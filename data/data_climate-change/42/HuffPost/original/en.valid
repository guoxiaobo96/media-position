when it comes to making decisions, i wouldn't exactly say i'm good at it. indecisive is definitely a word i would use to describe myself.\n\ni'm always worried i'm going to make the wrong decision and that the decision i do make will have catastrophic repercussions. perhaps my anxiety disorder plays a part with this, as i'm someone who will always play out the worst case scenario in my head, no matter the circumstance.\n\nthe decision around having another child is something that plays on my mind a lot. 6 months ago i was resolute in my decision i didn't want to add to my family. an opinion that was shared by my other half, in fact he was probably even stauncher with this attitude than i was.\n\nwe considered permanent methods of contraception and discussed the best course of action for us. 9 months ago i was even contemplating sterilization. that's how confident i was that another child wouldn't be on the agenda.\n\nmore recently the subject of a vasectomy was mooted. research informed me it would perhaps be the less invasive route to undertake and my partner was more than happy to take one for the team as it were.\n\nwe agreed that after christmas we'd head to our gp and get the ball rolling so to speak.\n\nnew year soon rolls around and i've found myself doing a 360.\n\ni'm only 30, i was 27 when i had my son. i've made no secret of the fact becoming a parent was the biggest challenge i've ever known, especially the first year. a diagnosis of post natal depression and anxiety followed a very tough year both emotionally and mentally. things were so difficult the very mention of another child brought a raft of emotions i couldn't handle.\n\nto add complications to the matter i am a carrier of a genetic condition called haemophilia. my maternal grandfather was a sufferer, my mum a carrier and i discovered aged 19 that i too was a carrier.\n\nit was something that didn't really have a huge effect on my life until i fell pregnant at 26. i'd long known about the haemophilia since childhood as my grandfather was in and out of hospital, always having blood transfusions and complications.\n\ni felt well researched when i found out i was pregnant, of course the haemophilia was a concern, knowing that if i was carrying a boy there was a 50/50 chance he would inherit haemophilia, but i tried not to let it overshadow my pregnancy too much.\n\nwhen i gave birth to my son in 2013, he was taken for testing when he was only hours old. the following day the results came back, he didn't suffer from haemophilia. the relief was palpable. seeing him in his cot next to my bed in hospital with a huge bandage on his little hand, following his blood test, reminded me just how lucky we'd been.\n\ni've previously written about being an only child. it never bothered me. i never knew any different. my mum had me at 32, my dad was 42. age played a part in her decision to have no more children, however, the overriding reason was the haemophilia. she felt she had 'dodged a bullet' having a girl (back then it was believed only males could suffer from haemophilia) and didn't want to push her luck any further. in actual fact, we have since discovered that females too can suffer from haemophilia, however, it is very rare for this to occur.\n\nso, taking the haemophilia and the depression and anxiety into account, this goes some way to explain why we decided to stick with just the one child.\n\nuntil recently.\n\njust before christmas one of my best friends had a beautiful baby girl. this shifted something for me. it unearthed a feeling of broodiness i hadn't experienced for a few years.\n\ni began to have very vivid dreams of having another baby. these dreams would play on my mind for days after.\n\nthen yesterday i was in a coffee shop with my mum, grandmother and son. there was the cutest 16 month old little girl in there, she was such a happy little thing. completely taken by my son, who being the attention seeker he is, did his utmost to make her laugh. watching him interact with her made my heart swell a little bit.\n\ni turned to my mum and said, i think i want another baby.\n\nshe did an eye roll. she's totally used to my 'hair brain ideas' as she would probably refer to them and knows how often i change my mind on things. but she indulged me and we struck up a conversation.\n\ni think you're forgetting about the haemophilia she said. and i had.\n\ni thought wes was getting a vasectomy? she said. and he was.\n\nhowever, all of a sudden something was telling me that a permanent contraception method felt too extreme. the thought of never experiencing having another baby made me feel a little sad.\n\ni've often said i felt like i missed out a little on my son's first year, i didn't enjoy it as i was consumed with anxiety which ultimately led to depression. that saddens me deeply and as selfish as it may sound, i want to experience it again. i want the chance to properly enjoy it.\n\nit played on my mind for the rest of the day, so much so when i got home that night i decided to broach the subject with my partner. he admitted, as he had before, that it's the haemophilia that deters him from wanting to expand our family. we were very lucky having a baby boy who didn't have the condition, would luck strike twice?\n\nwe had a discussion and have come to the conclusion that any talk of vasectomies and sterilization is very much on the backburner. we're going to revisit the situation in a year or two and have 'the conversation' then. in the meantime, i'd be keen for us to go down the genetic counseling route. i've had an element of genetic counseling before and feel it would be beneficial for us both to try this method prior to making any definitive decisions regarding adding to our family.\n\ni don't want to reach 40 and regret not having another baby. i hate what if's and maybe's, life is too short for that.
how can couples avoid the pitfalls that prevent the success of a second marriage? the key ingredients to a successful remarriage are selecting a partner who is a good match for you and both partners willingness to work through the inevitable hard times of marriage. with courage and persistence, you can defy the statistics that say your second marriage is doomed to fail and enjoy long-lasting love.\n\nit's normal to feel disillusioned about marriage if you've endured a divorce and gone through emotional pain and perhaps some financial loss. then there's the available census data telling us that second marriages have a 65% divorce rate compared to 50% for first time marriages.\n\nbut in spite of these facts, you might decide that you're up for the challenge that comes with a second marriage. however, it's key to pause and examine what went wrong in your first marriage – and create a vision for a successful second one.\n\njanette put it like this i've learned that marriage is a work in progress and that you get out of it what you put in. i feel very connected with my husband and we're working hard at keeping that connection.\n\njanette and todd have been remarried for seventeen years and each have two children (now grown) from their first marriages. it wasn't always easy to blend their four children and they dealt with rivalries between their children. todd's daughter never really warmed up to janette and rarely visits them.\n\ntruth be told, working as a team and creating a second marriage built on a foundation of tolerance, respect, and dedication to each other are essential to a lifetime of love. todd says we are a team and work together for the happiness of the entire family. we have mutual respect for each other and we know that we will be there for each other through all of the ups and downs.\n\ncreate a new vision for your remarriage\n\ncreating a positive vision for remarriage is an important first step to making your second marriage a success. everyone has baggage that can cause them to sabotage a new relationship if they haven't healed and worked through the issues that contributed to the demise of their first marriage.\n\nadd to that baggage from your first marriage is the realization that there are often a lot more players in a second marriage, such as kids from former spouses, stepkids and sometimes even new kids from this union.\n\ntaking your time to decide the kind of marriage that would work for you can be a silver lining to divorce because you'll be more likely to go into your second marriage with realistic expectations. and the fact of the matter is that you can create a happy second marriage if you give yourself permission to be vulnerable and take risks.\n\n10 reasons second marriages are better:\n\nyou have a clearer vision about what you want from a relationship. divorce has taught you what relationship dynamic promotes your best self. a second marriage is an opportunity to approach commitment with your eyes wide open.\n\nyou are making a decision based on strength and choice rather than fear of being alone. for instance, you may have felt a nagging doubt about tying the knot with your ex-spouse, but proceeded anyway due to feelings of obligation or fear of being alone.\n\nyou've learned to take responsibility for your part in the conflict or dispute. one person's ability to do this can change the dynamic of the relationship. drs. julie and john gottman write: one person's response will literally change the brain waves of the other person. apologize to your partner when appropriate. this will validate their feelings and promote forgiveness and allow you both to move on. love is not enough. saying you're sorry can heal a wound even when you didn't hurt your partner's feelings intentionally. resentment builds over time if couples aren't able to talk about hurt feelings that arise from unresolved grievances.\n\nyou are smarter about love. since you've learned from the past, you're less likely to repeat it. and you've learned to separate the past from the present and have begun to live in the present. therapy and/or keeping a journal can help you achieve these objectives.\n\nyou can allow yourself to take risks and be vulnerable with your partner. healthy relationships don't come without risk – so you freely extend to trust to your partner by expressing your thoughts, feelings, and wishes. since you no longer have to walk on eggshells, you feel more relaxed on a daily basis.\n\nyou've learned the value of having realistic expectations about a spouse. your partner is not going to change. in other words, you can't change a cat into a dog. love just isn't enough to significantly alter a person's basic nature and upbringing. for instance, if you fall in love with someone who is reserved and you need outward signs of affection to feel secure, you'll feel chronically dissatisfied. most likely, these differences will probably erode loving feelings over time and diminish positive interactions in your relationship.\n\nrather than trying to fix' your partner, you focus on improving your own life. many individuals focus on changing their partner and avoid dealing with their own issues. rather than investing your energy into fixing your partner, you've made a commitment to improve some of your undesirable traits – since we're all flawed in some way.\n\nyou've learned to communicate honestly about key issues in your relationship. sweeping things under the rug usually doesn't reap good results. in your second marriage, you make sure to be forthcoming about your concerns and express thoughts, feelings, and wishes in a respectful way. challenging your beliefs and self-defeating thoughts help you to let go of hurt feelings. when we listen to our partner's side of the story and process it briefly with them, we no longer need to hold onto hurt feelings.\n\nyou practice forgiveness on a daily basis. as a result, you apologize to your partner when appropriate and accept his or her apologies. this validates their feelings and promotes good will. forgiveness is not the same as condoning the hurt done to you but it will allow you to move on.\n\nyou're confident about your choice in a partner and your desire for a life partner comes from a place of strength rather than neediness. you've discovered that marriage will never be your sole source of happiness so you pursue your dreams to the best of your ability. however, you're dedicated to your partner and have an optimistic long-term view of your marriage.\n\nthe best way to beat the odds and see your remarriage succeed is to risk being vulnerable with your partner and create a positive vision for your second marriage. determination, respect, acceptance, and tolerance will greatly improve your chances of success in a second marriage.
it is a curious thing, the death of a loved one. we all know that our time in this world is limited, and that eventually all of us will end up underneath some sheet, never to wake up. and yet it is always a surprise when it happens to someone we know. -lemony snicket, horseradish: bitter truths you can't avoid\n\na few weeks ago, my mother's maternal aunt---my 98 year-old great-aunt sara---came down with pneumonia, became disoriented, and was admitted to the hospital. and i saw what dying looks like.\n\nwhen i walked into the hospital room the first time, aunt sara--frail and bone-thin--was moaning in pain while her children and grandkids sat all around her and tried to make her comfortable. and i was immediately struck by how both ugly and intimate death seemed to be. her sallow face and bony chest and missing teeth. different hands taking turns holding onto her. the shrill, bird-like noises that came out of her as she asked repeatedly for something to drink, only to push it away whenever anyone brought one to her mouth. the not quite knowing what she wanted--thinking something would help only to realize that it didn't.\n\nthat disorientation that life is full of, death is full of too.\n\ngrowing up, whenever my sisters or i would have an overly dramatic reaction to something--a loud gasp or high-octane oh my god--we'd say to each other: whoa, you just aunt sara-ed that one. of course, my sisters and i were just engaging in adolescent drama--- spilled milk and all. but for aunt sara, those audible reactions---sometimes heart-attack-level sounds for skinned-knee situations---came from a primal place of genuine concern. she just loved everyone around her too damn much, and didn't like to hear about bad things happening to them. and so, in my family, aunt sara became a verb.\n\n***\n\ni'm smart enough to know that i don't have anything original to say about death. it just is, waiting for every one of us. and seeing aunt sara's whole life crowded into that small, hospital room with blank walls and padded chairs and lcd screens displaying all the information her body was giving away--i didn't know what to think. i wanted it to have this immediate, revelatory effect on me. wanted it to teach me something profound about life. but the truth is, i walked away from all of it with, as tim o'brien said in if i die in a combat zone, just a few simple, unprofound scraps of truth: life is short. family is important. seize the day. nothing is permanent.\n\ni often forget how impermanent it all is. well, not so much forget as much as allow all the things in my life to crowd out that knowledge: deciding whether or not to keep the kick-ass pair of winter boots that i just spent too much money on. my machinations to get to someplace warm next month for a few days. ideas about decorating my study. questions about when i'm due for my next oil change and how long it's been since i published a blog post, and has my boyfriend remembered to exchange that velvet blazer i got him for christmas.\n\nall kinds of noises, some more stupid than others.\n\nand it occurs to me, especially at this time of year when we're all so busy making enormous resolutions to be better and thinner and healthier, that the hardest part of things is often the middle--when you're right in the thick of it and it's so easy to get lost.\n\ni'm sitting here in my living room in the middle of january--when mild temperatures have long since disappeared, and they are nowhere on the horizon. i'm 35, which is on its way to being some kind of midpoint. i've been writing a book for two and a half years now, and, though approaching the skeleton of a rough draft, i'm still many many cycles of revisions and rewrites away from a finished product. i'm a few years into the best relationship i've ever had. i'm in it, all of it--right in the middle of this big, messy, brilliant, baffling, surprising life of mine. and that's a hard place to be, i think.\n\nit's a place where there are no enormous resolutions for me to make--where all there is to do is keep going. keep doing what i'm doing, keep showing up to my life. keep writing and editing and re-writing. keep caring about the kind of person i am and how i choose to treat other people. keep being honest and flawed and spoiled and selfish and scared--and keep trying to do it all with a little more grace than yesterday.\n\nhow do you keep pushing yourself when there's no big payoff right around the corner? when the end is (probably, hopefully) too far out to be either the carrot or the stick?\n\ni find it all quite difficult, especially right after seeing a life shrunken down to its bare essentials: a woman in the middle of a hospital room with all that florescent sadness and love and fear--just asking for a drink and a little comfort on the way out. it makes me want to change everything, right now: get closer to everyone so that my hospital room will be filled with people one day; finish my manuscript tomorrow, see the world, run for days, spoil my nieces and nephew. and while those are all admirable goals--and there's nothing wrong with reaching to be better--i think the real heroics are in the grit and muscle of the daily grind. i think trying to conquer the world all at once is naive and self-defeating.\n\ni think that if i want to honor aunt sara's memory, i just have to keep showing up, keep caring about people--and keep gasping wildly and dramatically with them when the need arises.
the streets are still coloured in many glassy lights, the parks are still filled with children with happy faces, and merry songs are still being played. no doubt,the festive season is slowly winding up and while businesses are enjoying some sort of break, some are on the clock monitoring, evaluating and strategizing new ways to rake in profit.\n\nmany have laid out plans for their new year. as 2017 slowly cruises into full gear, it is normal for individuals and brands to settle down and make preparations that are almost sure to guarantee that 2017 turns out a greater year than 2016 was.\n\nspeaking to an entrepreneur friend, it was clear that most businesses are employing some slightly new measures to improve customer experiences, services, or product delivery. perhaps some of their moves may be of use to your business.\n\n1. online security- interestingly, many businesses, especially the small and medium, ones hardly take this particular step seriously. nowadays, businesses are careful about their internet data safety thus encrypting it. some plan to anonymize their ip addresses using various tools to improve online privacy and check security. the aim at the end of the day is to improve internal work conditions for staff.\n\n2. workforce appreciation- businesses, no matter how small, are making plans to maximize the current workforce they have especially the millennials. truthfully, it's hard to have the perfect workforce, but with the right push, appreciation and communication, the most can be gotten from the current crop of workforce you wield.\n\n3. never walk alone- it'll surprise you the heights your business can reach when you collaborate. new frontiers don't have to be conquered on your own. sharing skills, knowledge and experience can add immense value to the structure of your business.\n\n4. outsource the others- we were taught the essence and benefits of division of labour. once it was said that if you want to go fast, work alone but if you want to go farther, walk in packs. businesses can always remain thought leaders in their sphere even if they outsource some services to other contractors.\n\n5. diversify your portfolio- in the spirit of streaming in profit, it is wise to diversify and invest in as many channels as possible. in 2017, look for avenues to make more wealth than your business is currently offering.\n\nmake the right moves for your business and let the rest of the year thank you for them.
if one thing from all of this is clear, we really need to beef up our election standards and improve the system across the board.\n\n—brent s\n\nit's just another waste of taxpayers money.\n\n—christian matter

president-elect joe biden has assembled what environmentalists are calling an all-star team to lead his government's efforts to curb climate change and reverse the trump administration's astoundingly pro-polluter legacy.\n\nrep. deb haaland (d-n.m.), one of the first two native american women elected to congress and a strong supporter of the green new deal movement, would replace a former oil lobbyist if the senate confirms her as head of the interior department. in place of the ex-coal lobbyist running the environmental protection agency would be michael regan, who brokered the biggest coal-ash cleanup settlement in u.s. history as north carolina's top environmental regulator. the energy department would swap a fossil fuel die-hard for jennifer granholm, michigan's former governor and attorney general and now a clean energy advocate.\n\nwith the senate likely to remain in republican hands this year, biden seems to be preparing to resurrect the obama administration's approach after democrats lost the house in the 2010 midterms: a combination of aggressive regulation, executive orders and close collaboration with states.\n\nto oversee the effort, biden picked gina mccarthy, barack obama's former epa chief and architect of the administration's regulatory suite, as his domestic climate czar, a position obama initially created in his first term to coordinate the federal government's energy and environmental strategy and work to get climate legislation passed in congress.\n\nbeyond their stark ideological contrasts to president donald trump's agency heads, biden's top-level nominees also appear to signal the new administration's plans to embed climate policies at the state level, cementing the clean-energy transition and making it harder for the next gop president to undo whatever progress his administration makes.\n\nthere's this very calculated, hard-nosed recognition among the choices that executive action is going to be the key to progress, and action at the state level is going to be the key to progress, said cara horowitz, a climate policy expert at ucla school of law.\n\nas the obama and trump presidencies prove, it could likely be a rocky road. absent new legislation, the white house must creatively interpret its legal mandate to enact rules under existing statutes, leaving them open to challenge. republican state attorneys general sued the obama administration so routinely that the top cop in texas joked: i go into the office in the morning. i sue barack obama, and then i go home. gop-led states persuaded the supreme court to block obama's signature power plant regulation in 2016, and that was before trump added three right-wing justices to the bench and stacked lower federal courts with conservatives. red states are already vowing to pursue that same strategy.\n\nbut biden and vice president-elect kamala harris have options. and they've made it clear they're all on the table.\n\nthe biden-harris administration intends to pull every lever available, not only through executive and legislative action, but partnering together with cities, states, and businesses to reverse course on the climate threat, advance environmental justice and a clean energy future, and create millions of good-paying union jobs, jamal brown, a biden transition spokesman, told huffpost in an email.\n\ncarolyn kaster/associated press president-elect joe biden announces his climate and energy team nominees and appointees at the queen theater in wilmington, delaware, dec. 19.\n\n'a weak tool'\n\nbiden kicked off his presidential run on the wrong side of a climate movement. young activists were leading the push for a more ambitious federal approach, against the backdrop of dire united nations projections on global warming. in may 2019, reuters reported that biden was carving out a middle ground climate policy that would likely face heavy resistance from green activists.\n\nunsurprisingly, climate activists and scientists revolted, with some dubbing him middle ground joe. the biden campaign dismissed the report, and biden himself defended his record as an early champion of climate action.\n\nas the election drew closer, biden made climate a central part of his bid for the white house, tempering fears among advocates and scientists that he'd take the same slow, moderate approach that obama had during his first term a decade earlier.\n\nobama picked ken salazar, an oil and gas ally, as his interior secretary, and balanced new federal support for renewable energy with boosts to fossil fuel drillers, promising an all of the above energy play. the approach relied on congress, both chambers of which democrats controlled when obama took office, to enact a new carbon pricing scheme that would gradually increase the cost of fossil fuels and incentivize a shift to solar, wind and energy efficiency. democrats' landmark cap-and-trade bill ― a conservative and incrementalist policy that aimed to set a cap on carbon emissions, then let companies trade pollution permits ― fizzled in 2010. going forward, the gop, seemingly hell-bent on obstructing anything obama proposed and financially encouraged by dark-money groups unleashed by the supreme court's 2010 citizens united ruling, adopted a full-fledged position of denying the reality of climate change itself.\n\nthe partisan divides that inhibited strong climate action during the obama years have only deepened under trump, a reality that horowitz hopes will be enough to deter the biden administration from futile attempts at reaching across the aisle to address climate change.\n\nwitnessing and seeing firsthand how deeply dysfunctional attempts at bipartisan action have been over the last four years have really taken the shine off any notion that there might be some grand 'kumbaya,' coming-together moment, and that the biden administration should waste any amount of time whatsoever at the beginning of their administration seeking such a moment, she said.\n\nbiden will be forced to navigate a similar legislative playing field, except another decade into a rapidly worsening global crisis. unless democrats can somehow flip a pair of republican-held senate seats in the georgia runoff election on jan. 5, the gop will maintain control of the senate while democrats hold a slim majority in the house.\n\nthere is some possibility of compromise on issues such as nuclear power, carbon capture technology and research funding for renewables, all things included in the bipartisan spending bill passed last month. but a legal mandate to rapidly phase out fossil fuels and intervene radically in the economy is difficult to envision, given the makeup of the 117th congress.\n\nalex edelman via getty images defeating the threat of global climate change is the fight of our lifetimes, gina mccarthy said after being introduced as biden's nominee to be his national climate adviser.\n\nbiden isn't ruling out a legislative pathway. in the $1.7 trillion climate plan he released in 2019, which set a goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, biden said he will demand that congress enacts legislation in the first year of his presidency to establish a system for achieving that 2050 target. he said he will call on congress to make huge investments in energy and climate research and incentivize a rapid shift toward clean energy technologies.\n\nin his plan, biden also vowed to use the full authority of the executive branch, beginning his first day in office, to combat global warming, including orders to limit methane pollution from fossil fuel operations, protect the arctic national wildlife refuge from oil and gas drilling and conserve 30% of america's lands and waters by 2030.\n\nbut whether he's able to forge a climate legacy that endures beyond his time in office may very well hinge on leveraging states and cities to take aggressive action.\n\nthe lesson of the trump years is that executive order is a weak tool, said amy myers jaffe, managing director of the climate policy lab at tufts university. the biden team absolutely needs to see how they can support states ― from new england wind to stricter methane rules mirroring colorado to california's clean freight and [electric vehicle] policies.\n\nmyers jaffe supports a federalist model for addressing climate change, one to organize state voluntary efforts into a federally led initiative that would build a national policy without letting one or two states dictate through the courts, she said.\n\nnotably, several members of biden's environmental team have state government experience.\n\nthat's where i think the list really shines, horowitz said. he's packed this list with people who know how state progress is made.\n\nwhat he can do without congress\n\nexperts say there are numerous ways for the incoming biden administration to empower states and shore up its own gains even if a republican unseats him in 2024.\n\nbiden's administration could condition federal funding for state plans to build electric vehicle infrastructure and clean energy, or pay states to prepare climate action plans and stipulate that they be subject to federal enforcement or forced to return the money if they don't meet those goals. such a program would need to be voluntary, and could be expanded to include funding for states that agree to conserve additional land under their control, but it's a possibility, said michael gerrard, director of columbia law school's sabin center for climate change law.\n\nit's challenging to achieve permanence without legislation, gerrard said. but conditions on voluntarily received financial assistance are one method.\n\nthe administration could also consider providing new resources for states to mitigate the effects of wildfires and other climate-related disasters, or give states the flexibility to figure out how to meet new federal pollution-reduction goals, horowitz noted.\n\ngiving states the power and funding to make progress helps to insulate progress from the seesaw of future federal policy priorities ― not perfectly, but at least somewhat, she said.\n\ndavid hayes, executive director of new york university school of law's state energy & environmental impact center and a former deputy interior secretary under obama, declined to comment specifically on the incoming biden administration, but stressed the importance of federal-state collaboration.\n\nthe trump administration pursued its energy, climate and environmental deregulatory agenda with little regard for states' rights and interests, he said, citing, among other things, the administration's decision to revoke california's ability to set its own stronger fuel economy standards. this approach does not produce durable policy. as we've seen, many of the trump administration's rollbacks and replacement rules have been struck down in the courts, and many more will meet the same fate.\n\nin his lengthy climate plan, biden slammed the trump administration for abdicating america's leadership on climate, and applauded state and local leaders for their efforts to slash planet-warming emissions, invest in renewable energy and build climate-resilient infrastructure. since trump announced in june 2017 that he would pull the u.s. out of the landmark paris climate

lonely george, a beloved hawaiian tree snail that was the last known member of its entire species, died at the age of 14, state wildlife officials said.\n\nthe brown and white snail was the sole survivor of the achatinella apexfulva species, a type of invertebrate that once flourished across the tropical islands and was known as the jewels of the forest, according to hawaii's snail extinction prevention program.\n\nhawaii's department of land and natural resources highlighted the snail as an ambassador for the plight of the hawaiian land snails in an obituary confirming its new year's day death.\n\nhe was featured in many newspaper, magazine and online articles, and hundreds of school children and visitors to the lab eagerly viewed him, the last of his kind, the department wrote last week.\n\nscientists and environmentalists have fought the destruction of the tree snails' habitat and the increase of invasive predators, both of which are blamed for the snails' death.\n\nin 2012, lonely george was taken to the university of hawaii among 10 of the last known achatinella apexfulva snails. there, the snail outlived all of its gastropod companions, leaving it unable to mate with another snail of its kind, according to the hawaii department of land and natural resources.\n\ngeorge matured in a cage by himself, and although we called him a 'he,' the snail was a hermaphrodite, having both male and female parts, the department wrote. unfortunately, achatinella apexfulva seem to have been an obligate outcrossing species, meaning that it needed a partner to reproduce.\n\nlonely george was named after lonesome george, the famous pinta island tortoise who was the last of his species before his death in the galapagos islands in 2012.\n\nhawaii dlnr lonely george, the last known tree snail of its species, has died in hawaii, wildlife officials announced.\n\nin 2017, scientists collected a two-millimeter snippet of george's foot and sent it to san diego's frozen zoo, where the living tissue sample remains frozen. this preservation offers the chance that in the future, the snail could be cloned and allowed to live again, if technology allows.\n\nthe snail extinction prevention program, which is part of hawaii's forestry and wildlife division, is working to protect the islands' tree snails from meeting a fate similar to lonely george's.\n\nthe islands once boasted more than 750 species of terrestrial snails, but more than 90 percent of the diversity has since been lost, according to the program's website.\n\nuniversity of hawaii professor emeritus michael hadfield, who ran a conservation lab for snails of the achatinella genus, told cnn that despite scientists' efforts, the future of lonely george's genus also looks bleak.\n\nthere's no doubt that only 10 or so of those (species) still exist, and none of them will survive in the next 10 years, hadfield said. the extinctions have just been horrendous.\n\nthe hawaii department of land and natural resources similarly cautioned that lonely george's death is likely just the beginning.\n\nsadly, his passing is also a harbinger of what's to come for our remaining kāhuli (tree snails) if more is not done quickly to protect them from invasive species and climate change, the department wrote. many of the island's remaining land snails are facing imminent extinction.
it's the love/hate relationship for the ages - marketing and sales. marketing needs sales to clearly explain what they need to draw in customers and sales needs marketing to help fill the pipeline with prospects. let's face it, sometimes things get ugly in the process - in the tech industry, it's so critical for marketing and sales to operate seamlessly.\n\nallan thompson, chief operating officer at nsfocus, a global provider of intelligent hybrid security solutions, has seen the marketing/sales relationship from all sides. nsfocus is a cybersecurity company that focuses on network security - a hot space, with a lot of heavyweight competition. the company was founded in 2000, in china - and allan's job is to lead global expansion. although he's currently coo, allan's background is in sales, business development and marketing - basically he's seen it all, and has some great advice on marketing/sales alignment and what it takes to build a strong team.\n\n\n\nwhat is your background and current role at nsfocus?\n\ni am chief operating officer with the charter to expand nsfocus to all parts of the world outside china. i have been in the cybersecurity market for 20 years now, building leading companies like trend micro, intruvert networks (acquired by mcafee), reconnex (acquired by mcafee), redseal and now nsfocus. my knowledge and expertise is in marketing to the enterprise, service provider and federal markets via global channel and direct sales. i have spent most of my career in executive roles leading global marketing, sales and business development - that experience gave me the background that i need to run nsfocus ib.\n\nwhat's your proudest 'marketing moment' at nsfocus?\n\nthe company had been in the global market place for 9 years with nominal success and awareness. i knew that in order to be competitive it was critical to reinvent our messaging - to really communicate our breadth of services and value in a competitive market. i'm most proud of creating our unique intelligent hybrid security positioning. we've backed up our new messaging with customer success stories and data that supports our leadership in the market - and it's really helped to support and drive global sales.\n\nas a member of the c-suite, when it comes to marketing and communication activities - what does success mean to you?\n\nsuccess is measured in short term and long term impact to the global pipeline - it means driving a global pr message so that prospects and partners can very clearly understand our value and advantages over the 1000+ security vendors that are currently in market.\n\nwhat types of metrics are most valuable to demonstrating impact to execs?\n\nwe track increases in volume of hits to our website and how many documents are downloaded per month. we also track the increase of subscribers to our webinar series program, attendance at global events, monthly pr achievements - but most importantly we look for a 25% contribution to the global pipeline on a monthly basis.\n\nin your opinion, what are the 3 biggest challenges that marketers face in the cybersecurity space?\n\n1. the competition: it's so important that prospects understand how your solutions solve their specific problems - and how your technology is valuable and different from other vendors.\n\n2. sales messaging: global channel partners and the sales team must be able to communicate value in its simplest form to ensure that prospects understand, why nsfocus?.\n\n3. marketing and public relations: you need to make sure that your technology is seen in multiple press and pr settings to build reputation and awareness, so that prospects and decision making teams are clear on the company's market position and solution set.\n\nin the tech industry - what does sales need from marketing?\n\nsales needs simple and effective sales tools and programs to convey value. all prospects review hundreds of data sheets, presentations, white papers, channel hot sheets etc. what they want is simple and clear materials - so they can quickly understand the value of your solutions. the more complicated they are the less likely the vendor will be selected. marketing materials should be professionally designed - but they also must effectively convey who you are, why you are different and the 3 key value propositions of your solution set.\n\nhow can marketing/sales alignment be improved?\n\nit's the job of marketing and sales to work together to create consistent and clear messaging - at a global scale. it is critical that a brand's value and solutions can be easily conveyed, internally and externally. if a prospect on the it decision making team can't explain what the security vendor does and why - then you are unlikely to be selected or remembered.\n\nwhat are the qualities of a strong marketing department?\n\nmarketers must be great listeners; they must adhere to the advice from analysts, press, pr agencies, prospects, customers, sales people, product management etc. great teams understand how to listen, and then return the message worldwide so all parties understand the company and its solutions. if a company's value is understood by all relevant audiences, then the marketing team is doing a great job.\n\nwhat are the most important traits that you look for when you're hiring marketing and comms professionals, internally and externally (e.g. agencies)?\n\npassion, creativity, the ability to listen to all parties, flexibility to alter or change effectively to ensure the message stays crisp and fresh and alignment with business and sales objectives.\n\nwhat's on the horizon for nsfocus?\n\nnsfocus will be launching global case studies on the value of deploying our intelligent hybrid security solutions and our global threat intelligence platform, which includes the first and only view of attacks to and from china representing 40% of global attacks. we'll also be making some key announcements prior to rsa 2017 in san francisco, ca.\n\ndisclosure: nsfocus is an affect client.
kevin hart made another attempt to apologize to the lgbtq community on monday after several previous efforts to distance himself from past homophobic comments he made.\n\nduring a monday afternoon episode of siriusxm's straight from the hart, the comedian said he apologized for remarks that hurt members of the lgbtq community that came to light in december after he was selected to host the 2019 academy awards.\n\nwe thought it was ok to talk like that, because that's how we talked to one another, hart said of comments he made as recently as 2011, abc reported. this is wrong now. because now we're in a space where i'm around people of the lgbtq community, and i'm now aware of how these words make them feel, and why they say 'that s**t hurt because of what i've been through.'\n\nhart also said he was on the side of equality but that it's important for people to have their own personal beliefs.\n\nin the fight for equality, that means that there has to be an acceptance for change, he said.\n\nthe comedian continued: if you don't want to accept people for their change, then where are you trying to get to the equal part? where does the equality part come in? i don't think it's wrong for people to have their own personal beliefs. i think that in the times that we're living in, we have to be understanding and accepting of people and change. bottom line.\n\nhart's comments come just days after he appeared on the ellen degeneres show and received a strong endorsement from the talk show host.\n\ndegeneres said that as a gay person, she had been sensitive to the comedian's homophobic remarks but believed he had grown.\n\nhart stepped down as the academy award's host just two days after being awarded the gig, following scrutiny over past tweets and comments he made that used homophobic language. after some delay, the comedian eventually tweeted an apologetic explanation.\n\nmany found his apologies lacking, but degeneres said she accepted hart's remorse wholesale and revealed she had called the academy of motion picture arts and sciences asking for the comedian to be given back the hosting gig.\n\ncnn anchor don lemon, who is gay, later urged hart to focus on being an ally instead of trying to wipe the slate clean with an apology.\n\napologizing and moving on does not make the world a better place for people who are gay or people who are transgender, lemon said. being an ally does.
i can remember it like it was yesterday. it was a hot, thursday night and i was catching up on tmz, one of my favorite shows. i had class in the morning and knew i should have been getting ready for bed when the next segment caught my eye. the story was about maya henry, a girl younger than me from texas, who just had a $6 million dollar quincenera (a traditional mexican coming-of-age party for girls, similar to bat mitzvahs). hundreds of people showed up to the venue, which was custom built just for her party. there were cherry trees taller than anything i've ever seen before, floral decorations and arrangements everywhere, making the space look like a scene from the secret garden. the inside of the party was just as fabulous, with butterflies hanging from the ceiling, and more floral arrangements cascading the space like arches. she also got the chance to wear not one, but two beautiful gowns, which contributed to almost half a million dollars. both dresses exemplified elegance and grace, and honestly, it felt like something straight out of a princess fairytale from the 21st century. i was so fascinated by this girl and her life, and before i knew it, i had drifted into slumber, the voices in the background still telling maya's story.\n\nthe next thing i knew; i was at the cfda fashion awards in new york. i don't remember how i got here, or how i was invited but i'm with maya henry! she's wearing an absolutely gorgeous etro dress with floral print cascading all the way down to her ankles. her shoes are gorgeous, and everyone is gorgeous. we talk, and that's when i realize that me and maya are bffs! we make our way around the star-studded event, having casual conversations with anna wintour, heidi klum and laverne cox. i hear maya talk about her work with the hillary campaign, and the #teensforhillary she started to raise awareness about the presidential campaign, and her passion for philanthropic work with children. it was all so surreal, and while i felt like a true fish out of water, it was comforting to know i was with one of my best friends. i remember fast-forwarding a bit to our own little shopping trip. we were in los angeles, looking for dresses to wear to george clooney's dinner party later that night. we spent hours laughing and hanging out; it was a normal weekend being maya henry's friend. it was... it was a dream! it was all a dream, and i woke up to the sound of my alarm irritatingly reminding me that i had class in a bit.\n\nas i was getting myself together, disappointed that none of it would ever be my reality, i got a phone call from a texas number. could it be? omg! it was maya henry herself, calling me! i knew i had to tell her everything, so i told her about my dream, about our jet-setting adventures and low key fabulous weekends in california. i also knew i had to ask her about current events since we just finished a major election, so i figured i'd pick her brain a bit on everything going on\n\njazz girard: 2016 was such an amazing year for you; how do you plan on keeping that momentum in 2017?\n\n\n\nmaya henry: 2016 was an amazing year for me! i never expected my life to change so drastically in just one year. i have been given so many opportunities and i'm so excited for what the new year has to offer. i have a lot of projects i'm working on that include acting and modeling. i have been taking acting classes and going on auditions. i i will continue with acting because it is something i am very passionate about. i will also continue to develop my modeling careers not only as a model but as a role model to all young teens. my biggest project for 2017 will be my philanthropy work.\n\njg: how do you feel about our president-elect, both as a millennial and as a latina with strong mexican heritage? what do you think that this means for the united states moving forward?\n\n\n\nmh: it is clear that a majority of our country supported a woman for president. even though our electoral college doesn't not allow for the majority to win, people did voice their opinion and were willing to have a female president. i am happy that people were able to demonstrate that a woman can truly have the most powerful position in the world. i have friends and family that have supported both sides and i believe we all need to do what we can to make our country the best it can be. if our current president can't make our country better than it already is, then when i am of voting age i will be able to have a true voice for change through my vote! as a young latina woman, i encourage everyone to fight for our rights. i think that no matter our religion, race, gender, or sexuality--we all have equal rights!\n\njg: how do you plan on using your philanthropic passion and political motivation to help people of your generation and beyond?\n\n\n\nmh: as a young teenage woman, i understand what a great opportunity i have to help young people in my generation that do not have the same opportunities as i. i have had the fortune of meeting some amazing people that have the same goals as i do, and who can assist me in working together to ensure that we help other young people in need, as well as encouraging young people to stay educated and involved.\n\nmaya's rise to internet popularity through her epic quincenera party has no match on her future potential as a rising star, philanthropic leader, and political correspondent. be sure to look out for her in years to come!\n\nbe sure to follow maya henry on instagram to keep up with her!
community equals immunity. something good happens to your primordial grid when you're spending time with like-minded folks. knowledge is shared. inspiration is gifted. new seeds are planted.\n\ni attended my first hay house i can do it conference in nyc a few weeks ago and got to experience the resonance first-hand. the collagen of consciousness literally rebuilds our bodies. an idea grows stronger when it is shared, a course in miracles reminds us; may the nuggets below galvanize you to step into your highest self. happy new year!\n\nchange your thoughts, change your life\n\ndr. wayne dyer attended in spirit and his teaching rang truer than ever. my key take-away is his phrase, when you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change. that's all you need.\n\nhonor your inner artist\n\nlistening to and honoring our inner artist is close to cheryl richardson's heart. she takes singing lessons just for the pleasure of it because it's part of the expression of her soul. that's radical self-care. stand up for your gifts because the world needs artists and healers. and remember, cheryl says, when you ask the universe to support you, take action when it does. now go out and kick some ass.\n\ngoddesses never age\n\nla diosa northrup rocked the house with her trailblazing message that aging, commonly defined as a loss of life force, is optional. what a concept! it takes a supportive community to develop the collagen of courage to go beyond the pale. redefine what it means to be advanced in years; drop age (because it's a cage); and realize that you're in charge of creating your best life. more here and here and here. and remember: there is no death, and your job is to live while you're here. and to have flexible hamstrings.\n\nepigenetics galore\n\nthe inimitable dr. bruce lipton gave a fabulously engaging and enlightening talk on the power of epigenetics. our lifestyle choices determine which genes are turned on and off. simple as that. and who controls your lifestyle? that's right, you! the notion that you're a victim of your genes and predestined to a certain dis-ease because it runs in your family is old news. the reason certain issues are being displayed by several generations is because they're sharing the same lifestyle (i.e., junk food, smoking, lack of exercise, negative thoughts). as dr. bruce says, you are the master of your genes. and lifestyle comes down to energy. you are a tuning fork. your thoughts are energy vibration. what energy are you sending out? you feng shui yourself.\n\njoy\n\nleave it to gabby bernstein to fuse spiritual principles with supreme practicality. sharing stories from her own life on the power of forgiveness, she reinforced on stage what we know in our hearts: lean towards joy and you will be led. joy is freedom. joy is the movement. joy is the creator. yes, there's a time for anger, sadness, and grief. that's human, natural, and necessary. but thriving happens elsewhere. it's where we're committed to love, open to the beauty of the world, and enthused with the light of life. en-theos translates into god within, and that's where the magic happens. our greatest power is our capacity to tune in to the cosmos. amen.\n\nwake up\n\ndr. barbara de angelis closed out the event with a powerful talk on how to truly transform. transformation is shifting how you're vibrating, she says. you're a vibrational offering to the world. that's the gem right there. realize you're always vibrating, always giving off energies. in order to uplift yourself, your loved ones, and our beautiful planet, we need to raise our vibrations. love, peace, joy, kindness, compassion, and gratitude are high-vibe thoughts that translate directly into luminous life experiences. how're you choosing to vibrate today?
i met up with executive chef andrew roenbeck in the garden room of the italian restaurant lucca at the boca raton resort & club. gregarious and friendly, andrew is a strong presence at the resort, having worked there for 26 years, first starting out as executive sous chef for 14 years before taking over as the executive chef. he oversees 178 cooks, 65 stewards and 15 area chefs at the 13 restaurants located throughout the resort, club and clubhouse.\n\nandrew attributes his job tenure to the specialness of the resort. the longevity of the team here is abnormally long because it's such a dynamic place. there is flashy, newer competition out there, but they don't have what this resort has. our guests and members and convention attendees are well-traveled, understand quality very quickly, and their expectation is high. so our job is to make sure that, even though we are a historic property, we are staying ahead of what the current trends are but weighing that against being too flashy.\n\nhe doesn't have a typical day but his job goes beyond what the job title suggests. the reason why i can stay here as long as i have is because, truly, each week and each day there is something new. when you are dealing with that many associates, it's kind of like working at the united nations. if you name the nationality, personality or temperament, we have it. you have to be as much of a chef as you do a financial planner, a guidance counselor, even a pastor at times. it's amazing what comes across the chef's plate here and to keep all the moving parts moving is unique.\n\nandrew has had many mentors during his career to prepare him for this role, including steven hall who ultimately convinced him to come to the resort. his job is very detail oriented, and there is a lot of precision that goes into creating what he calls the boca twist. one example he gives is something he learned from mentor kelly vohs, who taught him that a restaurant has to have something called melt. it's music, entertainment, lighting, temperature. if one of those is off, you don't feel comfortable in the space and you won't want to go back to it, even if you don't know why. as an owner, you have to ask yourself if one of those things is off. so when we look at a restaurant, we want to make sure, before we open a restaurant, is the music and volume correct, is the temperature correct and does it need be adjusted throughout the night.\n\nandrew credits the resort with changing to keep up with the current times, yet keeping the strong traditions. he strongly believes in the individuality of each restaurant at the resort. every restaurant needs to swim in its own lane; there can't be crossover. i don't care if we have a number one selling dish - what you don't do is drop that dish into every menu at the resort. the menus change seasonally, four times a year, as do the drink menus. they source the food, whenever possible, using local farms for produce, including hydroponic farm swank specialty produce, and four local fisherman to bring in the fish daily, and seagrille offers a list of today's catch of fresh fish which changes on a daily basis. the resort also obtain a good portion of their kobe wagyu beef from nearby jackman ranch, located in florida, that raises its cattle free of hormones and antibiotics. regarding the unique drink menu, andrew comments that, eric hammer moved specifically into the director of beverage role a year and a half ago because we wanted to make sure that we were focusing on the current trendy drinks, and the creativity that comes with that.\n\nlunch options are equally important to andrew as they average 1500 lunches on the pool deck in three hours. he underscores that, even at lunch, presentation is key, with the chopped salads being served in two oversized martini shakers (one upside down on top of the other), and entrees being served in stackable beach-boxes that were custom-made for the resort.\n\ni ask andrew to name a signature dish at lucca. one item that has been on the menu since day one, and we cannot take it off the menu or we are probably going to have a riot at the door, is the scallops piccata. it has a caramelized spaghetti sauce with sage and capers and golden raisins, and our beautiful scallops go on top. any family recipes? 'my mother's potato salad  he says with a laugh, sharing that he often goes into the walk-in refrigerator to sample the daily prepared salad and make sure that it stays spot-on.\n\nin terms of the best part of his job, i love a good challenge. i love when we have events that are creative partners with us. when they are looking for the next, best great thing, and we can work within their budget to execute that in the event space or within the restaurants. you have to wear so many hats at a large property like this, you are constantly on the move. as kelly vohs would say, 'btty'. better today than yesterday.
as my mother and nana tell it, the first word i ever read was macy's. i was just shy of 2 and read it off of someone's shopping bag at a mall in new jersey, where we spent most winter saturdays in my childhood. my grandma on my dad's side operated a clothing store out of her home in brooklyn for years. my parents were set up by those two grandmothers after they kept bumping into each other at ― you guessed it ― the wholesale clothing store they both shopped in seasonally. one grandma was shopping for her store, the other was shopping (likely just as abundantly) for herself.\n\ni guess you could say that shopping, clothing, and collecting stuff is in my blood. in many ways, it's the glue that bonds the three women in my family together. the joy of shopping is something we, three people from three generations with different understandings of the world, can agree on. my mom taught me how to spot a good sale, my nana taught me how to dress. i've brought her to a fashion show, i've let her dress me in the name of journalism, but most importantly i've always associated the mere act of shopping as happy, soothing and positive.\n\nmy home, a decent yet still new york city-sized studio, is a reflection of the way i've been raised. when i walked into what's now my apartment for the first time, i put in an offer based on the closet alone: a holy walk-through with built-in storage installed by the previous owner. i already had a lot of stuff, and this was the first apartment i'd seen that seemed to both be within my budget and able to fit everything i'd acquired.\n\nthat was five years ago, when i had less credit card debt, about 100 percent fewer tote bags i never use, and considerably less closet-crowding than i have now. when i looked around at the closet that once felt like a dream and now reminded me more of a nightmare, i realized something needed to change.\n\nmarie kondo has been on my radar since 2014, when everyone and their mother started reading her bestselling book and figuring out if their possessions brought them joy. i tried to figure it out myself, years ago, and quickly found reasons that everything ― including socks with no mate (they'll come up in the next load of laundry!) brought me so-called joy in some way. i promptly abandoned the project of tidying up.\n\nfour years after her first book's release, kondo's new netflix show, tidying up with marie kondo, brings the magic of her tidying up principles to life ― pushing the agenda that clutter and mess lead to stress, and a minimalistic approach ultimately can lead to a more joyful and fulfilled life. research shows the link between mess and stress, as well as the health benefits of having a tidy home. a 2010 study found that women who had cluttered homes expressed higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol, than those who didn't, according to psychology today.\n\nthe netflix series follows kondo to various homes in various states of mess. she imparts her wisdom, folding principles and soothing demeanor on couples and families in hopes of bringing more joy to their lives. in one episode, a couple learns to appreciate each other without clutter getting in the way. in another, a pair of empty-nesters learn how to make their home theirs again.\n\nperhaps my rekindled urge to purge has to do not only with the show being a delight on the senses, but also a commitment i've recently made to make my apartment more of a place i want to spend time in. it seems obvious, but as a messy person with anxiety, it took the help of a therapist to realize how stressful coming home to a place in disarray truly is. (i know i've evolved because i asked for a vacuum cleaner for the holidays this year.)\n\nbut the cluttered closet, which became my first thought in the morning (i have to walk through it to get to the bathroom) and my last thought at night, had long weighed on me like the pile of dry cleaning stuffed into one of the shelves.\n\nwhen things stopped fitting on the hangers, i got creative (read: messier).\n\nbecause my first attempt at the kon-mari method didn't stick, i asked a friend to help me sift through the stress stuff ― something i highly recommend to anyone starting on this journey without the assistance of kondo herself. ideally, it will be someone who lives more minimally than you and who is not as attached to the coverup you wore at bonnaroo 2009 as you are.\n\nwe did not exactly seek joy out of each piece as we made our way through the closet. instead, we developed our own criteria, where my friend asked me of every item: does this make you feel good? do you feel sexy wearing this? many times, the answer was no. i felt pangs of guilt as i said no to dresses my grandmother had purchased for me, t-shirts my mother had brought me from various travels around the country (if you're reading this, sorry mom) and things i spent good money on that i thought i would love forever but in reality stopped wearing a long time ago.\n\nin the end, i axed about 70 percent of my wardrobe, shoes included. don't get me wrong. me saying i have no clothes is like your friend with hair down to her butt getting a trim and lamenting that she has no hair. however, i can claim one entirely empty dresser and several newly sparse shelves. i can see everything in my closet. there's a nice surplus of hangers that now sit on a top shelf just in case, and i uncovered a favorite bra i thought was lost and gone forever nestled safely at the top of the underwear drawer.\n\ncan you spot the dress that now has a home?\n\nmy first instinct after emptying the closet was, of course, to fill it again. what was i going to do with all that space? but the thought dissipated when i realized how calm and serene the less-crowded closet has made me. i find myself just standing in there sometimes ― like a less-anxious weirdo.\n\ntidying up didn't just give me more literal space, but something deeper. i have always used clothing and shopping as a distraction, a way to fill a void and feel self-sufficient. there's a part of me that feels like i filled up every nook and cranny to convince myself that only i could fit here ― that there was no space for another person, with all their literal and figurative stuff. now i'm starting to think i might be able to share.\n\nempty shelves -- never thought i'd see the likes of those.\n\nin 2019, i'll be spending more time in my tidy, sparse(r) apartment, and, in an effort to keep up this joyous momentum, have vowed to take a break from shopping and a commitment to buying only vintage when i do shop. not only is the stuff better, it's better on the wallet, and the environment. and that, well, brings me joy.\n\ni highly recommend the practice for you, too. just don't forget about that friend ― and maybe try to forget about bonnaroo.
time is up, she told e! correspondent giuliana rancic. we want diversity, we want intersectional gender parity [and] we want equal pay.\n\ni was so shocked to hear that e! doesn't believe in paying their female co-host the same as their male co-host, the will and grace star added. i miss catt sadler. so we stand with her. and that's something that can change tomorrow. we want people to start having this conversation that women are just as valuable as men.\n\nsadler announced her departure from e! news on her website late last month, explaining that she quit after discovering kennedy had been making nearly double her salary for years.
a sweeping reform bill that house democrats say will be their first priority after ending the partial government shutdown is filled with policies that would fundamentally alter the nation's voting and campaign finance systems. these policies are not coming out of nowhere. most of them have been implemented and tested in cities and states across the country.\n\nwithin the last five or six years, you just got more and more of these solutions happening at the state and local level, said rep. john sarbanes (d-md.), the bill's chief sponsor. it's not a unicorn. it's not like we're talking about something that exists in the atmosphere of jupiter. this is happening in america.\n\nsupreme court justice louis brandeis, in a famous dissenting opinion from 1932, asserted the freedom of a state or local government to serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country. this laboratories of democracy concept holds that state and local governments are the proper place to test policies before they move to the national stage.\n\nthat is exactly what has happened with the sweeping policies in democrats' h.r. 1, which they're calling the for the people act. the bill's campaign finance provisions on public election financing, dark money disclosure and democracy vouchers have all been field tested. the same is true of automatic voter registration, felon re-enfranchisement and the use of independent, nonpartisan redistricting commissions.\n\nsaul loeb via getty images house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) speaks alongside democratic lawmakers about h.r. 1, the for the people act, at the capitol in washington, d.c., on jan. 4.\n\nautomatic voter registration\n\nsince 2015, 15 states and the district of columbia have adopted automatic voter registration, a popular reform among advocates who believe it can significantly expand the number of people on the voting rolls in the united states.\n\nthe policy works slightly differently in each state, but the basic premise is the same: when someone interacts with the state motor vehicle or other agencies, they are automatically registered to vote unless they opt out. if they are already registered, their information gets updated if needed. federal law already requires state motor vehicle and some state agencies to offer people the opportunity to register to vote, and automatic voter registration essentially tweaks the process to make registering an opt-out choice instead of an opt-in.\n\noregon, considered the model for automatic voter registration, was the first state in the country to pass it in 2015. while it's still relatively early to assess the impact, the early evidence is encouraging. the policy went into effect in january 2016 and in a little over a year and a half, the policy added 375,000 people to the voter rolls. a 2017 analysis from the left-leaning center for american progress found over 116,000 people had been added to the rolls who wouldn't have otherwise registered.\n\nautomatic voter registration also went into effect in california last year, where it added 727,924 new voters to the rolls since its launch in april and updated the addresses of 269,365 people. (there were around 5.5 million eligible but unregistered voters in the state as of october.) the program also attracted scrutiny when it emerged the dmv made errors on thousands of voter registrations, including registering people who were ineligible to vote. the head of the dmv resigned and the agency imposed an additional level of review on the voter registrations it received.\n\nautomatic restoration of voting rights for people with felony convictions\n\nassociated press former felons desmond meade, president of the florida rights restoration coalition, left, and david ayala, husband of state attorney aramis ayala, celebrate with copies of their voter registration forms after voters approved an initiative restoring voting rights to ex-felons in november.\n\nforty-eight states don't allow people with felony convictions to vote while they are incarcerated, but states have widely different policies on when and how ex-felons can get back their right to vote. some states allow former felons to vote once they're released from prison, while others bar them while they're on probation or parole. the various policies can be extremely confusing and deter people from registering to vote, even if they're eligible.\n\nthe for the people act aims to fix this problem by automatically restoring voting rights once someone is released from prison. currently, 13 states and the district of columbia do this, but having a federal statute would help make the process easier for everyone involved.\n\ni think having a uniform rule that applies to everyone, everywhere and making that loud and having some action on it would be really helpful, said sean morales-doyle, counsel at the brennan center for justice, a new york-based nonprofit advocating for campaign finance reform and voting rights. having a uniform policy would clear up confusion among voters. it would also clear up confusion among elections officials. it would make keeping track of voter lists a lot easier.\n\ndark money disclosure\n\nthe supreme court's 2010 citizens united decision led to an explosion of undisclosed money spent by nonprofits, trade associations and corporate entities in elections. congress attempted to fix the court's collateral damage to transparency with the disclose act in 2010, but it fell one vote short of clearing a republican filibuster in the senate.\n\nstates have since stepped in to pass their own disclose acts or to issue regulations to stop dark money in state elections. varying disclosure rules to plug the holes created by the supreme court have been adopted in california, delaware, montana, new york, texas, vermont and washington. some of these laws provide more disclosure than others, and that can help congress determine the best option for federal elections.\n\ncalifornia's disclose act is great but limited, said former federal election commission chairwoman ann ravel, now with the pro-disclosure nonprofit maplight.\n\nthe california government has enacted two disclosure bills since the citizens united decision. the first was passed in 2014 to require any group spending more than $50,000 on elections to disclose its donors. the second, enacted in 2017, mostly focuses on requiring independent spenders to post disclaimers detailing their top three donors on their advertising and campaign materials. ravel believes that the $50,000 threshold for disclosure could be lower ― which is something the house democrats' bill does.\n\ndemocracy vouchers\n\nassociated press seattle city council member teresa mosqueda was the first person in the country to win an elected office by collecting democracy vouchers to fund her campaign.\n\na little-noticed provision in democrats' big reform bill would create a pilot program for democracy vouchers ― a proposal to provide every citizen with vouchers that can be used as small-dollar political donations. these vouchers would come in $25 increments, but could be used to give donations as low as $1.\n\nthe democracy vouchers idea was first proposed by constitutional law professor bruce ackerman decades ago, but had never been adopted until seattle voters backed a 2015 initiative to implement the idea. the program has already enabled a large number of people who would otherwise be incapable of affording political donations, including homeless people, to participate in the political process by contributing to candidates. one study found that 84 percent of people who used used their vouchers in the city's 2017 elections had not made a political contribution in at least the previous two election cycles.\n\nthe vouchers also provide an alternative fundraising system for candidates who lack the kind of connections to big-money donors that are often seen as necessary to run for office.\n\nin 2017, seattle city council candidate teresa mosqueda became the first person in the country to win their first election running with democracy vouchers. she had kept hearing that she should run for city council from participants in a program she ran for the afl-cio that encouraged women, people of color and working-class people to run for office. she was the kind of person she was trying to get to run: a latina in the labor movement who didn't come from money. but her background also presented an obstacle to funding a campaign ― until seattle's democracy vouchers became available.\n\nthe democracy vouchers program really took the pressure away from having to see yourself bankrolling a campaign or frankly having to dial for dollars for the majority of your time, mosqueda said.\n\ni was able to spend more time talking with people about what they wanted to see in government, she added.\n\nthe pilot program in the democrats' bill would be implemented in three randomly selected states to test how it works for congressional elections and whether it should be expanded to the whole country.\n\nearly voting and same-day registration\n\nthe for the people act would require states to allow people to register on the same day they vote and to allow voters to cast ballots for at least 15 consecutive days before election day. it would require poll sites to be open at least four hours each of those days and, to the greatest extent possible, that they be located near public transportation.\n\ntwenty states and the district of columbia have approved some form of same-day registration. it's seen as a reform that can greatly drive up voter participation rates because people start paying more attention to an election the closer it gets. federal law currently lets states cut off voter registration 30 days before an election. activists also embrace early voting because it gives people more time to go to the polls at their convenience.\n\nearly voting in particular has been at the center of many recent fights between republicans and democrats over voting laws. the conventional wisdom is that early voting benefits democrats, so republicans in several states have moved to limit its availability. but one 2017 paper published by four political scientists at the university of wisconsin-madison suggests that reality may be more complicated. the authors analyzed early voting in the 2004, 2008 and 2012 presidential elections and found that while election day registration tends to benefit democrats, early voting on its own is more likely to benefit republicans.\n\nthe type of voter who takes advantage of early voting ― older, whiter, and wealthier ― is already likely to vote, and more likely to vote republican, the authors wrote in a blog post last year. our findings confirm that early voting on its own has a negative and statistically significant effect on democratic vote share in all three presidential elections we analyzed. the availability of early voting in isolation raises the republican vote by about six percentage points.\n\nwhen same-day registration is combined with early voting, the paper found, voter turnout aligns more with the conventional wisdom.\n\nindependent redistricting commissions\n\nh.r. 1 would require states to create independent commissions that would be responsible for drawing congressional districts. state lawmakers currently have the power to draw districts once a decade, and both parties have manipulated that process to their advantage. in 2011, republicans saw an opportunity to take control of state legislatures, control the redistricting process and lock in an electoral advantage for the next decade. they executed that plan extremely precisely and well.\n\nsix states ― alaska, arizona, california, idaho, montana and washington ― use independent redistricting commissions to draw lines for state or congressional districts. (voters in michigan, utah and colorado passed ballot measures establishing independent commissions in the november election.) advocates say lawmakers have firm incentives to draw districts that favor their parties, and the independent commissions offer a firm check to make sure districts are fair.\n\nwhen lawmakers draw their own lines, they lose all of their philosophical ideals and they become ugly monsters. kathay feng, national redistricting director at common cause\n\nin 2011, california's independent redistricting commission drew electoral boundaries for the state for the first time. anyone can apply to serve on the 14-member commission ― which is made up of five democrats, five republicans and four people not affiliated with either party ― but there are strict requirements on who can serve. eligible applicants must be registered to vote in california and have voted in two of the last three elections. in the 10 years leading up to submitting their application, they also can't have run for office, worked for a lawmaker, political party or as a lobbyist, or donated $2,000 or more to a party or candidate. votes from multiple democrats, republicans and independents are required to approve a plan. h.r. 1 would impose similar safeguards on the independent commissions it creates to help ensure the districts are fair.\n\nwhen lawmakers draw their own lines, they lose all of their philosophical ideals and they become ugly monsters that are willing to cut out competitors, punish people from the other party and try to draw the most protective district for themselves so they don't have to face serious competition for the next 10 years, said kathay feng, national redistricting director at the good government group common cause, which championed the creation of california's commission.\n\nsmall-donor public financing\n\nthe for the people act's main campaign finance reform is the creation of a small-donor matching system to publicly finance congressional elections. it is based on the decades-old public financing program run for new york city elections.\n\nnew york adopted a small-donor matching system to publicly finance its elections in 1988 in response to a series of corruption scandals throughout city government. at the time, the system provided a 1-to-1 match for donations of $1,000 or less. a candidate received $1 in public funds for every $1 of a contribution up to $1,000. but the system has changed to boost the power of small donors over the years.\n\nproponents of new york city's matching fund system point to changes that greatly enhanced the role of small donors as the public match was increased and the contribution limit for matching funds was lowered. currently, the system provides an 8-to-1 match for contributions up to $175. that means a $175 contribution actually counts as a $1,575 contribution after the public funds are added in. democrats' for the people act uses a 6-to-1 match, a rate used by the new york city system from 2009 through 2018, for contributions up to $200.\n\nthe fact that it's been around for 30 years and it's still working, i think that's pretty remarkable, said lawrence norden, a lawyer for the brennan center for justice.\n\nnew york city's system has enabled candidates ― especially those from less affluent neighborhoods ― to more consistently rely on small donors in their districts. the city's public financing system gives candidates an incentive to reach out to a broader and more diverse array of constituents to fund their campaigns, a 2012 study by the brennan center and the progressive think tank demos found.\n\nthis small-donor matching system has also spread to other states, cities and municipalities. some matching funds programs have existed for years, but in the past five years, adoption has spread rapidly to washington, d.c.; montgomery and howard counties in maryland; and suffolk county, new york, among other places. new york state lawmakers are currently debating the statewide adoption of such a program.\n\nif new york city is any guide, it actually changes how candidates raise money, norden said. so, right now you have many candidates raising many more contributions than we've seen in the past raising from small donors. i think we would see even more of a change of going to constituents and small donors as a source of funding rather than the biggest donors.\n\ncorrection: a previous version of this story stated that teresa mosqueda was the first candidate in the country to run and win using democracy vouchers. she is the first first-time candidate to win.
danish siddiqui / reuters in 2013, india's supreme court reinstated a ban on gay sex after a four-year period of decriminalization.\n\nmumbai (thomson reuters foundation) - india's supreme court on monday agreed to reconsider its 2013 decision that criminalize consensual sexual relations between same sex adults, a victory for equal rights campaigners.\n\nthe court said a larger group of judges will re-examine the constitutional validity of section 377 - a colonial-era law that prohibits carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal - widely interpreted to refer to homosexual sex.\n\nwhat is natural to one may not be natural to others, the top court said on monday. a section of people or individuals who exercise their choice should never remain in a state of fear.\n\nlawyer anand grover, who appeared for five members of the lgbt community who had petitioned the court seeking a review of the ban, told the thomson reuters foundation: it is a big relief and a primary step taken by the supreme court to review its earlier order.\n\nthe petitioners had told the court they were living in constant fear of police action because of their sexual orientation.\n\nwe are being cautiously optimistic about the development today. we have climbed mountains of hope in the past and come toppling down, said gay rights activist harish iyer and host of gaydio, india's first radio show on lgbt issues.\n\nindia's supreme court had in a surprise ruling in 2013 reinstated a ban on gay sex after a four-year period of decriminalization that had helped bring homosexuality into the open in the socially conservative country.\n\nindia's lgbt community has argued the ban undermines fundamental rights as it fails to protect them. but earlier petitions to review the ban were overturned by the court.\n\nalthough the law banning homosexuality is rarely enforced in india, it is used to intimidate, harass, blackmail and extort money from gay people, activists say.\n\nthere are no official figures on the number of cases and most go unreported as victims are too scared to report crimes to the police, fearing they will be punished too, activists say.\n\ngay sex is punishable by up to 10 years jail under the law.\n\nwe want to emphasize that we are not asking for any special rights. we are asking for constitutional rights given to any citizen in the country, said koninika roy from the humsafar trust that works with the lgbt community.\n\nwriting by roli srivastava @rolionaroll; editing by ros russell. please credit thomson reuters foundation, the charitable arm of thomson reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience. visit news.trust.org
gofundme may reimburse more than $20 million to people who contributed to an iraq war veteran's fundraiser to build a southern border wall.\n\nthat's because its organizer, brian kolfage, has suddenly changed the direction of the money, planning now to send it to a nonprofit he created rather than the federal government.\n\nlast month, when his gofundme page was started, kolfage vowed that 100% of your donations will go to the trump wall.\n\nif for any reason we don't reach our goal we will refund your donation, he added.\n\nthose statements have since been removed from the page, where kolfage, a veteran living in florida, announced friday that he cannot get the money to the trump administration.\n\nthe federal government won't be able to accept our donations anytime soon, the update read.\n\nas a replacement, kolfage said, has decided to send the donations to we build the wall, inc., the nonprofit he has formed along with a board of advisers.\n\nour highly experienced team is highly confident that we can complete significant segments of the wall in less time, and for far less money, than the federal government, while meeting or exceeding all required regulatory, engineering, and environmental specifications, he wrote on his fundraising page.\n\nhowever, those who donated to his gofundme campaign must opt in to send their money to the nonprofit. if they don't, gofundme will return their contribution.\n\nkolfage has voiced outrage over news of the refunds, claiming at the top of his page, the media is falsely reporting all money is being refunded and it's over. they are wrong.\n\ngofundme spokesman bobby whithorne told the hill the refunds came about because kolfage broke the rules by switching the destination of the money.\n\nin his statement, whithorne pointed out the change in statements on the page, noting that kolfage promised to return all donors' money if his goal wasn't reached.\n\nhowever, that did not happen, he said. this means all donors will receive a refund.\n\nalthough kolfage attempted to assure donors the campaign wasn't a scam when it began, he previously ran into trouble online.\n\nin december, nbc news reported that kolfage's facebook page, right wing news, was taken down in a major sweep by the company as part of its initiative to rid the platform of pages run by fake accounts or those being used as ad farms using facebook to mislead people into thinking that they were forums for legitimate political debate.\n\non thursday, buzzfeed news revealed that kolfage allegedly has a history of making money by spreading false news. one of his ventures, the outlet said, included another gofundme page that raised thousands of dollars for mentorship of veterans in military hospitals, but spokespeople at the facilities reportedly had no record of his work there or any sign that he donated the money.
he added: look, it's a very bad situation. we haven't seen anything like it, but the end result is we've got to get back to work, and i think we can start by opening up certain parts of the country.\n\ni have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they're going to be, trump told fox news' sean hannity on thursday night. i don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators. you know, you go into major hospitals sometimes, they'll have two ventilators. and now all of a sudden they're saying can we order 30,000 ventilators?\n\npresident donald trump rejected calls from new york's governor that the state needed tens of thousands of new ventilators to treat a mass of patients infected with the novel coronavirus, saying he didn't believe those numbers were accurate.\n\ntrump on new york's ventilator needs for the coronavirus outbreak: i don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators. you know, you go into major hospitals sometimes, they'll have two ventilators. and now all of a sudden they're saying can we order 30,000 ventilators? pic.twitter.com/wmuolkagzk\n\nthe president's statements came as public health officials declared the united states the leading country in terms of coronavirus cases with more than 81,300 infected. more than 1,000 people have been killed by the virus, many in new york, which has the worst outbreak in the nation.\n\nnew york gov. andrew cuomo (d) responded friday by saying the numbers were based on facts, not a belief or a feeling.\n\ni don't operate on opinion. i operate on facts, data, projections, cuomo said at his daily press conference, explaining the numbers are based on projections from public health experts.\n\nall the projections say you could have an apex of 40,000 ventilators, he said. make the decisions based on the data and the science.\n\ni hope we don't need the 30,000 ventilators, cuomo added. he said he wished there'd be some natural weather change that would wipe out the virus, apparently referring to trump's spurious suggestion last month that the virus would simply disappear as the weather gets warmer.\n\nbut that's my hope, that's my emotion, cuomo said. the numbers say you may need 30,000.\n\ncuomo had warned thursday that the state's hospitals could soon be overwhelmed with patients afflicted with the covid-19 disease, noting more than 5,200 people had been hospitalized, including 1,290 in intensive care.\n\non tuesday cuomo said the federal emergency management agency was sending 400 ventilators after he warned that the state needed thousands more to deal with an impending apex of its infection rate that he estimated would take place in a few weeks.\n\nwhat am i going to do with 400 ventilators when i need 30,000? cuomo said at a news conference at manhattan's javits center, which is being turned into a makeshift hospital to treat new yorkers. you want a pat on the back for sending 400 ventilators? you're missing the magnitude of the problem.\n\ntrump later said 4,000 additional ventilators would be sent to new york's hospital system, but he blasted the governor's leadership, saying he had a chance to buy the machines in 2015 but turned it down. cuomo has ordered that 7,000 more be purchased but warned it's still not nearly enough. the state approved a plan to allow two patients to share one ventilator if needed as infections grow more dire.\n\nthe president has been insistent that the country can soon open up after many states have urged residents to self-isolate and socially distance in their communities to halt the spread of the virus. he's pushed the easter holiday weekend as his deadline, despite warnings from health officials that doing so could spell disaster.\n\ni think we can open up sections, quadrants, keep them going until the whole country's opened up, trump told hannity on thursday. the people want to get back to work. they want to get back.

toronto — the canadian government is now advising citizens against all travel to a chinese province that's at the centre of a global outbreak of a new form of coronavirus, stepping up an earlier warning about the region.\n\non monday afternoon, the government updated its advice for travellers to say that canadians shouldn't go to hubei province at all.\n\navoid all travel to the province of hubei, including the cities of wuhan, huanggang and ezhou, due to the imposition of heavy travel restrictions in order to limit the spread of a novel coronavirus, the website stated.\n\npreviously, foreign affairs minister francois-philippe champagne had only advised canadians to avoid non-essential travel to the region.\n\nthe chinese government cut transportation links to and from the city of wuhan, at the centre of the outbreak, on jan. 22. beijing has since expanded those controls to several nearby cities.\n\nanyone travelling from wuhan is required to register and quarantine themselves for 14 days — the maximum incubation period for the virus.\n\nthe canadian travel warning followed further reassurances on monday from the country's top public health official that the risk from the disease remains minimal despite the discovery of a second presumptive case in canada.\n\ndr. theresa tam said the two diagnoses involve a married couple from toronto who returned from wuhan on jan. 22. a man in his 50s was confirmed as canada's first official coronavirus patient earlier in the day, while the first of two rounds of tests indicates his wife has also contracted the illness.\n\ntam said the likely diagnosis of a second case has not changed her view that the risk of contracting the virus remains low in canada, noting the two instances follow a reassuring pattern.\n\ntransmission of the virus is occurring among family members who have close and prolonged exposure to sick individuals, tam said in a teleconference. canadians should not be concerned that they can pick up the virus from an infected individual by any casual contact, such as walking through the airport or another public place.\n\nsome groups were already avoiding travel to china, with the university of regina announcing earlier monday that it has cancelled all china trips it had organized for the next three months due to the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nlab testing 25 samples\n\nhealth officials in ontario have said both the husband and wife who were diagnosed with coronavirus wore protective masks during the journey back to canada, a step the medical community has said can be helpful in preventing the spread of the illness.\n\ntam said the man showed signs of a mild cough on the flight, and he and his wife both disclosed their recent travel history upon landing at toronto pearson international airport.\n\nboth federal and provincial officials have said the man sought hospital treatment for deteriorating symptoms the day after returning home, prompting paramedics to arrive on scene wearing protective equipment.\n\nhis status as the country's first prospective coronavirus case was announced on the weekend but confirmed on monday by ontario's senior public health officials.\n\ndr. barbara yaffe, the province's associate chief medical officer of health, said the confirmation resulted from tests at the national microbiology laboratory in winnipeg. the man initially tested positive at a provincial facility, as did his wife days later.\n\npeople are self-identifying and we continue to make sure the system is working. - dr. barbara yaffe, ontario's associate chief medical officer of health\n\ntam said monday the woman's case is now awaiting confirmation at the national level, noting the lab is currently testing 25 samples from multiple provinces.\n\nthe man remains at toronto's sunnybrook hospital receiving treatment, while his wife is in self-isolation at home, officials said.\n\nyaffe said several other prospective patients have been tested at the provincial level in recent days, with coronavirus being eliminated in at least 15 cases. results are still pending for 19 others, she added.\n\nthe good news here is that there is ongoing, active monitoring, she said. people are self-identifying and we continue to make sure the system is working.\n\nontario's chief medical officer of health, dr. david williams, said the patients currently being tested reside throughout the province, though many are concentrated in toronto.\n\ncole burston via getty images travellers are seen wearing masks at the international arrivals area at the toronto pearson international airport on sunday.\n\ntoronto mayor john tory said he's requested that all public health information related to coronavirus be translated into languages other than english or french to ensure the city's diverse population can stay informed.\n\nechoing public health officials who stress the risk of contracting coronavirus remains low, tory urged residents to maintain business as usual.\n\nbe careful, be vigilant, but you don't have to change your life at the moment, he said.\n\nfederal officials said sunday they were reaching out to passengers who travelled on the same china southern airlines flight with the couple and sat within two metres of them.\n\nwilliams said those who are not currently exhibiting the flu-like symptoms consistent with coronavirus are likely not contagious.\n\nif somebody does not have symptoms, they usually are not shedding, he said, adding researchers are continually studying the virus and becoming more familiar with its characteristics.\n\nmore than 4,500 cases\n\nthe new form of coronavirus, a close cousin to respiratory illnesses such as sars and mers, originated in china and has spread rapidly in recent weeks.\n\nofficials in that country have reported the illness has killed at least 106 people and infected more than 4,500 others, as of tuesday morning. several countries throughout asia, europe and north america have also confirmed cases of the illness. it remains to be seen whether the virus is as dangerous as the common flu, which kills thousands every year in canada alone.\n\nyaffe said all cases outside of china so far include a travel history to that country, adding that ontario emergency dispatchers have now been instructed to ask about that issue while screening calls from those showing signs of a respiratory illness.\n\ntam said a committee including officials from federal, provincial and territorial governments will be established on tuesday to help share information.\n\nthis report by the canadian press was first published jan. 27, 2020.
there are also types of coronavirus that originated in animals and evolved to impact humans. these include: mers-cov (coronavirus that causes middle east respiratory syndrome, or mers), sars-cov (coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or sars), and most recently, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov).\n\nthe latest type of coronavirus – known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) – is one of seven types of coronavirus identified since the mid 1960s. there are four common human coronaviruses, where the symptoms tend to be less problematic. these are 229e, nl63, oc43 and hku1.\n\nthe study's authors estimate that, on average, each patient in the hospital had spread the infection to at least two other people. meanwhile on home soil, a british man who became infected in singapore is thought to be responsible for at least seven other confirmed cases in england, france and spain.\n\na single patient with coronavirus infected at least 10 healthcare workers and four patients at a hospital in wuhan, china, according to a study , which shows just how fast – and easily – the virus can spread.\n\nsouthampton university's world pop project a prediction of the spread of the virus, calculated by southampton university's world pop project research group using data from chinese tech giant baidu.\n\nso how do these viruses spread?\n\nwith previous outbreaks like mers and sars, human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets (i.e. when you cough and sneeze), contact with others, and touching infected objects or materials.\n\npaul hunter, a professor in medicine at university of east anglia, reiterates this, telling huffpost uk coronaviruses are spread largely by droplets in the air. as the old saying goes: coughs and sneezes spread diseases.\n\nif a person with coronavirus coughs or sneezes and another person is within two metres of where they're standing, they could inhale infected droplets. likewise, if an infected person coughs or sneezes onto their hand, then touches a door handle, another person who touches that door handle could pick up the virus.\n\nif an uninfected person touches these surfaces, then washes their hands immediately (and properly), there wouldn't necessarily be a problem. but if they go on to touch their eyes, nose or mouth, they can become infected with the virus. in fact, touching anywhere near the mouth – for example, smoking – could cause infection, says prof hunter.\n\nthat's how colds spread [and how] sars spread, he says. it is undoubtedly the primary way 2019 novel coronavirus spreads.\n\ndr nick phin, deputy director of the national infection service at public health england (phe) echoes this, adding: while not a lot is known about the novel coronavirus, it is likely to behave in a similar way to other respiratory viruses.\n\nit's unclear how long surfaces are contaminated for after an infected person has touched it – although under most circumstances, phe says the amount of infectious virus is likely to have decreased significantly by 24 hours, and even more so by 48 hours.\n\ndr phin says how long any respiratory virus survives will depend on a number of factors: for example, what the virus is on, whether it is exposed to sunlight, differences in temperature and humidity, and exposure to cleaning products – even simple ones like soapy water and household cleaning sprays.\n\nexperts don't currently know whether people without symptoms of coronavirus – but who are infected with the virus – are infectious or not. if it's only symptomatic people who spread the virus, you don't need to worry too much about quarantining asymptomatic people [a person showing no symptoms], says prof hunter.\n\nbut, as we don't yet know at what stage the virus spreads, it's important to take whatever precaution you can by continuing to maintain good hygiene.\n\nthe best way to stop germs spreading is to: avoid close contact with people (particularly those suffering from respiratory infection symptoms); frequently wash your hands with soap and warm water (or using sanitiser gel); and cough or sneeze into tissues, and then bin those tissues. this advice is useful for all winter viruses that may be circulating – not just for protecting against coronavirus.\n\nif the 2019 novel coronavirus does turn into a pandemic, this advice might change, prof hunter notes.
in the flurry of new year's resolutions that so many of us inevitably make, maybe you succumbed to dating sunday and took the plunge of signing up for an online dating site. match.com says the sunday after new year's day is the busiest day of the year, with a 60 percent spike in new members between christmas and valentine's day.\n\nbut even more than most resolutions, this one might be quick to be broken.\n\nfor good reason--as common as online dating has become, there's a lot of negativity surrounding it still: it seems like everyone on there is married (thank you, ashley madison), or just trying to hook up (thank you, tinder), or trying to con you or kill you or sell you into slavery (thank you, entire internet).\n\nand there are plenty of other horror stories--the players and sexters and clingers and weirdos. there's the awkwardness, the rudeness, the disappointments. many who sign onto a dating site lose interest and motivation long before their subscription has expired.\n\ni tried online dating three separate times over a period of a few years, and each time wound up hiding my profile in discouragement or disgust just a couple of months in.\n\ni was badly burned out on the format, but, as a self-employed writer and editor who mostly lived in a cave with only my computer for company, it wasn't like my path was crossing with a whole bunch of eligible single men. not seeing any other options, though, eventually i reluctantly decided to try again.\n\nbut in this final try at internet dating, i made one crucial change:\n\nthis time i enlisted help.\n\nseveral of my girlfriends had been down the same road, trying internet dating with varying degrees of success, and they offered to be my dating buddies: a panel of advisers who would help me with everything from how to present myself in my profile and pics, to vetting the men who contacted me, to pep talks (and consolation calls!) before and after in-person dates.\n\nmy friends checked out the men who were contacting me. this one's cropped a girl out of the pic--next! one would decree, or, i know you want someone tall--i'm six feet--but this guy's only an inch shorter than you are, and he loves to read and travel, just like you--why not consider him?\n\nwhen we finally picked likely prospects together, i would let one of them know when i had an in-person date so someone had the man's contact info and my last-known whereabouts...just in case he was a psycho killer.\n\ni also called debriefed with them after--and when i had dates like the one where a guy told me about his four ex-wives within the first ten minutes, or talked on his cell phone for literally half the date, or blatantly checked out another woman's boobs, rehashing my travails with my gal pals made them seem hilarious rather than simply discouraging.\n\nthere are plenty of articles and even tv shows like tlc's love at first swipe that teach you to create a snazzy profile, but don't address the big-picture challenges of online dating: reentering the dating market when you're over 40, whether it's ever okay to lie/stretch the truth in your profile, what subtext reveals in your own profile and others', etc.\n\nand though there are services and people you can hire to help you with those aspects of dating--online and otherwise, it's not always affordable or feasible for everyone to hire a pro.\n\nfor me, sharing the experience with my friends made it less lonely, less daunting--and a whole lot more fun.\n\nand when i finally met the man i wound up marrying--who i probably wouldn't have met any other way--i had dear friends to celebrate it with who were there from the very beginning. (one of our very first dates involved him facing a gauntlet of these six women over cocktails, every one of them meticulously checking him out.)\n\nit took kissing a lot of virtual frogs to get to my prince--and it also took a village. without the input, advice, sympathy, and encouragement of my friends, i might still be clicking around and bemoaning the uselessness of online dating.\n\nso this year i'm proposing that if you're one of the almost 50 million singles who try online dating, you do things a little differently: date by committee.\n\nif you've wanted to try online dating and hesitated--or you have tried before and hated it--maybe 2016 is the year to grab your own dating buddy and take the plunge.\n\nphoebe fox is the author of the breakup doctor and bedside manners, part of the breakup doctor series (from henery press). heart conditions, book three of the series, will be released february 2016. you can find her at www.phoebefoxauthor.com, and on twitter and facebook.
joshua l. jones/athens banner-herald via ap demonstrators march in athens, georgia, after undocumented immigrants there were arrested in july for driving without a license. a 2011 state law permits law enforcement officers to stop anyone they deem to be suspicious and ask for their papers.\n\nby teresa wiltz\n\ndecatur, ga. — over the past few years, statehouses around the country have tried to rein in cities deemed too friendly to undocumented immigrants. but georgia is the only state that's created an independent board with one specific mission: punishing cities that aren't doing enough to crack down on illegal immigration.\n\ntypically, that responsibility falls to state attorneys general. but in georgia, residents can file a complaint against any city or county they judge to be breaking state immigration law.\n\nuntil a recent case against the small liberal town of decatur, though, all but one of the complaints had come from one private citizen, an avowed anti-illegal immigration activist who's made this his life's calling.\n\nthen the lieutenant governor, republican casey cagle, filed a complaint accusing decatur of violating state immigration law last year as he was running for governor. and on facebook, he threatened to yank its state funding.\n\nliberal politicians in the city of decatur are trying to put the interests of criminal illegal aliens ahead of our safety — and i will not allow it! cagle wrote. (he did not respond to repeated requests from stateline for comment.)\n\nfew locals have heard of it, but georgia's immigration enforcement review board was created seven years ago, when the state passed one of the nation's strictest immigration laws. trying to keep track of the legal comings and goings of the ierb, as the board is known, can be dizzying.\n\nmost of its members are not attorneys or immigration experts. all are volunteers — and all are political appointees, which in this red state makes it a majority republican board.\n\nand while technically not a court, the board has been given many of the powers of a court: it investigates alleged wrongdoing, subpoenas witnesses and hears testimony.\n\nthe board has the power to recommend sanctions against municipalities found to be in the wrong — and ultimately, withhold millions in state funding from them as punishment.\n\nso far, though, it has levied just one lasting fine, for $1,000 against atlanta. a handful of small cities, though, have been forced to spend time and money defending themselves against accusations.\n\ntwo of the immigration board members refused to step down years after their terms ended, and did so only in 2018, when they were sued by a decatur resident and accused of violating georgia law.\n\nthe georgia board is an example of what not to do, rather than a model for something effective, said jessica vaughan, director of policy studies for the center for immigration studies, a national research and advocacy group that favors limited immigration to the united states.\n\nit's troubling, vaughan said, to have that authority go to a politically appointed group that lacks expertise in the subject matter.\n\nthe city of decatur has filed two lawsuits against the board, saying it has violated public meetings and public records laws; the georgia first amendment foundation and the southern poverty law center joined one of the suits in december. (under james balli's tenure as chair, he has made efforts to make the board more transparent, including releasing records to a reporter.)\n\nballi said it is just complying with state immigration law in its work, and until that law is changed, it'll continue with its charge.\n\nthe 2011 law the board is focused on, hb 87, permits law enforcement officers to stop anyone they deem to be suspicious and ask for their papers. the law also requires cities and counties, and many businesses, to use e-verify to ensure workers are in the country legally; and punishes those who use fake identification to get work.\n\nthe goal is compliance, not punishment, balli said.\n\nwe're not anti-immigration, balli said, adding that his grandmother was an immigrant from mexico. we don't want that to be the picture of this board.\n\natlanta's hippie cousin\n\ndecatur's been described as a speck of blue in a sea of red, and that is true — up to a point. there have always been specks of blue in georgia, and the state is increasingly trending purple. in november, democrat stacey abrams narrowly lost to republican brian kemp in the race for governor.\n\nbut decatur, as the atlanta journal-constitution puts it, is renowned as a bastion of southern liberalism. it's atlanta's hippie cousin — population 23,800 — 4 square miles of bungalows, yoga studios and farm-to-table fare. in 2016, 86 percent of voters here cast their lot with hillary clinton.\n\nboth decatur and its next-door neighbor atlanta issued directives in 2017 ordering local police not to detain immigrants, barring a court order. decatur doesn't even have a jail — and has few immigrants.\n\nbut for the past year, it is decatur, not atlanta, that has been in battle with the state, fighting accusations that it is a sanctuary city.\n\nand even though the ierb has yet to yank state funding in any of the cases it's heard, decatur officials say they worry the city could lose millions in funding if the board tried to take action.\n\n'kangaroo court'\n\nmany critics of the board, who fall on both sides of the immigration battle, have said it should be disbanded.\n\nit's a court that operates in very strange, mostly nontransparent ways and yet has a tremendous amount of power, said naomi tsu, who oversees the legal and advocacy work on behalf of immigrants in the deep south for the alabama-based southern poverty law center. the center has profiled the ierb on its hatewatch blog.\n\nthen there's marietta, georgia, resident d.a. king, who's filed 20 of the 22 complaints that have come before the board. he called the ierb a parody of a kangaroo court.\n\nking, a detroit native, describes himself as a nationalist along the lines of a george washington, but says that he's not a white supremacist. nor is he against legal immigration. my adopted sister is from korea, he said.\n\ni'm trying to educate people about immigration. it's about the law and what's good for america and americans.\n\n21 minutes\n\noriginally, georgia lawmakers wanted to create a court for dealing with complaints against cities and counties that were allegedly violating the law, said rusi patel, senior associate general counsel at the georgia municipal association, a membership and advocacy organization representing georgia's cities and counties.\n\nbut local governments, worried about long, expensive court hearings, pushed for an alternative, patel said. the ierb was created as a compromise.\n\npersonally, i've been hedging back and forth for a while, whether we've done the right thing, patel said.\n\ni don't know if we have.\n\nthe board meets quarterly. some meetings have wrapped up in three minutes. others have stretched on for hours, with tempers flaring. in june, for example, bryan downs, the decatur city attorney, asked then-board member phil kent why he was participating in the meeting when kent had already recused himself from the decatur case.\n\nkent refused to answer, downs said, and when pushed, demanded that the two men step outside to settle their differences, downs recalled.\n\nit was kind of a macho thing, 'step out in the hall, mano a mano,' downs said. it was weird.\n\nkent did not respond to a request for comment.\n\non a recent december morning, though, three of the six board members were in attendance, and a fourth board member called in. it's not clear where the other board members were.\n\none by one, the board went down a list of seven complaints against seven local school districts, all filed by king.\n\nbut he was nowhere to be found. that's because, he said later, no one told him his complaints would be heard that day.\n\nit likely wouldn't have mattered if i was there, he said, because the last time they heard my complaints, they refused to allow me to speak.\n\nnevertheless, king's presence was felt.\n\nking accused the school districts of teaching english to the immigrant parents of schoolchildren in violation of a georgia law that says anyone receiving public benefits, including adult education classes, must document that they are in the country legally.\n\nfederal law prohibited schools from asking students their immigration status, balli said in the meeting, so the adult education classes weren't breaking any laws. plus, he said, children benefit when their parents can help with homework.\n\nfrom a policy standpoint, this is the right thing to do, balli said. we want children to learn.\n\nthe board dismissed all the complaints. (on jan. 1, king appealed the board's decision.)\n\nthe board then decided to make a policy change and only hear two complaints a year from the same person — a change clearly targeted against king.\n\nit might prohibit some of the unnecessary filing, balli said. he turned to the representative from the attorney general's office.\n\ncan we do that?\n\nyes, the representative said. you must hear all complaints, but it doesn't matter when you hear them.\n\nand after 21 minutes, the meeting was adjourned, with little or no comment from the other board members. (the board is scheduled to meet again jan. 8, ahead of schedule, through a conference call. critics have complained the board is too secretive and schedules meetings on a whim without much notice.)\n\nthe pew charitable trusts the georgia immigration enforcement review board meets quarterly in atlanta. few were in attendance at its december meeting.\n\nright as the meeting wrapped up, a woodstock, georgia-based lawyer, karen sacandy, arrived, looking flustered and a little out of breath.\n\nshe said she makes a point of making the 45-minute drive down to attend every meeting she can.\n\nlike king, she's driven by her strong belief that immigration should be checked.\n\nshe said the ierb isn't doing nearly enough to crack down on immigration, both legal and illegal. she'd like to see all immigration curtailed, because, she said, all immigrants — the latins and the indians — do is drain government resources and take jobs away from american citizens.\n\naren't you worried about the blacks and unemployment? she asked a reporter. well, i am.\n\nthe ierb, she said, needs to be destroyed because it provides a facade that something's being done when really, nothing is being done.\n\nit would be hilarious, she said, if it weren't so tragic.\n\nshowing some muscle\n\nthese battles will likely get more heated, immigration experts say, unless congress takes steps to fully define the authority of u.s. immigration and customs enforcement and the role of local law enforcement agencies.\n\nclashes between cities and states over cooperating with ice have been occurring with greater frequency with the trump administration, said randy capps, director of research, u.s. programs, for the migration policy institute, a research group based out of washington, d.c.\n\nin his complaint against decatur, cagle, the lieutenant governor, alleged that city officials had violated the state's prohibition against local governments adopting, enacting, implementing, or enforcing an immigration sanctuary policy. they issued an order which threatens the city's law enforcement officers with disciplinary action for fully communicating and cooperating with u.s. immigration and customs enforcement (ice) and federal law enforcement.\n\ndecatur is not a sanctuary city, mayor patti garrett said, because it doesn't harbor immigrants who've been convicted or charged with crimes.\n\nthe lieutenant governor's complaint raised eyebrows for two reasons: georgia law specifies that private citizens, rather than public officials, can file complaints against municipalities. and two of the board members were his appointees.\n\ndecatur is known as a progressive city, garrett said. and the lieutenant governor wanted to show some muscle on this issue. we were held up as an example.\n\ncity officials vow to keep fighting.\n\nwe're not going to be bullied, downs said.
every new year, food-related goals make their way to my top five new year resolutions; however, after interacting with four young founders of two food-based startups in new york city, i've learned to keep a more wholesome mindset as goals around food and dietary consumption create a ripple effect around food waste, healthy living, and overconsumption for local populations.\n\n\n\ntransfernation and sani are two startups based out of manhattan working to combat the city's hunger problem and catalyze healthy living lifestyles. sani is a vegan-based meal replacement personalized to the consumer's unique dietary needs and contains every nutrient your body needs. transfernation is a non-profit group that has rescued over 10,000 pounds of cuisine since it began its operations in october 2014.\n\n\n\nboth pairs of founders, samir goel and hannah dehradunwala of transfernation, and sebastian garcia and danielle soto of sani, started their organizations with conversations over food. in the case of the sani founders, conversations turned into data analysis where they used a quantified approach to nutrition so we could hit our respective macros, said soto about sani's genesis. for transfernation, observation and conversation turned into analysis on the concept of food redistribution, starting with questions like what happens after we dump the food?. given the astronomical scale upon which hunger and poverty exist, co-founder dehradunwala found that there's a blatant gap in the current status quo where there is no service in place to redistribute the hundreds of pounds of extra food that is often left over after catered events. the burden of food redistribution cannot solely be placed on event planners and caterers, which is the opportunity transfernation was born on.\n\n\n\nhow it works\n\n\n\ntransfernation is the service that uses an app to deliver extra-catered food from various events to soup kitchens and shelters. their app allows people who want to donate food to get in touch with volunteers to come, pick it up, and drop it off to the closest homeless shelter or soup kitchen- all within the hour. sani is updating their interactive web platform to ask six simple questions about you and your fitness goals, and builds a meal replacement that you can either bake or drink to help you meet your goal.\n\n\n\nthe technology integration became a necessity for the two organizations after realizing their initial assumptions about the marketplace were going to need adjustments. the reality of any business is that ideas don't always translate from paper to the real world, said transfernation's goel. goel and dehradunwala realized that donors wanted as little involvement as possible, due to the sheer scale of some of the events they were hosting. secondly, they believed that the soup kitchens and shelters that transfernation would be partnering with would have the capacity to rescue extra food. but while the soup kitchens and shelters had the infrastructure, they lacked the manpower. according to goel, this led us to consider volunteer-based operations as the best way to provide value to our end beneficiaries.\n\n\n\non sani's side, their core idea never changed but the manner of execution had to. people not only want a product that'll help them look good, but a product that will taste good too, noted garcia. while the core idea hasn't changed, the ingredients consistently do. the balance between nutritional data and the customer feedback meant that they had to ensure that the product was healthy, and pivoted to include 5 flavors, ranging from mexican chocolate to coffee to peanut butter. now that we have a core product that is popular with our consumer base, we can extend our efforts to making sure user interaction with our site is as top-notch as it can be, said soto.\n\n\n\nthe impact\n\n\n\ntrying to evolve food intake into meal supplements is not only an indulgence for wealthy consumers. garcia and soto are planning to evolve sani's business line, admitting that while we're still a start-up that is perfecting our supply chain, our future includes a buy one, give one plan, where a consumer who is able to buy a sani meal also provides a meal to a child in need. being business students, garcia and soto have determined that donating food to a developing country or area actually can hurt that local economy more than help it. we want to work with organizations that already have established relationships, like who's child-meal program, said garcia, to avoid the risk of hurting more than helping.\n\n\n\nwhat started as an effort to make food redistribution fast and easy now also incorporates volunteer-based food rescue mission to increase their range of impact. for goel and dehradunwala, transfernation is running a crowdfunding donation effort to catalyze their 2016 volunteer efforts. we have been asked to expand our efforts to other cities around the us, but we just don't have the manpower yet, said goel. their donation campaign is going to be used to add people to their core team, scale operations and transportation, and incentivize volunteers.
rep. alexandra ocasio-cortez of new york's 14th district hasn't even been in congress for a week, and she's already attracted more criticism on the national stage than most other politicians will probably receive all year.\n\nbut not all of that criticism is from the right.\n\non the view monday, whoopi goldberg dinged ocasio-cortez after the congresswoman's 60 minutes interview with anderson cooper on sunday.\n\nwe as a party have compromised too much, ocasio-cortez told cooper in a clip from the interview. and we've lost too much of who we're supposed to be and who we are.\n\ngoldberg argued that ocasio-cortez wasn't giving her democratic predecessors the credit they deserve.\n\nit is very, very difficult when people make accusations where you say, you know, the democrats have done nothing, the establishment of the democrats have done nothing, the host said. and i just want to throw this out to you: [rep.] john lewis wasn't sitting still. [sen.] dianne feinstein wasn't sitting still.\n\nthere are a lot of people in the democratic party, goldberg said, who have been busting their asses.\n\nocasio-cortez has taken a number of anti-establishment positions since arriving on the political scene. she ruffled the feathers of some party colleagues in november when she encouraged future primary challenges against democratic incumbents. she also participated in a climate change protest outside then-house minority leader speaker nancy pelosi's office during her congressional orientation.\n\nit requires risk to try something new, but also we know so much of what we've tried in the past hasn't worked either, ocasio-cortez told cooper.\n\nbefore you start pooping on people and what they've done, you got to do something, too, goldberg said on the view.\n\nultimately, though, goldberg seemed to give ocasio-cortez more encouragement than condemnation.\n\nso you just got in there, and i know you got lots of good ideas, the host said, but i would encourage you to sit still for a minute and learn the job.\n\nlisten to the entire view panel's comments in the video below.
barcroft media via getty images pro-choice campaigners stage a demonstration on june 5. 2018, in parliament square in london demanding the british government decriminalizes abortion in northern ireland following the result of the referendum in the republic of ireland last month.\n\nireland just expanded the legal definition of domestic violence to include emotional and psychological abuse.\n\nas part of the country's domestic violence act 2018, which went into effect on new year's day, coercive control is now recognized as domestic violence and is punishable by up to five years in prison. the legislation defines coercive control as psychological abuse in an intimate relationship that causes fear of violence, or serious alarm or distress that has a substantial adverse impact on a person's day-to-day activities.\n\nthe new law makes ireland one of only a handful of countries that have set such a precedent. it's an important step in ireland, where one in five women experiences some form of emotional, physical, sexual and financial abuse by an intimate partner in her lifetime, according to the irish anti-domestic violence organization women's aid.\n\nthe new law recognizes that the effect of non-violent control in an intimate relationship can be as harmful to victims as physical abuse because it is an abuse of the unique trust associated with an intimate relationship, ireland's minister for justice and equality, charlie flanagan, said in a statement on wednesday.\n\nthis new provision sends a message that society will no longer tolerate the appalling breach of trust committed by one partner against the other in an intimate context, he continued.\n\nthe domestic violence act 2018 also criminalizes forced marriage, allows restraining orders for couples who do not live together and restricts media coverage in cases of gender-based violence.\n\nwomen's aid director margaret martin said her organization will be closely monitoring the implementation of the legislation.\n\nfrom january 1, 2019, women must feel change quickly. it must be positive, it must be practical and it must make them and their children safer from abuse, she said in a tuesday statement.\n\nshe noted that budget constraints could hinder the law's effectiveness. what is promised on paper must be fully resourced to be effective in protecting those affected by domestic violence, martin said. we are concerned that an already over-stretched system will see an increase in demand when the new provisions commence. cases of emotional abuse far exceeded reported cases of physical abuse in ireland in 2017, according to data obtained by women's aid. that year alone, there were 15,833 reports of domestic violence. of those, 10,281 were cases of emotional and psychological abuse, and 3,502 were cases of physical abuse. additionally, there were 1,443 reported cases of financial abuse and 607 reported cases of sexual abuse.
dr. adizes: i welcome you to adizes methodology.\n\ni think it would be good if i express to you what i believe is critical to make the methodology successful and why some companies are not fully successful.\n\nwhat is the essence of the methodology?\n\nwe all deal with change. whenever there is change there are going to be problems. how do you handle problems? how do you grow a company when there is so much change?\n\nthe problem is that there is uncertainty, you don't know what is going to happen, and there is risk. how to handle uncertainty and risk better than the competition?\n\nthis methodology was not developed in the library in a university. i left the university to go to the real world and see how to make this happen; how to make companies grow, in spite of uncertainty and risk.\n\nthis methodology has been tested for 50 years. please look at our website and you will see presidents of companies who say they grew the company from $12 million to $4 billion with the adizes methodology. it is a testament for the methodology. it has been tested in 58 countries, in companies from startups to the biggest in the world.\n\nwhy the success?\n\nif you have a complementary team, you see things i don't see; i see things you don't see. together we see more. that reduces uncertainty.\n\nnow, if you have the same interest, if we have common interest, that will make risk lower because those who you need will cooperate. when there is common interest there is cooperation. when there is cooperation there is less risk. a complementary team that shares knowledge and is based on common interests, reduces uncertainty and reduces risk.\n\nthat raises the question, what causes people to share information to make better decisions?\n\nmutual respect.\n\nand what will make people have common interest?\n\nmutual trust.\n\nso the whole adizes methodology is how to build mutual trust and respect in a company, so that the company can handle risk and uncertainty, and handle change better. not only to make you happier, but also to make you richer.\n\na company will grow better outside if it is integrated inside. if people are fighting inside, no energy is available to deal with the outside.\n\nnow the question: how do you build mutual trust and respect? especially in russia ( the audience is russian, ed note) -- because russia does not have a history of democracy. it was always a totalitarian system, and companies in russia are run in a totalitarian way. so there is a cultural problem: we have to change the culture inside the company.\n\nhow?\n\nthe program is very systematic, with a program and manuals.... the results are exceptional. as i told you, companies grew from $12 million to $4 billion. but the program is not easy to apply. changing the culture of a company is a very, very time-consuming and difficult job.\n\nit is normal that people want change as long as they don't have to change. so in order for the program to work, in order for a company to succeed with the adizes methodology, it requires commitment.\n\nmany times a president of a company has asked me, dr. adizes, have you ever failed? i say, yes. not every company succeeds.\n\nand they ask me, what is the difference?\n\ni look them in the eye and say, you.\n\nhow committed are you? because people will complain: it takes too much time... it's too much work... we cannot do it... are you going to hold the line? or not?\n\nadizes is not a consulting company. it's not a training company. we are like a coach. we will train you to be an olympic champion but you have to work hard. you have to do it. and it's not going to be easy.\n\nwhat is going to be difficult?\n\nnumber one: the program takes time. you cannot hire somebody to do physical exercise for you. that is what is wrong with some big consulting firms: you hire them to do the work for you. you just need a report and the job is finished. is it?\n\nto be a champion you have to show up. but i don't have time, people complain. in that case forget adizes. try a consulting firm, and good luck.\n\nadizes requires commitment -- at minimum one to two days a month. if you really don't have time, then you start the adizes program at 1 o'clock in the afternoon to 10 o'clock at night twice a month.\n\nproblem number two: as a first-line supervisor, you tell people what to do. you listen, but not too much. your mouth is big; your ears are small.\n\nas you ascend the hierarchy to be the president of a company, your mouth should become small and your ears should become big. small mouth and big ears. that's right: you have to listen what is going on.\n\nyou have to listen to the people, what is going on with them. you are now far from the action. they are on the fighting floor, so you have to listen to what is happening down there. that is where the roots of the tree are. watch the roots, not just the leaves. financial statements are important but remember they are the leaves not the roots of your success.\n\nthat means that you have to change your style. you have to sit in the room and listen to the people. some people are difficult. you must learn how to lead people whose style is different from yours.\n\nadizes is training you so you can handle change in the future without us. we are proud of every client we lose. our job is to teach you the tools how to manage as a team, and then say goodbye, thank you very much. finished. it's like psychotherapy, organizational therapy: you should not be dependent on your therapist for too long. a good therapist makes sure you are healthy and says goodbye, you are done with therapy. you are on your own. you can come to our conventions every year and learn what is new and update yourself so your company continues to grow.\n\nyou get 4 results from the program:\n\nyou solve problems.\n\nyou build a team.\n\nyou become better managers.\n\nand you enrich your managerial style.\n\ni can promise you one thing: if you do a diagnosis of your company, and you identify problems which are chronic -- they come back, and back, and back, and back--this is what is blocking your growth of the company -- this is what you lose sleep over at night -- i promise you--because we have the experience of 50 years, thousands of companies -- 40% of these chronic problems will disappear. minimum. 40% will be better; 20% will not change; and the second year, what was better will disappear, what did not change will become better. in 3 years, all problems you have today should disappear. that is on average. some companies do it faster. it all depends on how committed you, the ceo, are to give time and energy.\n\nin 3 years, it does not mean that you will have no more problems. you will have bigger problems. because you are as big as the problems you are dealing with. today maybe you have problems of quality control, you have problems of marketing, and maybe you have problems of hiring the right people. in 3 years, you will have a big problem: how to become an international company. by solving the small problems you can address the bigger problems.\n\nonce i sent a new years card, with wishes for the new year to my clients: i wish you bigger problems next year than this year that you can solve. tell me how big the problems you are dealing with are and i will tell you how big you are.\n\nthe adizes methodology does not only make the company bigger, it makes you -- you personally -- better. people say that it helps their marriage. next year it's coming out, a new book of mine on how to apply adizes in family life. and i just finished yesterday a new book on how to apply adizes to personal life. so, this methodology is not a consulting methodology, it's a philosophy of life.\n\ni welcome you, i hope that you will enjoy the methodology, and i hope you will join us and many, many companies around the world and have a better company and a better quality of life.\n\nthank you .\n\nwatch the presentation here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iiyjjsc5o8#action=share
during the ladies' short event, french figure skater maé-bérénice méité carved out a place for herself by skating to music including the beyoncé hits halo and run the world (girls). but that's not the only aspect of her performance making waves. méité emerged from the masses in a bodysuit with pants. yes, you read that right: a figure skater competed at the pyeongchang olympics sans skirt.\n\nthe 23-year-old took to the ice in black leggings that appeared to be attached to a gold and black sparkly sleeveless top. and her performance was just as dazzling as it would have been in a frilly, flouncy skirt, if not more so, because it was so bold. méité expressively floated and twirled around the ice winning the hearts of the world, despite her fall, with her boundary-pushing music (this is the first olympics at which skaters are allowed to use music with lyrics!) and even more daring ensemble. these twitter reactions sum it up.\n\nmeet maé-bérénice méité, an olympic figure skater from france.\n\n\n\n- dark skinned black woman\n\n- wore pants for her routine\n\n- skated to beyoncé\n\n\n\nhappy 👏 black 👏 history 👏 month 👏#blackhistorymonth #blackgirlmagic #blackexcellence #itstoocoldforskirtsoutthere pic.twitter.com/jykegqbkup — annie y (@booksandboujee) february 11, 2018\n\nhow she scored is irrelevant; maé-bérénice méité skating to a beyonce mashup in pants is my new queen and 2018 mood #olympics — ellis stump (@_liketheisland) february 11, 2018\n\ni love everything about maé-bérénice méité's outfit. sparkly and pants 😮. wish she could've done better #olympics — wannabe nomad (@jetsettingjoggr) february 11, 2018\n\ni loved the french skater (maé-bérénice méité)'s awesome pants outfit and the bey song. wish she'd done a whole program to beyonce songs. — cassie 🐶🌈🦄🐔 (@cfulgham) february 11, 2018\n\nfrance's maé-bérénice méité skated in pants, and ended her beyoncé medley with run the world (girls). girl, you are an #olympichero — jess mason (@jessloveslit) february 11, 2018\n\nmaé-bérénice méité to beyonce in pants. i'm with it. not even mad about this first two jumps. 🇫🇷 #olympics — from blob to blog (@e90x) february 11, 2018\n\ni don't care about how the skate goes, but mae-berenice meité wearing pants and skating to beyoncé is a powerful thing — andrea (@aaperezzle) february 11, 2018\n\nunfortunately, the judges weren't as impressed, giving her a score of 46.62, putting her in ninth place. did she lose points for her pants? not possible. according to the nbc olympics page, ladies in singles and pairs can wear a skirt, pants or tights. however, that wasn't always the rule. after katarina witt came out on the ice in a few feathers barely covering her behind in 1988, the international skating union enacted a rule that women had to wear skirts. that rule was overturned in the early 2000s, bringing back the pants.\n\nphoto: getty images maé-bérénice méité at the 2018 winter olympics on feb. 11, 2018, in gangneung, south korea.\n\nphoto: david madison/getty images katarina witt in the 1988 calgary olympics, sporting the blue dress that sparked the so-called katarina rule.\n\nthen why don't more women wear pants? for one, it seems not everyone is up to date on the new rules. last week, costume designer jan longmire told instyle, the guidelines change every now and then, but every girl always has to wear a skirt — she can't come out in a leotard on its own.\n\nplus, skirts are just easier on the eyes and more frequently identified with femininity, which is what figure skating is pretty much all about. but if women can wear tuxedos on the red carpet and not be any less elegant, female skaters can do the same in the rink. and they have.\n\nméité might prefer pants; she competed in the same costume at the women's short program dance during the internationaux de france isu grand prix of figure skating in grenoble, france, in november. she also wore pants for her free skate at the 2014 olympics — the unitard was similar, but the sparkly top was silver, blue, and black.\n\namerican skater polina edmunds wore a purple bodysuit in the ladies' short program during the 2018 prudential u.s. figure skating championships.\n\nphoto: getty images polina edmunds in the 2018 prudential u.s. figure skating championships on jan. 3 in san jose, calif.\n\nas soon as the skirt-only ice age melted away, russian skater irina slutskaya wore a fiery bodysuit at the 2006 olympics.\n\nphoto: getty images irina slutskaya during the 2006 winter olympic games in turin, italy.
a week after president donald trump incited his supporters to storm the u.s. capitol in an attempt to overthrow the government and stop lawmakers from certifying president-elect joe biden's electoral win, house republicans are outraged.\n\nthey are outraged that they have to use a metal detector at work.\n\nthe house sergeant at arms announced tuesday that lawmakers will now have to be screened before entering the house chamber in an effort to provide a safe and secure environment for conducting business. the change comes after some lawmakers raised concerns about trump's allies in congress being co-conspirators with the insurrectionists and potentially carrying guns onto the house floor, which is prohibited.\n\nmost lawmakers were fine with the enhanced security. after all, it was just last week when they feared for their lives and barricaded themselves in the house chamber as capitol police officers fended off violent white supremacists trying to smash their way inside. the insurrection left five people dead, and it could have been way, way worse.\n\nbut starting tuesday evening and going into wednesday, some house republicans had full-blown tantrums at the idea of walking through a metal detector ― something everyone else in america has to do all the time, whether at airports, schools or other buildings.\n\nhorse shit! shouted rep. rodney davis (r-ill.). bullshit!\n\nyou are creating a problem you do not understand the ramifications of! rep. steve womack (r-ark.) warned capitol police officers.\n\nyou can't stop me, i'm on my way to a vote, said rep. louie gohmert (r-texas), walking around the magnetometer outside the house chamber.\n\nrep. russ fulcher (r-idaho) just pushed his way through. he went through the metal detector and set it off, shoved an officer out of his way and walked into the house.\n\njonathan ernst / reuters rep. marjorie taylor greene (r-ga), a qanon conspiracy theorist, is searched outside the house chamber tuesday night. her mask says molon labe, a greek phrase meaning come and take them that the right wing uses as an anti-gun control slogan.\n\nrep. steve stivers (r-ohio) made a point to tell capitol police officers that he thinks that making lawmakers use metal detectors is unconstitutional. so did rep. chip roy (r-texas), who said a metal detector is unconstitutional and endangers members. (there is nothing in the constitution about not having to walk through a metal detector.)\n\nat best, the fact that any member of congress is fuming about the inconvenience of a metal detector ― days after a violent insurrection at the capitol, when the coronavirus is killing roughly 4,000 americans every day, in the midst of a presidential impeachment ― reflects an embarrassing level of entitlement and shows how out of touch they are with regular americans, who would not fare well at airport security if they shouted about the constitution and blew past the metal detector.\n\nat worst, it suggests they are bringing guns onto the house floor and don't want to get caught. there's precedent for this concern: rep. madison cawthorn (r-n.c.) said he was armed during the insurrection, which gop lawmakers like him helped incite in the first place.\n\nrep. steve scalise, the no. 2 republican, told me that the situation is untenable because it impedes the ability of members to come and vote. this is our job. these are the lines pic.twitter.com/z6wp9zxmc0 — manu raju (@mkraju) january 13, 2021\n\nat least one congresswoman of color, rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.), said she was scared she would be killed during the lockdown in part because of white supremacists in congress who might publicly reveal her location. rep. cedric richmond (d-la.), who is leaving congress for a job in the biden administration, similarly said wednesday that he believed some of his colleagues may be co-conspirators with the insurrectionists.\n\nsome of the same gop lawmakers fuming about metal detectors were recently all about using them for enhanced security. just not for themselves.\n\nin 2018, house republicans passed the stop school violence act to provide schools with more money to prevent gun violence. among other things, the money was authorized to install metal detectors.\n\namong those voting for that bill? bucshon, davis, gohmert and stivers.\n\ni also support ... improving school safety by increasing funding for schools to have metal detectors, stivers said in a statement at the time.\n\nhorse shit! rep. rodney davis (r-ill.), so angry about a metal detector\n\nit's not clear what authority capitol police officers have, if any, to stop lawmakers from going onto the house floor without being screened first. they are not allowed to arrest members of congress on their way to a vote, per the constitution. they also can't arrest them while they're in a session in their chamber, or when they're going to or coming from that chamber. the only exceptions are if they're committing treason, a felony or a breach of the peace.\n\nbut house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) may have figured out a way to tamp down on lawmakers' defiance of metal detectors: fines.\n\nin a wednesday night statement, pelosi said the house will move forward with a rule change when it comes back in session on jan. 21 that will impose fines on members of congress who refuse to abide by these protections.\n\nthe fine for the first offense will be $5,000, and $10,000 for the second offense. the fines will be deducted directly from lawmakers' salaries.\n\nit is tragic that this step is necessary, pelosi said, but the chamber of the people's house must and will be safe.
in the united states, the trump administration has come under fire from critics for what they say has been a slow gearing up of testing for the new virus.\n\nu.s. vice president mike pence promised on sunday that americans would have access in the days ahead to more than 2,000 laboratories capable of processing tests.\n\nwith limited testing available, u.s. officials have recorded nearly 3,000 cases and 62 deaths, and large segments of daily activities have been upended across the country.\n\ntedros said on monday the strategy to contain the disease - identifying people with infections and rapidly isolating them - was still the best approach, and had shown positive effects in china, south korea and singapore.\n\nmany countries have limited testing to the old or with pre-existing conditions, refusing tests for others with milder symptoms who can nevertheless spread the virus. often they simply do not have the resources to carry out more tests.\n\npaul molinaro, in charge of operations, support and logistics at the who, called for a change in mindset to overcome supply shortages in items such as test kits and protective equipment to fight the pandemic.
hbo nicole kidman's character in a much-talked-about green coat from hbo's recent limited series, the undoing.\n\ni had no interest in watching hbo's latest whodunit, the undoing. i had heard rumblings comparing it to big little lies and felt no urge to change course from watching hours of old episodes of real housewives. but strangers on twitter were aghast and the final reveal was seemingly big.\n\nafter seeing so much hype, i figured it has to be worth it. after all, twitter is never wrong. described as an east coast 'big little lies,' i figured the show would have twists and turns to keep me hooked for six episodes. so i spent a few days bingeing and watching seemingly unnecessary close-up shots of nicole kidman. almost all my knowledge revolved around talk of her coats on the show, from a velvety green number to a wine-colored robe ― sartorial experts were extremely excited about the outwear of their beloved protagonist.\n\nagree about the undoing. very whatever. nicole's kidman's coats were the main draw, which says a lot. — jamie litoff (@jamielitoff) december 19, 2020\n\nwhile i felt completely unsatisfied by the entire show ― ending included — i felt equally lukewarm about the fashion. the passion around kidman's coats left me flabbergasted.\n\nthe coats were … fine? mediocre?\n\nnot sure why the undoing is the coat show of the pandemic when kaley cuoco wears a different, even more amazing coat in every single episode of the flight attendant. i demand coverage! — taffy brodesser-akner (@taffyakner) december 19, 2020\n\nthe coats didn't overtly tell a story. we knew little about the brand of coats, where they came from or what made them especially significant to a character whose life is seemingly falling apart around her. the colors were vibrant and yes, against kidman's red hair, something pretty to look at. yet the coats became one of the most talked-about aspects of the show.\n\nthere surely have been tv shows (crime-related or otherwise) that featured more significant, memorable coats. so let's shine some light on the shows, both of yesteryear and today, whose coats are truly worthy scene stealers.\n\n1. killing eve\n\nnot only is killing eve actually a good thriller, the antagonist villanelle perfectly incorporates sartorial aspects to a genre not explicitly known for well-dressed characters. killing eve marries fashion and thrilling plotlines pretty perfectly, a theme the undoing certainly could've picked up on. to her core, villanelle is a woman who appreciates fashion trends and dressing up ― she might even feel good in doing so. with kidman's grace, fashion seems implied by her status but stops short in telling a deeper story about the character, or frankly, the plot. the outwear in killing eve also feels much more meaningful ― the characters actually have to keep warm in various cold-weathered locations. and as is typical with villanelle, her outerwear certainly lands her on best-dressed psychopath lists everywhere.\n\n2. love & anarchy\n\nin a year where escapism became a mandatory staple of television, netflix's underrated love & anarchy proved coats still had a certain je ne sais quoi. while sofie's coats might not jump off the screen with emerald green or red threading, they are paired well with a character and the development (or not) that ultimately takes place after an entire season. and unlike the undoing, the coats in love & anarchy could quite possibly carry a scene all by their lonesome.\n\n3. murder she wrote\n\nforget modern-day crime dramas and give me jessica fletcher. thanks to an abundance of reruns available on cable or amazon prime, murder she wrote has some of the most iconic costumes, including but not limited to fletcher's impeccable outerwear choices. marvel at '80s v-neck sweaters under men's coats, windbreakers with a plethora of colors or nautical rain jackets that put the gorton's fisherman in his place.\n\n4. search party\n\nit's entirely possible to create a compelling crime show featuring standout coats without actually having to discuss said coats. twitter didn't go apeshit over the outerwear sported by alia shawkat, john early or meredith hagner, but it should have. the series takes place over various seasons but each coat perfectly encapsulates each ridiculous and over-the-top character without talking it to death.\n\n5. frasier\n\n″frasier did more for trench coats than the undoing ever could for its apparel. thanks to the rainy setting of seattle, frasier and his counterparts made trench coats stylish, with or without interior burberry branding. frasier might not strike audiences as tv's most fashion-forward show, but next time you watch, pay attention to the countless beige drappering going on between the psychologist, his brother and the rest of the gang.\n\n6. the mary tyler moore show
it's hardly a secret that i was adopted as a baby and quite frankly, there's absolutely no reason it should be. as i've grown, i've watched the conversation and perceptions about adopted kids and families shift, but nothing has quite captured the truth, both the good and the ugly, of adoption like the film lion. it's an honest look at adoption and the not uncommon feelings surrounding identity that come up for many people. without getting on a soapbox, the film stands up to some commonly held misperceptions about adoption, the stigma many families deal with and supports the often life changing impact it can have. when it comes down to it, lion is a story of love and family, and the idea that we are shaped by both our environment and our dna.\n\n\n\nif you're not already familiar, lion is the true story of saroo brierley, who at 5 years old gets lost on a train, ending up on the streets of calcutta before ultimately being adopted by an australian couple. fast forward 25 years later, saroo uses google earth, when it was still a new technology to try to find his birth home.\n\n\n\nthe story alone is incredible, but the cast is simply remarkable in their portrayals -- and if you're anything like me, they'll have you sobbing through an entire box of tissues. this film is an emotional journey boosted by the gorgeous landscapes of india and australia, and no surprise that i noticed the music, which ties together the longing, heart wrenching, and joyous moments throughout.\n\n\n\nwhen it comes down to it, 'lion' is a story of love and family, and the idea that we are shaped by both our environment and our dna.\n\n\n\ndev patel plays saroo as an adult struggling with his identity, something i've found to be an experience every adopted kid feels at one point in their lives or another. the results of his search are beyond belief, but it's his journey that resonated most strongly with my own experience. on the one hand, you share the unconditional love for your parents that they have for you, not to mention eternal gratitude for the life they've given you. but as saroo shows, there's often a lingering thought about where you came from. we all yearn for our truth; who we are, where we come from, maybe where we get certain quirks or talents (for me i long wondered where my voice came from since my mother very well knows it was not from her). but finding those truths is the most personal of journeys, coming to each of us at different times and in different ways. on top of that, there's always a part of you that worries this is somehow a betrayal as if your parents and your life are not enough.\n\n\n\nlion expertly navigates those thoughts. the movie gives you so much time in india, giving you a complete sense of saroo's life and family there. as an adult he holds on to those memories, but also can't bring himself to open up to that part of his identity until it nearly paralyzes and destroys his life.\n\n\n\ni can honestly say being adopted was one of the best things to ever happen to me. it was never something that was hidden from me and it is not something i have ever been ashamed of.\n\n\n\nnicole kidman who plays saroo's adoptive mother, sue, made my heart break. nicole herself is part of the community of adoptive mothers and it so clearly impacts her performance in this film. she simply nails it. she is the image of an understanding parent, whose love has no limits. in one scene, she explains to saroo that the children she and her husband brought into their lives enriched it beyond words; that they chose him. in a way, she gives saroo permission to search, taking away the guilt because at the end of the day, she will always be his mother.\n\n\n\ni can honestly say being adopted was one of the best things to ever happen to me. it was never something that was hidden from me and it is not something i have ever been ashamed of. i recognize how fortunate i am to have parents who love and support me unconditionally. the fact that they are not my biological parents does not change the fact that they are simply, my parents.\n\n\n\nnot everyone can say that, but i count myself lucky to have a birth mother who loved me enough to know she wasn't ready to be a mom. i'm lucky that i have wonderful parents who chose me. i often say adoption is a full-circle blessing and i truly believe it. adopted children were not abandoned, we were chosen. that is one of the core messages of lion, serving as a beautiful reminder that love knows no boundaries.
hang on, you there, packing up the christmas lights, dismantling the tree, boxing up the crèche with its cast of characters and that long-tailed star. christmas is not over. sure, come december 26th, it may have been all over for the little drummer boy, bing crosby, and the nutcracker; but not quite for christmas. the wise men are just now arriving. and those magi from the east, with their three auspicious gifts, are not simply late to the party. they inaugurate a whole new thing: public acknowledgment by the world's powers, of a radically new kind of rule. they're not the only ones who notice (cue the soundtrack for the dastardly villain).\n\nwhat gets me now, thinking as i have been about environmental issues in jesus-ish terms, is how relevant the contrast between the wise men and herod is still today.\n\nthe christmas story, as relayed in the bible, takes a couple different tellings. luke's includes the birth with shepherds and angels; matthew gives us the wise men... and herod. the christian calendar varies across denominations, but for most, christmas ends only with epiphany (manifestation), twelve days (yes, pear-tree-partridges and all) afterward: january 6. but this is not about church traditions. it's about a striking contrast between two ways that the rich and powerful recognize something greater than themselves, something radically free with its own incorruptible rules and startlingly sublime.\n\nfirst, there's a qualitative difference between the cast of characters - between humility and arrogance, the expansive and the narrow, courage and fear. ancient magi were defined by their great learning - wise men whose quest for understanding then as now was the ceaselessly diligent work of a humbling sort that not only expands one's interests beyond one's immediate and personal but also enriches beyond the material. there's nothing of this in herod, the local king, only a narrow desperation to hang on to his power.\n\nherod was full of bluster and deeply afraid. in his power and riches, he feared that this newborn demand for justice, peace, respect, and love would compromise his might and threaten his bottom line. herod sees the newborn not for adoration and joy, but as a terrible danger to be killed as quickly as possible. while herod was ruled by fear and sought to take - through an arrogant and selfish greed, life itself - the magi, moved by adoration and joy, gave. these foreigners were people of wealth and privilege, powerful in their own right. out of those qualities, they recognized something in the one newborn worthy of respect. they gave.\n\nin a recent experiment of the imagination (god of earth: discovering a radically ecological christianity), i asked what happens if the jesus of christian theology (of reconciliation, fierce demands, love, and life itself) were not limited to the guy of 2,000 years ago but were also realized - made real, incarnate - in the nonhuman natural world around us? i called this jesus god of earth and tracked that question through the church year, since those are moments that theologically define jesus. stumbling into this season, i couldn't help but notice: the three wise men and herod model two very different ways to confront the beauty and demands of our nonhuman natural world inextricably bound up as they are with justice and peace.\n\nrecognizing the god of earth means nothing less than an end to the world's business as usual. there is great promise - prosperity, peace, even joy - in such recognition, but the unwise powerful cannot see this and would rather kill all semblance of the sublime than risk their bottom line. the significance of the god of earth with her demand for environmental wisdom and justice complicates in inconvenient ways the business of some of the rich and powerful. some, because remember the magi who came, and out of the dignity of their station, recognized with deference and adoration what was holy among them.\n\nduring the season of epiphany, our nation will undergo a marked change in leadership. in a democracy, a system in which each of us, whether or not we individually possess great wealth or power, can affect the course of our communities and country, we do well to consider these two ways, then tirelessly choose the better and urge our leaders to do the same. so, you can pack up that christmas stuff now. it's time to attend to the public implications of an invitation to be for justice and peace.
up until this past week, i liked to refer to myself as a recovering home-schooler. i loved home-schooling my children, the way we love anything that stretches and exhausts and betters us, but i had come to accept that it would no longer be part of our journey.\n\nwe initially chose home-schooling in a bid for increased freedom and individualized learning, which worked ― some days better than others ― until i alone could no longer meet their needs. just this past fall we made the difficult decision to enroll them all in real school. the irony that the year we put our kids in school just happens to be the same year that the entire world started home-schooling is not lost on me.\n\nnow, i, along with millions of other parents across the nation, ready my home school and slog through the ups and downs of distance learning amidst the covid-19 outbreak. many moms and dads are navigating this new reality while at the same time balancing the demands of a full-time job and attempting to parent through an exceptionally volatile and potentially traumatic worldwide crisis.\n\n\n\nhaving taught my four children for three crazy, wonderful, tiring years, i understand the anxiety that accompanies this new normal and the upheaval wrought by a drastic change in circumstances.\n\ngiven that, i'd like to share my personal home-schooling thoughts and experiences in the hope that some may find them helpful. please know that my perspective is shaped by my failures as much as, if not more than, my successes.\n\ndon't do school at home.\n\nwhy? you don't need to. also, you can't. i have seen all of those amazing, pinterest-worthy daily schedules circulating on instagram and facebook. yes, they are beautiful and inspiring, but they are also wildly impractical.\n\nwhen we first started home-schooling four years ago, i did my very best to replicate the school environment. our days were planned down to the minute, including bathroom breaks. it lasted exactly one week and we all cried. every. single. day. it was a disaster.\n\ninstead of a schedule, try to create a gentle, flexible routine. some school days will start at 8 a.m. and some days will start at 10 ― because you have a meeting or it's a beautiful morning to play outside or the kids are exhausted. none of that matters.\n\nhowever, when you do start your day of learning, try to start the same way as often as you can. it could be with a prayer, a reading or a dance party ― anything to help signal the beginning of learning time.\n\nlet your routine reflect your priorities.\n\nunderstand that something will fall through the cracks nearly every day. figure out what is most critical to the success of your family and work backward from there.\n\nour first subject of the day was always math. i did this for two reasons. one, i wanted to be sure that math was practiced daily and if everything else went off the rails, i knew this was checked off the list. two, i had the most mental capacity and patience to help with challenging problems at the beginning of the school day. i am fried after two or three hours of teaching, so i oriented our routine in levels of decreasing mental output (at least for me).\n\nlearn to pivot ― a lot.\n\nflexibility is 100% the key to staying sane as a home-schooling parent. when i initially hit roadblocks in teaching, my instinct was always to push through ― whether it was with a frustrated kid, an assignment that was wonky or a concept that wasn't landing. fyi, things usually just got worse.\n\npushing through is almost never the answer in home-schooling. if something isn't working, there is usually a reason and, most of the time, there is a better solution. i have never regretted hitting the reset button by taking a break, ditching the assignment or switching my approach.\n\nwe are blessed to have the guidance and support of the amazing teachers at our kids' schools and for that, i am so, so grateful. however, knowing that this is all new to them, there are bound to be bumps in the road. new concepts and certain curriculums may not translate as readily to an online format as we all hope. your kiddo may resist a new teaching style or may not assimilate information in this new fashion. all of this is ok. it just means that we need to put on our flexible pants and give everyone all of the grace ― especially ourselves.\n\nfocus on your relationship, not the work at hand.\n\nthis is easier said than done and takes lots of practice and self-regulation. it is very easy to get caught up in a moment of frustration or anger, especially with all the pressures we have right now. expect to apologize ― a lot.\n\nduring our first year of home-schooling, i apologized on the daily, usually more than once. when possible, remind yourself that you are the teacher for this brief (we hope) window, but you have an opportunity to positively impact your relationship with your child for a lifetime.\n\nso, be kind. give everyone credit for showing up and remember the only thing they really must know right this moment is that they are loved.\n\nyou can do this. you can teach your child and support their learning. it will be messy and challenging and there may be days when you wonder if your child needs far more than you can offer.\n\nin those times, please know that you are uniquely equipped to guide your child through this because you are their parent. you come to the table with a set of skills that includes an intimate knowledge of what makes your kiddo tick and a dedication to their success far beyond the chaos of this moment. use all of this to your advantage.\n\nyou've got this.\n\ndo you have a compelling personal story you'd like to see published on huffpost? find out what we're looking for here and send us a pitch!
toronto — canada is already taking the right steps to control the spread of the novel coronavirus, so there is no need to change things now that the world health organization has declared a global emergency over the outbreak, federal health minister patty hajdu said thursday.\n\nthe world health organization's global emergency status is really ... about helping countries that do not have the same level of sophistication as canada, or perhaps the united states, to protect their citizens if in fact they have a citizen who returns from china who is ill, or has been close to someone who has returned from china who is ill, hajdu told reporters in ottawa.\n\nyou know this has been working very well in canada, because we have actually been able to detect cases very quickly, support those people to get better and prevent the spread of disease, she said. and what the world health organization is saying is that we've got to make sure that other countries can do that as well, because it is in the interest of world health that we support everyone in this process.\n\ncole burston via getty images dr. david williams, the chief medical officer of ontario, listens to press questions during a press briefing on the coronavirus at queen's park on jan. 27, 2020, in toronto.\n\nthe world health organization declared the outbreak, which was sparked by a new virus in china that has been exported to more than a dozen countries, as a global emergency thursday. the un health agency defines an international emergency as an extraordinary event that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a co-ordinated response.\n\nthough many people experience only mild symptoms from the virus, china has reported more than 7,800 cases, including 170 deaths.\n\nhajdu stressed the need — and the responsibility — to remain calm.\n\ni think that anything that we are doing as politicians or leaders or members of the media that will create a sense of anxiety or panic is actually a dangerous road to travel down, she said.\n\ncole burston via getty images dr. barbara yaffe, ontario's associate chief medical officer of health, listens during a press briefing on the coronavirus at queen's park.\n\nearlier thursday, ontario's chief medical officer of health said the relatively low number of cases here is reassuring, even though it is still early days in dealing with the virus.\n\nthere are three confirmed cases of the virus in canada — two in ontario and one in british columbia — and all are linked to recent travel in china.\n\ndr. david williams and ontario's associate chief medical officer of health, dr. barbara yaffe, held a briefing on the new virus thursday and said there are no new presumptive or confirmed cases in ontario. williams said he would be much more concerned at this point if the province had already seen around seven to 10 cases.\n\nthis is reassuring in a way, but not that we're going to sit back and coast, he said. the system is working. we're investigating. individuals of concern have self-reported, are coming forward and we haven't seen ones that out of the blue show up already quite ill and infected. we're not seeing that yet, but it's still early days.\n\nthere are 27 cases currently under investigation in the province, and 38 people have already been tested and cleared.\n\nwilliams said the coronavirus does not seem to be much different from regular influenza in terms of transmissibility, and evidence suggests it is not transmissible when a person is not feeling symptoms.\n\nthe two ontario cases are a husband and wife, and since they had both travelled to the affected area in china, it's unclear whether the woman — as the second case — got it in wuhan or from her husband.\n\nasked about the novel virus thursday afternoon, prime minister justin trudeau warned against stigmatizing the chinese-canadian community.\n\nwe've seen too many instances of unreasonable fears being spread either on the internet or in other ways. we need to know this is a time for canadians — all canadians, including canadians of chinese origin — to pull together and to lean on each other, trudeau told reporters in brampton, ont.\n\nnurphoto via getty images an out of stock sign sits on a store shelf as face masks and hand sanitizer have been sold out in countless retailers across the city as people stock up in toronto.\n\nmeanwhile, quebec has no confirmed cases of the new virus, and the chances of its being transmitted to the community are considered low, the province's director of public health said thursday.\n\ndr. horacio arruda warned the public against wearing masks, which he said do not constitute, by science, a useful tool for the general population in quebec, even in the context of a coronavirus outbreak. instead, he suggested people practice respiratory hygiene by washing their hands and covering their mouths when sneezing or coughing.\n\nif people have respiratory symptoms and have to go out in public, wearing a mask can help prevent transmission, yaffe said, but it is not useful for the general population.\n\nanybody who's feeling well, wearing a mask is not going to do anything, she said. in fact, it might give them a false sense of security.\n\nthis report by the canadian press was first published jan. 30, 2020.
its january, and lots of us have been talking about what happened over the recent holidays, or, at least, listening to others doing so. maybe like me, you've heard (or said) something like, i thought it (xmas, new year's, a trip etc.) was going to be great, but then _______ (fill-in-the-blank) did or said ________ (fill-in-the-blank) just like always, and i couldn't wait for it to be over.\n\nseems like sentiment is pretty obvious, but actually, i'd argue that most of us are missing the point.\n\nwhen we consistently project the past into our current experiences, we rob ourselves and everyone around us of the chance to be present, now. it also means we condemn the future to be a continuation of the past. sounds harsh, huh? maybe it is. but it's true, and this destructive way to thinking is ubiquitous.\n\nat some point, we all have the chance to accept things in our lives simply as they are. this includes our own human failings, the mistakes and foibles of those we love, the tragedies we've survived and, yes, the suffering we've somehow caused. the past is past. all of it. whatever happened back then, happened already. yes, it brings us to where we are in our lives now, but we can't really be who we are right now if we let the past define us. this means, we miss out on just about everything.\n\nover the holidays, did you encounter any of these (or similar) scenarios:\n\nyour loved one was more interested in reliving past failures than noticing how you've changed your present perspective?\n\nyou were so busy being angry at a perceived slight from the past that you lost the fleeting chance to make a precious connection?\n\nyou were so involved with your own personal history that you left no room for anyone else's story, and lost the possibility on any authentic human exchange?\n\nyour version and interpretation of another person's past actions precluded you from experiencing any possibility of a different interaction, and so you don't actually know what might have happened... had you let it?\n\ndespite all your hopes for a better experience, relationship, reunion (etc.) nothing changes, because deep down you can't imagine what or how change could actually be?\n\ndo i sound angry? i am. but it's a righteous anger for all those who strive to show up in the current moment, fresh, carrying opportunity, vulnerable... and who are slapped hard in the face with other people's old hurts and hatreds.\n\nlet me be clear, i am not diminishing or dismissing anything: tragic or triumphant, painful or ecstatic. we are always accountable for our actions (constructive and destructive), and yes even our unspoken thoughts. there's no undoing what's already been done - but there is no need to continue redoing it (whatever it is)... especially when it causes suffering.\n\nthe bottom line is simple: this instant, right now, is all we can ever really have. this is the lesson of mindfulness: to be compassionate, aware and open. it is also the wisdom of all the world's great wisdom traditions.\n\ntry to hold your knowledge of the past in one hand, but allow the other to open so you invite the present and touch what's here, now. this stance bridges the present and future, because we reach out open-handed.\n\nin contrast, if you clench your fists out of a pain-filled past, you will become fatigued with living or worse, you will strike someone in the present and cause more pain. or, if you forever hold back, you can never touch what's right here. neither of these options work. we all know this, but few of us dare to look at our own hands
dear alive one,\n\n\n\ni know you just want to get through this time. but i want you to woo this time. don't rush. take your time because nothing that is yours is a matter of harried timing. it's going to work out. it always does in its own inexplicable way. and everything occurs in its own right hour; you simply can't breach the laws of reality.\n\n\n\ni am proud of you. you will make all the decisions that are right for you. and you will make new ones on the spot with new information. as you create this life, you will have a thousand chances. this isn't a multiple-choice exam in which you can fail. take your time. slog through whatever you need to go through in order to grow, even if it feels like cement. you are being given this chance. and it is a worthy one, followed by nothing but more avenues for your good. there is no scarcity of opportunity.\n\n\n\ndiscover by following your desire, even if that desire is faint or seems as likely as a chocolate factory, or maybe the easter bunny himself, in the middle of the desert. it's real. it's there for a reason. use desire as a compass, and do not concern yourself with how it could ever happen. if you really want to grow and experience all that life can offer you, let go of calculation. this is a path of revelation. it's the journey of becoming who you did not know you could become.\n\n\n\nthe censoring voice that tells you that you only have one chance to get this right is a voice of smallness and powerlessness. it's got sour dinosaur breath—it's of the old regime. it's the voice of limitation, asking you to deny your birthright of choice and possibility. it only has one agenda, the agenda to make you wrong. really, do you think any voice is protecting you by shaming and threatening you? any advice that limits your spirit is not advice. it's damnation.\n\n\n\ni am here to tell you that you are made of astonishment. you are finding your way, even when you are losing it. you may feel as though you're struggling or lost. you may ache for resolution, because it's human nature to want to skip steps and watch netflix. but here's what i want you to know. it is working out right now. that's the nature of life. it works out. a spiritual journey happens when we open our eyes to see it this way, no matter what. you are learning to tune in to the signal that will take you all the way; you are learning to listen to nothing in this life but that which strengthens you.\n\n\n\nso, will you—right now—thank yourself for everything, everything, everything, and i mean everything, past, present, and to come, no matter what? now, that's a viable prayer. you can decide right now how you will view this time of uncertainty. you may not be able to choose different circumstances. but you can choose to thrive in every circumstance. this isn't positive thinking. this is positive incarnation. it's your minutes on earth. it's your melody. and it's your choice how you play the song.\n\n\n\nbesides, there are an exponential number of outcomes that will help you thrive. there is no outcome that will not gift you. you bring the light with you. you're the homecoming queen or king thinking you need to win the school's election. you've already won. you're already chosen. it's already done. the whole world is simply waiting for you to choose yourself and the perspective that most sets you free. it will wait forever with bated breath. you are that valuable and necessary. we all are.\n\n\n\nno matter where you find yourself, you can always choose again. as long as you have breath, you can start over. there is no complexity except in the mind. there is only this simple moment. there is no promise in the distance. the promise is here. it's everywhere. if you are feeling lack, it is because you are not appreciating yourself and your journey. you are not forgiving yourself for things you imagine you should have done or been.\n\n\n\nchoose to be here. know that this moment in your life has a purpose and that this purpose is essential to your deepest happiness. this is a choice of mental focus that activates the power of the mystery. you're not thwarted or in a maze. you will be in amazement when you realize your freedom to choose how extraordinary you truly are.\n\n\n\ndo take in the privilege of being alive and having choices, drama and desires. there are those who are dying right now. they would give anything to be where you are.\n\n\n\nand there are others who would give anything to have your problems. they ache to have the chance you have right now. and there are others, still, who are fondly looking back on times in their lives when they stood where you stand right now. the times you are trying to run from, some say, were the best in all their lives.\n\n\n\nacknowledge your courage. it is not easy to be born strong and to crave higher ground. you may feel as though you're lacking. but truly, it's because you're burning to be who you really are. you have a bird of passage within you. you would never be happy at the end of your days having played it bulletproof safe, never knowing where your expression could have gone—especially because you do know deep down where the power of love is meant to take you.\n\n\n\nof course you're frightened—but you didn't come into this lifetime to avoid desire and risk and get to the finish line without a smudge, a scar or a difference in your point of view. you want to have put everything into it. you won't look back and wish you'd given up. you won't wish you'd sat it out and watched others on television live fascinating lives. you wanted to get wet. you wanted to know. you did know.\n\n\n\nyes, dear one, it's good to be afraid. it's important that you're living a life that matters.
peopleimages via getty images\n\naccording to a new gallup report released on wednesday, women in committed heterosexual relationships are as likely as their partners to work outside the home, and yet they're still more likely to do more work at home, too. women are more likely to clean the house, prepare meals and care for children on a daily basis, gallup said. and women report they're doing more of the cognitive household stuff as well, like anticipating needs (e.g., buying and switching out clothing) and making decisions.\n\nof course, being the so-called default parent isn't really a problem unless it's a problem for the person doing all that work, whether they're in a same-sex relationship, divorced co-parents, or something else. but when the weight of it all — the scheduling of doctor's appointments and playdates, the cooking, the remembering which kid likes what and who has a big math project due tomorrow, and on and on — begins to crush one parent, it's time for a change.\n\nso how do you start offloading some of your emotional labor as a parent? and how do you make big changes without starting big fights? here are five expert tips on making it happen.\n\none note: emotional labor has been a big buzzword in recent years, and there's some confusion about what it actually means. some people use it to refer broadly to the silent, unpaid work done to keep households and families humming. others — including the sociologist who coined the term — say we should stick more to its original meaning of needing to suppress your emotions while doing your paid job. we're using it pretty loosely and interchangeably here with the idea of being the default parent.\n\n1. to start, ditch the idea of a 50/50 partnership.\n\nconversations around fairness at home are often predicated on the idea that a 50/50 split is fair. and anything short of that kind of perfect split means one parent is being saddled with too much. but eve rodsky, a lawyer, mother and author of fair play — a book that helps couples divvy up domestic responsibilities — says 50/50 is basically bs.\n\nwhat is fair is not always equal, and what is equal is not always fair, rodsky told huffpost. throw out 50/50.\n\nif you have, say, 100 different household and child-related tasks that have to get done in any given week, it's hiiiiighly unlikely that one of you will take 50 and the other will take 50, and voila! what you need to do is sit down and proactively divide up tasks, really specifically spelling out what needs to get done and who is going to do it. like: you will own taking out the garbage and i will own getting the kids out the door in the morning.\n\n2. have those conversations about who owns what task when you're calm.\n\nconversations around resentment and domestic life tend to happen in the heat of the moment, says rachel sussman, a new york-based therapist and author of the breakup bible: the smart woman's guide to healing from a breakup or divorce. but that's the worst time and way to do it.\n\nyou definitely want to approach it when you're both calm, and you want to do it as soon as you realize you've started building up feelings of resentment, sussman said.\n\ntry not to frame your points as complaints. instead, frame them as observations — like, hey, i've noticed that i am doing a lot more of xyz and it is taking a lot out of me. and i'm wondering if you have noticed that too? i statements instead of you statements can also be helpful, according to sussman.\n\nrodsky recommends weekly 20-minute check-ins. you can communicate about your domestic life, she said. you can give feedback to each other when emotions are low and cognition is high. maybe you do it over tacos and tequila, rodsky said. maybe it's while you take a run together, or are just sitting for a few minutes on the couch at home. just set a time and commit to it.\n\nownership of a particular task means remembering it, planning for it, then following through — without needing to be reminded.\n\n3. establish that if you own a task, you own it from start to finish.\n\nhaving to remind your partner to do something doesn't take that something off your list. it adds to it, rodsky wrote in fair play. which is why it's so important that when you divvy up tasks again, you set the ground rule that ownership of a particular task means remembering it, planning for it, then following through — without needing to be reminded.\n\ntoo often, conflict arises when the partner who supposedly owns a task steps in only at the execution phase, foisting all of the mental load on the default parent. so if it's your job to bring oranges for halftime at your kid's soccer game, then it's on you to remember when the game is. it's on you to plan when you're going to get the oranges and get them ready without asking for guidance on how many or how they should be cut or transported to the game. and it's on you to make sure they're actually there on time — without your partner checking in on you.\n\n4. embrace a minimum standard of care.\n\ncouples often argue not just about what needs to get done, but also how it should be done — as if there is some kind of universal standard. but the way you'd do something is not necessarily the right way. nor should partners be let off the hook for taking on a task, then doing a truly crappy job at it.\n\nif you're going to try and swap tasks or lessen your load, it's important to first agree to what rodsky calls a minimum standard of care for that particular act. would a reasonable person, under similar circumstances, do the task in roughly the same way as you? she asks. if yes, great! you've met the minimum standard of care. if not, you haven't really done it.

jamie schwaberow/getty images quarterback trevor lawrence celebrates after his clemson tigers defeated the alabama crimson tide for college football's national championship on jan. 7. he and his teammates aren't paid for their efforts.\n\nit might be hard to tell from reading my column, but i love sports. too much, even. it's why i spend so much of my time watching, thinking, writing about and critiquing them. but i take a tough love approach. sports are a reflection of our greater culture and so, as with any part of our culture, they are rife with problems like racism, homophobia and transphobia, sexism, classism, etc.\n\nat the same time, the focus on sports in our society means they can be a site where we work on some of these problems. changes on the field, court or pitch can reverberate back into society for the better. that is why it is important that those of us who love sports do not do so uncritically.\n\nand so, at this time in the calendar year when we look ahead and make wishes for our lives that we then hope to implement, here is what i hope sports does better in 2019:\n\nit's time to pay college players\n\nit's time to pay college athletes for their work. amateurism does not create parity in sport. it is not a benefit to the student-athletes. it is exploitative at its core and so is not the feel-good moral or ethical position so many people wish it to be.\n\nthe ncaa rakes in over a billion dollars (that's with a b!) every year. coaches of big-time college sports make millions of dollars (with additional bonuses when their players do well on the field or in the classroom), which connecticut sen. chris murphy called immoral late last year.\n\npeople who oppose the idea of paying student-athletes (a group that just so happens to be mainly white people) argue that these kids are getting free college educations and those are very expensive these days, so they don't deserve any additional compensation. but this comes with caveats, too. not only do some schools create paper classes (classes that exist only on paper) to keep student-athletes eligible to play, but black student-athletes, who make up the majority of the teams that actually generate revenue for their schools, are less likely than their white counterparts or other black students at their schools to obtain degrees.\n\nso what exactly are they really getting out of their free labor?\n\nassociated press clemson defensive lineman christian wilkins kisses the trophy after winning the championship monday night.\n\nvictoria jackson, a sports historian at arizona state university and a former ncaa champion runner, argues that giving student-athletes lifetime scholarships ― allowing them to complete their degree at any time ― would, in part, address this problem and would finally, finally, finally acknowledge that the current system of going to school while playing a sport on a professional level is a bad one.\n\njournalist patrick hruby has made a strong case that the answer is to simply pay the players. we live in a capitalistic society that has figured out how to pay people in a whole host of other scenarios. certainly we can figure this one out, too.\n\nbut if you need incremental change, follow the olympic model of allowing players to make money off their own likenesses, give them lifelong health insurance to compensate them for the long-term detriments to their bodies and brains, or put a salary cap on the whole thing.\n\nthere are a lot of ideas here. let's start implementing them.\n\nit's time to really invest in women's sports\n\nmy hope this year is that not only will more fans turn up in person and even more watch/stream women's games, but that sports media will make more space for them. 2019 is the year of the women's world cup, and so a perfect time to focus on embracing women's sports.\n\nwe are already in the middle of an exciting women's collegiate basketball season. there's never been more parity in the game. the university of connecticut looked mortal last week when they lost at baylor 68-57, the huskies' first regular-season loss since november 2014, snapping a 126-game streak. and that parity feeds up to a stacked wnba, which saw one of its strongest rookie classes ever last year, plus a season where postseason slots were decided in the final games of the regular season and where the semifinal matchups both went to five games in their best-of-five series. this can only mean great things for the 2019 season.\n\nmore sports fans like me must speak up and hold their favorite teams and players accountable. the more of us there are, the more rapidly things will change.\n\nunfortunately, the ncaa volleyball season is over but put it on your calendar now to check it out in the fall.\n\ni also want leagues and organizations to invest more resources throughout those communities and countries where girls and women have poor or simply less access to sport. i will die on this hill of pushing women's sports and i invite you onto the hill with me in 2019.\n\nit's time to be better fans\n\nwhile there are plenty of other things i could wish for this year (i.e., sports teams and related organizations improving their response to reports of gendered violence, or sports media diversifying who covers this beat and which teams or stories they follow), i have one last big hope ― this one directed at other fans. we, as a group, gotta do better.\n\nlook, i know that sports would be more fun if you never had to think about its seedy underbelly of sexual abuse, domestic violence, wage disparity, racism, homophobic taunts, terrible team names, i could go on. but for so many of us, there's no choice. the issues we face in our everyday lives also appear on the field, pitch or court.\n\nthe best way to deal with this is not to ignore it; these problems and those advocating for change are not going away. ignoring them simply leaves you morally bankrupt in pursuit of selfish enjoyment.\n\nso, for 2019, i propose that you embrace being the loud-mouth fan in the stands and in life. i want more sports fans like me to speak up and hold their favorite teams and players accountable. the more of us there are, the more rapidly things will change. let's make sports more and more enjoyable for more and more people, and let's do it sooner rather than later.\n\nhere's to 2019 and loving sports even more than we do now!\n\njessica luther is a freelance journalist, an author and a co-host of the feminist sports podcast burn it all down.
chances are, you throw compliments around pretty freely on any given day. maybe you like a co-worker's shoes, or a friend's particularly adorable photo on instagram. but what we take for granted is the lasting effect a compliment can have on someone's ideas about self-love.\n\ncovet, a fashion-focused video game in which users complete style challenges, debuted 50 new digital models of all different sizes, shapes, heights, skin colors and facial features on tuesday. in conjunction with the launch, covet has released a video titled a beautiful perspective: how compliments can empower.\n\ncovet covet's new model options for its style challenges.\n\nin the video, three covet users are interviewed about their own views of themselves and the insecurities they face ― and it's all too familiar to anyone who owns a mirror.\n\nit takes more than a dress or a different hairstyle to change the way you feel about yourself, samantha said.\n\nbut after receiving makeovers, the three women are introduced to three other women who, according to the video, got to know them and shared what they saw.\n\nslowly but surely, you can see the women's attitudes and emotions changing as they hear things like, you're very beautiful and you really do brighten the room up. it is a truly beautiful shift that, by the end, has you wanting to compliment just about everyone ― which it then challenges us all to do.
when joelle casteix heard pope francis accuse sex abuse victims in chile of slander, the pontiff's words hit close to home.\n\nfrancis told reporters thursday that he hasn't seen any convincing evidence against chile's bishop juan barros madrid, whom victims claim protected a pedophile priest.\n\nthe day someone brings me proof against bishop barros, then i will talk, francis said during a papal trip to chile, according to the new york times. but there is not one single piece of evidence. it is all slander. is that clear?\n\ncasteix, a california native and advocate for abuse victims, knows what it's like to share a vulnerable story of sexual abuse and to have that story questioned. she is herself a survivor of abuse within the roman catholic church. from 1986 to 1988, she was abused by a choir director at santa ana's mater dei high school, in the roman catholic diocese of orange. by the time the abuse ended, she said, the teacher had left her pregnant and with a sexually transmitted disease. she was only 17.\n\nit was proof of what she'd been saying all along ― that church officials knew about abuse taking place in the diocese and didn't do enough to protect victims.\n\ngiven this history with the church, it's not hard to understand why casteix's voice sharpened as she spoke to huffpost about francis' attack on abuse victims in chile.\n\nevery abuser says to his victim: you have no proof. no one is going to believe you, said castiex, now an activist with survivors network of those abused by priests (snap). what pope francis did was put himself in the abuser's seat, in the power position.\n\nwhat he's doing is revictimizing every single child victim and putting himself in the abuser's shoes.\n\nhenry romero / reuters pope francis speaks with members of peruvian indigenous groups in puerto maldonado, peru, on jan. 19. it's the final leg of what has been a tense and controversial papal trip to south america.\n\nunabashed support for a controversial bishop\n\nfrancis' comments about barros came at the end of a papal trip to chile that was already fraught with tensions.\n\nchilean abuse victims and their allies have been upset about the pope's continued defense of barros. several victims claim that barros covered up and, in some instances, observed abuse carried out by his mentor, rev. fernando karadima.\n\nthe vatican convicted karadima of abusing teenage boys in 2011 and sent him to live a cloistered life of penitence and prayer in a chilean convent. a judge found the allegations against karadima to be truthful and reliable but dismissed a criminal case against the priest because the statute of limitations had expired.\n\nbarros denied having any knowledge of karadima's abusive actions ― and it appears that francis still believes him.\n\nvladimir rodas/afp via getty images chilean priest fernando karadima leaves a courtroom in santiago, chile, on nov. 11, 2015.\n\nin 2015, the pope appointed barros as bishop of osorno, in southern chile. politicians and even some church leaders in the country vocally opposed the move and called for barros to resign.\n\nthat same year, francis was captured on video telling a group of tourists at vatican city that people in osorno who protested barros' appointment were dumb and judging a bishop without any proof.\n\nfrancis' trip to chile this week was marred by street protests and the burning of nearly a dozen churches as people voiced frustration with how the church is handling the clergy sex abuse scandal.\n\non tuesday, francis expressed pain and shame over the abuse scandal and begged for victims' forgiveness. he met and reportedly wept with chilean survivors of abuse, the associated press reported.\n\nbut he has also continued to show support for barros. the new york times reported that the bishop participated in the pope's ceremonies in the cities of santiago, iquique and temuco.\n\nbarros told reporters that the pope offered him words of support and affection during the visit.\n\ncarlos gutierrez / reuters bishop juan barros, center, attends his first religious service as citizens protest at the osorno cathedral south of santiago on march 21, 2015.\n\nwords versus action on preventing sexual abuse\n\nin the past, francis has shown signs that he's willing and ready to take serious steps to confront the problem of sexual abuse in the church. still, some victims' advocates are worried that the vatican is not moving quickly to keep kids safe.\n\nin december 2013, victims' groups rejoiced when francis decided to assemble a vatican committee dedicated solely to fighting child sex abuse in the church. the group, the pontifical commission for the protection of minors, initially included two survivors of clergy sex abuse.\n\nin 2017, one of those survivors, irish activist marie collins, announced that she was stepping down out of frustration with vatican bureaucracy. in an opinion piece for the national catholic reporter, collins wrote about facing a number of stumbling blocks, including a lack of resources and the resistance of some in the vatican curia toward implementing the commission's recommendations.\n\nthe last straw for her was the refusal of a group at the vatican to ensure that all letters from victims received a response.\n\ni find it impossible to listen to public statements about the deep concern in the church for the care of those whose lives have been blighted by abuse, yet to watch privately as a congregation in the vatican refuses to even acknowledge their letters! collins wrote last march. it is a reflection of how this whole abuse crisis in the church has been handled: with fine words in public and contrary actions behind closed doors.\n\ntiziana fabi via getty images irish activist marie collins attends a news conference on may 3, 2014, at the vatican. she criticized the vatican's fine words in public and contrary actions behind closed doors.\n\nin december, all of the commission members' terms formally expired and the initiative's future is unclear.\n\nsecular groups have also delved into the problem of sexual abuse in the catholic church. in december, the australian government concluded an extensive, multi-year inquiry into sexual abuse of children in the country. the commission's final report found that 59 percent of the more than 8,000 survivors interviewed said they were sexually abused in an institution managed by a religious organization. about 62 percent of that group said that the institution was managed by the catholic church.\n\nthe commission came up with a number of recommendations for the church. it urged the church to end the secrecy of the confessional when it prevents or discourages compliance with mandatory reporting laws. the commission also asked the church to rethink the requirement of priestly celibacy, which, while not a direct cause, elevated the risk of abuse.\n\nmelbourne's archbishop has dismissed both of those recommendations, since they involve changes to longstanding church tradition.\n\nbut kieran tapsell, a retired civil lawyer who submitted a paper on canon law to the commission, believes there are many other recommendations the commission made that could be put into practice ― such as ensuring there's no statute of limitations for canonical trials and requiring vatican congregations and courts to publish reasons for their disciplinary decisions.\n\n″[these] recommendations had more to do with church law and practice, and could be more easily implemented, if church leadership is willing to take up this challenge, tapsell wrote in an analysis for the national catholic reporter.\n\nbut, as demonstrated in chile, much of that change starts with the pope.\n\nthe president of the chilean bishops' conference, monsignor santiago silva, told the new york times on friday that it would continue to support barros ― trusting in francis' opinion of the bishop.\n\nthe pope told us what he wants, and he wants monsignor barros to continue, silva said.\n\neitan abramovich via getty images demonstrators protest at the arrival of pope francis in santiago, chile, on jan. 15.\n\nbacklash in chile and across the globe\n\nin chile and around the world, francis' remarks in defense of barros have caused outrage among survivors of clergy abuse.\n\njuan carlos cruz, one of karadima's most vocal victims, was particularly unnerved by francis' demand for proof that barros had been complicit in the abuse.\n\nas if i could have taken a selfie or photo while karadima abused me and others with juan barros standing next to him watching everything, cruz wrote on twitter, according to a bbc translation.\n\nthese people are absolutely crazy, and [the pope] is talking about reparation to the victims. nothing has changed, and his plea for forgiveness is empty.\n\npatrick noaker, a lawyer who has represented dozens survivors of sexual abuse in minnesota, said that cruz's testimony appears to him to be extremely powerful. that's because when it comes to child sexual abuse, there is rarely evidence outside the testimony of the victim.\n\nfrancis' defense of barros is a reminder to noaker that bishops are the princes of the catholic church, and they are protected at all cost.\n\nthe statement by the pope reveals a hard-liner position that he will protect bishops over children, he told huffpost in an email. this will discourage survivors of sexual abuse from reporting their abuse because they will not have photographs or other evidence of the abuse outside of their testimony.\n\nother advocates for abuse survivors have the same fear that victims will be afraid to come forward with their stories. anne barrett doyle, co-director of the online database bishopaccountability.org, called francis' attack on the chilean sex abuse survivors a stunning setback.\n\nthe burden of proof here rests with the church, not with victims ― and especially not with victims whose veracity already has been affirmed, doyle said in a statement. exhaustive investigations by both church and civil authorities proved the allegations of juan carlos cruz [and others] in regards to karadima. a reasonable person would consider that they are telling the truth about barros also.\n\nwho knows how many victims now will decide to stay hidden, for fear they too will be attacked as slanderers? she added.\n\ndavid greenwood, a volunteer lawyer with the british advocacy group ministry and clergy sexual abuse survivors, echoed doyle and noaker's concerns.\n\nfor the pope to be deliberately confrontational and challenging in this way will prevent survivors coming forward to share their ordeals, greenwood told huffpost in an email.\n\nnurphoto via getty images police officers confront a demonstrator during a protest against pope francis in santiago on tuesday.\n\nthe church's handling of the abuse scandal in chile has disillusioned many of the country's catholics. a survey by the regional polling firm latinobarometro found that only 42 percent of chilean catholics approved of the job francis is doing, compared with an average of 68 percent for 18 other central and south american countries.\n\ncasteix told huffpost that, in her view, there's nothing the pope can do now to prove that his apologies to sex abuse victims are meaningful.\n\nit is as

one of the largest grocery chains in the u.s. has decided to end much of its in-house delivery service, outsourcing the work to third-party companies like doordash that rely on independent contractors to drop off food to customers on the cheap.\n\nunions representing workers at albertsons say the chain's decision will end up degrading good delivery jobs by putting the work on a gig model. independent contractors tend to bear many of the costs of employment, providing their own vehicles and covering wear and tear, while forgoing traditional work benefits like health coverage and a retirement fund.\n\nalbertsons told huffpost that doordash was one of several third-party companies that the grocer would shift the work toward, to compete in the growing home delivery market more effectively. the company said it's e-commerce business has exploded during the pandemic.\n\nwhile we know that this move will help us create a more efficient operation, it wasn't a decision we made lightly or without a great deal of consideration, an albertsons spokesperson said in an email.\n\nwhile albertsons did not cite the new california law known as proposition 22 for the decision, several major california markets will be impacted by the policy change. prop 22 makes it easier for companies like doordash to classify their drivers as independent contractors.\n\nthe change is scheduled to take effect on feb. 27.\n\nthe decision by albertsons was first reported by knockla, which said that albertsons chains vons and pavilions would be firing union workers. but albertsons said it would be offering the affected drivers other positions within stores and warehouses, and both albertsons and union representatives said jobs under union contracts would not be impacted by the change.\n\nfor all our nonunion drivers who can't bargain, it's really messed up. jim araby, ufcw western states council\n\nthe united food and commercial workers union condemned the move by albertsons. jim araby, director of ufcw's western states council, said his union represents around 250 drivers in california's bay area who work for albertsons subsidiary safeway. those drivers organized about two years ago and are in the process of securing their first contract; their jobs will not change as a result of the new arrangement at albertsons.\n\naraby said third-party delivery services appeal to companies like albertsons because another company has to worry about the fleet and the logistics of employment: you don't have to maintain the truck, you don't have to worry about accidents and all that goes with that. and the third-party companies ultimately don't have to worry about much of that either, because everyone is using their own cars.\n\naccording to araby, both ufcw and the teamsters represent in-house drivers at albertsons, but only a small share of the overall workforce. he said even though union drivers would not be impacted by the change, he believes grocers' increasing reliance on companies like doordash will imperil more in-house jobs over time.\n\ngeri lavrov via getty images an albertsons store in buellton, california.\n\nand for all our nonunion drivers who can't bargain, it's really messed up, araby said. i think it's an example of corporate greed.\n\nhe said his union is considering filing a grievance, believing the change may run afoul of provisions it has bargained related to subcontracting.\n\nalbertsons declined to say how many positions would ultimately be eliminated, but that it plan[s] to offer positions to each impacted associate. those who don't accept the transfer may be eligible for severance pay: we will work with them on their individual situation.\n\nthe move comes against the backdrop of prop 22. in 2019, california passed a law known as assembly bill 5 making it harder for gig companies to classify workers as independent contractors rather than employees. prop 22, which voters passed in november, excluded app-based drivers from the earlier law, protecting the contractor system at companies like uber, lyft and doordash.\n\nthose companies spent heavily to get the measure passed. unions and their allies on the left viewed the success of prop 22 as a major setback in their fight with silicon valley and the growth of the contract workforce.\n\nadan alvarez, a spokesperson for teamsters local 396, called the decision by albertsons a natural response to prop 22, now that the gig model is secure in the state among food delivery drivers. his union represents employees working out of albertsons warehouses in southern california. although no teamsters will lose their jobs, he said he expects the new jobs to be less stable than the ones being eliminated.\n\nthis is an example of what we predicted. it's giving companies an open door to chip away at employee-based jobs, alvarez said. these [albertsons] employees, they weren't unionized. but they were still employees with wages and benefits.
kevin frayer via getty images workers from wuhan guangsheng photovoltaic company install solar panels on the roof of a building in wuhan, china. in august, china announced it had already eclipsed its 2020 goal in solar installations.\n\nin november 2013, more than 15,000 scientists reissued a warning to humanity of widespread misery and catastrophic biodiversity loss unless business-as-usual changed. by failing to adequately limit population growth, reassess the role of an economy rooted in growth, reduce greenhouse gases, incentivize renewable energy, protect habitat, restore ecosystems, curb pollution, halt defaunation, and constrain invasive alien species, humanity is not taking the urgent steps needed to safeguard our imperilled biosphere, they wrote.\n\nformer un climate chief christiana figueres and physicist stefan rahmstorf last year warned that the world has approximately three years before the worst effects of climate change become inevitable. in an open letter they urged companies, communities, countries and citizens to cut carbon emissions now, arguing that failure means fires, floods, droughts, rising sea levels, extreme weather, agricultural losses and massive insurance costs. between 2008 and 2016, climate related disasters displaced 21.5 million people.\n\nhumanity is in a horse race with catastrophe. the good news is that we are in the race. but even if we win, it will change our economy beyond recognition.\n\nwe have the technologies to solve the worst of the crises facing us, and buy the time to deal with the rest. back in 2009, stanford scientist dr. mark jacobson said that renewable energy could power the entire world by 2030. his solutions project calculated how to do this for every state in the u.s. and many countries. more recently, scholars like christian breyer have shown how to do this with photovoltaics alone.\n\nstanford professor tony seba argues that not only is the transition to renewables possible, it is inevitable.\n\nin his book clean disruption seba describes how the convergence of disruptive technologies and business models makes a renewable world inevitable. he focuses on four factors: the fall in the cost of solar energy, the fall in the cost of storage (batteries), the rise of the electric vehicle, and the advent of the driverless car.\n\nthese innovations, he argues, by delivering renewably powered, electric vehicle transit as a service will be ten times cheaper than current private ownership of internal combustion cars. in the process, the shift to evs will move us to a completely renewable energy system.\n\nhe reminds doubters that experts totally underestimated sales of mobile phones. in the 1990s, mckinsey told att to expect 900,000 mobile subscribers by the year 2000. they were off by 108 million. by 2014 there were more mobile phones on earth than the seven billion people, increasing five times faster than humans.\n\nwhen the kentucky coal museum puts solar on its roof rather than plug into the coal fired electric grid at its doorstep, you know that the fossil era is over\n\na new solar array goes up in the u.s. every 150 seconds, but can the whole world be renewable by 2030?\n\nwhy? because the cost of solar is falling rapidly. in october saudi arabia announced the new world record low price in an auction bid: 1.7¢/kwh. when the kentucky coal museum puts solar on its roof rather than plug into the coal fired electric grid at its doorstep, you know that the fossil era is over.\n\nso we can run our society on solar energy, but what if the sun isn't shining or the wind blowing?\n\nstorage technology to make renewable energy available 24/7 is only in its infancy as an industry, but its prices are falling, too.\n\nwhen the aliso canyon natural gas well blew out, spewing 100,000 metric tons of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, the local utility feared it would be unable to keep lights on in southern california. in record time, tesla and others brought online more than 70 megawatts of energy storage at a price cheaper than building a new gas peaking plant, and vastly faster.\n\nin late 2016 the financial times reported that fitch ratings warned: widespread adoption of battery-powered vehicles is a serious threat to the oil industry, noting that transport accounted for 55 percent of total oil use in 2014. in the u.s. it accounted for 71 percent of oil use, according to 2016 figures.\n\nit endangers the banks, as well: a quarter of all corporate debt, perhaps as much as $3.4 trillion, is related to utility and car company bonds that are tied to fossil fuel use.\n\nanyone doubting this risk must have been sobered when, in september 2017, china announced it was going to phase out internal combustion vehicles. given that china represents a quarter of the global automobile market, this – coupled with india, france, the uk, and norway making similar announcements – is an existential crisis for both the oil and car industries.\n\nabout a week after china's announcement, jerry brown, the governor of california, the world's fifth largest economy, asked mary nichols, head of the state's air resources board, whether california could do the same. two days later she said yes. two days later jerry said then we will. that was a friday.\n\non the monday, general motors, which had reclaimed its coveted status of the world's leading automobile manufacturer on the strength of its bolt electric car, announced that its future is electric. meanwhile, daimler, volkswagen and volvo have committed to electrifying their entire product portfolios.\n\njosh lefkowitz via getty images the chevrolet bolt ev.\n\nin november, elon released an all-electric long haul truck, and china announced the launch of the world's first all-electric cargo ship.\n\nwe're three for three on seba's predictions. but in seba's scenario it's the autonomous electric vehicle (aev) that drives the real reduction in cost he claims will make the disruption inevitable. are aevs more than just science fiction?\n\nto get the straight story, i talked to tom chi, the head of product experience at google x and one of the designers of the self-driving google car.\n\nwithin ten years? asked tom. easy. tesla, he said, released its driverless vehicle when it was as safe as a human driven car. remember, hundreds of thousands of people die every year in car crashes. teslas have driven more than 5 billion miles in autonomous mode, en route to the company's 10 billion mile safety proof point. in fact, all teslas are now capable of full autonomous mode. the google car has driven four million real miles, and 2.5 billion simulated miles. gm just announced that it is pivoting its business model to offer autonomous electric vehicle transit as a service by 2019.\n\ndoes that make it four for four? is tony right?\n\nyou decide. but realize that if the evidence laid out here is true, it has profound implications for everything. it will mean the dissolution in value, likely complete loss of the oil, gas, coal, uranium, nuclear, utility, auto industries, the banks that hold the loan paper for all of these companies and the pension funds and insurance companies that are invested in them.\n\nit will mean an economic collapse on a scale never seen coming at us within about 10 years.\n\nconsider oil. in 2011, carbon tracker calculated that at least 80 percent of the fossil deposits still in the ground would have to stay in the ground if the world is to avoid warming beyond 2c more that pre-industrial levels.\n\ngiven that those fossil assets are on the balance sheets of some of the world's wealthiest companies and form the basis of the sovereign wealth funds of many nations around the world, john fullerton of the capital institute predicted that this implied a write-off of at least $20 trillion dollars. in contrast, fullerton warned, the 2008 financial collapse was triggered by the stranding of only $2.7 trillion in mortgage assets.\n\nwhat can be done?\n\nit appears unwise to have any of your assets in the industries that will be disrupted. bevis longstreth, former securities and exchange commissioner, observed: it is entirely plausible, even predictable, that continuing to hold equities in fossil fuel companies will be ruled negligence.\n\nwhere does your energy come from? are you dependent on an industry that is at risk? millions of people, communities and cities are going 100 percent renewable.\n\nis your job at risk? companies will either become part of the solution, or they won't be a problem because they won't be around. the emerging industries are creating millions of jobs, but millions are at risk. will we substitute a universal basic income? will we descend into unimaginable darkness? or will we create a finer future?\n\neither way, we will totally transform the global economy. the crises we face and the inevitabilities of change described here will drive this change.\n\nfor more content and to be part of huffpost's new economy community join our facebook group.
atlanta (ap) — georgia voters are deciding the balance of power in congress in a pair of high-stakes senate runoff elections that will help determine president-elect joe biden's ability to enact what could be the most progressive governing agenda in generations.\n\nrepublicans are unified against biden's plans for health care, environmental protection and civil rights, but some fear that outgoing president donald trump's brazen attempts to undermine the integrity of the nation's voting systems may discourage voters in georgia.\n\nat a rally in northwest georgia on the eve of tuesday's runoffs, trump repeatedly declared that the november elections were plagued by fraud that republican officials, including his former attorney general and georgia's elections chief, say did not occur. at the same time, trump encouraged his supporters to show up in force for georgia's tuesday contests.\n\nyou've got to swarm it tomorrow, trump told thousands of cheering supporters, downplaying the threat of fraud.\n\nmandel ngan via getty images republican incumbent senator kelly loeffler speaks as president donald trump listens during a rally in support of republican incumbent senators kelly loeffler and david perdue ahead of senate runoff at dalton regional airport, georgia on january 4, 2021.

(photo by jim watson/afp via getty images)\n\neven a closely divided democratic senate wouldn't guarantee biden everything he wants, given chamber rules that require 60 votes to move most major legislation. but if democrats lose even one of tuesday's contests, biden would have little shot for swift up-or-down votes on his most ambitious plans to expand government-backed health care coverage, strengthen the middle class, address racial inequality and combat climate change. a republican-controlled senate also would create a rougher path for biden's cabinet picks and judicial nominees.\n\ngeorgia, the whole nation is looking to you. the power is literally in your hands, biden declared at his own rally in atlanta on monday. one state can chart the course, not just for the next four years, but for the next generation.\n\ndespite fears among some republicans that trump's baseless claims of voter fraud could depress turnout, the two gop candidates strongly support him. perdue on tuesday said that trump would of course deserve credit if the republicans won.\n\nwhat the president said last night is, even if you are upset about all of that, you've got to stand up with us and fight, perdue told fox & friends. we'll look back on this day if we don't vote and really rue the day that we turned the keys to the kingdom over to the democrats.\n\nloeffler pledged monday to join a small but growing number of gop senators protesting congress' expected certification of biden's victory wednesday.\n\nmegan varner via getty images voters stand in line before the doors open at cobb county community center on january 5, 2021 in atlanta, georgia.

update: prime minister justin trudeau and u.s. president donald trump announced on wednesday march 19, 2020 that the canada-u.s. border will be temporarily closed to help slow the spread of covid-19. more details here.\n\nottawa — the federal government is retooling messaging for travellers arriving in canada amid criticism that it's not doing enough to ensure thousands of people entering the country don't drive a national spike in covid-19 cases.\n\nbut even as border officials are updating signs and pamphlets in order to ensure everyone coming in goes into self-isolation, prime minister justin trudeau said sunday the question of whether to close the border overall remains up for discussion.\n\nhundreds of canadians are on their way back to canada as the novel coronavirus continues its global march, its epicentre now in europe where borders are closing, flights are being cancelled and entire towns are being ordered into seclusion to control the spread of the illness.\n\nthe canadian press prime minister justin trudeau holds a news conference at rideau cottage in ottawa on friday.\n\non saturday, the federal government had urged travelling canadians to return home while they still had the chance, but the liberal government continues to face pressure to close canada off as well from the outside world.\n\ntrudeau said sunday that what decisions his cabinet will make will be guided by science.\n\nand canada's top public health official said what the science shows at the moment is that closing borders didn't work for other countries, and what's more important is how the society works together.\n\nthat's why all travellers are being asked to self-isolate, as they can't be forced to do it, dr. theresa tam said at a news conference in ottawa.\n\nit is impossible to be essentially keeping tabs on every single traveller that comes in, she said.\n\nthis is a social phenomenon, this is a societal response and everybody must take that responsibility. public health is going to do what it can.\n\non sunday, authorities were updating signage and information at airports in the wake of many travellers reporting that as they re-entered canada from abroad, they were being given no details about what to do — unless they were arriving from the three historic hotspots for the illness: china, iran and italy.\n\ntam said the epicentre of the outbreak has now shifted to europe as a whole, and as the situation continues to change, so too will the information travellers receive.\n\nwhile tam said all canadians need to be taking what measures they can to curb the spread of the illness, she did not suggest the border close.\n\nwe have to maintain essential movement of people and services as well, she said.\n\ncanada now has more than 320 cases of covid-19, with all 10 provinces reporting infections though most, so far, are directly linked to travel. there has been one death, and a number of the early cases are now considered recovered.\n\nchanges could be coming\n\ntrudeau acknowledged sunday that things are changing fast, and nothing is off the table — including shutting the border and making isolation and screening at the border mandatory.\n\nwe are hearing the concerns people have had, he told ctv's question period in an interview outside his home, where he and his family remain in self-isolation following his wife's diagnosis with the illness.\n\nthe shift in posture from the united states of course gives us significant things to think about and we will be discussing it later today among other measures at our cabinet meeting.\n\nthis week, u.s. president donald trump closed his country to travel from europe.\n\nthe opposition conservatives have been calling for trudeau to shut down the borders, and reiterated that call sunday.\n\nasking people to act isn't good enough, said the party's critics on health and public safety in a statement.\n\nit's not enough for the government to simply announce a policy, they must ensure it is being enforced and that front-line staff have the necessary resources and supports, matt jeneroux and pierre paul-hus said.\n\ntrudeau's wife sophie was diagnosed with covid-19 following a trip to the united kingdom. he said she continues to recover and currently has a headache but it is not worse than a bad cold.\n\nwhile other world leaders, including trump, have been tested as a result of being in close contact with those who have the virus, trudeau said the advice he has received is that the test would be wasted on him as he continues to show no symptoms.\n\nthis report by the canadian press was first published march 15, 2020.

a week after getting engaged, i woke up in the middle of the night soaked in my own stress sweat. the excitement of the proposal had worn off and the questions began to race through my mind.\n\nhow would our relationship change once we got married?\n\ndo we need to get married or can we just ditch the legal document?\n\nwill i have to drain my savings account to fund this wedding?\n\nspeaking of money, what will happen to my money once we're married?\n\nthat last question has stuck with me for quite some time. my fiancé and i have always been good at having hard conversations about life and our relationship. we've discussed topics like having kids, raising kids with a certain religion and our future career and relationship goals. we've always found ourselves seamlessly getting on the same page.\n\nwe've also talked a lot about our finances, disclosing to each other what our cash situation looks like and what kind of money mistakes we've made in the past. but one thing we never talked about before getting engaged was the infamous word ― prenup.\n\nfor a while, i didn't think getting a prenup was something we needed to do. neither of us were walking into this marriage with major assets. we just figured we'd keep our separate bank accounts, for a while, and figure out how to split bills and financially plan together, while keeping some things separate.\n\nin new york, where we plan to get married, the money you make becomes marital. which means, it's shared. money or assets from the past become marital, too, unless you protect them with a prenup or don't add any money to your savings account, investments or assets.\n\nmy fiancé and i have always been good at having hard conversations about life and our relationship. but one thing we never talked about before getting engaged was the infamous word -- prenup.\n\nbut the more i thought about the word marriage and the legal bindingness of it, the more i began to panic. i knew i had to talk to my fiancé about our financial game plan and perhaps even about getting a prenup.\n\ni thought prenups were just for people with huge amounts of money in the bank and long lists of assets, but the more i researched that, the more i realized i was wrong. essentially, prenups are something for anyone to consider, regardless of how much money you have to your name, who wants protection or a legal game plan of what will happen if the marriage ends. why argue about all of the assets you came into the marriage with, when the marriage is crumbling and on its final leg? why not get that out of the way beforehand. the idea of a prenup or a legal financial document started to sound more and more attractive.\n\nwhen i brought this topic up to my fiancé, at first, it was uncomfortable. he questioned why i had this fear and then began to understand the positives of exploring our financial protection options before getting married. for starters, it allowed us to go into the marriage with a clear plan of action for how we'd combine our finances and what we'd keep separate.\n\ni thought prenups were just for people with huge amounts of money in the bank and long lists of assets, but the more i researched that, the more i realized i was wrong.\n\nit also would be something that could calm my pre-marriage anxiety, which i find normal. you're about to legally bind a lot of yourself to another person, shouldn't that feel a little scary? we decided to educate ourselves on what a prenup would mean and in the process, figuring out the best moves for ourselves individually and as a couple.\n\nbefore continuing any financial conversation together, we decided to spend time separately going through our finances. we each created a spreadsheet with the current state of our bank accounts, our investments our retirement funds, and our debt. we also decided to write down what we both felt we were comfortable combining and what we wanted to keep separate (to be used for a potential future prenup).\n\ntaking this step not only allowed us to both organize any outstanding financial mess (like the need to merge an old 401(k) into a sep ira) but also have all our assets documented in an easy to consume way.\n\nafter sharing our spreadsheets, we decided to reach out and get help. a lot of the conversations that floated to the surface turned into small fights over deciding how to budget and save together. we both had different ideas about how to go about doing this; i wanted us to live on a tight budget to increase our savings and my partner wanted us to invest more now.\n\na lot of the conversations that floated to the surface turned into small fights over deciding how to budget and save together. we both had different ideas about how to go about doing this.\n\nan entire coffee shop of people stared at me as i yelled and cried one afternoon while we went over our credit card statements and talked about the kind of purchases we could cut back on. i found myself feeling strong and sensitive about the fact that i've been single and independent for most of my twenties and have worked hard for my money. though i've made money mistakes along the way, i was proud of my accomplishments, and at times, exposing my errors to my fiancé made me feel weak.\n\nwe spent full day in silence after a conversation about how to split our money and wages went south after discussing the potential scenario of having kids. i would have to temporarily stop working for a few months, and we both freelance so there's no such thing as paid maternity or paternity leave for us. we didn't reach a resolution.\n\nwe realized that we both needed financial advice and mediation from an expert. these were important conversations to have and to hold before getting married.\n\nwe sat down with someone at the financial gym, which according to their website is a group of financial trainers looking to put you in control of your finances, one step at a time.\n\nwe realized that we both needed financial advice and mediation from an expert. these were important conversations to have and to hold before getting married.\n\nwe met with a financial trainer who asked us questions about what our individual and joint financial goals were, analyzed our assets and helped us determine how much we should budget and save for our ideal retirement and investment plans.\n\nturning to an expert helped us power through a difficult set of conversations about basic finance and how things will work once our money is merged and the money we make becomes shared. once we knew what we were both bringing into the relationship, and were close to agreeing on how to implement shared money habits, we decided it was time to think about whether or not we wanted a prenup. while i always thought prenups were for people who had millions of dollars in assets, it turns out i was wrong.\n\nbefore making the decision, we decided to book an appointment to meet with a divorce lawyer, six months before our wedding date, to talk about what kinds of terms we could include in a prenup and what we could potentially add to it later on. this felt like a smart and proactive choice to help protect us from outcomes we weren't necessarily ready for since we weren't planning for them to happen.\n\nwe decided to book an appointment to meet with a divorce lawyer, six months before our wedding date.\n\nwhen we go to that appointment next month, we'll be ready to share our assets with the divorce lawyer, our future concerns and how we'd like to handle the worst case scenario of our relationship, an unexpected ending. either way, we're way past the awkwardness of having the prenup or financial protection conversation. now when the word comes up, we laugh and share with our friends proudly that we're considering getting one. a lot of them look at us with wide eyes of shock.\n\nover dinner with another engaged couple, we talked about the p word and the only thing they could share with us was that they are concerned we're approaching our engagement journey in a negative way, by planning for the worst.\n\nnone of my friends have ever openly talked about getting a prenup before their marriage and if they did get one, they kept that secret and swallowed the idea of releasing that information to their close friends. some people feel the decision is private, but society tells us that getting a prenup is like you're planning for the worst instead of working so hard on planning the best day of your life ― the actual wedding day.\n\nsociety tells us that getting a prenup is like you're planning for the worst instead of working so hard on planning the best day of your life -- the actual wedding day.\n\nthe more i talked to friends about this and told them i might want to get one, the more i felt judged. some friends even texted me asking if i was having second thoughts about marrying my fiancé. i'm not. i truly feel like marrying this person is the best decision but that doesn't mean i should feel shamed for wanting to figure out how i will walk out of the marriage, financially, if it ever comes to that. the wedding day will be a great day in our lives, but it's the marriage that's the most important ― and this includes discussing our finances.\n\ni've spent years making money and saving it. when life together gets complicated and changes (kids and more joint assets), i feel like i have the right to have a plan in place ― aka a prenup. it might seem unromantic to be so frank and rational, but i think it's the opposite. we've found ourselves, and our relationship, getting even stronger now that we know everything, every dollar and every conversation, is on the table.\n\nhave a compelling first-person story or experience you want

diocese de beauvais noyon et senlis / youtube bernadette moriau's healing was recognized as a miracle by a roman catholic bishop on feb. 11.\n\nnearly 10 years ago, a french nun named bernadette moriau visited the catholic shrine in lourdes in a wheelchair. after she returned to her convent near beauvais, she said, she was miraculously healed and able to walk for the first time in decades.\n\nthe roman catholic church in lourdes investigated her claim, and on sunday a french bishop placed a stamp of approval on it, formally declaring moriau's recovery to be a miracle.\n\nbishop jacques benoit-gonin of beauvais announced the 79-year-old nun's story of healing to be the 70th recognized miracle associated with lourdes, a popular pilgrimage site. he called her recovery a sudden, instantaneous, complete and durable change, according to the associated press.\n\nregis duvignau / reuters lit candles are seen near the entrance to the grotto of massabielle in lourdes, france, on nov. 4, 2016.\n\nthe sanctuary of lourdes in southern france marks the spot where in 1858, a 14-year-old girl named bernadette soubirous claims to have seen apparitions of the virgin mary. millions visit the site every year, believing that water from a spring in the sanctuary's grotto has healing powers.\n\nmoriau visited lourdes on a pilgrimage in 2008. according to la stampa, the nun had cauda equina syndrome, a rare condition that affects the spinal nerve roots and can lead to paralysis of the legs. she'd had four operations on her spinal column and had been unable to walk since 1987.\n\nmoriau said that when she visited the grotto, she never asked for a miracle, per ap. she just asked for the conversion of my heart and the strength to continue my path as a sick person, la stampa reports.\n\nshe returned to her home convent and visited the chapel to pray.\n\ni felt a [surge of] well-being throughout my body, a relaxation, warmth. ... i returned to my room and, there, a voice told me to 'take off your braces,' moriau said in a diocesan video about the event. surprise. i could move.\n\nbelow, bernadette moriau discusses her experiences in french.\n\nthe nun's claims were evaluated by the international medical committee of lourdes, a team of medical professionals brought together by the bishop of tarbes and lourdes in order to assess whether stories of healing that emerge from lourdes can be explained on the basis of current medical knowledge.\n\nthe committee reportedly found that moriau's case could not be explained scientifically. the bishop of beauvais, who has the last word on cases involving people living in his diocese, agreed that her healing appeared to be miraculous.\n\nshe immediately started to walk without any help, in a totally autonomous way, benoit-gonin said.\n\nthe last officially recognized miracle at lourdes was announced in 2013. in that case, an italian woman who had visited the shrine in 1989 said she was miraculously healed of severe high blood pressure and other problems.\n\nthe catholic church requires extensive documentation to verify the claim of a miracle. the process, which can take years, includes fact-finding, psychological examinations and theological evaluations.\n\nmiracles are tied to canonization in the catholic church. before being declared a saint, the deceased candidate will usually have been credited with performing at least two verified miracles.

the world looked on in horror as a mob stormed the u.s. capitol building on wednesday, putting a country that touts itself as the planet's oldest, strongest and most exceptional democracy on the brink of succumbing to the authoritarian whims of president donald trump and his most radical supporters.\n\nbut in brazil, perhaps more than anywhere else, the capitol riots felt like a warning from a not-so-distant future.\n\nsince winning election in 2018, far-right brazil president jair bolsonaro has waged an all-out assault on the country's democratic institutions, sought to undermine faith in its electoral system, and trafficked in many of the same voting-related conspiracy theories that trump and the republican party fomented over the last six months.\n\nthat trump's provocations resulted in wednesday's melee in washington set off alarm bells in bolsonaro's brazil, as if it were merely the matinee.\n\nattack on democracy, the front page of estado de s. paulo, one of brazil's largest newspapers, blared in bold, capitalized letters on thursday morning ― coverage of news from afar that nevertheless felt like a plea for brazilians to heed the danger facing their own republic.\n\nothers were more direct.\n\nfor brazil, it is a warning about what can happen even worse here, if bolsonaro's authoritarianism and his militias are not contained, if violations of freedom and rights continue to be tolerated, former leftist president lula da silva, who sought to challenge bolsonaro in 2018's elections before he was barred from running, wrote on twitter.\n\n(photo by lev radin/pacific press/lightrocket via getty images) pro-trump rioters stormed the u.s. capitol on wednesday, breaking through security barriers and entering the building in a desperate and conspiracy theory-fueled effort to stop the electoral college certification process from proceeding.\n\nalessandro molon, an opposition member in brazil's lower house of congress, tweeted that the riots in the united states proved that not even the most stable democracy in the world survives right-wing populism with impunity!\n\nthat is why it is so important to come together: we need to protect ourselves and avoid the worst in 2022! molon pleaded, while são paulo state gov. joão doria, a former bolsonaro ally who may run against him in next year's elections, called it an alert for brazil, where a minority that flirts with authoritarianism and fanaticism tries to weaken institutions and threaten the rule of law.\n\nfor more than two months, as trump has parroted absurd claims of voter fraud and stolen or disappeared votes, bolsonaro remained one of his only international allies in the fight. he was one of the last world leaders to recognize president-elect joe biden's november victory, and still seems hellbent on pretending that trump isn't going anywhere yet.\n\nthis is not a new cause célèbre for the brazilian. bolsonaro, like trump, peddled conspiracies about the 2018 election, openly musing about malfeasance against him even in a race he won. he has not stopped since: although many of bolsonaro's other blatant threats to democratic institutions, as well as the destruction of the amazon rainforest on his watch, have received more international attention, he has spent the last two years attempting to undermine brazil's electoral system and the last two months using trump and the united states as a reason to ramp up his attacks.\n\nap photo/alex brandon trump and bolsonaro have fashioned themselves into international allies on every major topic of their presidencies, and have mimicked each other's often-conspiratorial approaches to climate change, covid-19, democracy and elections.\n\njust as many brazilians have pointed to trump as an example of the horrors that bolsonaro could bring to their own nation, bolsonaro has warned that the problems that exist in the minds of trump and some republicans in america will make their way to brazil soon.\n\non thursday, he pushed brazil to abandon electronic voting machines that provide fast and reputable vote counts in favor of paper ballots ― a move some have warned could fuel the type of conspiracy theories that, in the u.s., baselessly alleged that mail-in voting was linked to rampant fraud.\n\nthere were people there who voted three, four times, dead people who voted, bolsonaro told a crowd of supporters on thursday morning, according to folha de s.paulo, brazil's largest newspaper. and here in brazil, if we have the electronic vote in '22, it will be the same thing. … we're going to have a worse problem than the united states.\n\nno such thing actually occurred in the u.s., and no such thing is likely in brazil, where the voting system is far more efficient and immediately accurate than any in the united states. but that doesn't matter to bolsonaro. the point is to find even the smallest kernel of evidence to bolster wild-eyed conspiracy theories.\n\nsuch remarks would be dangerously anti-democratic in normal times, but any sense of normalcy ceased to exist both in the u.s. and in brazil years ago. in 2016, dozens of angry, right-wing brazilians evaded security and invaded the country's national congress building to call for a military takeover of the government, a small demonstration that nevertheless offered some indication of the discontent that would later drive bolsonaro to power and portended worse to come. more recently, bolsonaro has fueled similar outbursts that feel like direct precursors to the sort of insurrection that occurred in washington.\n\nthroughout the first two years of his presidency, bolsonaro's most radical supporters have called for the closure of the national congress and the supreme court, and last year, a handful of militants were arrested after shooting fireworks at the supreme court building, as if to mimic a bombing. bolsonaro doesn't always endorse the worst, but he's always there to stoke the fervor among them.\n\nluis macedo/afp via getty images in november 2016, dozens of protesters invaded the brazilian congress to call for a military takeover of the government. it was peaceful compared to the riots that took place this week in the united states but foreshadowed further calls for the closure of the country's congress and supreme court from right-wing brazilians.\n\ntrump's instinct is also to throw red meat to his base when times are tough. and the riots, which broke out immediately after trump explicitly told his supporters to go to the capitol, offered brazilians an obvious look at how easily such agitation can erupt into a full-blown explosion, said bruno boghossian, a political columnist for folha de s.paulo.\n\nif we only look at it from the perspective of political agitation, it seems like [bolsonaro] is only trying to get more support and make these people angry so they can support him with even more passion, boghossian said. but when trump really does something about it, when he does something concrete, then we see what bolsonaro can really do.\n\nfrom the beginning, the worry in brazil was that bolsonaro was a more dangerous version of trump, a force that would offer a much tougher stress test for younger, less entrenched institutions. trump and the republican party ultimately proved american institutions weaker than many initially presumed, but in the end, the country's elections, the judiciary that oversees them and the congress required to certify them appear to have held ― if only just, and if only (possibly) just for now.\n\nbrazil's institutions, meanwhile, have at times acquitted themselves better than many thought they would, and divides in brazil's congress, where bolsonaro doesn't enjoy the support of a consolidated party like trump does in the gop, may help shield the country from total disaster.\n\n(ap photo/andre borges) in may 2020, bolsonaro greeted supporters who had gathered in brasilia, the brazilian capital, to call for the closure of the country's congress and supreme court.\n\nbut it's also not clear, boghossian said, that other institutions, including lower ranks of the military and the judiciary, would stand firm in the face of an all-out challenge should bolsonaro manage to incite one.\n\nin the united states there was objection from the military, from congressmen from the republican party, from electoral authorities from the republican party in the states, and from the vice president, boghossian said. i'm not sure that bolsonaro is going to have the objection of all these players in brazil. … the checks and balances and the democratic institutions and all the authorities involved in the political process might not be as hard on bolsonaro as the american authorities were on trump.\n\nthere are nuanced differences between brazil and the united states that the ready-made comparisons between trump and bolsonaro often obscure. still, it's undeniable that trump's election in 2016 was a preview of what followed in brazil two years later. brazil didn't learn the lessons on offer from its northern neighbor then. but this time, it still has a chance to heed the warnings before it's too late.\n\nbrazil must learn a lot from yesterday's terrible events in washington, miriam leitão, a columnist for rio de janeiro's o globo newspaper, wrote on thursday. this is exactly president bolsonaro's plan, and that is why he has been nurturing conspiracy theories around the electronic ballot box, the country's electoral laws, and the [supreme court] since 2018. he plans to reap what we saw yesterday in washington.\n\nbrazil should take everything that happened yesterday seriously, leitão continued. a president who lies for years and sabotages the bases of the republic will one day use his powers against the country. we need to strengthen the defenses of brazilian democracy.
video credit: skye fitzgerald, director, spin film\n\nahmed elhubbish, a middle-aged yemeni living in yemen's capital city of sanaa, wants to know what his children — abdul rahman, khalid, wasim and siham — did wrong.\n\nlast year, they were killed in an airstrike launched from thousands of miles above them by sophisticated machinery from continents away. what could make them targets for the coalition led by saudi arabia and supported by the u.s. that has been bombing yemen since 2015?\n\nthere's not a single reason for persistent attacks on yemenis such as the may 2019 strike that hit his children, elhubbish said through a translator in an outtake from hunger ward, a new documentary on the war and mass starvation in yemen, which was directed by oscar and emmy nominee skye fitzgerald. (watch above. note: the video contains graphic images.)\n\nthe footage, which was shot for the documentary and shared exclusively with huffpost, showed the immediate aftermath of an airstrike and included reflections by elhubbish and others that highlight the toll of the bombing campaign.\n\nlawmakers, u.s. officials, humanitarian groups, anti-war activists, arms dealers, foreign representatives and others have debated the american role in yemen for years in washington ― though rarely with such vivid evidence of the policy's consequences as is documented in fitzgerald's film.\n\nit's vital now to have a clear picture of what president-elect joe biden's choices could mean for yemen as he assumes the presidency later this month and will have the power to change u.s. policy.\n\nthe country's current crisis began in the fall of 2014, when iran-backed rebels known as houthis ejected yemen's internationally recognized government from sanaa. six months later, saudi arabia and its allies, notably the united arab emirates, launched a military intervention against the houthis ― with crucial backing from the u.s. and other western nations that continues despite persistent reports that the coalition is violating human rights standards and international law.\n\nmost national security experts believe that without american support for the bombing, the saudi-led coalition would need to seriously curtail its operations. that move would also make the kingdom more keen to cut a peace deal with the houthis and address deadly tussles for influence among its own yemeni partners.\n\nthe war has now killed nearly a quarter of a million people, the united nations reported in december. airstrikes by the saudi-led coalition have killed at least 18,000 civilians, according to the yemen data project, an independent monitoring group. the strikes have hit hospitals, markets, schools and other nonmilitary targets, prompting state department lawyers to worry that american involvement could implicate u.s. officials in war crimes.\n\nafter nearly five years of fighting, the houthis continue to control the most populated parts of yemen ― and the saudis continue to bomb those regions with u.s. support, most recently on new year's eve.\n\nunder president barack obama, washington provided the saudi-led coalition with aerial refueling that enabled it to run longer bombing campaigns, as well as intelligence and regular supplies of fresh bombs, while defending the campaign from international criticism and supporting a saudi blockade of yemeni ports that drove up food prices and pushed millions of yemenis into famine-like conditions.\n\npresident donald trump continued that policy and took further steps against the houthis that had devastating consequences for yemenis, such as slashing u.s. aid for houthi-controlled regions amid the coronavirus pandemic. when lawmakers and rights groups called for a tougher u.s. approach to the saudis over their role in the murder of journalist jamal khashoggi, trump cut off the aerial refueling assistance but left in place other forms of american aid to the saudi-led coalition.\n\ntrump also vetoed bipartisan legislation to cut off that support and to stop sending more bombs to the countries involved in the war.\n\nbiden has promised he will end the obama-era policy and treat saudi arabia as a pariah. but he will face a test of how seriously he takes that promise early in his presidency: biden will have to decide whether to block a giant arms package that trump crafted for the u.a.e. last fall, which the vast majority of congressional democrats opposes.\n\nthe humanitarian situation in yemen is predicted to deteriorate even further in the coming months with hunger on the rise, scott paul of oxfam america told huffpost in december after a slim senate majority approved the u.a.e. weapons package, which includes munitions that could be used in yemen. congress and the biden administration should do all they can to halt these arms sales and be a force for peace to save lives in yemen.
