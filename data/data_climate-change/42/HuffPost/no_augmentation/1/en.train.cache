If we think about ourselves and how we function in the world, we know that we are beings who think ideas; have sensations, feelings, and emotions; and we act according to how we think and feel. It is these three essential human faculties; feeling, thinking and acting, that we need to be more conscious of. They are tangible; we experience them every moment of each day. Not only that, each of these three faculties is linked to our body, soul and spirit.
The facility specializes in providing around-the-clock care for infants, children and young adults with developmental disabilities or who are medically fragile.
COVID-19 is too new for any clear answers about why more men are dying than women. It's possible that there are some genetic factors, Dr. Cara Tannenbaum, scientific director of the Institute of Gender and Health for the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, told Global News — but she was quick to point out that that's still speculation at this point.
On the eighth anniversary of the shooting that nearly took her life, former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) on Tuesday returned to the U.S. Capitol to urge Congress to strengthen background check requirements for gun sales.

Updated: See the latest stories on the coronavirus outbreak. Coronavirus has been officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation. A pandemic is declared when a new disease for which people do not have immunity spreads around the world beyond expectations, according to the body. It comes after the organisation declared the outbreak a global public health emergency at the end of January, when there were fewer than 100 cases of Covid-19 outside China and eight cases of human-to-human transmission of the disease. Now there are more than 118,000 cases in 114 countries and 4,291 people have died, with the numbers expected to climb. Australia has 112 confirmed cases.
This insurrection mounted by domestic terrorists at the urging of a sitting president was planned well in advance. Plans to Storm the Capitol were discussed on social media. Trump himself tweeted, Big protest on January 6th. Be there, will be wild.
Contact your insurer and keep up to date with travel alerts for the most accurate information. If you're yet to book your trip, be aware even if you do book travel insurance you won't be eligible to make a claim related to coronavirus now that it's a known event. However, it's still worth taking out travel insurance because it will cover you for other things like non-related medical expenses.
NEW DELHI — The Narendra Modi government is in the final stages of creating an all-encompassing, auto-updating, searchable database to track every aspect of the lives of each of India's over 1.2 billion residents, previously undisclosed government documents reviewed by HuffPost India establish.
Personal finance is not complicated, but everyone wants to make it out like it is. When Harold interviewed me for my last book, Pound Foolish, during the interview he said, Everything you need to know about personal finance could go on an index card. And then he more or less did it.

King, who attended Sunday's Golden Globes ceremony with Winfrey and Graham, also shared details about the speech. She said Winfrey declined producers' request to cut the length to three minutes from six minutes. Winfrey's appearance ended up taking nine minutes because of the applause, King added.
This is a boss who is great at managing their own team, but is bad at dealing with the bosses above them. They believe in your work, but they lack the office-politics savvy to make sure others in positions of power do, too.
Nassar, who was employed by Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics, is expected to spend the rest of his life in prison. The number of women who have now come forward to say he abused them, usually during medical treatments, stands at 265.

And then there was the Johnny Manziel issue.
Worse still is the phenomenon of international trade growing at a slightly slower pace than global production. The ratio of international trade-to-GDP, which indicates the relative importance of international trade in the economy of a country, has been falling sharply since 2009 except a gradual recover in 2010-2011.
The Browns are the second NFL team to be without their coach during the pandemic. Detroit interim coach Darrell Bevell sat out the Lions' Dec. 26 game at Tampa Bay because of COVID-19 protocols.
Each time Daniel decided to embark on a new venture, he either developed a website, reached out to sponsors, created a crowdfunding campaign, or shared his mission on social media. More times than not, he didn't get the support he was hoping for, but made just enough connections to make it possible. Not only are people good for support, but they will make you accountable.
The state's emergency alert protocol has been under scrutiny since the October wildfire disaster in Northern California, which left more than 40 people dead. Officials in Sonoma County — where over half of the fatalities occurred — had decided not to deploy the federal Wireless Emergency Alert system, and some survivors of the 21 blazes later said they were inadequately warned.
And now the Capitol is the site of more history, adding to the chapter that features Clinton, impeached 21 years ago for lying under oath about sex with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, and Andrew Johnson, impeached 151 years ago for defying Congress on Reconstruction. Another entry is for Richard Nixon, who avoided impeachment by resigning during the Watergate investigation.
The Trump administration has tried to mitigate some of the most noticeable effects of the shutdown to avoid public backlash. For instance, the National Park Service kept many parks open but with reduced staff, leading to piled-up trash and damaged vegetation in parks like Joshua Tree.
Therefore, it is crucial that public health measures like mask-wearing, hand-washing and social distancing remain in place.
On March 20, 2018, before the House Committee on Appropriations, Ross testified that we have had a request, as everyone is aware, from the Department of Justice, to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

The only exposure I saw of any gay culture was extremely effeminate, and that was what was on TV. I'm not like Jack on 'Will and Grace,' so I'm not gay, he said. So I tried to hide it.
Brain friendly creative focuses on making work easier to recall by being Recognised, Resonant and Relevant. We made activity brain-friendly by focusing on recognition: using yellow as a positive and dominant brand colour. We created emotional resonance through music and the use of 'Good Morning' (as a positive salutation). Overall, the activity was relevant in context as it sought to tackle the curmudgeonly morning commuter mind-set head-on by giving him something to smile about.
Menser, who showcased Seikatsu Club in his recent book We Decide!: Theories and Cases in Participatory Democracy, says it's fascinating that the group that started as a buying club was smart enough to pool its capital and start worker co-ops. This allowed them to create their own supply chains in the food sector.
The Walt Disney Co. said it will pay its cast members, as it calls employees, during the closure period.
3. You are rewarded for your creativity. Outside the box thinkers should be rewarded for their creativity. When you display creativity, you have a vested interest in helping to create new systems and solving problems. When you are creative you have a voice and are encouraged to participate. The reward does not necessarily need to be financial, but rather, just the fact that you are being recognized for your creativity is often times enough to make you feel like you are winning on the job.
They need to be in their jobs as soon as possible after January 20th, Biden said.

If you're ready to delve deeply into what's inspiring your dreams, Lundquist says it can be helpful to have a therapist lead you through the exploratory process. Identifying the source of anxiety can feel sometimes like catching a mouse — it sometimes doesn't want to be found, he says. Therapy is the best place to examine what's going on.

But you do need to balance your light. Too little, and you force your eyes to work overtime to help you see. Too much, and you may find yourself with a recurring headache by the end of each day, prompted by sunlight on your computer screen.
Because the vaccines do not offer 100% protection — and because it's possible that a person who has been vaccinated can unknowingly spread the virus to others — it's essential to continue following proven public health measures, like universal masking and physical distancing.
So, the question is, how do we cultivate our genius gene? Like most of us who hide behind the bathroom shower curtains or steering wheel singing, there is always a talent within us, waiting to burst. So let's break the rules of what you can and can't do and start playing that guitar, or hit those chords singing. And dump the fame game.
Once I return home, I binge on cookies. Ginger snaps, then oatmeal, then maple cream, then butter cookies. I buy a different flavor with each trip to the grocery store and bakery, and I consume them all with hot tea. The pain of eating too much is easier than the pain in my heart. Weeks later, I try to leave the cookies behind and seek time outside. I walk the dogs frequently, all the while breathing in the cold air of winter's eve.
Canada's chief public health officer has warned it won't be known for two to three weeks if country-wide social distancing has curbed the spread of COVID-19.
Many other countries with national health insurance systems don't have that kind of capability, which is likely one reason that vaccination in countries like France and Germany has had a slower start. It may be no coincidence that the U.K., the European country administering shots the quickest, is also the one where, as in Israel, the government is heavily involved in the provision of care and not just its financing.
There is a large amount of workers that are out there right now who have to make a choice between their health and the possibility of getting sick and whether or not their family is going to eat or not, Perrone said.
Tax cuts for the ultra wealthy mean far less to them than cuts for people with modest incomes, Krugman noted. And extra money in millions of hands boosts spending.
WASHINGTON — In an extraordinarily close vote, Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was reelected speaker of the House Sunday, securing the gavel for the fourth time in her nearly 34-year career in Congress.
The pandemic has laid bare the pervasive and violent inequality facing people of color, compounding existing inequities faced by communities burdened with environmental racism, police brutality, and economic inequality.
The drastic steps came as a new coronavirus began spreading to the rest of China and overseas during the Lunar New Year holiday, when many Chinese travel. The virus raged for weeks in Wuhan; however, the outbreak has gradually been brought under control there, and Hubei has seen almost no new infections for more than a week.
The comments, included in a letter about the plight of vulnerable children in general, were some of his most comprehensive on abuse.
Almost anything that follows 'should have' reflects a disappointment, a missed opportunity, an unhealthy comparison between an ideal and reality, and constant glancing in the rearview mirror, Hunt said.

Corporate India is expecting measures from the government which will boost consumption demand, according to Firstpost, since it has plunged drastically over the past year. The consequence of that has been drastic reduction in sales. The automobile sector is the best known example of this.
In public, Trump always suggests otherwise. Whether he's talking about rules for farmers or bankers, or changes to taxes or health care, he always says what he did at the Capitol a year ago ― that he's fighting powerful interests and protecting the forgotten American.
2017 was not an outlier, he said, noting insured losses have surpassed $100 billion multiple times since 2005. We must have on our radar the trend of new magnitudes.
The Trump administration couldn't get any safety net cuts through Congress, so it used regulations to push changes to food, health and disability benefits. In November, the administration finalized a rule that could make it harder for Social Security Disability Insurance applicants to win appeals after they've been initially denied benefits.
ASSOCIATED PRESS Marie Kondo said the ancient Japanese philosophy of wabi-sabi, which she described as experiencing beauty in simplicity and calmness, was one inspiration for her methods.
In several European countries, green parties are also important. In Portugal and Luxembourg, green and anti-capitalist socialist parties are components of government coalitions. Democracy in all such countries reflects people's demands for freedom to choose among parties with divergent attitudes toward capitalism. In contrast, the U.S. ― the nation that most loudly and routinely proclaims its commitment to democracy ― rigidly restricts its political parties to two that both celebrate capitalism.
That is an enormous step forward for women who are Muslim in India. That is terrific. Nobody is going to go back to those men who were not necessarily representative at all, she said.

Healthy habits go a long way in reducing your risk for any illness, including the coronavirus.
Her vulnerability to a challenge could speak to the changing nature of the Democratic electorate. Support for a Green New Deal unites disparate primary voters from the 2016 election. Among New York 4th Congressional District voters who picked Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in 2016, 55 percent said they would support a pro-Green New Deal candidate, compared to 8 percent who wouldn't. Among voters who picked former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 primary, support for a Green New Deal proponent hit 46 percent, compared to 19 percent who don't.
At the same time, Sheila Healy, who worked on Sanders' successful 2018 Senate re-election, told supporters that his campaign had implemented much tougher measures to prevent future workplace issues.
IMF experts estimate that the slowdown in economic growth since 2012, after the temporary catch up in 2010 and 2011, explains by itself about three-quarters of the dramatic slowdown trade.

The Rudd report also found that companies didn't spend any money to advertise healthy food options of their products on Spanish-language television.
Smith seemed a much more likely candidate to get the boot following his first Bucs year, which produced just two wins and a handful of horrid losses—a 56–14 blowout in Atlanta; a 48–17 home loss to Baltimore. But Tampa Bay nabbed Jameis Winston with the No. 1 pick and made significant improvements this season, including in its record.
The catastrophes came during a third consecutive year of above-average annual temperatures across the contiguous U.S. and Alaska, the NOAA report found. (Hawaii also saw record temperatures, but was not included in the report).

Under the president's vigorous, swift order to General Motors, said Peter Navarro, White House point man on the emergency supply chain, new ventilators would be ready in Trump time, which is to say as fast as possible.
How much the Conservative party knows about its candidates also became an issue in 2018, when revelations surfaced that the party was aware a candidate in the 2015 election had been accused of sexual assault.
En 2003, c'était exactement le contraire: le Sras était apparu en novembre 2002 mais Pékin avait attendu février suivant pour reconnaître la maladie, la minimisant et assurant qu'elle était sous contrôle. En juin 2003, le virus avait tué plus de 300 personnes en Chine, avec plus de 5329 autres cas. Sous pression de l'OMS pour rapporter tous les cas, les autorités chinoises avaient aussi interdit aux experts de l'organisation l'accès aux hôpitaux militaires de Pékin.

Police were called to Terry Parker High School, according to First Coast News though they don't report by who, when a group of about 10 students staged a sit-in to urge the school to change their current half-credit, semester-long black history course to a full-credit, year-long course.
A study published last week in the BMJ (formerly the British Medical Journal) looked at the 20 countries with the most confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus. Not all 20 countries differentiated by gender, but of the ones that did, the majority — including Canada — reported more confirmed cases of the virus in men than women.

We need positive change in Ontario. And that begins with education, she told HuffPost in an interview. It's not just about reversing [Ford's] cuts, it's about going further.
Character integrity means a great deal to me. I find it extremely important to portray the characters exactly as they are in their movies and as classically as possible. This can be a huge challenge depending on your environment (some parties take place in jungle gym environments) — plus, in real life, I can be pretty klutzy and dorky.
Trump struck a very different tone Thursday after a slew of White House resignations, condemnation from both foes and allies, suspension from several social media platforms and calls for him to be removed from office. He said that a new administration will be inaugurated on Jan. 20, which was the closest he came to making a concession speech.

I can't imagine telling her either, I say as I inhale the new car smell. In our family, we keep cars for 10 to 20 years, much like we cling to old habits. I wonder if, in the coming years, this moment will be a memory, steeped in grief and pain, for my sister. A memory stirred when she grips the steering wheel.

Yael, who spends several hours per day on YouTube, said he learned about MysteryBrand.net from trending videos on Marco and Alvin, a popular YouTube channel that has featured the website dozens of times since early October.

Today Mayor de Blasio turned his back on millions of first responders, police officers, firefighters and other public employees who depend on their pensions to provide for themselves and their families in retirement, API New York Executive Director Karen Moreau said in a statement. Government pension managers have a responsibility by law to seek the greatest return for their investors and pensions that invest in oil and natural gas companies have historically delivered a higher return than other investments. Deliberately hurting pension holders, like the fine men and women who keep our city safe, is a disgraceful way to score cheap political points.

Welcome to 2019. There's a government shutdown going on, and federal employees ― from cafeteria workers to janitors to research scientists ― are cut off from their income for a second week. The resolution of this dispute depends on hundreds of representatives and senators and a recalcitrant, rageful president agreeing on funding for a wall, or perhaps, according to The New York Times, on what the definition of a wall even is.

Kids and technology. It seems to be a love-hate relationship for parents. For me these days it's more of a hate relationship. Everywhere I go I am seeing more kids plugged into technology, glued to a screen, walking around like zombies. This frustrates me and makes me sad at the same time.
Maryland's largest city, which has been suffering extended heat waves and coastal flooding as a result of warming that's already underway, has asked the Supreme Court to refer its lawsuit seeking damages back to a state court.

A raw inspiration - one that emerges from new ideas - and the realization that it is possible to transform informality and stagnation, as well as, to create a formidable spirit for the future is what helped spearhead the magic. It is the reason I kept going. It is the reason we were able to build the local Greek T4A team and to hold a brilliant event streamed live to over 19,000 viewers around the world (www.t4action.org). The event, titled Transformation through Innovation was beyond any doubt a success.
Many flights had short delays on Tuesday and Southwest Airlines suspended all flights in or out of the airport until Wednesday morning, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.
Probably the fairest way to judge the U.S. relative to its peer countries is to say that it matches or exceeds the highest performing countries in Western Europe but, like those countries, hasn't had nearly the success that Israel has ― again, assuming that the data is roughly accurate.
Another major thrust of Trump's agenda is protecting businesses from lawsuits, even when they act in ways that exploit or harm consumers ― helping to foster what Mike Konczal, a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute, has called a Grifter Economy.
We put in place the act which passed and Doug Ford has completely destroyed. He's just not acted on any of it … I really wish I could have explored more ways to lock it into the system so it'd be more difficult for him to dismantle.

That dream never came to pass. Even after drafting defensive tackle Danny Shelton and signing a handful of high-profile free agents, like cornerback Tramon Williams, the Browns never were able to put it together defensively.

Some states, naturally, have managed better than others. The three having the most success ― again, based on Bloomberg's tracking of vaccines administered relative to population ― are West Virginia, North Dakota and South Dakota. Other places doing relatively well include Connecticut and Maine. Alabama is where vaccines are getting into arms the slowest. California is really struggling too.
Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers (D) said his state would hold primary elections as scheduled for April 7 despite pressure to postpone due to coronavirus concerns. He pointed out that there were also local races on the ballot for offices that would go unfilled for weeks or months, such as mayoral and county seats who would be crucial decision-makers as the crisis continues.
Wadbrant told HuffPost that, as always, knowledge is power. Reading the Reddit threads are a great place to start educating yourself. The questions you have have likely been asked before.

Earlier Monday, clothing retailer Aritzia Inc. announced that it was closing all of its stores until further notice as businesses across the country move to help reduce the spread of COVID-19, though customers could continue to shopping through the company's website for the time being.
Cable says had Theresa May gone for a soft-Brexit, by which he means keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, a lot of pro-EU voters would have gone along with it. I think a lot of Remainers would have said 'ok fine, we would rather not leave, but this is something we can cope with and it's not going to cause a lot of economic harm', he says. The fact they are pursuing a much more extreme and also very uncertain outcome means that these divisions are not going to go away. They are becoming more extreme and acute. People will want to have a fresh look at this when they know what the outcome is. I think there is a peculiar thing you encounter with the public, on the one hand they are absolutely bored stiff with the subject but equally they're very intensely divided. It's worrying in the long run. As somebody used the phrase the other day, there is a kind of non-violent civil war's going on. There's an element of truth in that. He predicts a big Tory rebellion in the Commons over May's plan to leave the customs union. There are a lot of people who probably wouldn't go to the stake over the single market because of immigration issues but would go tot stake over the customs union, he says.
Most people go overboard and burn out when it comes to resolutions. Instead of gradually easing into their desired outcomes, they try to completely change overnight. That strategy never works.

Last week, Democrats officially became the majority party in the House of Representatives, gaining control of the congressional committees that are empowered to investigate the presidency of Donald Trump. There is no shortage of targets for Democrats, but one who will be immediately scrutinized by the newly named House Committee on Oversight and Reform is Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and his misleading testimony about his decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.
Just so disgusting and so UN-AMERICAN.
However, several employees have made clear in social media posts and in letters that have been shared publicly that they are dismayed with the leadership's handling of the scandal. They say the leaders have discussed the option of rebranding, which would likely entail a change of the organization's name, but the employees are pressing for additional steps, including reparations and a leadership overhaul.
Trump invoked the Defense Production Act, empowering him to order companies to make what the country needs. This raised expectations that a new wave of emergency supplies generally and ventilators in particular could come to the aid of patients and the people looking after them.
The bad news is piling up at a time when Central Valley farmers (egged on by the Trump administration) are already fighting with state managers for larger annual allocations of snowmelt, at least some of which has to flow into the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta and to the Pacific. According to the Water Education Foundation, 80 percent of the state's commercial fishery species live in or migrate through the Delta, and at least half of its Pacific Flyway migratory water birds rely on the region's wetlands. Its ecosystem already teeters near collapse, driven in part by relentless shunting of water to farm interests in the Central Valley.
Realistic ways to translate red carpet and runway looks into readers' real wardrobes, providing styling advice and market info.
Not being able to move away from this top heavy approach is a failure. If we had moved away then we wouldn't have been at a stage where a head of state, in this case Trump, would be used as a leverage point to say — he is coming next week — do you want to get this deal done or not. If we had progressed on building this relationship on multiple levels, these issues would not play out in the open. These would be settled behind a consultative dialogue that happens behind closed doors.
When we tell our honest, humble and vulnerable story to others - it attracts them to us like magnets because it draws them to us when we especially add value to their life and show our vulnerable sides. When we begin adding valuable knowledge to people and they learn to trust us - only then will they want to work with us because number one they know we have also gone through some tough spots in life but also because we will be able to provide solutions to their overwhelming situations that will be effective.
Yet it was excruciatingly challenging to resist pounding my thumbs on my iPhone keyboard every time one of my Facebook friends posted some ill-informed and hateful, personal attack on my candidate, or worse yet, on me and my so-called ilk! I used to love Facebook. And it was hard not to lose respect for a friend when their relentless venting clouded my thoughts of them, but I didn't.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) stepped into the spotlight during the Democratic debate in Las Vegas earlier this week, grilling her opponents and demonstrating she's still got her fighting spirit. She trained an especially fiery line of questioning on former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has decided not to compete in the first four states of the Democratic primary. She heads to South Carolina without any clear victories to her name.
Though there's little the average citizen can do to avoid air pollutants entirely, there are some actions they can take on a daily basis and in the long term to help protect themselves and others.
Jamil points to the bullshit fantasy of pornography as a main reason men feel they can objectify women.
As far as skirts are concerned, you want to choose something that is more modest in nature, so at the knee or just above the knee is a good idea in terms of the length, Swann said.
I would never say, because I wouldn't want people to wish for that instead. The thing is the thing is the thing. But I just mean that there's always a push and pull with these things, and I think the movie as it is is, honestly, exactly what I wanted to make. But there was a time where it went way darker. And I'm glad that it doesn't. I don't think that would have been right either, actually. Those were the two prongs, and I think that where it is now is exactly where I want it.
Richard Horton, the editor in chief of the medical journal The Lancet, accused Johnson of playing roulette with the public by taking his time instituting changes.
Cable has been here before of course. He served as acting leader in 2007 during the transition from Sir Ming Campbell to Nick Clegg. But that was under very different circumstances than where he finds his party today. We had never been in government. So, you know, there was nothing to defend. It was all attack, attack, attack. Ten years on Cable, the former business secretary, acknowledges his association with the coalition has been a factor in the past but this diminishing as an issue. We do know from our surveys there about 25%+ of the electorate are considering voting for us. They may not, and they haven't firmed up on it, but there is a potential market, he says. From my recollection a majority of those who currently not voting for us but considering it are Labour, on the left Labour people. I guess the coalition was an issue for them but will become less so over time. The whole Brexit thing has brought other issues to the fore. There are some good things happening, Cable says of his party's position. We have this record level of membership, lots of enthusiastic young people. We are the youngest of the three parties, I've discovered, in terms of average age. You go around the country and lots of kind of idealistic young people, full of energy who want to do things and that's really good.
Many of Matthews' followers appreciated her candid confessions about her previous drug use and efforts to change.
The women featured in the series include models Paulina Porizkova, Robyn Lawley, Hunter McGrady, Ebonee Davis, Myla Dalbesio, Georgia Gibbs, Kate Wasley, Olivia Culpo and Sailor Brinkley Cook (daughter of Christie Brinkley), as well as Raisman. The photos are paired with in-depth, honest essays written by Porizkova, Lawley, Brinkley Cook and McGrady. (However, online readers looking for those essays might have had a hard time on Tuesday. The link was not featured on SI Swimsuit's front page, nor was it tweeted out by the brand's account by mid-afternoon.)
Another trick you can use to pay off your loan faster is dividing your monthly payment into two. For example, if you have $300 due at the end of every month, make one payment of $150 on the 15th and a second payment of $150 on the 30th.
History will record that today was a good day, he said.

But given the torrential rains that were predicted, a devastating disaster was almost inevitable. It's no secret that drought, wildfires and mudslides ― all three of which California has witnessed of late ― are connected.

―Americans reject the president's assertion that there is an illegal-immigration crisis on the southern border, according to a Washington Post/ABC News survey released Sunday. In that survey, 53 percent of Americans say Trump and the Republicans are mainly to blame for the shutdown, with 29 percent calling Democrats mostly at fault, and 13 percent believing both sides share equal responsibility. A 54 percent majority oppose building a border wall, although that's down from 63 percent in a Post/ABC survey taken last year ― the change is due largely to increased support among Republicans.
But Saturday's show of force, arranged by Organizing for Bernie ― an upstart group founded by Sanders campaign alumni and grassroots activists ― demonstrated one of the senator's biggest advantages if he decides to return to the ring: a network of supporters already familiar with his message and skilled in do-it-yourself internet organizing.

Tests sérologiques: ils se réalisent par prélèvement sanguin et permettent de savoir si une personne a développé des anticorps contre le virus. Il doit aider à déterminer quelle partie de la population a été en contact avec la maladie. Le problème est que les anticorps se développent plusieurs jours après avoir contracté la maladie. Il faut environ 15min pour avoir un résultat en laboratoire.
• Tale of the tape: As the Tennessee coach, Whisenhunt had a record of 1–6 this season, and 3–20 overall, when he was let go following Week 8. Mike Mularkey went on to win two of nine games as the interim coach.
This is a persistent misconception that also follows other vaccines, like the flu shot. Many people feel unwell after getting vaccinated for the flu and believe they have the virus itself. But the flu vaccine is actually made from inactivated or dead viruses.

Paddock, 64, fired more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition on concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest Festival from the broken window of his 32nd-floor corner suite at Mandalay Bay on Oct. 1. He then killed himself. He had an additional 4,000 rounds in his room along with an arsenal of weapons. It's not clear what his motive was.
Still, I was too nervous to tell other people. The love felt ethereal, airy, uncontainable. In that misty bliss, there was both unlimited possibility and dreamy surreality. For months I insisted that we let our relationship be just ours; I didn't want anyone else to take away the everythingness of the feelings I was finally willing to have.
The holidays are over. The New Year is here and with it comes new hopes and dreams.
The UN's Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination released a decision last month calling for Canada to freeze the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, Coastal GasLink project and BC Hydro's Site C dam construction until proper consent is obtained from all communities impacted.
As illness progresses, loss increases. Loss of the ability to do things like work and play. We increase our dependence on others to achieve once-simple daily tasks. We need help to care for ourselves ― our personal needs. We lose the ability to join others, to meet new people, to seek connection. Homebound, we rely on individuals to come to us and share life experiences, our end-of-life experiences. This is what it looks like.

Atlanta is a rapidly growing city that has been powered historically by the engines of transportation ― the railroad lines upon which we were founded, the major interstates that intersect here, and the air traffic at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the world's busiest passenger airport.
Benjamin Chapman, a professor and food safety extension specialist at North Carolina State University, explained that because the mode of infection is primarily respiratory, the chance of getting COVID-19 from food is extremely low. In fact, we don't see evidence of any respiratory viruses being transmitted through food in the past, he said.
Tom Farrey, leader of The Sports and Society Program at the Aspen Institute, believes that people are missing the purpose of these trophies.
Trump spent much of the conversation wanting to talk about vaping; he was considering a new policy restricting its use. White House officials now believe Trump didn't fully grasp the magnitude of the threat to the U.S. in part because Azar, who was feuding with several members of Trump's inner circle, did a poor job communicating it.
With a 16- or 17-year-old girl, it's hard to establish their age. Some are more developed than others, said Fortin, pointing out this is part of the reason why most arrests for child pornography deal with images showing prepubescent children.
Do invest in high-quality palettes and tools to protect your efforts and product. Be aware that cosmetics have a limited shelf life, says Karsten. So when you mess with them, you are exposing them to non-tested conditions and foreign packaging that could alter the performance or quality. Shteysel believes a thin, flexible metal spatula is also a depotter's best friend. It's going to let you get right in between the pan and the plastic packaging so that you can wiggle your makeup right out, she says.

What remains unchanged after Friday's announcement is that taxpayers who expect a refund can file right now and get their payments once the return is processed.
This could indeed be evidence for the beginning of globalisation going in reverse. The globalisation of trade means that countries trade more and more with each other, and that trade between them increases faster than their national production.
I back anyone who takes a stand for what they believe in, Scott said in a statement obtained by Billboard and Variety. I know being an artist that it's in my power to inspire. So before confirming the Super Bowl Halftime performance, I made sure to partner with the NFL on this important donation. I am proud to support Dream Corps and the work they do that will hopefully inspire and promote change.
Longtime NBC News personality Hoda Kotb has been named the co-anchor of Today, permanently replacing Matt Lauer after he was fired in November.
I shouldn't even have to post this as you guys should already know where I stand but If you do not pls know I unequivocally repudiate ANY AND ALL hateful comments against the LGBTQ community. Actually I'm tired of that label. We all belong to the same community, a shared community called humanity. And today and tomorrow and the next day I will continue to stand with other like minded people who condemn any and all statements and actions that would seek to deny the basic humanity of our fellow brothers and sisters. We cannot sit Idly by nor will we speak silently when we are confronted with such violence against members of our community. I am personally beyond exhausted by the ignorance and bigotry living in some people. At times I want to punch and I want to slap a lot of people when I read and hear the shit that comes out their mouthes !!! I will rejoice when folks stop thinking they ARE GOD, Jesus' assistant, picking and choosing what sins are acceptable in the Bible, and using the Bible as a whip! WE can't afford anymore tearing down of our shared humanity. My advice: If your religion is causing you to spew out words of hate, judge, or look down on others because of who one loves then you need to change it. And fast. If the religion don't make you are more loving or better person, ditch it. But what do I know.

I thank them, from the bottom of my heart, for speaking out, Sanders said of the accusers. What they experienced was absolutely unacceptable and certainly not what a progressive campaign, or any campaign, should be about.
It was big news last month when health officials identified a new and apparently more contagious strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the United Kingdom. There's evidence that the U.K. strain (official name is B.1.1.7) has spread widely, and is now present here in the United States. By early 2021, it had been identified in California, Colorado, New York and Florida.
Scientists should focus instead on making a comprehensive picture of the virus to help respond to future outbreaks, Woolhouse said.
In a tit-for-tat sense, it does seem just that artists like Louis C.K. and Tarantino ― whose reputations were long bolstered by the plaudits of critics and the reflexive hipster posturing of fans ― have now slid to the wrong end of the my taste is better than yours hierarchy. That's not the point of this moment, nor should the goal of this reassessment be to simply unseat one set of white male icons, to turn the same smugly superior judgment on their fans that their detractors have experienced. It's only human, though, to feel vindicated.
Officials are scaling up hospital capacity throughout the state, which is adding 6,000 additional ventilators to its operations, though it needs about 24,000 more, according to the governor. The state is planning to distribute 1 million N95 masks to New York City alone and is evaluating sites for building four new field hospitals to address the expected shortage of ICU beds, Cuomo said.
In fact, Pro Football Focus lists the former Stanford standout as the shiftiest running back in the league this season. No. 88 ― and yes, that should probably be changed to a number more befitting of a running back ― galloped for 163 yards and two touchdowns in a recent win over Chicago. Moreover, he has averaged a healthy 5.9 yards per rush, which would rank him first in the NFL if he had the qualified number of carries (100).
YeremyV expands on this idea, adding that most of the other characters in Shrek seem to be from fairy tales or nursery rhymes (Three Little Pigs, Three Blind Mice, Muffin Man), but Donkey doesn't seem to be from a specific story. It'd make sense if you consider that he's a boy-turned-donkey from Pinocchio.

On occasion, questions and comments that seem insulting may be just that. Buyers who come into a booth at the last hour of the last day of a show seeking large price reductions irritate Stretan and other artists, because they seem to be putting down my work and me as a professional. He noted when someone comes into my display, they're not under any obligation to make my day or to support me, but to visitors who appear belligerent and want to bust your chops he gives short answers to their questions and recommends that they take a look at some of the other displays.

Washington recorded the first U.S. coronavirus case in January, and now has more than 2,000 people who have tested positive. This order is enforceable by law, but the legal penalties are not what should convince people to follow these orders, Inslee tweeted. The real penalty may be the loss of a loved one to COVID-19. There are 110 Washington families who can tell you what the pain of that loss feels like.

In one video, Jafar is seen and heard urging the policemen to take action against the miscreants. Why are you not stopping them? she says over and over again. There was so much police, but when the violence happened, the police disappeared, she says in the video.
When I first moved to Canada, I decided that a great way to meet some friends in my new adopted country was to join an outdoor running club ― in January.
As soon as farming got involved, [life expectancy] shot down, said Daniel E. Lieberman, an evolutionary biology professor at Harvard University. Very few people lived to be very old once farming starts.
Yet the closure I got from our wedding weekend actually came from our American-style wedding day. My husband encouraged me to give a speech about my parents and I found myself at a loss for words. While I felt relieved, even somewhat triumphant by the way Saturday had unfolded, my feelings toward my parents were still a complicated, tangled mess. I had spent my whole life trying to prove myself to my parents and meet the unrealistic expectations they had heaped on me from a young age. I grew up knowing that while I was loved, I was also an investment to my family. I had not experienced a normal childhood. But look at what we had to show for my troubles!
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, offered a word of encouragement at the press conference: I can tell you for sure that we are clearly having an effect with social distancing efforts, although that effect cannot yet be quantified.
Frederick served as a Clinton-era assistant to the solicitor general from 1996 to 2001 and appeared on the Obama administration's short list for the top job in 2008.
When Trump spoke in Switzerland, weeks' worth of warning signs already had been raised. In the ensuing month, before the president first addressed the crisis from the White House, key steps to prepare the nation for the coming pandemic were not taken.
In Canada, I think we're making good progress in some of these avenues, such as our new shared parental leave program. My husband will be taking advantage of this and I think sharing the load with our new baby is going to make a world of difference in how we divide the labor. When he doesn't have to wake up for work, he can help with night feeds and I won't get so batty from sleep deprivation. He can go to mommy-and-me time at the library (haha!) while I rest or take time to myself (imagine). While I'm taking care of baby, he can handle some other household responsibilities like groceries. And when it's time to transition baby to daycare in a year, he'll be able to help and save me some emotional turmoil this time. I think shared leave is going to be great for both of us, as parents and partners.
Harrold added that Royals have been creating etiquette rules and royal protocols for centuries, and this is an example of our evolving royal family. In the 21st century we need to accept that things are different compared to last century, and that to the century before.
Still, hopes among Democrats that they would pick up several seats were thwarted, even as Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump in the presidential race. In the November vote, Democrats were left especially disappointed that they failed to defeat Republican Sens. Susan Collins in Maine and Thom Tillis in North Carolina.
I shop for the smallest travel size of shampoo, conditioner, face cream, sun block, foundation, hand cream, and hand sanitizer. My husband needs to add under-three-ounce sizes of contact lens supplies. But I'm still unsure if lipstick and mascara are liquid, despite reading the airline TSA rules. No matter how you slice it, those baggies are really hard to zip lock shut.
But since then, the virus has continued to spread across Europe. This week, France's president Emmanuel Macron placed the country under lockdown, as the number of confirmed cases in France grew to over 9,000.
How people around the world experience fashion and beauty differently, and what we can learn from them.
Don't push the distance if you aren't used to running in the cold. Start off with just one mile, and don't go too hard, Li said. You need to allow your body to acclimate to the cold air, especially your lungs and even your face and jaw muscles.
When it comes to saving for retirement, putting your money in a low-interest savings account is akin to shoving your money under a mattress. Ideally, you'd invest your money for bigger gains over time while reaping a few tax benefits instead. In other words, you'd contribute to your employer's 401(k) plan.
Whatever your specific purse in the freezer may be, encountering a symbol for your anxieties or fears in a dream suggests that you haven't reckoned with them in your waking life. You can start to address this issue by keeping a dream journal, which will give you a space to reflect — either on your own or with the help of a professional.
My love for technology took me into the banking industry and I learned to program some of these computers. It was fun following in my dad's footsteps and talking about programming with my Dad.
There's no lack for public interest and public service-experienced litigators, Hauser said. We don't need to rotate between Republican Big Law and Democratic Big Law.

It's long been clear Republicans would need to replicate their Election Day turnout margins from the general election in order to win the runoff, but Democrats' surprising strength has made it a more difficult mountain to climb.
I grew up playing sports, but golf was always special. My dad loved the sport, and taught me how to play from a very young age. We had years of great bonding that I'll never forget, memories I carried with me until high school.
Moms, and parents in general, are by nature designed to protect our kids. We deserve a seat at the table until the initiatives we've put forth are adopted, and we'll keep kicking up dust until they do. Because as long as the fox is watching the henhouse in youth football, he will continue to sell the eggs and keep all of the profits ― to the detriment of our children.
The fault mapping in this article has been done by the author based on available documents and complementary analysis of satellite Google Earth images and SRTM topographic data. The rupture of the segments is inferred from seismological, geodetic and field observation data mainly reported by INGV Italy, CNRS France, and COMET UK, complemented with the author's preliminary analysis of Pleiades satellite images. The rupture mapping will be refined in the forthcoming months while data analyses are completed.
A major draw can be a deep, historical interest in a particular period or subject of a country ― the Renaissance in Italy, the royal family in England, or recreations of historical events, said Vogele.
The guy got charged but I'm still vague on what happened to him. On another occasion, I was in a rapid response car and called to treat a man who had knocked himself out by slipping on wet stairs. His friend was upset that I wasn't in an ambulance and wasn't going to take him straight away to hospital. I explained I was there to give first aid quickly and my colleagues would arrive with an ambulance. But he pushed me down the stairs and I broke my wrist. It has got worse. I definitely get verbally abused every day now and physically pushed or shoved or worse at least once a week. That's why we need this protection. At the moment, it's hit and miss, this would give judges the power to give a minimum sentence. Eventually people are going to realise before pushing a paramedic over, 'let me take a deep breath, I will end up with consequences if I push him'. What makes it worse is we are overstretched and over-demanded and when we arrive people are already irate that we weren't quicker. And they take it out on us. Laura Barrett, 47, Paramedic in East London
Actress Rose McGowan said Sunday that it was Hollywood fakery for actors to wear black to the Golden Globes as a way to protest sexual misconduct.
If you can bring conscious awareness to the real emotion, then you can actually take an outsider view and discover why it's happening, said Patrick Davey Tully, a therapist in Los Angeles.
CBD is short for cannabidiol, the nonpsychoactive ingredient that can be found in weed. CBD doesn't get you high (that's what the THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, in weed does). Commercially available CBD has little to no THC in it.

So why would you choose a solo 401(k) over a SEP-IRA? The contribution limits, namely. It's possible to make contributions to a solo 401(k) as both an employer and an employee. In 2019, the contribution limit for employees is $19,000, or $25,000 for those 50 and older. As an employer, you can contribute up to an additional 25 percent of compensation, or up to $56,000 in total contributions. You can choose to make traditional or Roth contributions.
For me, getting married really didn't change our relationship—we were already living together, and I think moving in was the bigger OMG moment in our lives. Still, I do feel like we operate as more of a team since getting married. No more empty threats while fighting, for example. - Rachel, married two years
The Trump administration continues to dismiss and downplay the crisis. I don't believe it, President Donald Trump, who has a long history of climate change denial, said of his own administration's report. He added that we're the cleanest we've ever been.
Because he switched schools so often, Johnson's records often didn't follow him, making it difficult to diagnose his intellectual disability. Moreover, because Black students had been overly classified as intellectually disabled, educators and health experts may have been reluctant to apply the label to Johnson, Daniel J. Reschly, an intellectual disability expert, wrote in an evaluation of Johnson.

While AAP's victory is not a widespread endorsement of the protests at Shaheen Bagh, or the vociferous anti-CAA movement in Delhi, it does show the limits of Hindu nationalism at a time when the ruling BJP is under fire for mismanaging the national economy.
Despite mountains of reporting — not nearly enough, mind you — and evidence, people found ways to disregard allegations as rumors, and cited his 2008 acquittal on child pornography charges as a reason to leave the matter be. The same community that knows how unfair and inadequate the criminal justice system can be will lean on it when someone they love has been legally exonerated.

Americans say, 54% to 26%, that Trump did not do enough to condemn his supporters' actions; by 47% to 22%, they say other Republican lawmakers did not do enough to condemn what happened. Forty-three percent say Trump's rhetoric encourages his supporters to act violently, with 28% saying he discourages them from violence, and the rest that he does neither or they're not sure.

That unwillingness to prepare for its inevitable spread in the United States cost the country precious weeks that it could have spent aggressively ramping up the production of coronavirus tests and increasing intensive care capacity at the nation's hospitals, pandemic experts said.
Where government departments had previously maintained lists of scheme beneficiaries, the Social Registry would capture what Kumar called potential beneficiaries — and since everyone in India could potentially, at some point, avail of some government scheme, the system would capture everyone.

But Inslee said he's not wedded to a carbon pricing scheme as the central focus of a climate policy. Carbon taxes are gaining favor among Republicans and oil companies. But a new gas tax triggered fiery protests in France and became a rallying cry over the past few months against carbon taxes that don't directly benefit low- and middle-income workers.
The physical aspect can be challenging ― we do a lot of procedures and I'm on my feet 10 to 12 hours a day typically. The flip side of this is that I do feel very fortunate to have work right now and to be able to contribute to our recovery through the pandemic.
Multiple hurricanes in the U.S. last year ― including Michael and Florence hitting within a month ― and typhoons tearing through Japan and the Philippines were among the major catastrophes that came at a high cost in 2018, according to the Munich Re report.
'Oh, you mean the Gaddafi fellow?'
One reason Medicare for All will get a hard look is that the Democratic Party's increasingly powerful progressives are determined to improve upon the coverage gains made under Affordable Care Act, which has helped many millions get health care but also left many millions still struggling to pay medical bills. A single government insurance plan, progressives say, would be more efficient and effective than Obamacare's awkward mix of private and public plans.
Despite my extensive knowledge about brain injuries in football players, I still wasn't prepared when my son, Paul, died in a reckless motorcycle accident in 2014. His autopsy later revealed he'd been suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by repetitive hits to the head. The same disease has been identified in dozens of deceased former professional football players, including Mike Webster and Junior Seau.
The year, which ties with 2016, rounds off the hottest decade globally ever on record as the impacts of climate change intensify.

Yet regardless of the differences in their respective comfort levels, all couples have an (unspoken) agreed upon level of comfort hat they negotiate on an on-going basis, each partner offering balance in the security/risk continuum, or to use another metaphor the roots and wings.
I was messing around, and I came across this Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings sample … and I was chopping it up and mixing it around. I was doing headphone projects because my wife was super pregnant at the time and my son sleeping. We were in a small place in LA. I couldn't do it like I was at home and turn my guitar up. … I was experimenting, he told HuffPost. The result was the foundation to the song.
Since then, five states ― Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Rhode Island ― and a number of cities ― including New York, Baltimore and Oakland, California ― have accused those companies of breaking U.S. law by hiding the reality of climate change.

New York, the birthplace of the nation's annual climate march, has plenty of its own pollution problems. For example, in Queens, the city's largest borough, the Ravenswood Generating Station has another two years under city law to keep burning 3,264,000 gallons of fuel oil each year, producing annual emissions equivalent to about 500,000 cars. The city is also of the world's top garbage producers, and its recycling services lag behind other major metropoles.

This gives us an opportunity to have a very different set of choices and that's what the election was all about in Georgia last night, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) told HuffPost on Wednesday.
If he had his way, we'd wind up in a very bad state in this country, he said. I mean, the way I understand it, they laughed at Hitler. They all look funny. Hitler looked funny, Mussolini looked funny and other dictators and despots look funny.

Ultimately, however, Smith doesn't ask those questions. The same year Smith's Vibe story was published, LA Times reporter Cheo H. Coker profiled Kelly in a piece titled Media Shy, Music Savvy: R. Kelly ― a writer, producer and singer with the Midas touch. At one point Coker describes Kelly's demeanor as drained, as if the weight of the world is on his shoulders, almost as if questioning Kelly was subjecting him to unjust suffering. Even after Smith opened the doors to discussing Kelly's past, reporters were still hesitant to press the celebrity on what appeared to be his documented marriage to an underage girl, fearing they'd lose access to him.
On Fox & Friends on Monday, Earhardt asked Goodwin about why he thinks Ocasio-Cortez has so much support within the Democratic party.
School operators insist in this meeting essentially that former students would act as con artists, and exploit the rule to bring down good schools like theirs, even when the school leadership did nothing wrong. What kind of scam would that be?

Mais cela n'a été découvert qu'après beaucoup de recherches. Si nous savons aujourd'hui séquencer les génomes, et ce de plus en plus facilement, on ne sait pas si facilement à quoi correspond chaque gène. On ne connait pas directement, quand on voit la mutation dans le génome, l'impact pour le virus, précise la chercheuse.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: Londoners should be avoiding social interaction unless absolutely necessary, and that means they should be avoiding using the transport network unless absolutely necessary. Some 104 people in the U.K. have died after testing positive.
Addiction is a family disease. This nightmare became my reality, I never asked for this, and that is what gets me so angry at times. I woke up, and my entire life changed. It may never be the same. The thing is, even though I am not an addict, I am suffering just as much, though in a different way because the family witnesses helplessly how one lapse in judgment, one wrong decision, one chemical dependency, can ruin everything.
My parents spent every dollar making sure I was at the top of my class for the components they valued: academics and white-collar office skills.

If you can wash your clothes in the hottest water possible recommended for that material, that would be ideal, Nanos said. However, please don't ruin all your clothes by boiling everything, as that will add more stress and anxiety that none of us need right now.
I love my friends and didn't want to step into the ugliness with them. Elections will, thankfully, come and go, you'll vote for the lesser of two evils (your crass uncle, or your less-than-honest aunt), you'll win some and lose some, but friends, they are forever. I wouldn't allow myself to suffer the loss of a friendship over an election. That's just not possible.
Girls who are smiling beside platters of stale, uneaten breakfast items are not enjoying a meal. I should know. I was one of them. Couples who pose for hours in crowded tourist locations to get a perfect Insta shot are not having the time of their lives. They are sweating, stressed, tired and completely blind to the very thing they are trying to get a picture of. I should know. I've been there. These photos make us crave a life that simply doesn't even exist. And then, when we can't achieve it, we feel badly about ourselves. It's sick, and it's gone way too far. So, going forward, I'm making a deal with myself when it comes to Instagram. If I can grab a great shot during an activity I am already doing, in an outfit I am already wearing, in a location I am already going... awesome. I will snap a few photos and make a post. If the shot doesn't work out, at least I have a memory and a blurry candid photo to document it. When I look back on my past adventures now, it's the real, unstaged photos and seemingly pointless selfies that make my heart sing anyway ― not the curated, overedited, completely inauthentic shots. I haven't posted anything on Instagram in over a month but I think I'm ready to give it a go again ― while following my new plan.
Kondo's tidying methods are not necessarily groundbreaking ― making sure every item in a drawer is visible, for example ― but they seem to have struck a nerve with American audiences.
Dr. Gina Kwong from VCA West Los Angeles Animal Hospital suggests taking the time to work on some basic obedience training or learning new tricks. My own dog hates getting wet, so when the weather isn't cooperating, I spend some of our 'walk' time teaching him to 'heel' in the hallway of my apartment building. Learning new behaviors is mentally stimulating and will help keep your dog stay engaged and focused. It's a great way to actively spend time with your dog-- a win-win for you and your pet! Just remember to keep the training sessions relatively short (about 10-15min), especially if it is learning a new behavior, so that your dog doesn't become too frustrated.
Nightengale left the restaurant and was confronted by officers in a parking lot, leading to a shootout in which he was shot and killed, Cook said.

This march is even different from the last one, because of the #MeToo movement and the spotlight on sexual assault victims, Vargas said.

While most new parents need to focus much of their time, energy and resources on the newborn, it's important to recognize that you need to nurture yourself and your relationship once the baby is a couple of months old. There are many parents who struggle to go out on a date after having children due to financial constraints. It's important for partners to engage with one another as adults with a variety of interests other than their kids in order to keep the erotic energy going. You can have sex while your kids are sleeping, but if all you've been doing night after night is reading stories and cleaning up after dinner, the routine can become old and exhausting. It leaves little time to connect romantically and sensually with your partner.― Sari Cooper, sex therapist and director of the Center for Love and Sex NYC

Patronicity's president, Ebrahim Varachia, credited with bringing this model to life, sums up the innovative genius of CrowdGranting: No longer is the grant process solely the home of black box review committees, tedious paperwork, and high administrative costs that eat into the very dollars the grantor seeks to use to improve communities. Our innovation democratizes granting, helping organizations extend their reach while building goodwill in communities. We believe our model will reimagine philanthropy as we know it.

It is code for doing less, said John Holahan, a health policy researcher and fellow at the Urban Institute. It would be literally cuts, of one form or another, if they couldn't live within the caps that they agreed to, which in this situation where we are today, they clearly couldn't. Holahan published a policy brief on Wednesday outlining the negative effects of limiting federal Medicaid spending during the coronavirus pandemic.

Instead, Manchin said, Getting people vaccinated should be the first order of business.
As a child of divorce, I've experienced the sting of loss and I'm fine-tuned to the signs of rejection and abandonment. However, I've always believed that whether they last three months or three decades, relationships can provide their participants with the love, understanding and intimacy they need at the time. Often, the courage to end a relationship that is no longer meeting both partners' needs shows the greatest strength. Growing up in a divorced home taught me that marriage will never be my sole source of happiness so it's important to pursue your dreams to the best of your ability. ― Terry Gaspard, author of Daughters of Divorce: Overcome the Legacy of Your Parents' Breakup and Enjoy a Happy, Long-Lasting Relationship
In terms of the shutdown, President Trump has made it very clear who was responsible, Sanders said.
Jayapal is a leader of a Medicare for All House caucus that had 78 members as of late November and, with an infusion of newly elected Democrats, should soon have more. The new bill will be similar to one she co-sponsored in the last Congress, which in turn was similar to a bill Sanders introduced in the Senate.
But she hasn't explicitly committed to leaving, and the California Democrat — who would have spent 20 years as the top Democrat in the House by then — could always change her mind.
Under the Constitution, Mr. Johnson is barred from execution, Johnson's lawyers wrote in a court filing last week. Decades ago, evidence was presented in Mr. Johnson's capital sentencing hearing that decisively asserted he was not intellectually disabled.

Bolton's pronouncements were the first public confirmation from the administration that the pace of the drawdown had changed since Trump's announcement in mid-December that U.S. troops are coming back now. Trump faced widespread criticism from allies about his decision, including that he was abandoning the Kurds in the face of Turkish threats. Officials said at the time that although many details of the withdrawal had not yet been finalized, they expected American forces to be out by mid-January.
I have never been that person. As a child I always doubted myself and I grew into a woman who has always been timid -- cautious and careful. And while I believe we are created on a spectrum, I believe we can teach ourselves the gift of believing in ourselves. And it starts with the gentle reminder:
The current political environment is going to change dramatically in the next couple of years, he said. 2024 is a long, long ways away.
Perhaps reflecting this, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who ran unsuccessfully against Trump for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016, volunteered last month to argue before the U.S. Supreme Court a widely ridiculed legal challenge to overturn the 2020 election results in four key states. The court refused even to hear the case just days later.

In a post on her website titled What We Need to Learn from the Aziz Ansari Clusterfuck, Jamil says she has no right, nor inclination, to comment, on the assault allegations against Ansari, and instead focuses on the concept of consent.
This has resulted in considerable loss of purchasing power for many countries and billions of consumers, and thus a reorientation of demand at the expense of durable goods, which have become inaccessible to many. Added to this are national trade imbalances - the surpluses of some countries and the deficits of others - that have also acted as a brake on trade.

This exchange illustrates very pointedly that Ross lied to Congress multiple times when he testified that the citizenship addition to the 2020 census originated with a request from the Justice Department. Very clearly, the request from the DOJ was orchestrated by Ross and his staff.
Will the Republican leadership allow Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) to continue serving on the House Judiciary Committee? Like King, Gohmert has an exhaustive history of making remarkably ignorant and racist comments. In June of 2011, Gohmert took to the House floor to accuse Obama of being loyal to the Muslim Brotherhood. Last year, Gohmert introduced a resolution wanting to declare March 31, Cesar Chavez's birthday, as National Border Control Day. Last October, Gohmert floated the idea that the president should invoke martial law to deal with the caravan of immigrants he characterized as gangbangers.

Yep, you read that right. Folks are using CBD for everything, including, it seems, getting it on. So, what the heck is CBD lube used for? Are there any sexual benefits to lubricants with CBD in them?
Pourquoi n'y a-t-il toujours pas de vaccin ? Si la recherche d'un traitement est une course, la recherche d'un vaccin est un marathon. Et le vainqueur est souvent sacré trop tard. Il suffit de regarder derrière nous pour s'en convaincre. Ces vingt dernières années et leur lot d'épidémies offrent en effet un tableau plus que contrasté sur l'issue de cette compétition au vaccin. Le SRAS en 2002, le chikungunya en 2005 ou la fameuse grippe A H1N1 en 2009: autant d'exemples que les Français connaissent bien, mais dont le pic de danger est passé sans qu'il y ait eu recours à la vaccination, ou qu'elle ait été particulièrement utile dans le cas de la grippe A. L'explication dans notre vidéo ci-dessous:

North Carolina revamped its tax code in 2013, and, like the recent federal rewrite, lowered individual rates, cut corporate taxes, and doubled the individual standard deduction.

When Argento pointed out that McGowan had spoken out about Weinstein and inspired others to step forward, the former Charmed star wrote in reply: And not one of those fancy people wearing black to honor our rapes would have lifted a finger had it not been so. I have no time for Hollywood fakery, but you I love, @AsiaArgento #RoseArmy.
No matter how you feel about your former spouse, your children still deserve to love and be loved by their other parent. Unless your ex is truly unfit, you need to support your kids' relationship with him. Trying to change your ex's parenting style is futile and interfering with the bond between him and your children is unfair to your kids. Focus on your own parenting: is there anything you need to change? Develop patience? Improve time management? Set better limits? Have fun? Stop trying to control your ex, or worrying that your kids love him more, and work on yourself instead.

―Three-quarters of the public, including most Republicans, think the shutdown is embarrassing for the country, per an NPR/Ipsos survey released Friday. About 7 in 10 agree that the shutdown will hurt the country and economy, with a similar number saying Congress should pass a bill to reopen the government now while budget talks continue. Just 31 percent want the government to remain closed until a border wall is funded.
Whenever possible, use the hot water setting, as it helps to kill the virus, she said. Extra heat, and time in the dryer, do make sense, as the droplets should dry out, which would likely inactivate the virus.
We did it! Finally cut the cable cord. It was an oddly empowering moment. However within a few weeks of basking in our joy and anticipation of the savings we were going to experience we started getting some rather concerning emails from our former cable company about data overages! We could stream to our hearts content while we paid exorbitant rates for cable that supplied us with an endless supply of channels we never used. The minute we took charge that old pesky cable company somehow infiltrated our lives again with the promise of extra fees. We started getting a daily deluge of emails letting us know for a few more drops of blood ... I mean dollars ... we could keep our overages in check and be safe and complacent again. We were floored. But alas we caved but in our small protest we vowed to neva-eva-eva-eva go hungry again... I mean pay for cable again! ― Lucy Fellows

We cut out cable and tried to replace it with just streaming options, then with those plus PlayStation Vue (because they were the only option for live sports). That was a bust because the internet streaming couldn't keep up with the speed of most sports, plus the DVR options were abysmal [which made missing live game broadcasts not an option]. So we went back! We are the proud payers of a DIRECTV bill and I'm not even sad about it. ― Stephanie Bowen Earley
Los Angeles County officials ordered all nonessential retail businesses, shopping centers and playgrounds to close and banned indoor gatherings of more than 10 people in an effort to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus.
In early February last year, The Intercept reported that Wheeler held fundraisers for Sens. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) and Inhofe in May, five months before his formal nomination to be deputy administrator came before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, on which the senators serve. That same month, HuffPost reported that two nonpartisan groups of regional air pollution regulators accused Wheeler of abusing his power as a Senate aide in the early 2000s to bully and intimidate the organizations when they opposed a bill Inhofe, Wheeler's boss at the time, introduced. In a statement Wednesday, Barrasso, the Environment and Public Works Committee chairman, vowed to push to confirm Wheeler as administrator. Acting Administrator Wheeler has done an outstanding job leading EPA and is well qualified to run the agency on a permanent basis, he said. I will work with committee members to get him confirmed. This story has been updated with statements from Barrasso and Wheeler.

Later Wednesday, Democrat Jon Ossoff was declared the winner over Republican David Perdue, whose Senate term expired Sunday. With Ossoff's win, there will be a 50-50 tie in the Senate, with incoming Vice President-elect Kamala Harris serving as the tiebreaker, giving Democrats control of the Senate.
A concerned Alberta resident posted a picture of the sticker on Facebook in late February. It showed a drawing of the back of a nude female with two hands pulling her braided hair from behind. The word Greta was written across her lower back, and the name of Alberta oilfield firm X-Site Energy Services was printed boldly at the bottom.
That's the image to remember as you look over the issue, the First Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue of the #MeToo Era, as a Vanity Fair article put it. In it you'll find a set of images of gymnast and Larry Nassar survivor Aly Raisman, posed nude with words like Every voice matters, Survivor, and Abuse is never OK written on her body.
I didn't know something could be so terrifying and embarrassing at the same time, she tweeted, alongside a photo of a domestic terrorist wearing face paint and horns, shirtless with his arms flexed in the Congressional chambers. The work papers abandoned by members of Congress mid-certification of the 2020 election results lay strewn around him. Meanwhile, a fellow MAGA rioter stands a few feet away taking photos of him; one can only assume he plans to post them on Instagram. Even in the darkest of moments, it's impossible not to notice the nightmare aesthetics of these wannabe right-wing agents of terror.

But in an increasingly crowded field of mayoral hopefuls, Stringer has distinguished himself as an enthusiastic ally of the city's influential Green New Deal movement, joining protests against new fossil fuel infrastructure and racking up endorsements from unions and socialist firebrand lawmakers alike.
But the incident ― on which Constantinides is scheduled to hold a Feb. 11 hearing ― raised new concerns about the risks of burning fossil fuels for electricity in a residential neighborhood and cast a new light on existing public health problems linked to power plant pollution.

The U.S. now has more than 31,000 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, an increase of more than 10,000 since Saturday, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. At least 390 people across the country have died from COVID-19 and over 176 have recovered from it, the university reported.
According to the USCP union, Liebengood was among those who responded to the violence at the Capitol.
Trump downplayed the seriousness of the virus for six weeks after its rapid spread started raising concerns globally. He falsely claimed it was no worse than the seasonal flu, predicted without any scientific basis that it would disappear on its own come April and accused Democrats and the news media of trying to tank the stock market to hurt his reelection chances.
Neither ALEC nor Mitchell immediately responded to HuffPost's requests to comment.
As the years passed, Manhattan, beloved by male critics who were unbothered by or eager to explain away the movie's troubling sexual undertones, became cemented in film canon. If Kael and Didion couldn't get us to openly acknowledge the flaws in Allen's work, who could? At least now it seems right to go back and examine the catastrophic failures of some critics to tease out these threads. Many critics, including the New York Times' A.O. Scott, are now openly reckoning with the insufficiency of their past criticism of Allen's work, and they're right to do so.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said on Monday morning that her husband, John, had tested positive for the coronavirus. What initially seemed like just a cold progressed into a temperature and bad cough, she said in a statement, adding that when he started coughing up blood, he sought medical help.
And the longer I run the more I realized there is one balloon we shouldn't hold on to. The most blatant of all lies we tell ourselves and some of us dangerously choose to believe. Some of us hold on to that balloon so tightly we can't see any of the others. And it stops us from ever getting to the start line.
It's a gathering together of conservatives fearing the changes that are undermining old social positions and privileges. Its appeal is simple and clear. Vote for the GOP to have the government slow, stop or reverse those trends. The party always links that appeal to a rigid commitment to preserving and strengthening the economy. By this they mean private property, markets and businesses where a dominant class of employers rules over employees.
In his last visit, Biden called Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler roadblocks and urged Georgians to vote for two United States senators who know how to say the word 'yes' and not just 'no.'

Marshall Steinbaum, a progressive economist at the University of Utah, favors using one of the reconciliation bills to repeal all of the Trump tax cuts. Trump's 2017 tax cut bill lowered personal income tax rates, doubled the exemption for the estate tax on the assets of the super-rich and lowered the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.

India is trying to get a totalisation agreement on people who have H1-Bs. A totalisation agreement is how do you square the circle on social security and taxes when you have individuals who split their time between the US and India. That is the next step on to the axiom that Indians are going to continue to dominate H1B visas. But immigration being such a hotbed issue and at the core of Trump's 2016 campaign, and possibly once again in the 2020 campaign, I don't think anyone wants to sort out the H1B visa, right now. It's going to be on the back-burner.
When you work out in the cold, you don't feel like you're sweating as much as you do in the warmer months, said Katie Barrett, an instructor at the fitness studios B/SPOKE and MyStryde and a six-time marathon runner.

It can make it a little easier to detach from this view when we think about how things might be if we both were operating from the same biased view. Recognizing our own tendency (towards greater risk or greater security) can be very helpful in enabling us to let go of the notion that we are right and they are wrong. It goes without saying that this is easier said than done. This however possible and from our own experience well worth the investment of time, energy, and effort that it requires to develop the inner flexibility and openness that such shifts entail.
Thus, in practice, there are only two ways to fix the euro: A far-reaching political union proposed in the Five President's report in 2015 or returning to the system described in the Maastricht Treaty, where member states would be responsible for their own economies only (no bail-out).
According to the Press Association, it will now cost £3,152 to travel between Liverpool and Manchester each year (up £108) and £3,092 between Theresa May's Maidenhead constituency and London (up £104). Meanwhile, an annual pass between Elgin and Inverness has also risen by £100 to £2,904. CBT chief executive Stephen Joseph accused the government of choosing to snub rail passengers by continuing to raise fares while fuel duty is frozen for a seventh consecutive year. The extra money that season ticket holders will have to fork out this year is almost as much as drivers will save, he said. That doesn't seem fair to us or the millions of people who commute by train, especially as wages continue to stagnate. What's good enough for motorists should be good enough for rail passengers. But Mark Carne, chief executive of Network Rail, said passengers would see a huge change in the coming year due to investment in rail networks.
Airports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China, though some health officials and experts have questioned the effectiveness of such screenings.

Still, the biggest motivation for marchers has remained women's rights. At the Women's March 2017, only 61 percent of the people in the crowd said women's rights was the main reason they were out in the crowd, said Dana R. Fisher, a sociology professor at the University of Maryland College Park, who has collected data on past marchers. At Women's March 2018, 92 percent said they were out in the crowd for women's rights.
It's not surprising that a Democratic presidential candidate would shy away from a record supporting the Iraq invasion. It's a deeply unpopular war and has doomed other candidates with primary voters in the past. It's been, in many ways, the defining litmus test for the party in recent years. And in recent days, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is among those challenging Biden for the Democratic presidential nomination, has been going after him for his war vote.

Yet Ukraine's soldiers have been reluctant to seek treatment for post-war mental trauma, Ioana Moldovan, a photojournalist who visited Ukraine in 2015 to document soldiers receiving psychological treatment, told The WorldPost in an email Wednesday. Many soldiers feel that psychologists will prevent them from serving in the army, the International Business Times reported in April. Others avoid talking about emotional problems in general, as mental illnesses have typically been considered a taboo in Ukrainian society.
The challenge is how to scale it and make it sustainable, Anthony Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, said of the upcoming Sunrise Movement tour. One-off rallies in a few cities, for example, might generate a little press and get some temporary action, but the effects are unlikely to last or build sustained support for the policy or, I would argue, build the deeper political power of the climate movement.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday that the entire country would be placed under a full lockdown starting at midnight for 21 days, insisting that this was the only way to tackle the highly infectious disease. As he explained the concept of exponential transmission through data, Modi said India would pay a high price if people didn't follow social distancing measures.

The second explanation for shrinking international trade stems from the general global climate, which has become more protectionist. The IMF notes that, in the 1990s, an average of 30 trade liberalisation agreements were signed annually between countries. But barely ten such agreements have been signed each year since 2011.

And in the midst of all that, my grandmother got sick, and I watched my grandfather do all of the hardest things. The taking care and the letting go. Never once in those last days did he try to control her pace as she drifted. He just left a sacred space between them for her to do what she needed to do in order to walk on.
Sparks: When we did the deliveries in the beginning, we gave them to everybody in the community, no matter how much money they [made]. We were driving our beautifully packaged meals to mansions. And it was just an older couple who was afraid to go out to get groceries and didn't know technology, so they didn't get Instacart. They were lost and hungry. It's not just a financial thing. It's an emotional toll and a mental toll that's taken our community. It's going to go deep.
These ad dollars are devastating in light of the ongoing obesity epidemic in America, which affects almost 26 percent of Hispanic children and 22 percent of black youths, compared with 14 percent of white children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The most important thing is not medication; it's sanitation, Lieberman said. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, people learned how germs worked and started doing things like building more sewers, boiling water for childbirth and making sure drinking water was clean. Countries also got better at distributing food, which decreased starvation, Vijg said.
Her scene with Luke. The first time I put the scene together, it was put together and I tracked a little bit of music in it, and I watched it and I got completely choked up. I mean completely choked up. This was sort of me bringing my love of 'Star Wars' and thinking about what it would be like. These characters that have been apart for so long and here they are together, brother and sister again. It really affected me emotionally, and that was while Carrie was still with us, he said.

If David Frederick is willing to argue against accountability for Shell in court, despite the copious evidence of the company's decades-long campaign to mislead consumers and the public about the existential threat of climate change, they wrote, his appointment would also have wider implications for all communities seeking redress from corporations that lied about the dangers they knew their products would cause.

Democrats may be more readily willing to spike a new rule from the Trump administration that allows religious institutions that take federal contracts to make hiring decisions based on faith. The Labor Department finalized that regulation in December. While the administration claimed the rule encourages the full and equal participation of religious organizations as federal contractors, groups like the American Civil Liberties Union said it amounts to a license for employers to discriminate.

I'm tired of feeling so suppressed and not feeling the love that God wants us to feel, said Pierson, 18. It's time to show what God's love looks like and that his God is unconditional and infinite and reaches everyone, not just straight people and not just celibate gay people.
Sir Vince Cable says the Lib Dem policy of holding a referendum on the final Brexit deal is now much more appealing to voters, despite the party not getting any traction with that message at the snap general election last year. It is six months since the 74-year-old was elected as Lib Dem leader, 30 years since his party was founded and one year until the United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union. Cable is speaking to HuffPost UK on Valentines Day - before meeting his wife Rachel at a nice romantic restaurant down by the river. The chances of stopping it are now quite high, Cable says of Brexit. I take the view the Lib Dems are important players. We have 12 MPs - but we have 100 peers and we have a big army in the country. But we are not going to do this on our own. We've got to do it by working with people in the other parties. It was supposed to be somewhat different. Under Tim Farron, the Lib Dems hoped to entice a large chunk of the 48% who voted 'Remain' to back the party with an overtly pro-EU campaign. But it did not really work. Farron, having had his religious beliefs and views on homosexuality put under the microscope, resigned. He has since said he regrets saying he did not think gay sex was a sin. It wasn't helpful and he acknowledged that himself.
Q. What defines a man today? What will you teach your sons about being a man?
My apology was sincere when it was given, and I made it sincere when I gave it again, and my effort after that, when I gave another one, was just as sincere, he said.

This is not to say that only white dudes (or all white dudes) are fans of unsavory artists like Tarantino or Louis C.K. Plenty of men have been happy to note that they never liked Tarantino anyway, and plenty of women loved Louie and Manhattan and Pulp Fiction and have been struggling, in the aftermath of unsavory allegations, to resolve their admiration of the art with the personal crimes of the artists. (Personally, I never had the stomach for Tarantino films ― blood makes me queasy ― but I grew up on Allen's daffy early films and liked a decent amount of Louis C.K.'s comedy.)

Because while the first round of damage happens before we come out of the closet, the second, and maybe more severe, comes afterward.
Cities can, and must, lead the way in accelerating this critical transition to renewable energy sources. As home to half the world's population and generating 80 percent of global GDP, cities are where the future is happening now.
Did you see them playing games with the $2,000 stimulus relief this week? Warnock asked to a chorus of horn honks. I mean, people are facing eviction. Folks are feeling pain. They've waited for relief for months.
A. Pick a Job, Not a Career
Did you ever flirt with the idea of having her do any of those things?
Narcissists will grill you about getting passed up for a promotion at work or joke about where you went to college, but they'll get unnerved if you put them in a similar hot seat, Malkin said.
Biden's plan to change the vaccine distribution plan was first reported by CNN.
The letter, led by Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and co-signed by Reps. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.), Chip Roy (R-Texas), Ken Buck (R-Colo.), Kelly Armstrong (R-N.D.), Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) and Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), included support for debunked claims of fraud touted by Trump and his allies, but said should Congress move to reject Biden's victory, it would amount to stealing power from the people and the states.
But, in Trump's version, when the war bankrupted the Soviet Union, it became Russia.
There's a one-word answer: EGO. But it'll take more than one blog to address that story.
After all, Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava, in the second century Mishnah, reports of a tarnegol - a rooster of some kind - that was put to death in Jerusalem for killing a child. With their dinosaur-like legs, their hawk-like, banded feathers, their buzzard-like necks, and their general attitude of indifference, these birds lent sudden credence to that tale. 'Gang,' by the way, is the correct collective noun, and apt - by contrast to domesticated butterballs who, as a group, are called a 'rafter.'
The problem of the euro can be visualized in the development of the GDP per capita (see Figure 1). Germany has been successful in the Eurozone, while Greece and Italy have not. France is not doing well either. The jury is still out for Finland.
The Democratic sweep in Tuesday's Georgia Senate runoff probably won't alter much of the incoming Biden administration's reform agenda. Progressive hopes for everything from action on climate change to judicial reform remain limited, if not nonexistent. Even without the pandemic, the country and the world are marching steadily toward various modes of destruction.
Ninety-two percent of Democrats said supported the concept, including 93 percent of liberal Democrats and 90 percent of moderate to conservative Democrats.
As an outspoken actor and activist, Ashley Judd is no stranger to online misogyny. On a near daily basis she receives threats of sexual and physical violence and heinous photoshopped images of herself online. In a newly released TED Talk, Judd makes a powerful statement about why online harassment is so damaging, and whose responsibility it is to tackle it.
McGuire says Amy stood up and cried at the gesture. I sat down with her, untied my boots, and slid off the top layer of my fuzzy warm socks and handed them to her. She said they were the nicest shoes she's ever had, wrote McGuire.
7. They Fail to Develop People's Skills
My focus is going to be on impeachment, Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent running for the Democratic nomination, told reporters. He said his supporters would keep working to defeat the most dangerous president in American history.
But sometimes you want to return that impulse buy (our impulses are not always good ones).
Here's another anti-rotation variation that's even more challenging than the single-leg planks above.
More than 10,000 years later, the numbers look eerily similar.
Biden, who drew criticism for leaving New Hampshire well before results came in, held a caucus day celebration in Nevada after voting, unlike Sanders, who spent the day campaigning in Texas — a Super Tuesday state.
Goodwin responded by saying that young people today are not being educated properly in schools and don't know the history of our country.
Angelica explained that they saw the standard images of beauty their child saw on television and in toys and began searching for dolls that looked like their daughter and found nothing. So, they created a doll and over time found a change in their daughter's attitude.
Farmers, he explained, grew more food, creating larger populations that lived in close quarters, often with domestic animals. This spread infectious diseases (and still does — remember swine and bird flu?). While hunter-gatherers found varied diets for themselves, those early farmers were actually more likely to suffer from malnutrition. Their skeletons showed more evidence of things like anemia and stress lines. They died on average around age 20, estimates one 2007 study. That's 10 years younger than hunter-gatherers.
Brigit Helms, the general manager of the Multilateral Investment Fund, also has served as the director of SPEED, a USAID-funded program in Mozambique, and a senior expert for financial inclusion at McKinsey & Company. She has a PhD in agriculture and development economics from Stanford.

But Frontier was not without its detractors.
Federal officials put the CDC solely in charge of developing a test for the virus and left out private interests, a choice that cost precious time when the resulting CDC test proved faulty.
Natural disasters worldwide in 2018 cost a total of about $160 billion ― significantly higher than the average over the last 30 years of about $140 billion (adjusted for inflation).
You're a fucking idiot and I hope child protective services take away your rights, she yelled. You cannot give a diabetic a burger, you bitch! If your son dies, it's your fault!
On a typical day, I come in around 5 to 6 a.m. to try to get my administrative and research work caught up, then go see patients in the ICU all morning. Depending on how busy it is, that can bleed over into the afternoon. I otherwise usually have operations and research meetings all afternoon since I'm part of our pandemic response team.
Back in 1966 when John Denver wrote 'Leaving on a Jet Plane', air travel was so much simpler. Here's how old I am. I remember the Chad Mitchell Trio's recording of the song from 1967 and Peter, Paul and Mary's 1970 version. So wish me luck on my Cuban adventure and, as the song says, Tell me that you'll wait for me...'Cause I'm leavin' on a jet plane... Oh babe, I hate to go.

Marco and Alvin/YouTube Mystery Brand videos have gone viral on YouTube.
The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Jan. 12 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.
In early December, the doctor says she needs one to two months to heal but does not say how much longer she will need 24-hour care. We cling to the hope that she will be able to stay by herself soon, at least some of the time.
When handling or preparing food, the government recommends following standard food safety practices, like washing hands and surfaces often, separating raw meat from other foods, refrigerating food, and cooking food to the appropriate temperature.
The bill narrowly passed out of the committee by one vote.
Billionaire and former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg said Tuesday that his nonprofit Bloomberg Philanthropies would be donating $40 million to combat the global COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in developing nations.
Again, make sure your planks are rock solid before trying this variation. Ego has no place here, and nobody will think you're badass if your ass is sagging under loaded planks (your lower back won't be too happy either).
Inspired by such virtuosos, we can't help but ask the question: How talented are we? It's almost impossible not to know their work and crave a piece of genius.
Lawley has formally apologized for the video, and said he agrees with the studio's decision to drop him from the film.
She said the current wave of feminism that demands equal rights and accountability for out-of-bounds behaviour is new to society, which is why there's a backlash.

We're all in this together. Let's remember that.
In April 2016, Randall and her husband, Jeff Ellis, welcomed their first child, a baby boy named Breck. And this month she'll compete in her fifth Winter Olympics.
The stated goal of this weekend's mission is to thank U.S. federal and state lawmakers for their efforts and support during the drawn-out negotiations to replace NAFTA, and to celebrate the imminent dawn of the USMCA, which needs only Canada to formally ratify the agreement. Most experts anticipate it will be the law of the land in all three countries by mid-summer.
Since his election in 2013, Francis has taken some steps to root out sexual abuse in the Church and to put in place practices to protect children. But victims' groups say he has not done enough, particularly to hold to account bishops who tolerated sexual abuse or covered it up.
Using a single-leg stance will reduce your base of support and add an anti-rotational component.
A first line of defense is to increase light exposure, Hartstein said. Get outside during the day, even if you have to bundle up, and get more vitamin D and exposure to sunlight. For mild cases, this change alone can have lasting benefits.
Randall has been skiing since she was a year old. She made her Olympic debut at 19 at the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City, and later competed at the games in Turin, Vancouver and Sochi. In 2007, she became the first American woman to win a World Cup title in cross-country skiing.
Myth #8: You should wait until you can choose the exact type of vaccine you'd like.
Evanston police Sgt. Ken Carter said Nightengale appeared to have a connection to Evanston, but he did not have further details. He said Sunday that an outside agency would take over the investigation since Evanston police were involved in the fatal shooting.
When asked Friday why he would not just reopen the government and negotiate over the border wall later, Trump said, We won't be opening until it's solved.
In the Amatrice-Norcia region, it seems that the earthquakes cascaded along the huge fault system to the west of the Bove, Vettore and Gorzano mountain. About 70km in length, this fault system - named Amatrice-Monte Vettore - is one of the largest in Italy. And one of those across which the Earth's crust is stretching apart.
While numbers people want you to make all decisions based on data, know-it-alls want you to make decisions based on just their knowledge. They often give feedback like Well if I were you, I would have done it like this, or Well, it only took me three months, Brown said. Know-it-alls are unable to account for times when their information is limited or outdated.
This is an historic change. If the WTO forecast for 2016 were to be confirmed, world trade would have risen less rapidly than world GDP, which grew between 2.2% and 2.9% in the first half of 2016.
Psychologists in Ukraine are working to change that.
There are fears the transmission could accelerate as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel during the Lunar New Year holiday, although many have canceled their plans.
Israel's small size may also be helping. With fewer than 8 million people living within a relatively thin strip of land, the national government can make and implement policy directly without a lot of delegation to lower-level governments, organizations and officials. That's not really practical in countries with many tens of millions, let alone the 330 million who live in the U.S.
The early voting bill required each county to establish an early voting period that begins 10 days before election day and concludes two days before it. That period must include two full weekends and counties must establish one early voting site for every 50,000 voters up to seven sites, but could vote to authorize more.

Moving Judges To The Border ― And Slowing Deportation Cases
5. Change the tone of the conversation.
For Delta, American Airlines and United Airlines, those measures include banning passengers from carrying firearms in checked luggage on flights to Washington starting this weekend, with United saying its policy would go through Jan. 23. The only exceptions to this rule are authorized law enforcement officials and active-duty military members traveling on Defense Department orders.
We face weeks and weeks of worry, while waiting for more answers.
In a twist, a right-wing commentator seemingly alluded to Sanders' words on Tuesday. Erick Erickson, a vocal conservative critic of Trump, suggested on Twitter that, if GOP lawmakers cave to the president's border demands, it is only a matter of time before a progressive President declares climate change a national emergency and uses eminent domain to shutter coal plants, etc.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a letter to colleagues that while there is no doubt of Biden's victory, their job now is to convince more of the American people to trust in our democratic system.
Scholars say textbooks like these, with their alternate versions of history and emphasis on Christian national identity, represent one small part of the conditions that lead to events like last week's riot at the U.S. Capitol, an episode that was permeated with the symbols of Christian nationalism. Before storming the Capitol, some groups prayed in the name of Jesus and asked for divine protection. They flew Christian and Jesus 2020 flags and pointed to Trump's presidency as the will of God. The linkage between Christian beliefs and the violent attack on Congress has since pushed evangelical leaders to confront their own relationship with Trump and their support for the rioters.
Such accommodations for Army service members were previously made on a case-by-case basis.
The WRF's goal is not necessarily to become the biggest, as De Leeuw puts a strong emphasis on the quality of the event. It's impossible to measure impact. Not everybody understands the complexity of the problem. For instance, someone asked asked us to measure the difference between the pollution and resource use before and after the conference. We started to laugh out loud.
It could be used before sex to make the body get ready quicker since it promotes muscle relaxation, blood flow and arousal, Urman said.
The Camp fire could come at a serious cost to power company PG&E. Dozens of Camp fire victims have sued the utility for its alleged role in the blaze, saying it did not properly maintain its power lines. Their lawsuit points to PG&E documents that indicated a failing transmission line was in the area where the massive blaze was believed to have started.
A 19th-century village cathedral in western Germany was razed to the ground on Tuesday to make way for the expansion of coal mega mines.
Becker has categorically denied any wrongdoing. Yet Sanders' main campaign committee denounced his alleged actions and said he would not be part of any future work.
As alternatives to live television ― such as Sling TV, YouTube TV and Hulu Live ― improve and other streaming services ― like Netflix and Amazon Prime ― add better original programming, it's become increasingly tempting to cut the cord.
At least four airlines announced additional security measures on Thursday as federal and local officials began increasing protection around the Capitol after supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the building in a deadly riot last week that led Congress to impeach him a second time.
In a follow up tweet, the Treasury Secretary encouraged taxpayers to do just that.
Smith seemed to have survived where Whisenhunt did not. The Buccaneers changed all that in a heartbeat.
Michael Powers, the head of New York state's corrections officers union, confirmed Weinstein's diagnosis to Reuters on Sunday.
Ocasio-Cortez, 29, was sworn in to Congress on Thursday, after being the youngest woman elected to the chamber. She campaigned on a fiercely anti-Trump agenda and has promised to be a leading voice on a slew of left-leaning issues, including climate change, immigration and health care.
Before the federal prison policy changed, Colorado and New York City had already passed legislation requiring free menstrual supplies for female inmates in state and local institutions.
I will approve of myself, my characteristics, my abilities, my likes and dislikes, my inclinations and disinclinations, realizing that these form my unique individuality. I have them for a reason.
And that brings up that this document, notably, is targeted at the upcoming Conservative leadership race.
I think it's about both sides failing to progress the issue beyond a top heavy approach. For the longest time in the post Cold War-era, the relationship has largely been dependent on the political chemistry between the two heads of state, whether it is a Bush and Manmohan, who enjoyed working together, or Obama and Manmohan, where Obama revered Manmohan Singh's advice on macroeconomics even when it came to the eurozone crisis. There is a lot of personality driven partnership and camaraderie there. The same for Modi and Obama and Modi and Trump as it was for Clinton and Vajpayee.
Fast-forward five decades and Seikatsu, which in Japanese means daily life, is now a sprawling operation of nearly 400,000 members (about 90 percent of whom are women) that runs its own milk factory and has food supply agreements with about 200 outside producers. In addition, some of the production ― for example, of jam and baked goods like cookies ― is now done by workers collectives that are part of the cooperative.
WASHINGTON (AP) — The extraordinary Republican effort to overturn the presidential election was condemned Sunday by an outpouring of current and former GOP officials warning the effort to sow doubt in Joe Biden's win and keep President Donald Trump in office is undermining Americans' faith in democracy.

I emphasize that violence has and most likely will occur, she wrote. The prevailing climate is such that a state of riot could occur at any second, without warning.
If you want your partner to be more loving, then you need to be more loving. If you want your partner to be more forgiving, then you need to be more forgiving. If you want your partner to be more patient, then act more patiently towards him/her.
The newly elected representative tweeted that she got under his skin and that she'd say we'd be taxing 70% of Trump's income, but he probably hasn't made more than $10 million in years - and that's the real reason he's hiding his taxes.
The first person I was with when they died was my mother. I hovered with her for hours in a place between here and there. A place unique as breath that seems deep and then shallow. I could accompany her just so far. Her last breath was the deepest ― then I felt she had gone. A palpable disappearance of her person. All of her.
Arana came to the states just 13 years ago, in 2003, in pursuit of a crash course in English after graduating with a business administration and marketing undergraduate degree in his home country. He had an aunt living in Santa Barbara. He quickly ran out of the $120 cash he had come to the states with. After his aunt declined to loan him money for a beer, he became motivated to work. Without speaking any English, Arana's prospects were limited. He found a job at a local restaurant as a busboy. When his english improved, he waited tables and eventually became licensed as a real estate agent after taking note of what some of his wealthy customers did for a living. His first condo sale came from a fellow waiter.
I run the Doula Program to Accompany and Comfort, a nonprofit organization that trains, carefully matches and supervises men and women who visit a person facing the end of their lives alone. For many individuals, the relationship with our Doula Volunteer is the only consistent relationship in their lives as their illness progresses and medical and social services change. We will visit weekly until this person dies. We also consult for hospitals and community organizations nationally and internationally.
Symptoms of SAD are similar to those of depression but appear during specific times of year (late fall until early spring), which is how it differs from traditional depression, explained Jennifer L. Hartstein, a New York-based child, adolescent and family psychologist.
For now, Pelosi has secured another term, and the Democrats waiting in the wings will have to wait a while longer.

The Vancouver-based company said it will take a $1.13-billion writedown on the Frontier project in Alberta, which was expected to create an estimated 7,000 construction jobs, 2,500 operating jobs and about $12 billion in federal income and capital taxes, but was also expected to produce about four million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions per year over 40 years.
Gaither recommends looking at the ingredients of any CBD lubricant and avoiding any with chemicals and artificial scents. Oil-based ones might degrade latex in condoms, making them less effective, so look for a lube that's water-based, Gaither said.
Baltimore's state's attorney, Marilyn Mosby, ordered her staff to drop all pending charges for a bevy of crimes, including drug possession or attempted distribution, prostitution and minor traffic violations.
Successful brands are 'human brands' in that they evidence evolved human behaviours such as the ability to adapt, simplify, actively listen and speak clearly. As part of this, human brands need to understand where their brand can best connect across the spectrum of human relationships. We needed to move the relationship people have with belVita from more of a low awareness 'Casual Acquaintance' to a 'Friends with Benefits' (FWB) relationship – which is still not brand love right now, but more of a benefit-led value exchange. Another good example of this relationship type would be EasyJet. belVita, with its slow release energy to keep going through the whole morning, seemed like a perfect candidate as an FWB.
My parents always had an open and transparent philosophy with me. That means our family does not have any questions that are off-limits, though I do sometimes get low-quality answers on controversial subjects. I think they regret their open philosophy after being forced to explain to me some words and concepts from the Game of Thrones books. I have a provocative personality. So my parents remind me (more like, threaten me) that I have to respect the boundaries other parents might have and I should not share controversial knowledge with my friends.
State agencies are already making a push. Last June, New York's Department of Public Service issued a report outlining an energy storage roadmap. In December, the state's Public Service Commission released a plan requiring utilities such as ConEdison to procure a total of 350 megawatts of storage as part of a broader blueprint to decrease the state's dependence on fossil-fueled peaker plants. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority earlier vowed to conduct a study on how to move every sector in the state to 100 percent renewable energy, although Politico reported last week that the report had not been made public by the end of 2018 as promised.
Democrats' sweep of the Georgia runoff elections puts the party at an even 50-50 split in the Senate, and when Vice President-elect Kamala Harris is inaugurated on Jan. 20, she will have the tie-breaking vote.
At one rally in Delhi, Bisht falsely said that Kejriwal is feeding biryani to the protesters in Shaheen Bagh. At another, Shah called on voters to choose between Modi and Shaheen Bagh, and publicly lied, claiming that protestors were demanding Jinnah wali azadi.
Richard Benedict, one of Johnson's special education teachers at the facility, described him as a likable kid who needed a high level of structure and support to survive. I knew he'd never make it on his own, Benedict said in an interview. Johnson was self-conscious about being stupid, as he put it to Benedict. He wanted to be liked and could be talked into things that would get him in trouble in his pursuit of acceptance.
We do not have clinical data as to whether the vaccine prevents people from developing asymptomatic COVID infection that they can transmit to others, Robinette said. That type of immunity is referred to as 'sterilizing immunity,' the idea being that the person not only doesn't get sick, but is also 'sterilized' of the virus.
Today is a very special day. It has never happened before and it will never happen again. And we have no idea what will come next.
The state's attorney also urged Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) to release all inmates over the age of 60 in state prisons, as well as a slew of other prisoners, including those that are scheduled to finish their sentences in the next year.
The remarks came hours after the White House's daily coronavirus briefing, in which Trump claimed that the U.S. will see more deaths by keeping the restrictions in place than by COVID-19 itself.
Air pollution is an equal-opportunity toxin. But recent studies show that it affects the mortality of women and people of color much more than others; children in low-income, often minority communities suffer disproportionately from the impacts of air pollution. As an African-American mother of four beautiful children, all of whom suffer from asthma, the dangers of air pollution hit home with me more than most.
A 2013 Supreme Court ruling, Shelby County v. Holder, notably struck down a key section of the Voting Rights Act by allowing states ― particularly jurisdictions with a history of discriminatory practices ― to change their election laws without pre-clearance from the federal government. Activists and elected officials have long decried the ruling as enabling voter suppression.
In her tweet, Thunberg quoted an especially condemning excerpt from the piece: If an alcoholic assured you he was taking his condition very seriously, but also laying in a 40-year store of bourbon, you'd be entitled to doubt his sincerity.
It's important to understand how much exercise and diet can contribute to mental health. Start exercising, Melchor said, noting that CrossFit worked for her. The activity really helps manage emotions, get rid of anger, elevates mood and [helps you] learn to feel both good in your body and the power of your body, she added.
The climate movement underwent an unprecedented surge since 2018, when United Nations scientists warned that governments had a decade to cut planet-heating emissions in half or doom the world to catastrophic, irreversible warming. The findings made clear that politically unpopular schemes to put a price on carbon emissions and incrementally transition from fossil fuels, which had until then dominated the climate policy mainstream, could not alone deliver the economic changes needed.
Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, who has been travelling the country meeting with premiers and others in a bid to mend some of the deep divisions exposed by the election, said she and the prime minister already have lots of respect for Manitoba.
Civil rights activist Gloria Richardson was one of several people who marched in Cambridge, Maryland, in 1963, fighting for desegregation. She wrote a telegram to U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy that year amid escalating violence in the small town. There had been gunshots, molotov cocktails and other violence at their demonstrations.
Those moves, Cohen noted, could generate considerable savings, creating new revenue even if Republicans won't agree to any tax increases.
Thankfully, there have been no reported deaths. But this series of earthquakes adds to those that struck the same region over the past year and have left many Italians feeling helpless and traumatised.
For years, that expectation has shaped clinical practice. And for years, everyone from midwives to self-appointed natural birth advocates have railed against Friedman's benchmark, arguing that it incorrectly treats as abnormal any labor that does not hew to this rigid, somewhat arbitrary pattern.
He continued, bizarrely: All of a sudden, 'Well, maybe I'm going to hang on to that old clunker for another five years because I can't afford another new home because the government's taking a bigger portion of my income every year.'

Crucially, the CRA requires only a simple majority of senators to get a disapproval resolution through the Senate. That's good for Democrats, who will only control 50 seats in the Senate and have to rely on Vice President-elect Kamala Harris for tie-breaking votes.
HuffPost Canada spoke to an oil worker who said the sticker was being handed out to workers at oil fields across central Alberta as promotional material to be worn on hard hats.
Other conversations are clear-eyed about who was responsible for the riot — and more sympathetic. Just heard a report shots fired inside the Capital!!

Often the most stressful part of a party is parking before it begins, when guests start parking near me. There I am: a princess, sitting in a Nissan, taking selfies and silly videos on my iPhone. I don't want a child to see that!
Infectious disease expert and Manhattan physician Matt McCarthy sounded the alarm Monday about the critical lack of available testing for the new coronavirus, blasting it as a national scandal that has hamstrung health care professionals.
• What went wrong: Well, the record speaks for itself. Take out Tennessee's Week 1 wins the past two seasons and Whisenhunt was a ghastly 1–20. Even with a roster in need of significant rebuilding, that's a tough sell in this league. Marcus Mariota's arrival also could not save Whisenhunt, despite Whisenhunt's reputation as a bit of a QB guru.
The program is the third emergency facility since the 2008 financial crisis that the Fed has established in response to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.
Republican lawmakers' massive tax plan appears to be on the cusp of legislative victory. From a public opinion standpoint, that may not be such a good thing.
Stopping gun violence takes courage, the courage to do what's right, the courage of new ideas, she said. Now is the time to come together, be responsible ― Democrats, Republicans, everyone. We must never stop fighting. Fight, fight, fight. Be bold, be courageous. The nation's counting on you.
Many Albertans also noted that the manifesto doesn't reflect their experiences.
GOP perceptions about Trump's standing in his party have also changed. Just 48% of Republican and Republican-leaning voters now think that most or all congressional Republicans support Trump, down from 65% in December. There's less movement in these voters' own loyalties: A 41% plurality of Republican and Republican-leaning independents who voted for Trump in this year's presidential election say they consider themselves more supporters of Trump than of the Republican Party, indicating little change from the 42% who said the same last month.
There's clearly a narrative being built here of Milk as villain. But last week, I thought this was mostly playful — that Milk was in on the joke as she shaded the other queens in confessionals. Even this week's sad humblebrag about doing her Celine impression for the Canadian singer's wedding planner comes across as more pitiful than haughty.

Less than a year ago, AAP did not win even one of Delhi's seven seats in the Lok Sabha elections, even though it fielded candidates like Atishi, a Rhodes scholar, who was an advisor to Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and is widely credited with improving Delhi's government schools.
Not only does having a proper mise en place set you up for success, it also sets you up for a relaxing cooking experience. Going through its motions can alleviate stress in and of itself, and provide rituals and benefits that can ease a troubled mind.
Canada's deputy chief public health officer Dr. Howard Njoo told the House of Commons health committee Thursday that it will take more than the health system to curb the spread of the virus if it hits Canada.
Unique among major law enforcement agencies, the roughly 2,000-officer department that secures Congress isn't subject to a transparency law that allows the public to access official records. As a branch of Congress, which is excluded from FOIA, no such law applies to the Capitol Police. When presented with FOIA requests, it's common for the agency's counsel to respond simply that it doesn't have to comply. In 2005, Congress passed a law that gave the Capitol Police more latitude to shield records the department deemed sensitive from public disclosure.
But other attendees simply believed that Sanders is the politician most authentically committed to enacting Medicare for all, free college and the dramatic measures needed to combat climate change.
He added: Once you figure out the moment where it's going to happen, you may get some hope — and then it's all going to go away.

The Chinese government has tried to stir confusion about the virus's origin. It has promoted theories, with little evidence, that the outbreak might have started with imports of tainted seafood, a notion rejected by international scientists and agencies.

My father worked at Shell Oil Company for many years, and while on the Seventh Circuit, in an abundance of caution, I have recused myself from cases involving those Shell entities with which he was involved, she wrote in an answer to a questionnaire during her Senate confirmation hearings in October on her Supreme Court nomination by President Donald Trump.
Following confirmation that a member of his staff is among those who tested positive for the coronavirus, Vice President Mike Pence said at a press conference that he and his wife will be tested soon. The staffer is doing well, Pence added, and has not been in the White House since Monday.
AAP's win capped a months-long campaign that highlighted the party's achievements which included free neighbourhood clinics, a focus on Delhi's government-run schools, free travel on public buses for women, and sharply reduced tariffs on water and electricity. The party, born out of Anna Hazare's anti-corruption movement, also reminded voters that it had run a largely scam-free government.
This study envisions spending about $1 trillion per year on direct air capture alone. That amounts to roughly 5% of the United States' annual gross domestic product, a percentage the researchers gleaned from the average budget the country has spent fighting every major conflict since the Civil War. Then Hanna and his team looked at the maximum rate at which various technologies have been developed and deployed in times of crisis, including U.S. warships in the 1940s and French nuclear power plants in the aftermath of World War II, and arrived at 20% as a usable average.

Take care of delicate ingredients. If I'm garnishing, I'll set my herbs in a glass of water to keep crisp, Springer says. And if I'm using more delicate herbs or flowers, I'll set them on a wet paper towel to keep fresh for plating later. Just be cognizant that some ingredients ― anything beyond hardy aromatics like onions and vegetables and meats ― might need a gentler touch.

The announcement from Mayor Bill de Blasio came roughly a week after the Democrat was inaugurated for a second term. It marks his strongest action yet to address global warming and its associated sea-level rise, which devastated the city with massive flooding during Superstorm Sandy in 2012.
President Donald Trump is insisting that Congress give him $5.7 billion to build a wall on the border with Mexico, a proposition Democrats describe as a costly and immoral boondoggle. With talks at a standstill in Washington, the president headed to the border on Thursday to make his case for the wall. He said he is considering declaring a national emergency to get the funding Democrats have denied him, a maneuver all but certain to be challenged in court.

We aren't quite there yet, though. As Jericho Apo, digital strategist at The Story Of Stuff, a community of people working to change our consumption-crazed culture, told HuffPost, we still live in a very consumer-driven economy, heavily influenced by materialism.

My parents came to the U.S. from Taiwan in 1982, lured by the opportunity to build a new life. They adopted Western names, William and Mimi, to better assimilate into American society. While my father had dabbled as a small-time soap opera actor and my mother briefly studied fashion design, they hung up these dreams for more sensible endeavors: working as a waiter and waitress in a family friend's restaurant. As the children of Chinese Nationalists who lost everything when they retreated to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War in 1950, they simply understood when it was time to grow up.

My depression and self-loathing didn't go away, because moving doesn't simply fix that, and after a year of suicidal thoughts and generally despising myself, I finally sought help at my school's counseling center.
It was a mistake to trust that they [President George W. Bush's administration] weren't going to go to war. They said they were not going to go to war, he added. They said they were just going to get inspectors in. The world, in fact, voted to send inspectors in, and they still went to war. From that point on, I was in the position of making the case that it was a big, big mistake, and from that point on, I moved to bring those troops home.
Through a handful of failed relationships in my late 20s, I unearthed a whole slew of unpleasant side effects that I carried with me into adulthood: difficulty showing weakness and asking for help, a constant need to be the best, and endlessly seeking external approval.
There are strong reasons to think Republicans will get that wish. In the HuffPost/YouGov poll, barely more than a third of Americans who opposed the tax bill said they were following its progress very closely. Just 13 percent of those opponents named it among the two issues most important to them. Overall among opponents, the tax bill ranked seventh on a list of 12 issues. Health care ranked first, as it has for much of this year. If that doesn't change, the tax bill's unpopularity may not help its opponents electorally in the way Obamacare did — and continues to do.

There's a lot of unpredictability with this chronic condition. Each time my child wakes up with a stomachache or dizzy spell, my first response is to check his numbers. At one point, I shook a sleeping William for half an hour because his blood glucose number dipped down to the 30s. The normal blood glucose range is between 70 and 99 when not eating. Anything under 50 on the glucose monitor can mean that only a shot of Glucagon ― a hormone that could possibly spike William's sugar to an exceptionally high number within minutes ― could keep my son alive.
Medical experts believe that you may have temporary immunity against the coronavirus, not unlike other illnesses like the common cold.
In hindsight, so many signs of his condition were there. William was constantly thirsty for months. We told him to stop drinking so much juice and suggested water. I could sometimes hear him using the bathroom two or three times throughout the night, and he started to have bed-wetting accidents. My husband and I would change the sheets, instruct him not to drink anything an hour before bed and told him to try to get some sleep. There were days where William felt groggy, but I brushed it off as him wanting an excuse to skip school.

However, Modi did not announce any economic relief package, raising concerns about how people with low incomes will survive if they are unable to work for 21 days. News reports have said that poor migrant laborers who have been trying to reach their homes in the midst of the lockdown have been harassed and beaten up by the police. The prime minister also did not clearly outline how Indians could access food, medicine and other essential goods.

The change comes as governments across the country urge Canadians to engage in social distancing to slow the spread of the virus.
One example is the case of economic standstill in terms of growth. I have come to the realization that serious and deep innovative thinking in economic policy is needed to overcome the period of slow growth, as coined by Willem Buiter, chief economist of Citigroup Global. I believe the traditional ways of handling economic policy need to be revised. Simply because, the known developed-world has been saturated and new ideas do not easily reach the decision-making top, thus there is greater rigidity to change. This is a rather oxymoron phenomenon, as the developed world gives the impression of being open and welcoming to new ideas...

Geopolitical competition in global trade agenda-setting among the US, the European Union and emerging powers, such as China and India, and increasingly popular protectionism rhetoric in national trade debates also explain the failure or lack of cooperation in the multilateral trading system.
SANTÉ - Même l'armée a été mobilisée. Pékin a annoncé samedi 25 janvier avoir envoyé des médecins militaires au coeur de l'épidémie du nouveau coronavirus, partie de Wuhan. Cette ville de 11 millions d'habitants d'où est parti le virus qui a désormais atteint la France a été la première placée sous quarantaine et depuis ce samedi, la circulation des automobile y est presque interdite. Les accès à plusieurs autres villes ont été fermées, ce qui fait que près de 50 millions de Chinois sont confinés.En parallèle, la Chine a également fermé les accès à certains lieux emblématiques du pays comme certains tronçons de la Grande muraille ou Disneyland. Parmi les mesures drastiques prises par les autorités, on peut également citer les tests quasi automatiques pratiqués dans les transports en commun ou la construction d'un nouvel hôpital en une dizaine de jours seulement. L'objectif est clair: éviter la propagation du virus qui a touché 1300 personnes et causé la mort d'une quarantaine de patients. Plus de transparence et de rapidité

All costumes, accessories and wigs are provided by the companies I work for; however, I provide my own makeup, colored contacts and the more intimate articles, such as tights, wig caps and character shoes. Makeup expenses certainly add up, but to be honest, I've never really gone to the trouble to see just how much I spend. One of these days, I'll pay attention to how important it is to file work expenses for taxes ... but today is not that day.

As the authors note, these dire projections are roughly consistent with recent research from other scientists using different models and assumptions: see here, here, here, and here. And they also dovetail with the findings of California's Fourth Climate Change Assessment, released in August. As a result of projected warming, Sierra Nevada snowpacks will very likely be eradicated below about 6,000 feet elevation and will be much reduced by more than 60% across nearly all of the range, the report found. The Fourth National Climate Assessment, released without fanfare by the Trump administration the day after Thanksgiving, offered similar warnings about fast-vanishing snowpacks in the West.
Don't anticipate schools are going to open up in a week. Please don't anticipate in a few weeks, Newsom said during a news conference, according to the Los Angles Times. I would plan, and assume, that it's unlikely that many of these schools — few, if any — will open before the summer break.Almost every school district in the state is closed, impacting more than 6 million students in public schools. Districts have continued to teach via online classes and homework. Kansas also closed all state-accredited schools, representing nearly 500,000 students, for the rest of the school year on Tuesday.
Liberty Counsel in and of itself isn't the problem. (It certainly is a problem, just not the problem.) A Christianity that uses the pulpit to teach discriminatory ideologies and Christian superiority is. The group is a case study of what happens when politics and Christianity are so tied that Christians cannot or even refuse to see the people that policies are supposed to represent. Many religious people have consistently used the intersection of their understanding of Scripture and the law to dehumanize.

After the first Women's March, Wruble went on to found March On, the broad coalition of sister marches outside Washington. Asked if she and the Women's March Inc. leaders have reconciled, said no, but she told Yahoo News, Historically, all social movements have had rifts and splits, and I don't know why we would expect something different from such a large and broad movement as the Women's March movement. When these points of friction come up, it gives us an opportunity for everyone to learn from them. Ultimately, it makes the movement stronger, and I have absolutely no concern that the Women's March movement isn't going anywhere. It is unstoppable.
The first response I'd have offered to your questions is, How would you know? A teacher who gives all the answers and assumes the questioner will take the shape of empty, ignorant vessel disserves both student and himself. A good teacher wants to know how the inquirer is expecting to learn. How does she think one can know of things above? Does she want to be told what is so, like a child? Is she ready to go higher? Am I a Christian? you asked. How would you know? Who, in your conception of reality, has the right, the power, even the duty to tell you what is so with the things of God?

Then, a month after the election, having escaped unscathed, one of my dearest friends of over forty years, a person with whom I went to college, traveled the world, partied, and helped through divorces and deaths--a person who I love and has long known my political beliefs, called me from across the country. She left a message that sounded like something terrible was going on in her life. I returned her call and asked what was wrong. Was she ill? Did she split from her husband? No, it was neither. It was the election.

Family courts deliver answers, not necessarily justice. Children sometimes align with a toxic parent. People you thought were your friends fall off the radar. You work a full-time job and live in an apartment while your gainfully unemployed ex lives in a mansion and is supported by a wealthy fiance who seems oblivious to her shenanigans. Wallowing in bitterness and resentment won't change your circumstances. Accept that suffering is part of life and try to shift your focus to what's going your way.

If you simply take a few minutes each week (and a few more each month) to evaluate your progress, make adjustments and identify just a few action items to tackle, you'll be certain to meet your goal by the end of the year.
It's a major blow to the Browns (11-5), who qualified for the playoffs for the first time in 17 seasons on Sunday with a 24-22 win over Pittsburgh — ending the league's longest playoff drought. They'll play the Steelers again this week in the first round of the AFC playoffs.
The coronavirus death toll in Italy has surged by 793 since yesterday, reaching a total of 4,825, officials confirmed. This is an increase of 19.6%, the largest daily rise since the outbreak emerged a month ago. The northern region of Lombardy alone saw 546 deaths in 24 hours.

When word spread in December that actresses planned to wear black dresses to the awards ceremony, McGowan zeroed in on Meryl Streep. She said the Oscar winner showed hypocrisy for having worked with Weinstein. Streep has insisted that she knew nothing of Weinstein's alleged criminal behavior, and told HuffPost through a representative that she was hurt by McGowan's comments.
The biggest mistake is that [people] think that the more light, the better, and sometimes it's a little bit overkill, said Karen Loesing, owner of The Ergonomic Expert, a firm that evaluates ergonomics for businesses. If you have too much light and then [you] add the light of your computer screen, then you're probably really messing with your eyes.

The organization said the number of deaths could change as it tabulates incidents from the end of the year.
Still nervous of what people think? Let's take a different route and perform our first act in disguise. For example: If you are a writer and terrified to come out for fear of humiliation, try using a pseudonym. Or if you're hungry for leadership, invent a small blog that ignites your cause. Try creating a fictitious persona. Use an easy name, as not to attract too much attention. This will help ward of any humiliation.

De Leeuw came on board in 2011, as EMPA pulled out of the organization to focus on its research activities, and the WRF took its current form. I think, apart from size, the most important difference with the R-conferences, is that we include people from all scientific disciplines, sociologists, psychologists, as well as businesses, governmental organizations, he explains.

In recent years, most hiring managers highly depended on employee referrals. This hiring metric is not only proven effective, but it's also time-efficient. In 2016, this trend has continued. In fact, employers have even ramped up their referral programs and have extended their referral bonuses externally.

Plant-based 'meats' often have as much saturated fat and sometimes even more sodium than a meat equivalent, Peacock said.
There is guidance within us to lead us to the right path throughout our life if we just listen to it. If our spiritual part of life is not tainted, the voice of the conscience within will be obvious. There is a wise saying, Explore, Dream and Discover. That's what a successful life is really all about. It is a journey.
She reminded us that he has been so consistent from his time as mayor to his time in Congress on the issues that he's cared about, said Natalia Salgado, CPD Action's political director. That kind of reminder, for a lot of folks, when we're dealing with an administration as inconsistent and unstable as the one we're dealing with, is so incredibly refreshing but also exciting.
More than 100 people were in the room together for as long as several hours, a source who was there told HuffPost. At least nine Republican House members were not wearing masks for extended periods of time, according to the source as well as video of the lawmakers.
As reporters pushed the president on why he would open up businesses when the country is seeing COVID-19 deaths occur at a faster rate, Trump said that more people would die from economic and social restrictions than from allowing the virus to spread.
Some countries like the United States have also been litigating when ICT is not accessible for everyone. Someone recently asked me a question during #AXSChat; Do you think the US could have made progress without legislation and litigation? My answer was NO. I wish that it could have been a different answer but the US made little progress with disability inclusion and accessibility until we legislated it and began to use our legal system to litigate. These legislative and ligation efforts helped other countries because as the US demanded accessibility and inclusion through our legal channels products became more accessible globally. Should other countries follow this path? I think each country should decide the best path for their citizens but we must do a better job including persons with disabilities in every aspect of society.
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein on Monday called on Washington to halt its unconscionable policy.
All of these things are fabulous ingredients for a vibrant life, but when faced with real and lasting change, you are faced with hundreds of decisions every day that are going to reflect that. You have to create new neural pathways, new patterns, new belief systems and this takes repetition and commitment.
Republicans have traditionally held turnout advantages in runoffs, but Trump's allies actually encouraged GOP voters to stay home and not vote as part of their strategy of questioning the integrity of the election process.

How to take immediate control of your Mental, emotional As Henley wrote, If we are the master of our fate and the captain of our soul. This is true because we can control what happens to us next by controlling our words, thoughts and actions. Most people give away to their feelings and do things that they have to regret later. Most of the unhappiness in the world would have ended if people exercised their birthright of being able to control their mind. Getting our spiritual life in the right direction is of utmost importance if we are to have peace of mind and happiness throughout our life.

And so do you -- no matter what start line you decide to toe. You belong there.
Walmart employs twice as many people, and its efforts to contain company health care costs have succeeded only on the margins. More than 150 million Americans have health insurance from their employers, including many big companies, and those firms have been unable to get doctors, hospitals and drugmakers to budge much on price.
We worry about balancing work and home life--although I just looked up the average number of hours Americans work per week and, having done so, now have no idea what the hell everybody's complaining about. Apparently Americans work an average of 34.4 hours per week. Okay - add five hours a week commuting (including stops for a latte and scone) and we're almost at a 40-hour-work week. But who are these people? Where are they? I don't know anyone who works that little!

What's needed in 2021 is for nations to take aggressive action toward transformative change that addresses the linked needs of people and nature. In September, 64 world leaders signed The Leaders' Pledge for Nature, committing to reverse biodiversity loss by tackling pollution, putting climate and the environment at the heart of pandemic recovery plans and building sustainable economies. All countries need to take all of the actions within this pledge. The world's nations must also commit to an aggressive agenda for systemic change when they meet at the United Nation's biodiversity conference in May.

It was hard not to be affected by the death of Kobe Bryant over the past week, with emotional social media posts everywhere and real-life instances of #24 jerseys worn worldwide. But sometimes it takes a truly personal account to drive home the loss of the person — not the hero, not the larger-than-life figure, but the man, and this woman's essay about her own experience with sudden grief absolutely brought me to tears.
I'm not on social media right now, but I wish I was for this! I'm shocked by your generosity, and I just want you to know how much hope your words bring to all of us! I just can't get over the fact that someone I don't personally know is sticking up for me, let alone a strong woman that I've looked up to for years, Maroney's statement reads.
Pour résumer, le nouveau coronavirus, comme tous les autres, mute très souvent, mais il ne faut pas croire que cela va le changer radicalement. Par contre, ces mutations peuvent devenir des armes pour les chercheurs.
Slowly, I learned to oblige with a meek nod and to mumble some satisfactory answers, hoping they would change the subject. In those formative years, I learned to give emotional support, but never found the words to ask for it myself.

Kat Powers, who lives in Boston, also laid out her experience with COVID-19 in a Twitter thread in March. Powers urged people to take the virus seriously, even if they were generally healthy. She didn't skimp on the gory details.
Murtaugh: We are stringent with following masking and social distancing guidelines, so our biggest risk of exposure is through Russell being at the hospital. He will usually bring a change of clothes to work to have on hand, and when he gets home, he leaves his shoes outside, says a quick hello and goes straight to the shower before anything else. Recently, he has been fortunate enough to be fully vaccinated, so we are grateful for the added layer of protection.
For months after my tearful phone call to my principal, I was unable to say the word retired. I didn't post it on my social media platforms, and I only told people if it was unavoidable. Even now, after more than five months of being home 24/7, I am still reluctant to admit I'm retired.
Arana: This was before I was financially successful. My wife was hemorrhaging from the birth of our second child. I had a newborn and 2 yr. old at home. I'm sitting outside of the hospital room and it was a moment that I realized I had to do something. Money was not going to save me in this. This was a pivotal moment. I was the most successful that following year because another part of me was born by going through the darkness.
As the coronavirus changes and travels across the globe, it's getting more and more difficult to isolate countries that are more specifically affected, Hajdu said.
We cannot make any concessions, Erdogan said, and also slammed Bolton over comments suggesting the United States would prevent attacks on Kurds.
The contractor, the electrician, the plumber, the carpenters ― they're the ones that benefit when rich people spend money on their homes, continued Hannity, who has been linked to shell companies that spent tens of millions investing in residential real estate over the last decade.
Don't wait until the potentially damaging symptoms of an imbalance in the risk/security continuum manifest themselves. Both excessive risk as well as insufficient challenge and stimulation can be relationship-killers. Get on top of things and stay on top of them by looking at how things are going for you, your partner, and your relationship. Identify and negotiate the changes that are needed and take actions that you both feel will readjust the balance. Then get in the habit of doing that on an on going basis. You'll be amazed what a difference this will make. We guarantee it!
The PM had asked the nation's chief medical officers to consider banning arrivals from other parts of Europe but, as of Thursday, the government said there would be no ban on visitors from Europe.

Because the raw ingredients are very good, everything tastes good, Ito says. Because we minimize the use of chemicals and additives in our products ― we don't have things like MSG ― it's a very natural taste.

How it works: A Roth IRA is similar to a traditional IRA with a few exceptions. The first is the way your money is taxed: Rather than contributing pre-tax money, you contribute funds after taxes have already been taken out. That money is never subject to capital gains taxes or dividend taxes from that point on, Alden said. In other words, your withdrawals in retirement are made tax-free.
Studies have shown that health care prices in the U.S. are outrageously high by international standards. Knee replacements cost $28,000 on average in the U.S., for example, while they cost $18,000 in the U.K. In a Medicare for All system, the government would force American prices down ― not all the way down to European levels, but enough to get a better handle on costs here.
Watching the smoke rise from Mt. Etna, the view from the Eiffel Tower, the surfing waves on Portugal's shores, hiking one of the Camino de Santiago trails ― these are all moments in time you are physically present and treasure, causing a desire to repeat them, said Vogele.

Boyes pointed out that it's less stressful and time-consuming to plan repeat visits, particularly if you're choosing the same hotel, car rental spot and so on. Certain destinations are very predictably relaxing. For example, my family in New Zealand return to small beach towns in either New Zealand or Australia year after year, she said. The experiences are different enough to provide a sense of a break and change of pace and scenery but don't involve culture shock or require a full day or more of travel to get there.
The Italian government banned all internal travel in the country on Sunday and issued an order freezing all business activity deemed non-essential in an effort to keep more people at home and off the streets. However, union leaders accused the government of not going far enough with the closure order, noting that dozens of sectors had won exemptions. They threatened to call a general strike if they thought too many workers were exposed to health risks.
David Frederick is the most capable, pro-consumer Supreme Court litigator in the country, and has demonstrated his ability over more than 50 Supreme Court arguments, Todd Webster, a former chief of staff to Sen.

En confinant deux villes de 11 et 7 millions d'habitants pour lutter contre ce nouveau type de coronavirus, la Chine change radicalement d'attitude par rapport à la crise du Sras (Syndrome respiratoire aigu sévère), il y a près de vingt ans, lorsqu'elle avait été accusée d'avoir tardé à donner l'alerte et tenté de camoufler l'ampleur de la situation.
Broadly speaking, slow progress in the first stage of labor should not be a reason for performing a C-section, the guidelines state, and a woman shouldn't be considered to be in active labor until she is 6 centimeters along.
As confusing as a false awakening can feel, Hohne emphasizes their value, explaining that they aren't something you should seek to prevent. If you realize mid-dream that you're having a false awakening, try to not wake up, she says. Try to go with it and be a witness to it. Then be prepared to give your subsequent feelings the attention they deserve.

Before you panic: It appears the vaccines we currently have on the market offer some level of efficacy against the strain; others currently in trials are showing less efficacy against the variant. That said, scientists predicted this would happen to some degree and they could tweak the vaccines to effectively work against new variants.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who heads the UN agency, said the World Health Organisation (WHO) is deeply concerned by the alarming levels of spread and severity of the outbreak. He also expressed concern about the alarming levels of inaction and appealed to affected countries to detect, test, treat, isolate, trace and mobilise to prevent the Covid-19 outbreak worsening. We cannot say this loudly enough or clearly enough or often enough: all countries can still change the course of this pandemic, he told a briefing in Geneva.
The growth of the zones is yet another consequence of global warming — including increasing ocean temperatures — triggered by greenhouse gases and, closer to the coasts, contamination by agricultural runoff and sewage.

The restrictions do not prevent residents from going to the grocery store, pharmacy or gas station, and they can still go for walks. Public schools throughout the state have already been shut down ― as they have across nearly all 50 states ― and will remain closed through April 7, as well.
Champagne said it's important for Canadians to register with Global Affairs Canada whenever they leave the country, so that authorities can contact them easily if an emergency develops while they are away.
I have to doubt that wild turkeys seemed quite so dragon-like to earlier New Englanders of the human species. The Canadian writer and environmentalist Farley Mowatt once predicted that, outside of humankind and its livestock, by the middle of the new century on which we are now embarked, there would be no animal left along the eastern seabord bigger than a breadbox. But the picture was once very different.
And of course, there are microaggressions against people of color. Capitol Police once told a well-known health care and disability rights activist that she had to take a Save Medicaid button off of her daughter's wheelchair because it was a political slogan. While rules are strict within the Capitol, political slogans on buttons and T-shirts are not just permitted but common. She complied because she did not want to get kicked out, but other advocates noted the disparity in treatment. I'm sure she is not the only person of color to have been treated more harshly than white activists inside the Capitol.

The textbooks don't give a full-throated endorsement of Trump, noting his crude remarks and previously liberal positions, but they ultimately represent him as someone on the side of Christians who is fighting for their values. One description from the Abeka textbook reads:
We've made so much progress with many sea turtle populations in the last 30-plus years ... that it would be heartbreaking to lose the ground we have gained through conservation actions over the decades.
It was also great being a part of this shoot because my experience in the male modeling industry thus far has centered around a lot of rejection and being told that my body isn't the right fit. This lack of opportunity and access to work shows that there still needs to be a huge cultural shift towards inclusion and body diversity that's beyond just using the term body positivity as a surface-level buzzword.

How about slackers living at home with their parents? There's an explanation for that as well. A report from the Pew Research Center explains that the increase in Millennials living at home is driven by the economic conditions, the high cost of housing, education level, and marrying later in life. In other words, Millennials as a group aren't slackers. If anything, they may be being more practical.

Trump kept out of sight in a nearly empty White House as impeachment proceedings played out at the heavily fortified U.S. Capitol. There, the damage from last week's riots provided a visible reminder of the insurrection that the president was accused of inciting.

At issue is Frederick's current work defending Royal Dutch Shell against state and city lawsuits demanding the Netherlands-based oil giant pay for infrastructure damages caused by climate change.
What a great day just to be here now! The perfect day to let the past rest where it is and let the future take care of itself. As is every day. To experience just this moment, to pay attention to the colors, sounds, smells and sensations. To pay attention to your feelings, to other people's feelings. And to make this day, this week, this month, and this new year, one of beauty and tenderness.
But for all his bluster, Trump has not racked up the draconian immigration enforcement record he threatened from the campaign trail. By the most important enforcement metric, deportations, Trump has trailed far behind his more liberal predecessor Barack Obama.
For gay people, the effect is magnified by the fact that our minority status is hidden. Not only do we have to do all this extra work and answer all these internal questions when we're 12, but we also have to do it without being able to talk to our friends or parents about it. For more stories that stay with you, subscribe to our newsletter. SIGN UP John Pachankis, a stress researcher at Yale, says the real damage gets done in the five or so years between realizing your sexuality and starting to tell other people. Even relatively small stressors in this period have an outsized effect—not because they're directly traumatic, but because we start to expect them. No one has to call you queer for you to adjust your behavior to avoid being called that, Salway says. James, now a mostly-out 20-year-old, tells me that in seventh grade, when he was a closeted 12-year-old, a female classmate asked him what he thought about another girl. Well, she looks like a man, he said, without thinking, so yeah, maybe I would have sex with her. Immediately, he says, he panicked. I was like, did anyone catch that? Did they tell anyone else I said it that way? This is how I spent my adolescence, too: being careful, slipping up, stressing out, overcompensating. Once, at a water park, one of my middle-school friends caught me staring at him as we waited for a slide. Dude, did you just check me out? he said.
He is particularly upset about an idea from freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) to finance the plan by introducing a marginal tax rate of up to 70 percent for the nation's wealthiest people. Doing so would have dreadful effects on the very rich, Hannity said Tuesday in an at-times nonsensical rant on his radio program.
Women will have the opportunity to be cast beginning this fall, the group said.
It is rare that visitors to a booth or exhibition are looking to quarrel - after all, they often have paid admissions to enter the fair and have some idea of what to expect - but simply want to strike up a conversation (itself a compliment of sorts) and don't know what to say. Artists are sometimes told that they dress like artists, which may seem like a backhanded compliment (are their clothes oddly matched or funky or ill-fitting or in disrepair?), or that their work reminds the visitor of some other artist's (is their art derivative, unoriginal, plagiarized?). It is likely that both comments are meant in a positive light, indicating in the first instance that the artist is a unique individual and in the second that the artist's work is as good or as pleasing as someone else's. Knowing how to find the positive side of a potentially negative remark may turn an awkward situation into a more relaxed moment. Shows can go for days, and artists may become tired and irritable by the end, apt to find a question insulting simply because they have heard it repeated so many times. Possibly, there is no ulterior motive to the question of how long it took to paint that picture. Artists might simply need to refresh themselves periodically in order to maintain a positive attitude.

Robo-advisers ask you questions on preferences and goals when you open an account, and then create a personalized allocation based on your answers. The pioneer of robo platforms ― and still the largest of the independent firms ― is Betterment, which launched about seven years ago and now manages about $9.1 billion in assets.
It's theoretically possible that a mutation could occur that would diminish the efficacy of the vaccine a bit, but Pollock said scientists could easily adjust the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines — like the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines — to respond to the mutations.

Unsurprisingly, my comment is met with pushback.
Here's the problem, if all this is meant to rebuild that trust that we once had, doing this halfway will end up causing more harm than good.
U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered the dramatic closing down of the hospitality and entertainment sectors at a news conference on Friday, amid fears of overwhelming Britain's National Health Service.
StockX was completely unaware of MysteryBrand.net, a representative told The Verge, adding that no formal partnership between the companies exists. Digital marketplace G2A cut ties with the website last week amid the scam and gambling allegations.
To me, him getting over that hurdle is been what I've been the most impressed of because I mean, he's a football player, McCarthy told Detroit media ahead of the Lions game. We've always played him in there situationally or schematically as a change up, so you could always see the playmaking ability. But to do the every-day, all-three-downs nuances of the running back position has been very impressive. That's just a real credit to him.
There is growing criticism of the honors' evocation of the British Empire, the legacy of which has been debated anew amid campaigns against racism and colonialism around the world.

Once you notice this, try to modulate your voice.
I originally started featuring my travels on Instagram as a way of documenting my journey. It was better than a travel journal because it was visual and because engagement with other people was built in. It made my adventures more interactive, and I got feedback and tips about the places I was visiting. Plus it was a great way to stay in contact with my friends and family at home. It was mostly fun and games for the first year, then the platform slowly but increasingly became a way for me to critique and judge myself.
If you look into the deal, it's nothing of great substance. It's a lot of Chinese declaration to buy more from the Americans and nothing more than that. Nothing on intellectual property, nothing on theft of intellectual property or forced transfer of technology to Chinese counterparts. None of those systemic changes or reforms, but just a lot of commitments. That too is enough for Trump to go back to his base and say that he has been productive in term one. I think that's a calculation that we are making as well
Overall, though, Schachter praised the report for its thoroughness.
To Sanders, the loss of that endorsement to Warren was especially biting because his political director, Analilia Mejia, was a former head of the New Jersey Working Families Party. Several people with a say in WFP's endorsement process told HuffPost at the time that Warren's team had simply put in more work for it, with Sanders forgoing the opportunity to address WFP delegates in a private address in which Warren and former Housing Secretary Julián Castro participated.

I think that breaking the stigma associated with sharing our insecurities, breaking through the toxic masculinity that makes us feel ashamed about talking, addressing why as a community we regard thin white chiseled bodies over all other bodies, and making sure there's body diversity and inclusion in both LGBT and straight media, that we can be kinder to one another and hopefully create change within the community.

But I made it through. It was cathartic. While I hate it when people say there's beauty in the struggle because that's a lie, I do think there is something about finding hope in the struggle.

In 1939 — on Juneteenth, no less — a mob arrived at 12-year-old Opal Lee's house. About 500 white residents burned down the family's house in Fort Worth, Texas. For days, the neighbors had showed up, throwing rocks and terrorizing the Lees, who had just moved into the neighborhood. When Lee's father got home from work with a gun, an officer said: If you bust a cap, we'll let the mob have you.
Problems of the euro are structural and persistent
There's no real basis to say it's going to escape or evade the vaccine. - Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security
When he was tested in his early 20s, Johnson's reading and writing abilities were at a second-grade level. As a teenager, he could not prepare snacks for himself or make purchases and check to ensure he received the correct change. At the age of 16, an aide at his school would accompany him to the bathroom to prevent him from getting lost or distracted on the way back to his classroom. Yet Johnson has never had a meaningful opportunity to present evidence of his disability — and, therefore, his ineligibility for the death sentence — in court.
Pelosi said she would introduce a rule change on Jan. 21 that the House will then vote on. The announcement comes after HuffPost's Matt Fuller reported that at least 10 Republicans refused to comply with the safety measure. The magnetometers were installed just outside the House chamber after last week's violent insurrection at the Capitol, which that left five people dead, including a Capitol Police officer.
Hurricanes created the most damage, totaling $265 billion as Hurricanes Harvey, Maria and Irma racked up a respective $125 billion, $90 billion and $50 billion. Wildfires caused $18 billion in losses, tripling previous annual records.

He had to have the newest technology, the highest amount storage, and slickest interfaces. We often made fun of him about his love of technology. My father taught us that technology was exciting and that it could change lives, and he encouraged my siblings and myself to learn as much as possible about technology. Most of my large family followed in his footsteps and are in technical careers.
A big concern for citizens is their food. As one of the country's major food-producing areas, the coastal region of Fukushima supplies products like rice, mushrooms and fish throughout Japan, as well as overseas. But in the wake of one of the world's worst nuclear disasters, people still worry that what they're eating may be contaminated with toxic levels of radiation ― even if it meets government standards.

Instead, if we look at the experience we've garnered and truly value the work we've done (which is an achievement itself) and the direction it's taken us, as a detour, it gives us the license for contemplation. It allows us to regroup, reassess, redirect, and pursue recourse with confidence and positive energy. Maybe it's the same goal that will now be attempted with a different strategy. Isn't that powerful? Yes.
Also astounding are the profits. Polaris' research estimates that these businesses, which more often than not are part of an organized criminal network, generate revenue of about $2.5 billion a year.
No, this is not the kind of presidency that Trump promised.

My parents split up before I was 2 years old. My father went on to marry a total of seven times. My mother found true love with another woman. And me? I've been divorced twice. But I still believe in marriage, partially because although it took my parents several tries to find their soulmates, they both eventually did. Mom and Pat have been together over 40 years. Dad and Tricia have been together over 20. They have taught me to never to give up on finding true love. ― Lara Lillibridge, author of the forthcoming Girlish: Growing Up in a Lesbian Home

stevendelduca.ca Ontario Liberal leadership candidate Steven Del Duca says his daughters, who are 8 and 12, motivate him to do something about climate change.
As the recent drought showed, farmers respond to lower allotments of snowmelt by reverting to the pump—dropping wells to tap in to the Central Valley's underground aquifers. But that practice quickly led to a host of problems, from dry wells serving poor communities to rapid land subsidence, which snarls up roads, bridges, and aqueducts. Farmers were grabbing groundwater so fast that in 2014, the California Legislature passed a law requiring that groundwater basins achieve balance—the rate at which water is taken out can't exceed the rate at which water goes in—by 2040. By then, if climate change proceeds apace, farmers will be caught between tough groundwater rules and a vanishing snowpack.
That said, if you have traveled to an affected area, come in contact with someone who has, or suspect you've been exposed to it, you should contact your doctor. This also goes for other illnesses like the flu.
Instead of trying to tackle everything on day one, start small. If you commit to just a few actions per week that will move you closer to your goal, you'll be far more likely to stay the course than if you over-commit and try to do too much too soon.
This year, according to the COO of Women's March Inc., Rachel Carmona, the organization is releasing a Women's Agenda, a policy platform that she says will set the roadmap for our expectations for the elected officials who were either just elected or would like to be reelected in 2020. We view it as a work plan for all of our elected officials, and we are going to translate that into a 50-state strategy.

Another good example is that which occurs in the North Carolina Department of Public Safety's Polk Youth Detention Center in Butner, North Carolina. There prison guards often use pepper spray and batons against the prisoners with minor provocation, which results in both enhanced violence amongst the prisoners themselves and a more pronounced them-versus-us attitude. This ratchets up the tension and violence of the facility.

Yet only some of the high-profile Democrats hoping to challenge Trump in 2020 have made the issue a top priority. Sanders held a town hall on climate change in December and is preparing legislation on a Green New Deal. Merkley was the first senator to back a Green New Deal last year. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) followed soon after, explicitly tying his push for a federal job guarantee to the climate proposal.
More than from any policy though, Sanders has benefited from the warmth he exhibits in the small audiences where he has had to court his would-be endorsers, according to Salgado.
The bill's announcement comes nearly two weeks after an equipment malfunction at a Consolidated Edison substation next door to the Astoria Generating Station released an electric arc flash that illuminated the city sky with an eerie neon blue.

I was so afraid of destroying my friendship, but I knew I'd never forgive myself if I let my fear get in the way of what could be real happiness. My mom always said the reason she married my dad was he was the first person who loved her for who she was. I never understood that feeling until now. It doesn't feel like a risk, it feels safe. It feels like safety to observe another person, gazing at you all starry-eyed, and know that half the joy you feel comes from them really seeing you, and enjoying you so hard, knowing that there is not one part of them wishing you'd change.
Well, yes and no. I think probably the mistake that young people make the most is, first, not always paying down their debt. The number of people I've interviewed over the years who don't prioritize that is huge. And I don't just mean young people, I think that's across the board.

Quickly, U.S. intelligence and public health officials began doubting China's reported rates of infection and death toll. They pressed China to allow in U.S. epidemiologists — both to assist the country in confronting the spread and to gain valuable insights that could help buy time for the U.S. response. U.S. officials also pressed China to send samples of the virus to U.S. labs for study and for vaccine and test development.

Meanwhile, advocates for agricultural workers may press Democrats to halt a new Trump rule that will drive down the minimum wage on farms.

The Labor Department finalized that rule in early November.

All the people that never liked Tarantino films are feeling somehow vindicated and that's fucking awful. You're profiting off the sadness and hurt of another human being to feel morally superior to the rest because you feel that your critical opinion feels somehow accurate?? — Jaime Grijalba (@jaimegrijalba) February 6, 2018
We also engaged in publically pushing for change and innovation in the areas of economic policy and politics. This work was applied in several places around the world, including parts of South and North America, and has been presented in lectures, policy briefs and articles that I authored or co-authored. It represents over 19 years of frontline experience, built on the successful application of transforming informal societies, people, and markets into vibrant formal entities and agents.
While we argued often during my formative years, my teenage rebelliousness in action only went as far as choosing, against their wishes, to participate in a school play my junior year of high school and staying out until midnight the summer between high school and college. Deep down, I knew that they loved me and only meant well –- after all, the price of success was having a little less fun than everybody else.
In the wake of the Challenger disaster on January 28, 1986, all GPS satellite launches stopped, stalling all commercial development on the system - except for one company. Magellan, founded four months after the shuttle explosion by entrepreneur and pilot Ed Tuck, who wanted a portable device to help him navigate to small airports, and two early GPS experts, Don Rae and Norm Hunt, went to work instead. In May 1989, the company started shipping this first-ever portable GPS receiver, more than three years before any competitors, which established a revolutionary way to get from Point A to Point B without having to fumble with maps or stop to ask directions.
We have it totally under control, Trump said on CNBC. It's one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It's going to be just fine.
There is a kind of holy rage, a rage at what is and its profound paucities, that can lead to visionary ideas. This is a rage that can be channeled into a yearning to break open stagnant and foul systems and replace them with better ones, a rage born of pain and empathetic pain, a rage at the suffering of the world ― the terrible things happening around us that Fyodor Dostoevsky once called unavenged tears.
It looks like it doesn't transmit through the air very easily and probably transmits through close contact, he said. That was not the case with SARS.
DeRogatis' groundbreaking investigative piece accusing Kelly of being a sexual predator published in December of 2000, marked the beginning of a slow sea change for entertainment journalists. After DeRogatis' bombshell investigation, rumors solidified into legal allegations. The artist's mysterious public aura transformed from controversial to possibly criminal.

Identical twins are not exactly genetically the same, new research shows.
When I am in a flare my muscles become stiff and weak. I start to walk funny and it becomes very difficult to open doors, bend over etc. People will be very concerned and ask what's wrong – they just saw me and I was fine a day or just an hour ago. It's shocking to them and almost impossible to explain. Then boom, a day, week. whatever later I appear to be fine. – Katrina R.
It comes as the United States faces intense criticism for detaining children separated from their immigrant parents at the US-Mexico border.
Does that mean that, say, a grandparent cannot visit a family member they haven't seen in months? Or that a vaccinated health care worker can't spend time with a friend who has not yet received both shots? Those are decisions that individuals are going to have to make themselves (heeding local restrictions, of course) — but with the understanding that certain precautions should stay in place.
In fact, his cursory tone almost pokes fun at the scenario, using jokes that shift the onus of blame onto Aaliyah, the minor, rather than the man 10 years her senior.

The dinner, often nicknamed nerd prom, is considered a celebration of the First Amendment and of the journalists and correspondents who cover Washington. President Donald Trump has boycotted the event for the past three years despite every president before him since Calvin Coolidge attending it.
In 2014, researchers compared straight and gay teenagers on cardiovascular risk. They found that the gay kids didn't have a greater number of stressful life events (i.e. straight people have problems, too), but the ones they did experience inflicted more harm on their nervous systems. Annesa Flentje, a stress researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, specializes in the effect of minority stress on gene expression. All those little punches combine with our adaptations to them, she says, and become automatic ways of thinking that never get challenged or turned off, even 30 years later. Whether we recognize it or not, our bodies bring the closet with us into adulthood. We don't have the tools to process stress as kids, and we don't recognize it as trauma as adults, says John, a former consultant who quit his job two years ago to make pottery and lead adventure tours in the Adirondacks. Our gut reaction is to deal with things now the way we did as children. Even Salway, who has devoted his career to understanding minority stress, says that there are days when he feels uncomfortable walking around Vancouver with his partner. No one's ever attacked them, but they've had a few assholes yell slurs at them in public. That doesn't have to happen very many times before you start expecting it, before your heart starts beating a little faster when you see a car approaching. But minority stress doesn't fully explain why gay men have such a wide array of health problems.
Then, talk about what you expect ― not demand ― of your partner and figure out a compromise.
Aly Raisman just called out USA Gymnastics for victim-blaming the 120-plus women who have accused former team doctor Larry Nassar of sexual abuse.
Because the fact of the matter is, to lose weight, you simply need to have fewer calories coming in than you have going out. According to Ramirez, There is no proof that Skinny Coffee Club provides weight loss results without being in a caloric deficit.
And progressive members, such as Ocasio-Cortez, who has clashed with Pelosi over legislative priorities and committee seats, are eager to have a more left-leaning alternative to her speakership. Ocasio-Cortez told The Intercept in December that while she wanted Pelosi to step aside, at present, trying to push Pelosi out posed too great a risk of something even worse filling the void.
You guys are in some kind of right wing trance, said one poster.
And then, of course, the greatest protest movement in a generation, the Black Lives Matter movement for racial justice should compel every member of Congress to prioritize the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act ― and more, to obtain racial justice in this country once and for all through reforming our criminal legal system.
If we're talking about alienation and separatist sentiments, according to two different polls in the months following the 2019 election, — one from ThinkHQ and one by Abacus Data, less than 28 per cent of Albertans surveyed actually support separatism.
You definitely want to stay away from athletic wear and activewear. That is something you should definitely not wear to a funeral, Swann told HuffPost. That's at the top of the list.
Middleton, who said he was speaking out because he supports his royal relatives' campaign to remove the stigma from mental illness, described his condition as a cancer of the mind that made him feel like a complete failure.
Last year, the dictionary added the definition of shade as it was popularly used in the queer black and Latino ballroom scene: To express contempt or disrespect for someone publicly especially by subtle or indirect insults or criticisms. (Thanks to RuPaul's Drag Race and the Real Housewives of Atlanta, this use has become increasingly mainstream.)
But they'll be a lot smarter and have many more colors to their personality and be more mercurial and become someone with the same values as he has but able to get much further and do more damage as a despot, he said. That's my worry. There are people who look up to him: 'I want to be like him.' But they'll do it much better and they'll be more smart about it.
Adalja says the variant won't have any impact on the accuracy of our diagnostic tests, antibody tests or treatments.
The truth is, though, that Tomsula never stood a chance.
You know, the book was timely before and it's definitely timely now. This crisis is so much harder on Americans and the one thing I hope people take away from the book and this situation is that we really do lack compassion. I want them to recognize our selfishness, the obsession with money and material things, and how we buy into this [false] notion of the American dream. Also, the idea of how you obtain social mobility. You can make all types of money right now and have still shitty insurance and die. I saw it before this crisis and I am seeing it now while we're in. Can't we do better?

That first time, they made the impression of 'Arov - the fourth plague of Egypt, about which we read this week - wild beasts stirred into the mix of human life where one least expects them. I can still remember the acid feeling of shock in my legs, an instinctual if absurd fight-or-flight reaction. I flew - or, at least, I gave the formidable, hip-high fowl the sidewalk.
Prior to the latest tax bill, victims of fires, earthquakes, floods or similar natural disasters who experienced uninsured losses greater than 10 percent of their adjusted gross income could deduct a portion of those losses from their taxable income.

And even as the Trump administration continues to support its Healthy Adult Opportunity initiative, federal authorities are taking other steps to shore up the Medicaid program amid the outbreak. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is swiftly approving states' requests to relax Medicaid enrollment rules to make it easier for qualified individuals to sign up.
Luzzi is a true Renaissance man. In addition to teaching Italian and Literature, he is also a prolific writer and has an amazing grasp of history, culture, and politics.

The role influencers play in affecting their followers' diet and lifestyle decisions is really scary, Meshulam said. People look at influencers as 'goals' in so many ways. Followers then try everything to replicate their influencers' lifestyles, thinking that they too can achieve these goals.'
As for the wig, in the script I think it just said a colorful wig, and the amazing hair and makeup designers brought a few options. It needed to serve a few purposes. These are guys that she'd been to college with, so she needed to be unrecognized. She needed the makeup to be heavy. She needed the wig to mask her, because even though we've implied in the movie that she looks very different — because [Burnham's character] Ryan can hardly tell who she is when he first encounters her at the coffee shop — she still needs to be careful, because Al barely recognizes her until she says who she is. But also what I didn't want it to be was too neat and tidy. The reason that Cassie brings sneakers to walk up the hill and then changes into her red shoes only once she'd gotten to the top is because, if you're making a film that's very stylized, you also need to always keep an eye on those things that do feel a bit bogus, like hair not being out of place if you've walked up a fucking mountain in stilettos. So there's something about that wig that I liked. It was a bit messy. There needed to be that moment because every revenge movie has that moment.
But some progressive advocates say Frederick's recent work defending Shell, in which he's argued that lawsuits trying to hold oil companies liable for climate change have no legal grounds, should be disqualifying.

Many Hollywood studios have postponed film releases, as countries around the world have shuttered theaters and other public venues in order to stem the spread of COVID-19. Most U.S. movie theater chains have closed, including the two largest, AMC and Regal. Together, they have more than 1,100 locations.
That doesn't mean Steyer isn't trying to boot President Donald Trump from office. He will instead spend at least $40 million on impeachment efforts against Trump this year, he said in a statement.
Alex, a fitness instructor in Seattle, was told by a guy on his swim team, I'll ignore your face if you fuck me without a condom. Martin, a Brit living in Portland, has gained maybe 10 pounds since he moved there and got a Grindr message—on Christmas Day—that said: You used to be so sexy. It's a shame you messed it up. For other minority groups, living in a community with people like them is linked to lower rates of anxiety and depression. It helps to be close to people who instinctively understand you. But for us, the effect is the opposite. Several studies have found that living in gay neighborhoods predicts higher rates of risky sex and meth use and less time spent on other community activities like volunteering or playing sports. A 2009 study suggested that gay men who were more linked to the gay community were less satisfied with their own romantic relationships. Gay and bisexual men talk about the gay community as a significant source of stress in their lives, Pachankis says. The fundamental reason for this, he says, is that in-group discrimination does more harm to your psyche than getting rejected by members of the majority. It's easy to ignore, roll your eyes and put a middle finger up to straight people who don't like you because, whatever, you don't need their approval anyway. Rejection from other gay people, though, feels like losing your only way of making friends and finding love.

Tedjo has grabbed headlines for some of his bold proposals, which include merging the public and Catholic school boards and implementing a basic income based on the Wynne government's pilot project.
The pandemic revealed both how insecure so many workers are, and that many of the most insecure, undervalued jobs are essential ― essential to our health, safety and well-being. From the farm worker and grocery worker to the child care and home care worker ― many of our essential workers lacked the wages, paid sick time and family leave, access to health care and family care needed to keep themselves safe as they were keeping us all safe. We must never forget that essential workers are essential all of the time, and that all work in America should offer the basic safety and security that allows for our collective well-being.

In other words, participation trophies don't last forever. They serve a purpose for younger children, but the workforce entering your organization understands that there are winners and losers in the world. They see it on television every week as they watch their favorite athletic team lose or reality show contestant go home. They experience it in sports, band, or choir as the move from middle school to high school. If they are college graduates, they have been competing their entire life to get into the best school.

The ruling body also backed moves to reshape the annual conference to give more debate time for the rank and file, and less for Shadow Cabinet ministers. As reported by HuffPost UK, neither London Mayor Sadiq Khan nor Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham will have speaking slots on the platform in Brighton. The NEC was until this summer finely balanced between pro-Corbyn and 'moderate' wings of the party, but it is now set to shift much more in his favour. Under a 'compromise' plan first revealed by HuffPost UK this month, the proportion of MPs and MEPs needed for a leadership bid would be reduced from the current 15% threshold to 10%. The change in rules - first proposed by the TSSA transport union - all but guarantees that Corbyn's successor will be from the Left, as it lowers the bar for the Parliamentary Labour Party's (PLP) veto on candidates. At present, 42 Parliamentarians are needed for any new leadership candidate, but if the change gets the go ahead, just 28 nominations will be required. Once MEPs are abolished after Brexit in 2019, just 26 MPs' nominations will be needed.

And yet, vindication isn't the only feeling at play. There's something about this sudden shift that's wildly infuriating as well. Oh, NOW you're listening? I thought recently when a writer I'd criticized as sexist ― only to have my critique neatly brushed aside by male colleagues and friends ― faced career consequences after being accused of personal misbehavior toward women.

By signing, Inslee is laying the groundwork for a historic, if long-shot, bid for the presidency on the single issue of scaling back planet-warming emissions and preparing for climate change. The move is bold but timely.

This was no ordinary protest, either. The insurrectionists showed up with bombs and assault weapons. Their plans included not just stopping the certification of an election that was conducted freely and fairly without any evidence of fraud, but to do so by force. Even more concerning, the insurrection was planned for a day when both Vice President Mike Pence and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, the first and second people in line for succession to the presidency, were present in the Capitol, and there were explicit calls to Hang Mike Pence.
Several other polls about the shutdown have also been released since Friday. Taken together, they paint a consistent picture that's also in accordance with earlier surveys: When asked who's most to blame for the shutdown, Americans largely point their fingers at the president. Some of the highlights:
This is the most researched and analyzed generation in our history. You've heard the descriptors. Millennials are lazy, entitled, narcissistic, and hard to focus. They want everything now, and they don't understand why they can't be in charge within 3 months. They require constant feedback and recognition because they all received participation trophies for their entire life. They incessantly ask why and are convinced that there is a better way to do whatever it is that you've been doing the same way for years.

My parents' divorce makes me work harder to create the type of family I wish I had. As a stepmom to three and a mom to one, every day I strive to provide the kids with a stable, loving environment. I'm not going to lie, being a stepmom and a second wife in a blended family isn't always easy but I think being a child of divorce has made me more dedicated to my marriage and to my family. I know firsthand how it feels to be a child of divorce, and I don't want that for my daughter, and I certainly don't want my stepchildren to have to go through that a second time. ― Jamie Scrimgeour, blogger and creator of The Kick-Ass Stepmom Project

To start, Gaither recommends talking to your physician before trying out a lubricant with CBD since it could potentially interfere with any prescriptions you're taking.
In fact, Congress has already recognized these realities. The first coronavirus emergency bill that Trump signed includes additional Medicaid funding for states as a means of shoring up their budgets. That law also forbids states from cutting enrollment or benefits as a condition for receiving the temporary bonus funds. Extra Medicaid funding is a common form of helping state budgets and providing economic stimulus during recessions.
The company will also support its drivers, providing financial assistance for up to two weeks if they are diagnosed with COVID-19 or put under quarantine individually by a public health agency, and have been active on the DoorDash platform for at least 60 days and have completed at least 30 deliveries in the last 30 days.

Teck Resources Ltd. says it's withdrawing its application for a massive oilsands mining project just days ahead of an expected government decision, citing the political discourse over climate change.
In court filings in California and Rhode Island last year, Frederick argued that federal law prevents states from suing Shell and other oil companies over climate change. He contended that federal law also provides no remedies for damage due to global warming and that Shell could only face climate litigation in the Netherlands, where it is headquartered.

When the disparity first came to light in the '50s and '60s, doctors thought it was a symptom of homosexuality itself, just one of many manifestations of what was, at the time, known as sexual inversion. As the gay rights movement gained steam, though, homosexuality disappeared from the DSM and the explanation shifted to trauma. Gay men were being kicked out of their own families, their love lives were illegal. Of course they had alarming rates of suicide and depression. That was the idea I had, too, Salway says, that gay suicide was a product of a bygone era, or it was concentrated among adolescents who didn't see any other way out. And then he looked at the data. The problem wasn't just suicide, it wasn't just afflicting teenagers and it wasn't just happening in areas stained by homophobia. He found that gay men everywhere, at every age, have higher rates of cardiovascular disease, cancer, incontinence, erectile dysfunction,⁠ allergies and asthma—you name it, we got it. In Canada, Salway eventually discovered, more gay men were dying from suicide than from AIDS, and had been for years. (This might be the case in the U.S. too, he says, but no one has bothered to study it.) We see gay men who have never been sexually or physically assaulted with similar post-traumatic stress symptoms to people who have been in combat situations or who have been raped, says Alex Keuroghlian, a psychiatrist at the Fenway Institute's Center for Population Research in LGBT Health.

Green turtles feed on sea grass, eat on algae, and those are the base of the food chain in the ocean, Wyneken told HuffPost. Without the turtles' grazing, seabeds become unhealthy, which affect all other animals higher on the food chain.
When you have companies going after toddlers and infants, it's insane, he said.

Some Republicans are particularly aggrieved with the metal detectors (which they go through regularly anyway for their air travel). On Tuesday, Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.) attacked the use of the machines as an appalling infringement on his rights, Rep.

Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) simply pushed her way through them and rebuffed officers' requests to check her purse.
Injuries added to the misery, especially at running back. Carlos Hyde, tabbed as Frank Gore's replacement at running back, was on pace for more than 1,000 yards, but he played just seven games. Anquan Boldin, Antoine Bethea, Vernon Davis and other important veterans also missed time, further thinning the already depleted ranks.
In the newest HuffPost/YouGov poll, 57 percent of Americans say they hold Trump at least partially responsible for the shutdown, an uptick from the 49 to 51 percent who have said the same in previous weeks. The 44 percent of the public who assign some responsibility to the Democrats and the 39 percent who point to the Republicans are less changed from previous surveys, although the GOP number is slightly increased.

Your alarm goes off. You roll out of bed, rub your eyes, and start your daily routine. Maybe you make it as far as your first meeting of the day, or you might only get to your first sip of coffee.

Was Shangela in the top and Thorgy in the bottom? Were they both in the top? Were they all bottoms? This week's distinction is much clearer, thankfully.

When dealing with a high-conflict ex, the only thing that's certain is that this person will not change. He is a drama addict, and to get his fix he will bad-mouth, cyber-bully, manipulate children, remain gainfully unemployed, perform feats of vanishing-income magic, threaten litigation, twist words, cast aspersions, steal your thunder, all while managing to convince the public he is Father Of The Year.

Real successful people expect obstacles because they know it is part of the game. Successful people already experienced growth, they know in order to grow you have to overcome some obstacles in your life. That`s just part of life and when you know that you can prepare yourself. Just choose in advance how you`re going to react to the obstacle. Look at the last five obstacles or conflicts that you met. How did you react? Did you react pushy and angry? Or did you leave the room? This by the way shows a lot about how you handle conflicts. So, sit down and write how you would react to a major obstacle from your highest self. How would you behave? How would you react? Just choose in advance and it will be a game changer for you because this gives you the comfort of knowing what you`re going to do.
I never did. I can't tell you why, really, except that I think by the time I felt brave enough to bring it up to my doctor, I'd already been handling it myself for years. And while it caused inconveniences and stress, it never became debilitating. Plus, my fear of germs started out so gradually in my early 30s that at first, I saw it as more of a quirk and a minor annoyance than a problem that required the assistance of a mental health expert.
Three days ago, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who on Monday announced the launch of an exploratory committee for a presidential bid, told Axios she supports the idea of a Green New Deal.
A bold plan to transition to a green economy will both put Americans to work and reduce pollution that keeps millions of the working poor sick and trapped in poverty. Kids will miss fewer days of school due to respiratory illness, parents will miss fewer days of work, and working a full-time job will pay a livable wage. And action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is the only way to lower the probability that devastating fires, hurricanes and floods will become even more frequent occurrences. For the kinds of climate-related impacts that we have already endured ― and will continue to ― we need coordinated infrastructure and systems in place to ensure that Americans are prepared and protected.
A 79% majority of Democrats, but only about one-third of Republicans, say they think the Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol represent most supporters of the president.
We know this will be hard, and we're looking for every tool we have to get through this crisis, Pritzker said.
2020 had no such event. In fact, the end of the year saw the development of its opposite – La Niña – which is usually associated with a cooling effect.
A lot of people are rightfully asking really tough questions of the Capitol Police and the reality is that, unlike most police departments, we're going to have a really tough time getting answers, said Michael Morisy, chief executive of MuckRock, a news outlet devoted to public records access and reporting. They have a track record of not being transparent about their operations, especially when there's scandal or scrutiny.
Australian Health Minister Greg Hunt blasted those who were not complying with the strict rules.
Belmar promoted Wildhaber to lieutenant in December, placing him in command of a new diversity and inclusion unit.
With H.R. 8, the push for universal background checks will again have at least some Republican support. Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) is the lead GOP co-sponsor, alongside four other Republicans. He previously sponsored background check bills. Senate Democrats on Tuesday introduced their version of the legislation, though no Republicans have yet signed onto that effort.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 26,000 for the first time ever on Wednesday; it rose from 25,000 to 26,000 in just seven trading days.
″[Sneakers are] a no, Gottsman said. I think it just says, 'I tossed something on to come here and I'm getting ready to leave.' The same goes for flip-flops and canvas slip-ons, she added.
With climate change, Gaume said agricultural products like grapes will need to adapt to harsher conditions. Through a series of space experiments, Space Cargo Unlimited hopes to take what's learned by stressing the plants in weightlessness and turn that into more robust and resilient plants on Earth.
And the President looked upon the Plan and saw that it was good.
Baltimore City is already feeling the impacts of climate change in severe storms and flooding, sewage backups and overflows, heatwaves, and polluted air, said Nabeehah Azeez, an organizer with the Baltimore Peoples Climate Movement. Baltimore deserves a fair trial on the basis of climate justice.
[He] is looking forward to engaging more on the issue as it continues to develop, Chris Evans, a spokesman for O'Rourke, said by email Friday. As he mentioned while traveling to every county across Texas during his senate campaign, he's proud to come from a renewable energy producing state that is number one in wind power production, number one in wind power jobs and number one in solar energy potential.
That was the case with Poehler and Fey when they were given the chance to host the Golden Globes three years in a row, thanks to their near-perfect rapport. Their banter and charm was certainly a welcome distraction from the otherwise methodical format of awards shows, which is why people are campaigning for duos like John Mulaney and Nick Kroll to host. Except I'd rather just watch funny people perform their Netflix specials than schmooze through a set of overly vetted jokes performed in front of the crème de la crème of Tinseltown. Maybe awards show hosts were more popular in the 1980s and '90s because we had few opportunities otherwise to see comedians like Billy Crystal and Chris Rock live. Now, streaming platforms, social media and YouTube make it easy to get your fix.
Military officers and religious liberty advocates celebrated the ruling, which could have far-reaching implications for people of faith serving in the Army.
Colbert is one of many to cheer on Garfield's Golden Globes lip-lock. Reynolds' wife, Blake Lively, laughed during the exchange, and Garfield's ex-girlfriend Emma Stone called it hilarious backstage after the award show. Even Gosling thought it was charming: I mean, I'm happy for them, honestly, you know? he said. Good for them.
Judd proposes a number of solutions for combatting misogynist online harassment, and specifically calls on the tech industry and our friends: White Males (two often overlapping communities) to take responsibility for the ways in which they've failed women. She cites Gamergate and industry-wide sexism in tech as examples of those failures.
On May 1, 2017, Atlanta became the 27th city in the United States to commit to transitioning to 100 percent clean energy, thanks to a resolution passed unanimously by the Atlanta City Council and approved by my predecessor, Mayor Kasim Reed. Atlanta is the biggest southern city to set such an ambitious goal, and we are proud of our bold leadership at the regional, state and global level in confronting the threat of climate change.
Passages from the textbooks reflect an overarching worldview in which America is constantly moving away from a moral center, with Christians on the front lines beating back the forces of immorality.
Au cours des deux dernières semaines, le nombre de cas en dehors de la Chine a été multiplié par 13 et le nombre de pays touchés a triplé, selon l'OMS.
I spoke of my family's harrowing experience with cancer, when my mother was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease, and how I came to comprehend real, unconditional love by watching my father care for her on a daily basis throughout those difficult years. But most importantly, I told my parents that they no longer needed to worry about me because I had married a man who treated me the way my father treated my mother.
That score broke their previous world record, 82.68, set at Skate Canada last year.
In fact, what is really getting people into trouble is the fact their salaries aren't keeping up while things like education, healthcare and housing are going up at a fairly high rate historically.
Throughout the video, these girls have words on their arms like loud, angry and unladylike. But at the end, they wipe them off to show they're not aggressive despite what school officials might think.
The incident involved two people, Kanahus Manuel and Isha Jules, who were both charged with mischief and intimidation, according to APTN. Construction road crews had complained they were being disrupted.

The Biden transition team, which is expected to announce its Justice Department picks sometime after Tuesday's closely watched Senate runoff elections in Georgia, did not respond to questions about Frederick's candidacy.
Traditionally, black has been the color of choice for attending funerals. In Western culture, black has been associated with mourning for centuries, but the tradition of wearing black to funerals dates back even further to the Roman Empire, according to Wonderopolis. The custom was also reportedly adopted by Queen Victoria, who wore black to funerals to show her dignity and respect for the deceased.
Trump also said the Department of Housing and Urban Development is suspending all evictions and foreclosures until the end of April. And the Department of Health and Human Services announced a new regulation that allows doctors and medical professionals to practice across states lines to meet the needs of overstressed hospitals.
Pas impossible, mais très peu probable, comme le rappellent trois chercheurs dans un article publié dans Nature le 18 février. Une mutation unique a permis au chikungunya de s'adapter à une autre espèce de moustique. Une autre a augmenté l'infectiosité d'Ebola sur des cellules humaines. Mais ces cas sont rares et impossibles à prévoir. De plus, les caractéristiques importantes, comme le mode de transmission et la virulence d'un virus peuvent être contrôlés par de multiples gènes, précisent les auteurs.
Italy has registered more deaths than any other country in the world, while the number of confirmed cases is second only to China, with the tally rising by 5,560 to 59,138 on Sunday, the Civil Protection Agency said.

He spent June and July in custody on remand. I attended court to read out a victim statement and the judge started giving him his sentences, two years in total. At that point I'm thinking, not bad, not brilliant. And then the judges said 'I'm going to suspend that sentence for two years'. I left the courtroom before I said anything. I walked out because I could have got myself into trouble. To say I was gobsmacked is an understatement. They've got to do something to protect the emergency services now because it's just getting ridiculous. We are definitely getting more police officers assaulted. One of my colleagues had his jaw broken. People are more willing to have a go at you. I've been 22 years in the police and it's got worse, for sure. It just seems to be every day a cop is getting injured and nothing is happening. Nikki Williams, 34, Junior Sister, A&E ward, London.

It's measurable: Our life expectancy has shortened for the second year in a row, the first multiyear drop since 1963. The top 1 percent of Americans haven't controlled this much wealth since the 1920s, after decades of increasingly dramatic stratification. Nearly half the country would find its finances crippled by a $400 emergency expense. Some 72,000 Americans died of drug overdoses in 2017, amid a doubling of such deaths over the past decade; graphs of the trend soar sharply up, like a tilted needle.
Del Duca says he's the best person to rebuild the party after its whopping 2018 defeat that reduced it to seven sitting MPPs. Many Liberal stalwarts agree.
Funds need to be invested today to accelerate the deployment of this technology, improve its technical performance and reduce the cost associated, said Giulia Realmonte, a Milan-based researcher who has authored past studies on direct air capture for the Department of Energy. We need to start talking about the climate crisis and getting ready to face it with all the 'weapons' we have.
The order comes after many of California's major metropolitan areas issued similar policies earlier this week due to the coronavirus pandemic. California is the first state in the U.S. under such an order.
Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines appear to be remarkably effective based on the data currently available. The Pfizer vaccine is 95% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 seven days after the second booster dose, while the Moderna vaccine is 94% effective 14 days after the second dose.
On May 2, 2017, Ross complained in an email to his staff, I am mystified why nothing have [sic] been done in response to my months old request that we include the citizenship question. His staff responded, We need to work with Justice to get them to request that citizenship be added back as a census question, and we have the court cases to illustrate that DOJ has legitimate need for the question to be included. I will arrange a meeting with DOJ staff this week.
Cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Remove cover and give mixture a stir. The sauce should be thick enough to coat the chickpeas. If it seems too soupy, continue cooking, uncovered for another 5 minutes or so.

Aujourd'hui, cela coûte 50 à 100 dollars de séquencer le génome d'un coronavirus, précise Nathan Grubaugh. Ces techniques ne font pas gagner du temps, mais apportent plutôt une plus-value, précise-t-il. De quoi mieux comprendre l'évolution de l'épidémie afin d'y faire face plus efficacement.
You want to make sure that the lube you're using is right for your body, so it's important to check the list of ingredients — some could be more harmful than helpful. Alcohols (almost anything that ends with -ol) can become drying and irritating over time, and certain sugars and glycerins might make you prone to infections, Ingber said.
Please share your thoughts in the comments section below as I learn just as much from you as you do from me.
Yet because of pending loans, Congress is already having to find more money to help businesses cover payroll.
For me, I had two very distinct reasons I drank: when I was having fun or socializing, like dinner with friends or on a date, or when I 'needed' alcohol to cure something, [like] when I was feeling stressed by work or home alone and lonely, Gonzalez said. It's the latter that I find problematic. If you are leaning on alcohol to help you with something, like all those memes that say you 'deserve' a drink after a hard day of work, question that.
There were issues all over the roster and on up through the front office, but Pettine's inability to coax anything out of Cleveland's defense led to his undoing as much as anything else. He spent five years as a defensive coordinator before arriving in Cleveland—four with the Jets and one in Buffalo.
Along with an 1.9 percent spike in power sector emissions, increases occurred in the transportation, industry and buildings sectors, according to Rhodium. Contributing to the overall increase were the growing U.S. economy, a cold start to the year that required additional energy for heating, and the limited progress made in developing decarbonization strategies, the analysis found.
McGuire said that she had taken off many of these layers while at dinner and had stuffed them into her bag. As she spoke to Amy, McGuire said she became convinced of what she had to do.
We hope to encourage George and Charlotte to speak about their feelings, and to give them the tools and sensitivity to be supportive peers to their friends as they get older. We know there is no shame in a young child struggling with their emotions or suffering from a mental illness.
How it works: Another option for freelancers, small business owners and other self-employed individuals is the one-participant 401(k) plan, also known as a solo 401(k). This account has the same rules and requirements as a traditional 401(k) you'd contribute to through an employer except that it's designed for the self-employed.
2018 marks the first year that EuroPride will be jointly hosted in two cities ― Stockholm and Gothenburg, Sweden. Organizers from Stockholm Pride and West Pride pointed to a 2017 National Geographic study, which found that 67 countries had no legal provisions in place for changing gender, as the impetus for the new campaign.
Keep a few of these addictive bars handy and you won't be tempted by a vending machine, cookie jar or convenience-store sweet. Dried cherries, sesame seeds and walnuts make for a perfect sweet-savory mix and stay bound together with coconut butter and either agave nectar or dark honey (which has a richer flavor than light honey).
Yet this registry is no pipe-dream.

On a call disclosed Sunday, Trump can be heard pressuring Georgia officials to find him more votes.
It feels like Trump is calling all the shots?
LET, which regularly promotes far-right conspiracies, also published a piece on Sunday sympathizing with a handful of the riot attendees who were loudly chanting USA during their flight home to Phoenix from D.C. The pilot pleaded with the raucous passengers to behave and threatened to divert and drop them in Kansas, LET reported. That same day, the website ran another article about two Seattle Police Department officers who were placed on administrative leave over their alleged involvement in the insurrection, lamenting that they are now being doxxed by [the] media.
Every day after school, five or six guys would yell FAGGOT! and tell me to go home. They would threaten me and tell me I wasn't allowed to be there. They would grab my hat or glasses and throw them on the ground, or run at me somewhere on the course, push me to the ground and yell in my face.
We are asking for the world to step in to help us to oppose the dirty oil pipeline on our land and to fight against Canada's criminal behaviour.

These projects are essential for market access.
Schumer doesn't believe the piece should have career-ending consequences for the Master of None actor, but deems his alleged behavior as not acceptable in a frank conversation during a taping of the The Katie Couric Podcast released on Thursday.
There's no reason to take that video seriously, there's no reason to give him any credit for it, there is no reason at all to believe that it means that he's going to change going forward, Mary Trump said. We're still looking at a very difficult, potentially dangerous 12 days, and it certainly shouldn't do anything to let him off the hook.
Dr. Linda Anegawa, an internist with virtual health platform PlushCare, said the main symptoms often appear similar to the flu's, such as fever over 100.5, cough, malaise, and occasionally nausea, diarrhea. In more severe cases, shortness of breath, chest pain and pneumonia will be apparent.

She ends her talk with one poignant, essential reminder when it comes to combatting sexism in any realm: believe women.
There is an emerging sense that new and very different parties are needed, parties that gather many segments of the employee class for a confrontation with all those who explicitly or implicitly accept and support capitalism.
Should I stay or should I go?
Union Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the annual budget on Saturday in the Parliament at 11 am. This year's budget, which is only a state of accounts of the Union government in a routine year, comes at a time of slowdown in the economy. Both businesses and consumers have expectations from the government since private investment and consumption demand have plunged drastically.
Danny Moloshok/Reuters Air quality has dramatically improved in Los Angeles in recent decades. A protester, seen above, picketed in 2016 following a gas leak that fouled the air in the Porter Ranch area of the city.
Content creators should do their due diligence and take responsibility for what they promote, he added. Every YouTube creator wants to influence their fans in a positive way, but sometimes a check can change people's minds.
But the pandemic may be starting to change that perception, possibly for good.
There were some days where I wouldn't leave the house because I couldn't comb my hair just right. Swim class was panic-inducing in high school, because getting my hair wet would cause it to separate, and everyone would see my bald spots. I would also try to sit in the back of the class so no one could look at the back of my head. Yes, the pain runs deep.
Hopefully, this is the beginning of... something that we'll see for the rest of our lives, women in these roles, Henson said. Cause I think it's important. And, you know, with the narrative that we're trying to change right now, the more young girls see women in power like this, the more they say, 'I don't have to be a victim.'
I am not saying any of those methods will not work. However, what I do encourage in addition to whatever method you choose is to:
Can you describe how you feel after working a long shift?
She said a dramatic increase in public concern about air pollution can empower citizens to push for change. And if the populace demands action, it can force governments and businesses to tackle the issue.
But of course, it was purely performative. There was not any truth in it at all, and if you listen carefully, he doesn't actually concede the election, Mary Trump added.
Açai has been touted as a superfood with miraculous health benefits, bursting onto the wellness scene like a ripe, popped berry. However, what most folks don't know is that most açai bowls have only small amounts of this valuable fruit.
Naturally Perfect Dolls aims to change the standard of beauty one doll at a time while encouraging self-acceptance, diversity and letting girls know that they can be whatever they want to be, Jason said in their pitch on the program. I mean look at us, right? We're all a little bit different. But our differences shouldn't be ignored. In fact, they should be accepted and celebrated!
Disappointments have been the source of the greatest genius, inventions, creations and successes. Disappointments force us to think, look, listen and make radical changes in our lives. Tragedies bring into light the self within us that we never knew existed. Some of the disappointments in my life have made me realize the extent of strength I had within me that I never knew of. It's the nature's way of teaching us lessons necessary for us at the particular moment.
It's going to take a while until we reach herd immunity.
Nassar was sentenced in January on seven counts of criminal sexual conduct in one of the largest sex abuse scandals in U.S. history. Meridian police are now planning several steps to improve their response to such reports.

Wachter said she's watched as clients as young as 6 years old pick apart their bodies, and clients pushing 80 who've never felt at peace with their bodies. It's not them, she reminds them; increasingly, it's who and what they're seeing.
Upon returning to the U.S. to begin grade school, I was relieved of the daily questioning I received in Japan, but quickly learned that life in America was all work and no play. For Christmas one year, my parents gifted me a Hooked on Phonics program to ensure that no one would mistakenly enroll their daughter in an English as a Second Language class. A few months later, my mother asked my father for a piano for her birthday so that I could begin music lessons. When we were able to afford a computer, they brought one home -– a clunky, grey NEC -– so that I could learn to type well before my peers.
An Arizona man has died after consuming a toxic, non-medicinal version of chloroquine, an active ingredient in drugs touted last week by President Donald Trump as a potential game changer for treating COVID-19, which also appears in a product used to clean fish tanks.
If you want to change your investing experience, 2017 is your opportunity to do so. You have never had so many great alternatives to choose from.
I worry she will not bounce back. I sob at night in my childhood bedroom. I sleep in the fuzzy pajamas and socks, the window open to the night air and the door closed against the heated recirculated air. The wind rattling the dead leaves outside comforts me as I drift into a restless sleep.
A couple of hours ago, Karan Johar confirmed what trade pundits had been speculating all day: Sooryavanshi, the tentpole cop-drama starring Akshay Kumar, Ranveer Singh, Katrina Kaif and Ajay Devgn will be indefinitely pushed from its original release date of March 24 as the Coronavirus outbreak continues to spread across the country.
For a few tumultuous hours, the mob stood in the way of Congress certifying the 2020 election results and officially starting a peaceful transfer of power.
This year I resolve to push for quality, investment pieces that will stand the test of time. All too often clients are easily wooed by catalog brands that show up in their mailbox, but part of working with a designer is trusting their judgement on where to save and where to splurge.
Testers can view each violation and determine the status of the instance. Testing results and notes are saved to reports in SSB's Accessibility Management Platform (AMP). In addition to recording instances and notes on their resolution, Alchemy allows testers to resolve many of the most common and highest priority accessibility issues with no development time. Alchemy provides the testers with easy to complete forms in which they provide the information, such as labels or alternative text, needed by the tool to fix the issue.

Kejriwal did not visit Shaheen Bagh. Neither did Congress's Rahul Gandhi.
I started to think, 'Why don't my pictures look as good as theirs? Why doesn't my hair look like that?' the homewares designer wrote to HuffPost. I think it affected how I saw myself and how I viewed my desirability as a dark-skinned woman.
Let's take our $20,000 loan example from above. With 10 years left at 6 percent interest, your monthly payments would be $222.

The delegated convention model is the opposite of giving people a say in how their government is run, candidate Alvin Tedjo told HuffPost Canada when he was done having a laugh.
The USOC said the purpose of its letter was to apologize to the victims and lay out the steps the organization would take to protect athletes. The committee vowed to initiate changes within the USOC and the national governing bodies that oversee individual sports to prevent abuses in the future.
It also blocks possibilities for more than two parties. The GOP and Democratic Party have together produced and sustained the rules that make third parties difficult to start or maintain.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had a clear message to Canadians who continue to gather in groups and appear to think they are invincible amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Or perhaps it was the kill them with kindness schtick that didn't quite land as the two tripped over their purposefully tame teleprompter lines. Or the odd transition from facetious hot potato to sincere monologue, when Oh, standing in front of a room full of mostly rich white people, began to explain how sincerely special it was for her, an Asian-Canadian actor, to be hosting the Hollywood Foreign Press Association's big night.
During his campaign, Warnock emphasized his life rising out of poverty as a contrast to Loeffler. In one ad, he walked through the housing project in Savannah where he grew up with 11 brothers and sisters, stating that children there have it harder now than I did back then. That's got to change.
And darkness was upon the face of the Workers.
For a week now, there have been rumours of the police sending a recovery notice to Jafar and two other prominent social activists — Deepak Kabir and Mohammed Shoaib — who were arrested on 19 December in Lucknow.
In recent days, many posts on Thee Rant have condoned the riot or promoted baseless conspiracies about the siege on the Capitol. After Capitol Police shot and killed rioter Ashli Babbitt as she attempted to smash through a door in the Capitol building, some posters on Thee Rant declared it the beginning of a revolution.
But the Congressional Budget Office has been much more conservative about the efficacy of government spending during the pandemic, assuming that only a fraction of every federal dollar will actually result in economic output. Based on the CBO's more cautious estimates, the latest stimulus legislation is a stunning $6.8 trillion short of February 2020.
The thing I found especially valuable was that it made workers think about what they actually do, and what the most important parts of the job are. Jarrod Haar, professor of human resources management
Making promises to people places you on the fine line that lies between making them very happy and watching them walk out the door. When you uphold a commitment, you grow in the eyes of your employees because you prove yourself to be trustworthy and honorable (two very important qualities in a boss). But when you disregard your commitment, you come across as slimy, uncaring, and disrespectful. After all, if the boss doesn't honor his or her commitments, why should everyone else?
The suggested solutions, though, are not an adequate response to the questions raised by the shooting, some Parkland students say.
Breathing -- when done correctly -- can greatly improve your planks.
For about a year, for example, Utah lawmakers have discussed how to change state taxes, which have not been changed significantly since 2008. Greg Hughes, the Republican speaker of the Utah House, estimated the state stands to gain between $75 million and $150 million this year due to the federal tax changes, which has given the state's comprehensive overhaul effort new impetus.
Sitecues from AiSquared is a tool that focuses on helping web users who are sometimes left out, even by accessible websites. In the US, 1 in 4 computer users have a mild to severe visual difficulty or impairment and their needs vary. With Sitecues you can expand your website's reach to those individuals. For example, many web users who have minor vision or cognitive impairments often struggle to read small fonts, to make sense of paragraphs of text, or even to find their cursor on the screen. Though these usability issues are well-known, these types of issues are not generally the focus of website accessibility work. Websites that follow good accessibility practices often fail to address these types of web users. This is where sitecues comes in and extends the benefits of web accessibility to more people.
L'Organisation mondiale de la santé a elle aussi été vivement critiquée ces dernières années. Jugée trop alarmiste pendant l'épidémie du virus H1N1 en 2009, elle avait par la suite été accusée, au moment de la terrible épidémie d'Ebola en Afrique de l'Ouest (2014), de ne pas avoir mesuré l'ampleur de la crise avant qu'elle ne s'amplifie.
However, reports of her undergoing cosmetic procedures to achieve her new look are bothersome.
De multiples experts ont calculé ces derniers jours un paramètre important pour les épidémies: le taux de reproduction de base, ou R zéro. Il représente tout simplement le nombre de gens contaminés par une personne infectée. Leurs estimations vont de 1,4 à 3,8, selon David Fisman, ce qui est jugé modéré.
The problem is that ICT accessibility can be confusing and tricky to implement into the DNA of an organization. It is not impossible but it is tricky. Consider a website with millions of pages of data, tables, videos, PDFs, audio and many other objects being accessed via computers, tablets, and mobile devices. Many websites are now created in multiple languages. So how do you build accessibility into the DNA of your website? Can the accessibility overlay tools help or will they create problems by giving organizations a false sense of security?
The UFCW has emerged as one of the most important labor unions in the coronavirus crisis because of where it represents workers: in grocery stores, meatpacking and processing plants and pharmacies. Few private-sector unions outside of health care would have so many members continuing to clock in because their work is so crucial to the lives of others.
YouTube's top influencers have cashed in on highly lucrative sponsorship deals to promote an online gambling company to their young fans, and YouTube doesn't have a problem with it.
I'm in the White House, waiting. The Democrats are everywhere but Washington as people await their pay. They are having fun and not even talking! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2019
I've only been to Shaheen Bagh, but I've read a lot about the other places. Knowing what is happening in India, and knowing the long and dangerous history of being young, male and Muslim in India, it makes total sense. I don't think it's just about minimising the violence that comes down on bodies that resist the state, I think it's also about the realisation that young Muslim men are particularly vulnerable. Muslim men would be the first to be labelled as terrorists, to be picked to up some kind of mob, and to be disappeared. I think the strategy is one that one sees elsewhere. When young men are vulnerable in a particular kind of way, the women come forward. A friend of mine, who was talking about former Yugoslavia and Argentina as well, said that when the men were being disappeared, the women would come in front. It is a strategy. It is a protective strategy of the young men.
More than 50 Capitol Police and D.C. Metropolitan Police officers were injured during the attack, with several needing to be hospitalized with serious injuries, Sund said Thursday. Out of hundreds of rioters, some of whom took property from the building, just over a dozen people were arrested for breaking into the building.
A friend who works in the oil industry sent an image of the sticker to Narang. They spoke to HuffPost Canada on a condition of anonymity, fearing repercussions at their job. The sticker, reading X-Site Energy Services, was handed out recently as promotional material at job sites to be worn on hard hats, the worker said.

Economists appear divided about how the Narendra Modi government should address this situation. A section of economists believe that the government must not worry about increasing the fiscal deficit and scale up the extent of public expenditure to transfer money directly in the hands of people so that consumption demand increases. In an interview to HuffPost India, senior economist Sudipto Mundle advised an increase in public spending. The other section of economists holds the belief that structural factors must be addressed to fix the economy. Former member of the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council Rathin Roy explained this perspective in an interview to Huffpost India.
Adults are constantly telling me how to think and what to say. But mostly what not to say! After my doctors tested my IQ to be above the 99.9th percentile in third grade and said my EQ (emotional intelligence) was also surprisingly high, everything changed and adults started taking me more seriously ― I finally felt that I was being heard. The tests showed that I was something called profoundly gifted. I was admitted into Mensa International, a program for individuals with a high IQ, and became a Davidson Institute Young Scholar. My parents started getting professional advice in order to learn more about the needs of profoundly-gifted kids, and they moved me to a specialized elementary school. Today we live in the San Francisco Bay Area suburb of Pleasanton, and I attend both fourth grade and college. I am having an awesome time.
And particularly during the winter months, hearty Minnesotans gear up for some of the coldest living conditions in the northern hemisphere. In -20°F temperatures with only 15 mph of wind (which is common), frostbite can occur in as little as 10 minutes. Minnesota winters are not only dark and cold, but also potentially fatal.
Avol said one benefit of breathing masks, effective or not, is that they raise psychological awareness that air pollution is an issue worth talking about.
Democrats initially planned to make their first legislation in the majority a package of anti-corruption, campaign finance and democracy reform bills. That will now be the second item on their agenda, after funding the government, though they are still calling the anti-corruption package H.R. 1 and plan to pass that bill later on Thursday.
It all began for me after my sister, Monica, got hired for Smile and A Song Princess Parties, a company that provides princesses for parties here in Los Angeles. I'd been dreaming about moving to LA for years and was just waiting for my opportunity to join her, so two years later, when Joanna, the owner, was looking for more performers, I immediately accepted a position.
According to the police report: He was trying to put his finger in her vagina. She had a tampon in her vagina, and she said that she could tell he could tell that it was there. Nassar asked for a hug after the second appointment, too, she said.
The alert was ultimately sent out at roughly 4 a.m. local time, the L.A. Times reported, when the flooding had already began and it was clear the situation was only going to get worse.
Catching up on your favorite Netflix show might sound like your most appealing option when you have some free time, but putting off something you need to get done is likely to lead to more stress.
After New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) ordered all nonessential businesses to close by Sunday night and all nonessential workers to stay at home, there was some confusion about what kinds of businesses would be deemed essential. Cuomo named groceries, banks, utility companies, pharmacies, health care providers and media outlets as some examples.
And the craziest part of all of this? I never touched the stuff myself.
Why Burma? Burma (renamed Myanmar by military rulers), is where Aung San Suu Kyi is preparing for her party to assume leadership in Parliament in March. Her National League for Democracy swept an astonishing 78 percent of the seats in fall elections. One can only imagine the joy, relief and exhaustion the Nobel laureate must have felt, having led the struggle against military rule since 1989. She spent 15 of those years under house arrest. It's instructive to note some of the first things the democracy leader did after the election victory:
In a memo sent to employees Thursday afternoon, the company told managers to push back on any local law enforcement requests to close GameStop locations.
Psuche, from which we have the word psychology, can be translated in the Bible as heart, life, mind or soul, and refers to our soul which gives us our capacity to feeling and sense things. Pneuma can be translated as breath, life, spirit or wind, it is our spiritual nature associated with our ability to think, it is suggestive of thoughts that can blow through our mind. Our body, which is the earthly vehicle of the soul and spirit, in Greek is soma, the center of human activity and mobility, which we can identify with the human will.
Even amid a three-week partial government shutdown leaving federal workers scrambling for pay, the Trump administration is continuing to approve oil and gas drilling permits, Bloomberg reported.

His speech was emotional, heartfelt, comical and honest ― leaving not a dry eye in the room. You were the change, Obama said, speaking to Americans across the country. You answered people's hopes, and because of you, by almost every measure, America is a better, stronger place than it was when we started.
So what about the men online? What do men lie about, if they're not busy retouching their photos and lying about their weight? Well, they apparently lie a little, too: in one large study of online daters, men were found to lie more than women about their income, personal interests, and personal attributes.
Every time I visit the Capitol, I am in awe of its big, beautiful dome stretching into the sky, symbolizing the strength and endurance of American democracy. I am equally awed by what normally appears to be one of the most efficient security operations in the world.

If anyone could pull off a vegan, low-sugar yet still sweet, salty and even spicy cookie, it's chef Sam Talbot, whose new book is 100% Real. Talbot, who has Type 1 diabetes, is a pro at swapping high-sugar, high-carb ingredients for healthier ones, and these treats are a terrific example. They include coconut sugar and date sugar in lieu of regular white sugar, and then there's smoky ancho chili powder for a little kick and dark chocolate chips for a deep, rich chocolaty flavor. Fine sea salt, in the batter and on top of each cookie, is the unexpected finishing touch.
A government spokesman said this week they will exchange views with Chinese scientists but gave no indication whether they would be allowed to gather evidence.
But a large share of New York City's locally produced electricity is generated by two power plants in the densely populated northwestern corner of Queens that Constantinides represents. The plants, located in the councilman's native Astoria and neighboring Long Island City, each burn a mix of gas and fuel oil. The stations annually burn a combined 6.3 million gallons of No. 6 fuel oil ― a thick, viscous blend considered one of the most polluting energy sources in the world. The Long Island City plant, called Ravenswood Generating Station, was ranked the state's largest carbon polluter in 2014.

This can be a major benefit to workers who don't earn a lot now but expect to increase their income significantly in the future. For example, maybe you just graduated from medical school and are in your first year of residency. Eventually, you plan to open your own private practice. In this case, you will likely save money on taxes by paying them now while your income is relatively low instead of at retirement. Tax-deferred compounded growth over decades can really make a big impact to one's retirement nest egg, in addition to being able to have tax-free income later on during retirement, said Celeste Hernandez Revelli, a certified financial planner and director of financial planning at eMoney Advisor.
Women are rarely locked or chained inside massage parlors, but this does not mean they feel empowered to leave, said Esther Lai, a Polaris consultant on survivor experiences. They are mentally trapped. Traffickers recruit vulnerable women and control them through debt bondage, shame and by manipulating the cultural background they bring with them to America.

Take Allen: Pauline Kael and Joan Didion, both prominent female critics, savaged his opus Manhattan, which revolves around a 42-year-old man who is romancing a 17-year-old student, for, respectively, pass[ing] off a predilection for teen-agers as a quest for true values and telegraphing that adolescence can now extend to middle age.
The reason Medicare for All can provide coverage to everybody, while spending less money, is that the government would regulate prices throughout the health care sector ― not just on prescription drugs, but for doctors and hospitals and everything else.
Democrats had warned that the rules package from Trump's ally, the Senate GOP leader, could force midnight sessions that would keep most Americans in the dark and create a sham proceeding.

You are so capable. You are so flipping powerful. You are wise beyond your years and it's no-one else's responsibility to ensure you are smiling but yours.
After age 65, you can withdraw the funds tax-free to cover health insurance premiums in addition to other qualified medical expenses. You can also use the money for non-medical expenses without paying a penalty; you just have to pay taxes on the withdrawals.
Revenge isn't nice. The stuff that she's been through isn't nice. There's a reason that she has been doing something, I suppose, in a recreational way, in an impersonal way. She knows that if she gets close to the real thing, she can't trust herself. It's fucking dark and it's going to get darker. And so as an audience member, what do you do? This is what's exciting about revenge as a genre. You want it, but when you get it, it's not quite what you wanted. And then that's interesting because then we're all complicit, because what do we want? Do we want her to kill them? But again, she doesn't do anything. That's what's so frightening and powerful about her. She doesn't do anything to Alison. She doesn't do anything to Dean Walker's daughter.
He worked tirelessly to protect the Coastal Zone Act in Delaware, which is one of our treasured environmental laws, said Max Walton, a partner at the Wilmington, Delaware-based law firm Connolly Gallagher who argued the case with Frederick. I can't think of a human being who works harder and smarter and more fair than David Frederick.

Luongo noted that people like to visit major cities repeatedly for similar reasons. Buenos Aires for example is a city that many people go back to because there's always something vibrant and always something changing, whether that's the art scene, the nightlife, the restaurant scene.
I absolutely thought of these textbooks when watching what played out last week, Wellman said. It's the anti-science culture, anti-elite, the identification of Christianity with military culture.
Looking at yourself in the mirror becomes a firm impression. You have that familiarity. Familiarity breeds liking. You've established a preference for that look of your face, Pamela Rutledge, director of the Media Psychology Research Center, told The Atlantic back in 2014.
Some Santa Barbara and Ventura county residents who had just returned to their homes after evacuating in December from the Thomas fire were reluctant to pack up and go again when they received a flood warning. Some lost their homes, others their lives, as a result.
McConnell said, The president's lawyers will finally receive a level playing field, contrasting it with the House impeachment inquiry.
Sometimes it would be two or three guys in a row. As soon as I closed the door on the last guy, I'd think, That didn't hit the spot, then I'd find another one. It went on like this for years. Last Thanksgiving, he was back home to visit his parents and felt a compulsive need to have sex because he was so stressed out. When he finally found a guy nearby who was willing to hook up, he ran to his parents' room and started rifling through their drawers to see if they had any Viagra. So that was the rock-bottom moment? I ask. That was the third or fourth, yeah, he says. Adam's now in a 12-step program for sex addiction. It's been six weeks since he's had sex. Before this, the longest he had ever gone was three or four days. There are people who have lots of sex because it's fun, and that's fine. But I kept trying to wring it out like a rag to get something out of it that wasn't in there—social support, or companionship. It was a way of not dealing with my own life. And I kept denying it was a problem because I had always told myself, 'I've come out, I moved to San Francisco, I'm done, I did what I had to do as a gay person.'
Make Sure the Goal is Achievable
Especially in the beginning, when most people are not vaccinated, we really should not be changing behaviors at all, Sanchez said. We still need to wear masks, we still need to social distance.

Congressional makeup shapes any administration, but perhaps even more so for Biden, who spent 36 years in the Senate, plus eight as Obama's vice president and top congressional liaison. Biden leaned on that resume to pitch himself to the country as a consensus builder; he also criticized presidents' increased use of executive action to go around Congress and insisted it would be different in his presidency.

We fully expect to work with the Commissioner throughout the remainder of this season on finding a solution that is good for the game and our organization.
In the past year and a half, I'd taken to wearing wigs on stage and wraps and turbans off stage. I didn't want anyone to see what I was going through. I kept my disease and hair loss from friends and some family ― and I definitely kept it from fans. When I was backstage with a cast, I would go into another room to put on my wig because I just couldn't show them what I really looked like. It was hard for me to be the girl who was losing her hair and also a glamour girl of burlesque.
We don't necessarily trust police. We have a lot of reasons to not trust them, said Aalayah Eastmond, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas who survived last year's shooting. So having them at school makes it ten times worse and heightens the problem.

I'm going to let you in on a little secret: Feeling stuck is in your 20s (and even into your 30s) is pretty common. The statistics speak for themselves: 40% of job seekers are millennials, and only 18% of employed millennials expect to stick with their current role for more than a year.
One really good thing that has happened, which is about women's empowerment, is that the usual people who used to be representatives of the so called Muslim community — which is really really diverse, of course — people like (Syed) Shahabuddin — I think, that time has gone. That's really really important.
Some who said they'd felt an effect were worried about the disease itself: I have been feeling sick, but can't get tested, wrote one Alabama woman who was surveyed. I'm especially worried because I am over 60 and I have an autoimmune disorder―the medication I am on suppresses my immune system.
My poor intolerance to heat, odors and smoke. Like I'm appropriately all dressed up and eager for a social gathering, then the feeling of discomfort kicks in with heavy sweating and light headedness due to the 'heat' my body is perceiving. Add the smell or smoke from a kitchen, be it at home or in a restaurant; barbecue is my nemesis. I want to enjoy yet my body refuses and others see me as a killjoy or just too fussy. – Vee Vee Y.

What gives me hope is that this traditional bifurcation is starting to break down. People are starting to recognize that if they care about something, if they care about it enough that they donate money to the cause, they vote around the cause, they donate their time, then they should care about it enough that it factors into their economic decisions — where they work, what they buy, how they save and invest. We're still in the early stages with such investment products, but we're getting there.
Not necessarily. Think about your timing in the same way you'd consider it with other illnesses like the flu, said Dr. Kristin Dean, a physician with Doctor on Demand.

Putting a check mark next to 'chop carrots' or 'toast spices' and knowing you won't have to run around looking for stuff feels great, Grubb says with enthusiasm. Having all those ingredients ready to cook in a delicious recipe and feeling that you're ready to rock service is always a moment of Zen ― and in this new era, even Instagram pic-worthy to have a neat, satisfying spread of ingredients rounded up before the rodeo begins.
I'm still recovering from pneumonia but every day seems a little brighter, he told the Hartford Courant. This is one thing less on my mind ... I can smile again.
There's been a lot of talk along the lines of when this is all over and when things get back to normal. I think, by and large, many people's lives will return to normal eventually. They'll go shopping without their masks and gloves, browse leisurely, and stop to chat in the aisles. They'll return to pre-coronavirus behaviors such as not wiping down surfaces they touch, not using copious amounts of hand sanitizer, and for the most part not thinking much at all about germs.

As I am moving on with my life and doing things that must be done, I am finding that more and more people are tuning into what I have to say and how I am living my life. There are an ever increasing number of youths and people at higher stations in life who are taking my stands on different issues as the standard. This increasing fame and influence has given me a different perspective on life. While I used to be the center of my universe before, I have made the fundamental principles of life to be the center of my life. According to Einstein, Insanity is doing the same thing again and again but expecting different results. We must change some aspects of our lives if we are unhappy with the circumstances or people we are attracted to ourselves. If we want something we never had, we must become something that we never were. We'd be very careful about our speech if we knew the power of our words. By the idle words, some men have destroyed themselves and their life that would otherwise could have been one of great enjoyment and pleasure.

Sitecues is a software-as-a-service technology that can make any website more accessible and usable. When sitecues is added to a website, it gives website visitors the option to customize the website to meet their individual needs. In this way, websites are made more accessible for individuals with different needs -- such as age-related vision loss, learning disabilities, or low literacy.
The taxes and premiums would be in lieu of what private individuals and employers pay for insurance today, so that, advocates say, a majority would come out ahead. But exactly how many would depend on the budget arithmetic in the rest of the program. If the cuts in payments to doctors and hospitals aren't deep enough, for example, the whole program would end up more expensive, requiring bigger taxes and swelling the ranks of people who would feel worse off financially.
This begs the question ― is there an afterlife? I have had numerous experiences since that time, as men and woman nearing death speak of feeling the need to pack and ask for my help. I assured all of them that they would get the help they needed.

Overnight, you went from a twosome to a trio that includes a demanding little human. You liked all the attention, romance and affection you had before, and now you might feel a little neglected by your partner (not to mention feeling drained emotionally by your newborn).

I ran on the same issues that progressives all over the country, including in New York City, ran on: Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, making sure that we treat housing as a human right in this country.
Modern party politics has its contradictions. By its growing dependence on major donations from corporations, it risks exposing its class nature. Failures of major parties to solve key social problems increasingly provoke people to turn against the party system. Contemporary movements for social change are increasingly skeptical of allying with any existing political parties.
Success is whatever you think you are at that time in your life. When I was a waiter, making $30 a day, I was the best waiter at that restaurant and I felt successful.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Wednesday that any lawmaker who refuses to pass through new metal detectors installed in the U.S. Capitol may be hit with severe fines under a proposed rule change, a step she called tragic but necessary after several Republicans refused to do so.
Americans spend a lot on things. According to a 2017 report in The Boston Globe, men in the U.S. spent over $26 million on shoes in 2016. That number was even closer to $30 million for women. The Balance reported that retail sales hit a record high of $5.7 trillion in the U.S. in 2017. Somewhat ironically, people have suggested that Kondo's new show is responsible for increasing sales at The Container Store.
Multiple airlines also said they plan to keep flight crews out of hotels in downtown Washington and increase staffing at Washington-area airports to supplement front-line teams during Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20. American Airlines will also cut alcohol service on flights in and out of the city until Jan. 21.
Others are enthusiastic about Medicare for All, but think it would be more practical, as policy and politics, to have a more gradual transition ― for example, by making the new public insurance plan voluntary for individuals and employers, while enrolling newborns so that it gets bigger over time. That's the approach of a new bill from Reps. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) and Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.).

Houck: We really want to develop a way to help people think about healthy eating differently. We had feedback from people. One woman wrote and said: I've never eaten so many vegetables in my life. My blood pressure is under control. My diabetes is under control. I've lost 25 pounds. Micheal and I said we should be eating our soups. If we can get people thinking that way, then there's an opportunity to get them thinking about cooking differently. Micheal and I grew up with parents and grandparents who cooked everything from scratch. We're circling around the idea of how to combine community urban farming and cooking from scratch and an on-a-budget idea and being able to form that into something to teach communities to be healthier.
I used to work in the food industry.
Things that are new and different are sometimes scary. Don't avoid the fear or the challenge, embrace it. As you start to embrace it more, saddling up will become easier. Opportunity has a way of disguising itself in a blanket of fear. As you approach a fearful or scary situation in your life, take a moment before you saddle up, and find courage in these important factors:
Since there's no known transmission of COVID-19 through food, you don't need to worry about avoiding any foods in particular. A bigger concern when shopping is the risk of coronavirus transmission from person to person.

Arana: No you don't. In fact, it was the very thing that drew me to work with my partner at The Agency. He has a sign in his office that says No Assholes. Life is too short to work with people you don't like. Even with clients who are choosing you to represent them, if I don't feel we are a good fit, I will be professional about it but I will tell them we are not a good fit. You may be working with a client for a year. Do you really want to work with someone for a year you know is not a good fit? I work very hard. I have a very strong work ethic and high integrity. These are qualities I want around me.
Well before my time, the R-conferences in the 1990s were biannual gatherings organized by EMPA [Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology], he says. These conferences initially focused on the technical aspects of recycling and were geared towards engineers and scientists. As recycling became a more prominent theme, people started to realize that it was more than a technical problem, that it would affect production and consumption.
The women in our family carry the load when it comes to housework and elder care. We are not the only family entrenched in this division of labor. It is estimated that 66% of informal caregivers are female. Also, female caregivers spend as much as 50% more time providing care than male caregivers. There are only grandsons in my family, and this heightens the tension over how to manage Mom's care.

Two runoffs Tuesday in Georgia will decide which party controls the Senate and, thus, how far the new president can reach legislatively on issues such as the pandemic, health care, taxation, energy, and the environment. For a politician who sold himself to Americans as an uniter and a seasoned legislative broker, the Georgia elections will help determine whether he's able to live up to his billing.

Lawmakers passed a series of bills Monday that include establishing an early voting period, consolidating primary dates, automatically updating voter registrations when people move, and allowing 16- and 17-year-olds to pre-register to vote. Despite its reputation as a progressive state, New York stuck out for its abysmal voter turnout and not having early voting, a practice in place in some deep red states. It was also the only state in the country in 2018 to have separate primaries for state and federal offices.
Furthermore, the same inequities and broken governance and management systems that propagate the biodiversity and climate crises also made us vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic.

If Trump did back DACA, it would still be a sell to Democrats in Congress. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other leaders have said that deal is no longer on the table, after Trump rejected it last year. It would take a substantial amount of trust that Trump wouldn't just change his mind and somehow find a way out of DACA, perhaps by offering a new executive order to override the legislation.
Respondents across the country also noted other effects, from falling stock prices to ravaged supermarkets to NCAA cancellations. And some expressed exasperation at what they considered an exaggerated panic.

Hogan said this kind of boss can cause bigger issues down the road, because they tend not to find out about team problems that should have been addressed or raised earlier. Long-term, it often ends in disaster, because this person never did their first responsibility, which is managing the team, Hogan said.

You should subscribe. SIGN UP The researchers I spoke to explained that gay guys inflict this kind of damage on each other for two main reasons. The first, and the one I heard most frequently, is that gay men are shitty to each other because, basically, we're men. The challenges of masculinity get magnified in a community of men, Pachankis says. Masculinity is precarious. It has to be constantly enacted or defended or collected. We see this in studies: You can threaten masculinity among men and then look at the dumb things they do. They show more aggressive posturing, they start taking financial risks, they want to punch things. This helps explain the pervasive stigma against feminine guys in the gay community. According to Dane Whicker, a clinical psychologist and researcher at Duke, most gay men report that they want to date someone masculine, and that they wished they acted more masculine themselves. Maybe that's because, historically, masculine men have been more able to blend into straight society. Or maybe it's internalized homophobia: Feminine gay men are still stereotyped as bottoms, the receptive partner in anal sex. A two-year longitudinal study found that the longer gay men were out of the closet, the more likely they were to become versatile or tops.

By cooler heads prevail, we don't mean this:
Identifying this can be a tricky process since many of the agreements that couples make are implicit, unspoken and even unrecognized. We all have our own set points for what we find to be comfortable levels of risk and security in our lives and our relationships. It's not uncommon for a person with a lower threshold for risk to be in a relationship with someone with a relatively higher one. The dynamic tension of such a match can be a source of distress to the couple, depending upon how different each partner's comfort levels are and their respective skill levels in dealing with differences.
Now that you've calmed down, think about what's motivating your anger. More often than not, anger is a secondary emotion we use as a mask or a defense for an entirely different feeling (shame, for instance, or embarrassment).
Dr. Jean Twenge, a professor at San Diego State University and author of Generation Me, has been a strong proponent that the Millennials, as a group, are basically self-obsessed and not prepared for real life.
We must listen to the voices of LGBTQ people, many of whom are Christians — to their stories of oppression, pain, joy and historical and present triumph. We must let their stories change those of us who are not marginalized on the basis of gender or sexual orientation and follow in the fight for a more equitable world. I must, as a Christian reject any ideology, law or practice that strips people of their humanity.
Taking a real stance on officer safety will require us to address the elephant in the room, Solomon said. Addressing officer wellness which includes spiritual, mental, social, and physical health should be the number one priority for each agency head in 2019.

The key is to be mindful of foot placement. Most of the time, when a fall occurs, it will be when a winter runner is running fast and not paying attention and/or turning, said Kyle Kranz, an online running coach based in South Dakota.

What's your advice on dealing with them?
Sex scenes in movies or on TV may inspire couples to get it on. They may see something they want to try, or they may get aroused just watching. If watching erotic scenes makes you uncomfortable, this may be indicative of a problem in your own sex life or trigger some aspect of your own sexuality that is shameful or confusing. Being able to enjoy a sexy scene with you partner is a sign of sexual health. If shame or embarrassment is getting in the way, it may be a sign of a problem. If you struggle to maintain sexual attraction to your partner, watching a sexy movie may serve as a painful reminder that you 'lost that lovin' feeling.' It may also spark a conversation that you do not want to have. Honesty is the best policy. Communicating directly about your sexual satisfaction, expectations and preferences is the best way to avoid a sexless relationship. ― Kimberly Resnick Anderson, sex therapist and associate professor of psychiatry at UCLA School of Medicine
Some experts are concerned the variant could be even more dangerous than the strain found in the U.K. Both strains are thought to be more infectious than the previously dominant strain going around, but there's also concern the B.1.351 variant could wind up being resistant to the vaccines.

Overall, as in previous HuffPost/YouGov surveys, Americans give everyone in Washington low marks for their handling of the shutdown ― but the GOP is faring especially badly. Americans are 45 percentage points likelier to disapprove than to approve of the performance by Congress as a whole. They disapprove of congressional Republicans by a 29-point margin, of Trump by a 17-point margin and of congressional Democrats by a 13-point margin. Members of the public are close to evenly split on how they feel about the performance of their own representatives.

The easiest way to avoid germs, of course, is to just stay home, and as a freelance writer, I'm fortunate to be able to do that more than some people. However, because I am single and live alone, there is still that pesky need to go out and get food. I can't have groceries delivered or get takeout food because thinking about what hands might have touched my food causes anxiety. Yes, it's irrational, because plenty of hands have touched everything whether it's delivered or I buy it myself in the store. It doesn't matter; germophobia is not a logical condition and I can't reason with my thoughts or tell myself not to worry.

White people doing similar or worse things than black people does not absolve black people of their bullshit.

Nature is ever evolving and it's always setting an example for us to move upward and onward continuously. However, some of us refuse to listen to the divine voice and stay amid our past or the ruins unless death of a friend or lover, end of a comfortable occupation or source of living or a great tragedy that forces us to change. As Napoleon Hill said, FIn every adversity, there lies a seed of equal or greater benefit. So, do all the disappointments and failures. They come to guide us, teach us, and make us think about things we never would otherwise learn.
Homeowners previously were able to write off the interest on mortgages up to $1 million. Under the new tax law, however, the cap has been reduced to $750,000 in qualified residence loans.

This is not to say that there are not real, genuine concerns that we should be having about the ways in which predominantly white institutions influence and orchestrate the persecution of black people in the public eye. It is, after all, overwhelmingly white institutions like the Oscars and the Grammy and white tastemakers like Ellen who have co-signed these men as much as any black people have. This also isn't to play into some narrative that all black people are inherently homophobic or misogynistic (I'm aware that tweets or comments on The Shade Room, for instance, do not represent the totality of black opinion on this situation). But the conversation around these two stories still forces us to interrogate the ways in which we do and don't show up for one another.
About 81,000 people around the world have now become ill with COVID-19, with the World Health Organization reporting cases in 37 countries outside China. There has been a rash of new cases appearing in Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan over the past week, and officials fear the virus could spread undetected in other countries that lack the capacity to monitor people for signs of infection.

Why is it called the Buffalo Declaration?
We are undoing a history of voter suppression and injustice in Black and Brown communities. The changes we are seeing now didn't happen overnight, and we are not solving our challenges with just one vote. Over the last couple of months, the New Georgia Project Action Fund has knocked on millions of doors, called, texted, and held in-depth conversations with voters across Georgia. Organizers showed up, and the voters decided. We know that our community is ready for change. We are ready to fight COVID-19 and to be represented in the halls of power by real leadership.

Yet Karsten cautions against depotting foundations and concealers unless they come in the same type of plastic packaging.

Luckily, big, chunky sweaters are everywhere in stores right now, as most brands are still stocking their winter collections. Soon enough, the stock will change, but that just means you'll probably be able to snag some cozy knits on sale. Or, if you're feeling extra crafty, you can try your hand at knitting your own chunky sweater; trendy knitting brands like We Are Knitters and Wool and the Gang have plenty of kits available. They don't necessarily come cheap ― though you can also find tons of super affordable and free patterns online ― but considering you could easily spend upward of $100 or even $200 for a big, cozy sweater, making your own doesn't seem so bad.
Hawley plans to object to the state tally from Pennsylvania. But that state's Republican senator, Pat Toomey, criticized the attack on Pennsylvania's election system and said the results that named Biden the winner are valid.

People say I've had my butt done or I've had liposuction. When I hear that I have fake body parts it frustrates me, but I also take it as a compliment, Kardashian explains. I bust my ass every day, so I get annoyed when people say I've had liposuction and my hard work gets discredited. Yet on the other hand, I take it as a compliment because it's like I look that good that my butt looks fake.

More men than women are dying from COVID-19. So why is it that men take it less seriously?
The country currently at the epicenter of the pandemic faces a critical moment this week that could prove to be a global turning point in stemming coronavirus.
In a court filing in Texas, the department said they have have sued the wrong defendant and Pence should not be the target of the legal action.
Roses and lisianthus and black-eyed Susans. It was all so beautiful and romantic, and for a moment I let down my guard, and was overwhelmed with joy. Stace was standing in the middle of bridge, in the middle of nowhere, for no other reason than that she knew it would make me happy. It felt so safe.
When Aaron Rodgers led the Green Bay Packers to their fourth Super Bowl title (and 13th NFL championship) in 2011, he did it despite his team being the sixth and lowest seed in the NFC. That year, the Packers had to win three road games just to earn the right to play Pittsburgh in the big game. That's the beauty of this single-elimination tournament: It doesn't matter how you got here. It just matters that you're here.
LA is a success story, he said. It's much cleaner than when I was growing up, he said. The current generation have it much better.
The charges against her sister, Varma believes, will eventually be dropped. She has faith in the higher courts of India. But the lifelong legal battle, which now lies ahead of them, will change their lives forever.
The U.S. testing system, key to containing infection, has been a failure in the crunch, as public health authorities (but never Trump) acknowledged in March.
But new arrivals like Mondaire Jones, a progressive who won an open Democratic primary in New York's 17th Congressional District, are also a major reason the makeup of the House Democratic Caucus is moving incrementally to the left.
But there are a few events that aren't so well-known. Looking back at discontinued events and demonstration sports throughout Winter Olympics history, there are even more. (Demonstration sports are showcases for promotional purposes. They're generally under consideration for inclusion in the regular Olympic program but often don't make the cut.)
This moment is truly unlike any other. It's made plain the deep social imbalances ― like poverty, racism, sexism, classism to name a few ― that are a new revelation for some, but have been common knowledge for many. As a trained public health professional and former state health official, I can't help but think about the lessons that I hope health care and public health take and learn from the moment we're in.
This healthy take on fruitcake is just as flavorful as the traditional version, despite its lack of butter, sugar and rum (a common ingredient in the classic). The recipe calls for dried cherries, raisins, apricots, figs and dates, but you can use any dried fruits you like. It also includes brewed tea and orange zest, which give the cake a pleasantly bright note.
We have more leads than we've ever had as a union, Perrone said. The question is … are we at the tipping point yet? This pandemic ripped gaping holes in the system. Is it going to change the way workers can unify together to make a move?
In November, when scientists at 13 federal agencies, including the EPA, determined in the annual National Climate Assessment that global warming was rapidly worsening, Wheeler responded by threatening to intervene in the next report's drafting.

Although the actual stickers weren't distributed at their workplace, they said the graphic image was circulating among their colleagues on Wednesday. The worker said the company was asked if it would be interested in a similar sticker.
The collective shrug can be attributed, in part, to the fact that fans and journalists alike saw Kelly as a hitmaker beyond reproach. As writer and former entertainment journalist Alexia Hudson-Ward put it, some folks want to enjoy his music without guilt, and that included writers and reporters within the entertainment industry. This much is clear in Nekesa Mumbi Moody's 2001 obituary of Aaliyah for the Associated Press, penned after Aaliyah's tragic death in a plane crash, where she refers to Kelly as an R&B superstar who had the greatest impact on [Aaliyah's] career.

In order to make lasting change, there must be some passion and true desire to do the work. It's not enough to want the result. You must want the result so badly that you're willing to make it a top priority this year. Most resolutions don't make the grade when you review them in this manner.
It's just that trusting Trump to hold up his end of a bargain is a gigantic leap of faith for Democrats.
This is not a process for a fair trial, this is the process for a rigged trial Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Ca., the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee leading the prosecution, told reporters. He called it a cover-up.
Party members will elect a new leader on June 27.
But, as is often the case in recent public opinion, the most glaring divide is political. President Donald Trump, who on Monday warned of the seriousness of the outbreak, had often downplayed the issue in previous statements, an attitude that's reflected in his supporters' reactions. Democrats are 35 percentage points likelier than Republicans to say they're at least somewhat concerned about the spread of coronavirus in the U.S. A 55% majority of Democrats, but just 19% of Republicans, say they're very concerned. (Previous epidemics like avian flu, H1N1 and Ebola, it's worth noting, also drew polarized responses.)
So, the misrepresentation was how quickly I said I was immediately against the war. I was against the war internally and trying to put together coalitions to try to change the way in which the war was conducted, he explained.
In Madrid, struggling with Spain's heaviest virus load, the municipal funeral home announced it would stop collecting bodies from Tuesday due to a shortage of equipment. Private funeral homes continue to operate in the capital.
And that's why he stood down, Cable says of his predecessor. I don't think it was what he said, that did upset quite a lot of people, it was the fact that he basically went missing in the early part of the campaign because he was preoccupied with that problem. He's acknowledged that himself. I spoke out very strongly and made it clear that was absolutely not my view and absolutely not the party's view. But he is a party spokesman I am not proposing to change that.
Republicans have already put record numbers of Trump's judges onto the federal bench: 30 circuit judges, 53 district judges and two Supreme Court justices. That's so many circuit judges ― more than any other president has seen confirmed by this point in his first term ― that 1 in 6 seats on the U.S. circuit courts are now filled by judges nominated by Trump.
Scenes like we had [Wednesday] are extremely detrimental to the image of the United States and lead to questions internationally about how strong and how safe U.S. democracy really is, but most leaders are reassured that within a couple weeks, you'll see a transition of power that will bring a new president with more traditional values and less of a dangerous ideology, said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.
In 2014, major American medical groups — including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists — issued official guidelines that specifically challenged Friedman's standards.
We've been able to leverage the enthusiasm and resolve that Black Georgians have, Ufot said. We've invested a huge amount of resources into making sure those votes are counted. It minimizes the amount of intimidation voters feel when they go to cast their ballot.

Authorities said there's a heightened risk of sustained local transmission of coronavirus.
So I'm really looking forward to just getting stuff done. And for what it's worth, I think the media has really exaggerated the dissension within the Democratic caucus. Obviously there are ideological differences. But when I speak to the 15 members of the freshman class, we just want to work together to get things done.
What's something other people wouldn't know or realize about being married to a health care worker during the pandemic?
This was the heavy confession I told our couple's counselor last August, as my husband and I returned from our honeymoon in Hawaii. It was a deep sigh, a release from the weight of so many years of tiger parenting deeply ingrained in me as the child of immigrants.

There are two things that are important in politics, Marcus Hanna, chairman of the Republican National Committee and United States Senator from Ohio once declared: The first is money, and I can't remember the second.
I hope by sharing this that I can possibly help someone who has also felt worthless, unloved, and hopeless. Fighting depression is an incredibly hard battle, but taking small steps every once in a while is better than nothing. Reaching for help is not shameful, and mental illness is not bigger than you. Just like a sport, it can be conquered.

The coffee-and-doughnut chain will delay the distribution of the reusable cups that were planned to be given away next week until later this year.
I think regardless of how formal or informal, the clothing should still be respectful and subtle, as opposed to out there, Gottsman said. You have to show that you made the effort. That's the bottom line. You have to show that you made some effort to come and show your respect for the deceased and the family members.
When I was in graduate school, a professor kept making this joke about how Economics majors are just learning how to get money from poor people. It was Berkeley, so it got a few laughs each time he said it, but I think about that comment a lot today, especially as I've become a business owner and entrepreneur myself. I twisted the question around a bit: What are entrepreneurs going to college for?
You want to honor the spirit of the event, Daniel Post Senning, co-host of the Awesome Etiquette podcast and co-author of Emily Post's Etiquette, 19th Edition, told HuffPost. Traditionally, that [meant wearing] things that were darker tones. It didn't always have to be black, but the idea was that you weren't really festive. The idea was that you were expressing mourning.
Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has tested positive for the coronavirus, according to his office. He is the first senator known to have contracted the virus.He is feeling fine and is in quarantine, Paul's office tweeted. He is asymptomatic and was tested out of an abundance of caution due to his extensive travel and events. He was not aware of any direct contact with any infected person.
I hope my children learn this lesson much sooner than I did. Because it's taken 37 years and thousands of miles for me to realize: I belong in every place my heart longs to be in this world. I can show up scared. I can show up worried. I can show up doubting my ability -- but I will never again show up timid and uncertain of my place in this world, wherever my feet may take me, where I belong.
This is not to say that the desire for physical, financial or emotional security is inherently dangerous or misguided, far from it. But the devil is, in this case, in the details, particularly the detail that has to do with the place on the priority list that the commitment to security is placed.
Trying to figure out how COVID-19 vaccination is going in the U.S. is a lot harder than you might think.
What are some techniques you use to keep your dogs happy when long walks outdoors aren't an option?

One of our most important responsibilities as Pride festivals is to put focus on the injustices and oppression that LGBTIQ+ persons still suffer in other countries and here at home, West Pride President Tasso Stafilidis told HuffPost in an email. By arranging EuroPride we can aim a spotlight on life-critical issues, like transgender people's living situations, shape public opinion and make demands for change and respect.
Morrison also announced bans on indoor gatherings of more than 100 people, urged social distancing for months and chastised Australians for hoarding food and home goods.
The real threat to the swimsuit issue may not be that women's protests will bring it down, he wrote. No, the threat is that women will co-opt it. Instead of taking offense at the swimsuit models, women may have become more inclined to identify with them and to look like them. … More than 400 women a day get breast enlargements, lifts or reductions, and according to Self they tell plastic surgeons that the desire to change — to look more like an SI model — is their own, not some man's, idea.
Some students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas ― particularly those of color ― told HuffPost that the suggested changes, like heightened security and armed teachers, would make the school feel less safe.

It's easy to scroll through Instagram and assume everyone else is leading a life far superior to your own. But this is often far from the truth, according to Ree Langham, a psychologist and writer at ParentingPod.com.
Are you ready to join the world's largest digital party on Sunday night?
Cleveland's decision should finally compel the Washington football team to make the same honorable decision, Halbritter continued. Washington Owner Dan Snyder needs to look at Cleveland's move and then look in the mirror and ask whether he wants to be forever known as the most famous purveyor of bigotry in modern sports, or if he wants to finally stand on the right side of history and change his team's name.
When you don't include moms in the football safety conversation, we take control of it ourselves. After Paul died, I joined other victims' families to create an awareness group that encourages kids and families to drop tackle football and instead play flag football, which has all the fun and teamwork of tackle without the risk of repetitive brain trauma inside a too-large helmet.
The coming year is crucial for biodiversity. In 2019 and early 2020, momentum was really building for recognizing the climate and ecological crises as one interlinked crisis: ecological degradation undermines the climate, and climate change poses a huge threat to ecosystems.
This is such a proud moment for us as parents knowing that Lucas has a platform to spread joy, not only to those he interacts with every day, but to people all over the country, his mom, Cortney Warren, said in the press release.

Of course, my parents stayed as long as they could without getting hurt, Lee, 93, told HuffPost in June. And then, they left the house to them, and they burned the place, drug out the furniture, tore the place up.
• What went wrong: Maybe Coughlin's approach grew a little stale after a decade—an eternity in NFL coaching circles these days. Maybe embattled GM Jerry Reese set up Coughlin to fail over the past two years by allowing the Giants' defense to evaporate into nothingness. A little from column A and a little from column B paints the most complete picture.
The Republican lawmakers on Sunday said that the only reasonable way Trump could shift the results of the election would be finding proven evidence of fraud before Jan. 6. All legal challenges to do so have failed, and no evidence has arisen.
It looked like Dresden after World War II, Inslee said. In my final days, when I look back and ask what I did to deal with climate change, I want to be able to say I did everything I could, including possibly running for president.
Just weeks before the severity of the novel coronavirus outbreak in the United States became unmistakable, President Donald Trump's administration offered states a way to make significant cuts to their Medicaid programs, which provide health care coverage for just over 20% of the population.

In the end, no matter how much I wash, sanitize and self-isolate, there's no guarantee that COVID-19 won't eventually find me. If it does, I can only hope I am one of the 80% that the World Health Organization says will have mild symptoms. In the meantime, I am doing everything I can to prevent my phobia from getting the best of me.
Rick Tyler, a political consultant who worked for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, said Trump's performance in this crisis will have consequences this November.
Loeffler, a former Wall Street executive, is the richest member of Congress, and her husband is the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange. In April, she came under significant criticism for trading millions of dollars in stocks after receiving a closed-door Senate briefing on the coronavirus in January ― before many Americans understood the severity of the virus. While Loeffler said at the time that she did nothing wrong with the trades, she announced that she and her husband would liquidate their individual stock shares to move on from the distraction. In the runoffs, Perdue and Loeffler tied themselves closely to President Donald Trump, putting them at odds with the Republican political establishment in their own state. They backed Trump's efforts to discredit and overturn the presidential election results in Georgia, even as the state's top GOP officials ― including the governor and the secretary of state ― stood by the results.
Always do your best and shine when you don't feel like it. Get up each day and tell yourself you can do it and prove everyone wrong about your capabilities.

In the spending bills Democrats plan to pass on Thursday, the February date for DHS funding would serve to continue negotiations. Some Republicans in the House may end up voting for the bill, and there's a possibility that if the shutdown drags on for long enough, Senate Republicans could pass the bill and both chambers could override Trump's veto.
This is not to dismiss the individual empowerment (a word used so blithely and frequently that it has almost lost all meaning) that the women who participated in this or any other Sports Illustrated swimsuit photo shoot may feel. Brinkley Cook told E! News that the project made her feel sexy, but also more emotional. It helped me accept myself, she said. Raisman had similar praise for the project. For me, 'In Her Own Words' serves as a reminder that we are all humans, we are all battling something, and it is OK to not be OK, she said. We are not alone and we need each other.
The extraordinary climate events of 2020 and the data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service show us that we have no time to lose, said Matthias Petschke, director for space in the European Commission, the EU's executive arm.

Some of us argue we were born less fortunate with little or no starting points. But I think we are all born with some genetic genius, maybe passed down from our great, great ancestors. But if left dormant, it becomes lifeless.
City officials announced school closures in Chicago, Detroit and Milwaukee because of the weather.
In a statement released Sunday, Zirinsky, who has long been the head of 48 Hours, emphasized that the change in title wouldn't mean a change in goals.
4. You are compensated and recognized based upon your performance. Hard work should be noticed and although it's wonderful to feel like you are a part of the team, nothing beats a pat on the back, genuine gratitude and/or compensation for extra effort. That doesn't mean you should be expecting a bonus every time you burn the midnight oil or chip in to do an extra project. Having a winning job means your employer is aware and gives you two thumbs up for a job well done.
I worry that focusing on the cause of the financial crisis and Wall Street's seemingly endless proclivity to create complex investments will obscure the larger issue. It's that the underlying premise is fatally flawed. Many investors believe their stockbrokers have a legal obligation to put the interest of the investor first. They don't understand the inherent conflict of interest that comes with permitting stockbrokers to sell investment products that generate higher fees as long as those investments are deemed suitable. Stockbrokers are under no obligation to advise their clients that lower-fee investments, with higher expected returns, are available.
This doesn't mean you can't have fun. There are plenty of activities you can do on dates or with friends that don't involve drinking. It just may take a little getting used to at first (which is totally normal). Don't give up.
Illustrations or drawings can prove even trickier to prosecute, since the spirit of the law is to stop the proliferation of those images to protect children from being victimized.
Q. What would Santiago today tell the 20 year-old Santiago self?
Before I knew it, I was engaged in a full argument over my ill son as another adult tried to arrogantly lecture me about Type 2 diabetes, an illness my son doesn't have. I knew she spoke from a place of ignorance and concern. Still, it's hard not to defend your parenting skills to a mob of people who are judging you about things they know nothing about.

The 2017 edition of CES, which convenes this week in Las Vegas, marks the 50th anniversary of what has become the largest trade show in the country. More than 165,000 attendees will pour into Sin City, taxing the city's infrastructure and the patience of drivers, to visit more than 3,800 exhibits in multiple halls and hotels across the city. And what happens in Vegas this week will definitely not stay in Vegas, considering the swarm of media covering the show and the thousands of new gadgets about to be unveiled.
Pod after pod of spouting whales, the great ones together with the lesser kinds, surge through waters everywhere aripple with living tides of fishes. Wheeling multitudes of gannets, kittiwakes, and other such becloud the sky. The stony finger marking the end of the long beach below me is clustered with resting seals. The beach itself flickers with a restless drift of shorebirds. In the bight of the bay, whose bottom is a metropolis of clams, mussels, and lobsters, a concourse of massive heads emerges amongst floating islands of eider ducks. Scimitar tusks gleam like a lambent flame.... The vision fails.
Pubs have been ordered to close from midnight tonight, as the U.K. government escalates measures to fight coronavirus. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously urged people to avoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues in order to try and slow the spread of the virus. But despite the plea, many Londoners were still gathering in pubs in some parts of the capital this week. The government also announced it would step in to pay 80% of the wages of workers to encourage employers not to layoff staff.
When you don't have job experience, it's highly unlikely that your first job (or first few) will be the ideal fit. Especially in today's hyper-competitive market, I would advise millennials to not get dismayed and to treat every job like a valuable learning experience. I was a temporary employee at my first job, but keeping a positive attitude led me to where I am today. - Elle Kaplan, LexION Capital

Shortly after Meghan and Harry's announcement, Buckingham Palace released a statement saying the Queen's discussions with Meghan and Harry are at an early stage.
Never has our dysfunction been on display more than in 2016. As a post-WWII baby who witnessed the aftermath of what we can do when we all come together, and as a coed whose university closed because of national unrest during the Vietnam war--just a couple of events during my lifetime that prove we have issues--I've always taken pride in my country because the individuals who make up our citizenry are, overall, a good and generous people.
Bringing your baby home is a magical bonding time for most couples. But life with a newborn is also incredibly stressful, full of little hiccups you may have never anticipated during pregnancy.
In a trailer released on Tuesday, fans are treated to a collage of some of the Pearson family's most heartwarming moments before we see their home engulfed in flames.
Especially during a job search, rejections are most likely to play a big role. You might send out hundreds of applications only to receive negative responses in your inbox almost on a daily basis, which are surely de-motivators and self-esteem eaters.
The risk of transmission is increasing. There is limited availability of testing and infection control facilities. Critical care for Australians who become seriously ill, including in Bali, is likely to be significantly below the standards available in Australia. Medical evacuation to Australia may be not be possible and, if it is, very expensive. It may not be covered by travel insurance. - Department Of Foreign Affairs
Could you do it in a hospital, say? That's probably one (where) there's not enough fat in the system. If so, then it may not help some of the most highly stressed workers.
My family's visits to the Capitol over the years have increased in frequency as Trump's attacks on health care and civil rights have intensified. During every visit, my young daughter in a wheelchair is subjected to intense security searches. She is often required to get out of her wheelchair to be searched while her wheelchair is inspected thoroughly.

CBD is short for cannabidiol, the nonpsychoactive ingredient that can be found in weed. CBD doesn't get you high (that's what the THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, in weed does). Commercially available CBD has little to no THC in it.
After all, Sports Illustrated gifted these beautiful, accomplished women the ability to speak ― via words inked onto their naked bodies. How magnanimous! The messaging just falls a bit flat when those photos are sandwiched between more sexy photos of all those pretty girls in those beautiful places who have yet to be given the commercial chance to be who they are.
Crowdfunding, the online technology that transformed the field of fundraising, is about to disrupt America's grant-giving, and for leaders trying to change the world for the better, this change can't come fast enough.

One such worker is Larry Howard, a 62-year-old guest services associate at the National Zoo in Washington. The zoo is part of the sprawling Smithsonian network, which closed on Jan. 2 as a result of the shutdown. Howard said he is employed by a non-profit contractor, the Friends of the National Zoo, earning $13.50 per hour in his part-time position. His last payday was Jan. 4, and he doesn't expect to receive a check next week as he normally would.

The federal government is responsible for enforcing immigration law, so no one truly obsessed with deporting people would allow the federal government to shut down because that would further jam up a complex enforcement system that is already backlogged in the federal courts by more than 1 million cases.

The Donald Trump presidency is now one year old and in many respects ― the unhinged tweeting, the contempt for democratic norms, the potential collusion with a hostile foreign power ― it has been unlike any presidency in history.
Because the federal government does not mandate the reporting of officer suicides, Blue H.E.L.P. must obtain and verify raw data from a number of sources, including individual law enforcement agencies and surviving family members.
Ocasio-Cortez has been an outspoken proponent for reopening the government, as the partial shutdown hits its 18th day.
Family and emergency Dr. Janette Nesheiwat suggested that polyester, spandex-like material may retain germs longer than breathable cotton-based fabrics, making it important to wash leggings, underwear and dresses carefully (more on how to do that later!).
I never break character, even if I'm just talking to the adults or saying goodbye to the parents. It just makes the whole experience a lot more authentic and magical for everyone involved.
But he warned that the current political environment ― one in which Donald Trump's administration has loosened health restrictions on school lunches and fought sugar taxes ― did not bode well for progress.
That the federal government blew the pandemic response is, outside QAnon fantasy forums, uncontroversial. Less well-understood is the way federal economic mismanagement has contributed to the public health problem.

One possibility is that a wildlife poacher might have passed the virus to traders who carried it to Wuhan, one of the WHO team members, zoologist Peter Daszak of the U.S. group EcoHealth Alliance, told The Associated Press in November.
Congress sources did not confirm if the party had decided not to run a full campaign as a matter of strategy, but they did say cutting AAP's vote was deemed a bad idea.
The way you can address it is to capitalize on time when the baby is asleep to connect with each other ― and of course, to use babysitters. A lot of babysitters, Anderson said. Turn off the TV and actually do some connecting – the same goes when you get a babysitter: Get out of the house and enjoy some baby-free time.
Many airlines connecting Australia to Europe are working around the clock to accommodate customer needs amid the outbreak and have substantially changed cancellation policies.
LBL just heard about One Day U a couple of years ago, and this was her 4th One Day U. Each one has been an intellectual awakening. Yesterdays line up was:
One month ago, on my birthday, I got this book from my doctor and friend, Teigen wrote in the Story. I was done with making an ass of myself in front of people (I'm still embarrassed), tired of day drinking and feeling like shit by 6, not being able to sleep.
WASHINGTON — The House of Representatives easily enacted a set of rules on Thursday that included pay-go budget limits loathed by some progressive members of Congress and outside activists. Just three Democrats voted against it: Reps. Ro Khanna (Calif.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) and Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii). An equivalent number of moderate Republicans voted for the rules.
There was a knighthood for cinematographer Roger Deakins, a 15-time Academy Award nominee who has won Oscars for Blade Runner 2049 and 1917.

Wheeler is the latest former employee of an industry regulated by the agency he now leads to be on the verge of ascending in the president's Cabinet.
Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, sounded a similar note. The ceiling of possibility is higher for everything we want to do, he said.
My New Year's resolution is to embrace the imperfect. I think as designers we so often strive to have everything be just so - always attempting to makes things appear perfect. However in letting go of the unachievable - and embracing the imperfections in life - we also find the joy. The dog hair on the sofa, the cluttered coffee table, the remnants of a meal - these are the results of things that bring me happiness. Curling up with one of my dogs for a nap on the sofa, reading the Sunday papers around the coffee table, or gathering with friends for a memorable dinner - all bring great joy. A little mess can be the sign of a life well lived. I intend to embrace it and give myself a hall pass when it comes to seeking perfection!
When it comes down to it, dogs need exercise and stimulation.
The most exciting part: When you're about to start a company, the world is rosy. We had a clear idea of what we were going to do and how fun starting a company would be. Then, reality hit... very quickly. Working out of a small apartment with my husband and no employees, no real product and just an idea was going to be much harder than we thought. The excitement dissipates a bit when you realize what you really have gotten into. No more Google, no more organic lunches, chair massages to break up the day, cheery co-workers to grab a drink with after work. Just you, your co-founder and a big idea.
The federal government has to come in and handle this, Cuomo said.
People have focused on this issue of a carbon tax, but it may not be necessary to finance renewable energy infrastructure, Inslee said. We may find other ways to finance this. You look at the Trump tax cuts that were misbegotten and gave all these tax benefits to the upper-income groups, and people weren't worried about the deficit when they did that.
Now let's pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act — Ari Berman (@AriBerman) January 6, 2021
It's been particularly horrible to see Ford's government revoke Liberal environmental policies because they haven't replaced them with anything significant, Del Duca said.

But I'm unprofessional? — Angie Thomas Doesn't Control Movies (@angiecthomas) February 5, 2018
That change you feel in the air is Kim Kardashian slowly, yet surely, returning to the limelight after three months of self-imposed seclusion. The reality star truly outdid herself on Thursday night with a series of Snapchats at a family dinner with her beloved sisters.
In the 1950s, an American obstetrician by the name of Emanuel Friedman began publishing studies that fundamentally changed how childbirth was managed in the United States.

Naturally, Singh was asked about what he thought of the U.S. president. The NDP leader sighed.
I am fortunate enough to be able to work from home, and have been since around mid-March 2020. The workdays are long for us both. We do a lot of texting back and forth throughout the day for moral support and to gauge when he might be able to return home. It helps us determine our dinner plans. Planning meals is challenging these days, and we admittedly do a lot of takeout during the week simply because it provides the needed flexibility when he inevitably gets delayed. Otherwise, I'm often eating dinner alone or it's a lot of reheated meals and leftovers.
My sense is that some parts of the progressive movement felt kind of unprepared by Sanders' successes in 2016 and now feel like they don't want to miss out on being part of it this time around, said Waleed Shahid, a spokesman for the left-wing group Justice Democrats, which has not endorsed in the presidential primary. There's no question that Sanders has been a huge ally of social movements and community organizations and helped them gain a platform on the national level.
We really don't and cannot know all the reasons or circumstances for a rejection. All we can do is to know ourselves. So open yourself up, think about what you want, trust the process and never ever give up!
There is very little money being spent to reduce the numbers of officer suicides, said Karen Solomon, president and co-founder of Blue H.E.L.P. We hope that by raising awareness about the scope of this problem — and shining a light on the need for increased mental health resources directed to officers approaching crisis — we can ultimately reduce the number of officers who die by suicide.
All three have accused Nassar of sexually abusing them under the guise of medical treatment, along with over 150 other women who share the same allegations. On Wednesday afternoon ― after a weeklong sentencing hearing where 169 survivors and family members read impact statements ― Nassar was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison on seven counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree.
We all have this idea that it's our small expenses that are doing us in -- that our financial woes are because of these. The famous example is the Starbucks latte. You buy too many lattes, you'll be in trouble. It can be any little luxury you want. The dinner out that you shouldn't have had, or the night you met a friend at a bar when you could have been at home.
San Diego's Sunshine Care invites young students to join in twice a month to participate in the Intergenerational Garden Club. Together older and younger germinate seeds, tend to plants and eat the fruits of their labor.
He's been my friend and I really feel for the woman, she added later in the conversation. I identify with all the women in these situations. Even if it's my friend, I don't go, 'Oh, but he's a good guy.' I think, 'What would it feel like to have been her?'
Cuomo called on the administration to use the Federal Defense Production Act, which allows the president to prioritize and incentivize production of essential materials during a national crisis, to help meet the national demand for ventilators.

In the United States, the costs in lives and damage is fast rising, said Adam Smith, a climate scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
And in New Mexico, GOP Gov. Susana Martinez this week said it's time for her state to tackle the big one — comprehensive tax reform.
Swedish activist Thunberg, 17, has galvanized young people around the world to call on global leaders to act on climate change. She made several stops in Canada last year, including a climate rally at the Alberta legislature. Supporters of the oil and gas industry from United We Roll countered the event with a convoy meant to show their pride for the sector.
This 133m tumbling cascade, is Japan's highest waterfall. The Nachi Taisha shrine, supposed to be built 1400 years ago, was built in honour of the spirit of the waterfall kami and serves as an important religious site.

House members will be fined $5,000 for the first offense and $10,000 for the second, and the penalties will be deducted directly from their salaries.
Saying I always hated his work might be a cheap hipster pose, but it also might be bitterness born of long-suppressed, impotent anger. If you've grown used to being shamed or condescended to for caring about an ugly thread that everyone else seemed to be overlooking, the sudden shift is gratifying, but also exhausting. All the years of churn and self-doubt suddenly feel like a cruel, unnecessary burden forced on you by the people who insisted you were wrong.
Last year at an event at which Beeley, Hayward and Robinson were speaking, a Syrian protesting the talk was dragged outside for voicing her opinion and told by an unidentified man from the audience that her people control the media. Asked who her people were, he replied: Of course, the Pentagon. Israel.
Andy Cohen, producer and host of Bravo TV's Watch What Happens Live, announced on Instagram that he tested positive for COVID-19.
When Trump took questions on his way out of the White House on Monday, a reporter asked the president about Ocasio-Cortez calling him a racist. To that, Trump said, who cares.
The plain fact of the matter is that for a lot of Americans, life simply sucks and isn't getting better.
U.S. Capitol Police on Sunday announced the death of one of its officers, bringing the number of deaths in the unit since Wednesday's violent Capitol siege to two.
Spoiler alert. Diddy's not going to save you.
Newsom said the Federal Emergency Management Agency was going to be critical in getting hospitals more of these needed supplies. He said the state has placed requests with FEMA for equipment including ventilators, gowns and masks for health workers, adding: We certainly are going to need more support.
When I was eight, I found my best friend. Alice,* like me, was a voracious reader, with a wild imagination and a penchant for the written word. We spent days adventuring in the woods adjacent to my backyard, fashioning a woodland home from fallen branches and sweeping the forest floor with pine needles. We invented our own language and took pleasure in communicating on a different plane from our classmates. We were at home among books, taking pride in our shared position at the top of the third grade class.
As you take on this thanksgiving challenge, you'll receive an amazing gift. You will be less critical of yourself. You will begin to be kind to yourself and over time will relish in your own accomplishments and the beauty of the relational gifts you offer the loved ones of your life.
Being an R. Kelly hater in early 2000s Chicago was a mighty lonely experience, but the release of a video that featured him engaged in sexual acts with two teenage girls was all the proof I needed to let him go ― though his marriage to Aaliyah in 1995 and the stories I heard about him approaching my friends when we were only in middle school should have done the trick.
Happiness is not just an individual pursuit, but a collective one in this day and age. It's about developing an exponential mindset of solving problems and being of service to each other. True happiness via success can be measured by the number of lives we impact in our lifetime, and given the technological innovation nowadays, even beyond our lifetimes.
Los Angeles residents awoke on New Year's Day to find the 94-year-old sign on the side of Mount Lee had been altered overnight to read Hollyweed.
Brown told HuffPost that despite the fact that many social media users were uplifting Black people — and Black women specifically — for saving America, their votes weren't cast with the intention of saving this country.
From its inception, the swimsuit issue has courted and basked in its own controversy ― both real and imagined. After the original swimsuit issue ran in February 1964, the magazine published a letter from W. Frank Caston, of Columbia, South Carolina. I most certainly do not want such pictures coming into my home for my young teen-age son to ogle, wrote Caston, much less myself.

Sparks: There was food insecurity before COVID, but it brought us to attention because it's disproportionately affected the POC communities. We're in for the duration now. There's no way we can go back. We've been in talks with the Episcopal church and other organizations of what this looks like nationally in the long term and what can we do for other communities with the same program.

Officials in that country have reported the illness has killed at least 81 people and infected more than 2,700 others. Several countries throughout Asia, Europe and North America have also confirmed cases of the illness. It remains to be seen whether the virus is as dangerous as the common flu, which kills thousands every year in Canada alone.

This lawsuit acknowledges what Lt. Wildhaber survived in the police department and lets us move forward as a county, County Executive Sam Page said on Monday. I think it's important to recognize that this sends a message to everyone in county government and to all of our employers in the St. Louis region, that discrimination will not be tolerated.

Moreover, blithely referencing the content of her first album ignores the fact that Kelly helped write those songs, and reducing Kelly to an older man in this scenario effectively normalizes his behavior and absolves him of accountability.
Astoria Borealis was a spotlight on the issues of what we're dealing with in our community, he said.
Besides now getting to use the excellent pun of referring to these MPs as the Buffalo wing of the Conservative Party — and developing a hankering for blue cheese dressing along the way — this document reignited debate about Western alienation, conversations that followed last fall's election after the ruling Liberals didn't win a single seat in Alberta or Saskatchewan.
The polar bear's diet is high in fat, supplied largely by hunting seals, but with less Arctic ice, scientists worry that the bears will have to walk or swim greater and greater distances for food with each passing year.

In 1948, H. Edward Spires, received an undesirable discharge from the Air Force for being gay.
You probably are not the stupid, crazy, incompetent person your ex says you are, so stop taking what he says personally. Remember: high-conflict people are always looking for someone to blame and you are a convenient target. He is likely spouting off as a way to defend against the shame of divorce, or to project his unowned sense of inadequacy on to you. What he thinks of you is about him, and you can't change it anyway, so get on with your life.
Finally, why do you want to change? It's important to take a good hard look at what it is that you want to change about yourself. Is it a realistic goal or is it just something you beat yourself up about? We don't always have to be striving for perfection or feel like we're a work in progress.
Edwards told KSLA-TV that authorities will not set up checkpoints to enforce the order, saying that we are deep in trouble if residents need enforcement in order to comply.

Social entrepreneurs looking for a multiple win-win solution have a case study here. Citizen activists win when they are empowered to identify problems. Citizen donors win when they can vote with their dollars to solve problems. Community members win through a transparent granting process that rebuilds their area. The state wins as they identify problems quickly and gain citizen support to solve them without the need to hire a large paid staff to identify, approve and process grants.

A study by Washington scientists has linked a recent case of coronavirus to the first one in the state in January, suggesting that community transmission of the disease has occurred undetected for six weeks. A county health officer complained about the difficulty of obtaining testing for residents. Six people have now died in the state, and as many as 1,500 could be infected.

A key factor, according to Democratic operatives, is anger over the GOP's vociferous attacks on Warnock, the senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, the onetime pulpit of Martin Luther King Jr. Loeffler and Republican outside groups have engaged in repeated over-the-top and false slams on Warnock, taking his sermons out of context, labeling him a Marxist and suggesting he covered up child abuse.
But as of late, music is exactly how Lovato has chosen to air her political frustrations.
Also of note here: both Smith and Tennessee's Ken Whisenhunt failed to make it beyond the 2015 season, despite their respective teams taking high-profile QBs early in last year's draft. The general consensus headed into the pre-season, especially in Whisenhunt's case, was that a rookie franchise quarterback might help buy the coach some time.
Holidays are supposed to be a time for family, a time of joy and a time for reflection. Sadly, they are often a time when people are disappointed. The Currier & Ives perfect Thanksgiving, Chanukah or Christmas is not a reality for most people. Family gatherings are often difficult. You do not pick your relatives and many people can't stand their in-laws. Holidays are also a time when people make mistakes. What about one drink too many at that holiday office party? An indiscretion with another man or woman can be problematic. A word that should not be said, a careless email or text message -- the list is endless. With social media, it is so much easier to cross that line than it was a few years ago.
We need to be a party that's open and that is inclusive, that's modern and youthful and ready to take on the challenges of the future. I think that moving to a one-member-one-vote system would really help.

The groups that signed onto the letter said Frederick's willingness to defend Shell against the communities they harmed raises questions about what cases he'd champion as solicitor general.
Now, when Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph took the stage on Sunday, I wondered if those women ― two more of Michaels' protégés ― could carry a contemporary awards show with minimal criticism. Their timing, chemistry and delivery soared in the few minutes they were on camera. That, in part, had to do with their lack of dependency on the prompter, as they used most of their limited screen time to gaze into each other's eyes after a staged proposal. (A proposal that maybe mocked director Glenn Weiss' Emmys engagement?) But wouldn't watching Poehler and Rudolph perform standup for 60 minutes be 10 times better than watching them read off overly rehearsed lines to a room full of people who are high on Moët and their own egos?

Menstrual hygiene products should not be considered a luxury, and Maryland must do more to prevent dehumanizing situations where women inmates don't have sanitary necessities, the bill's chief sponsor, state Sen. Susan Lee (D), said in a statement last week.
This was never going to be easy, Jennifer Kates, senior vice president at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, told HuffPost. But the federal government basically punted the hard stuff to states who, left reeling from the ongoing impact of COVID-19, weren't able to mount a robust effort in most cases. In addition, many states in turn punted the hard stuff to counties. At the end of the day, everyone is playing catch up and the stakes are very high.
Corporations' decision to spend much of their tax savings on massive payouts to shareholders undercuts the idea that the tax cuts spur economic investment, according to Steinbaum.

The project is significant not only because of the scientific results, but also because it is likely to capture the imagination of people on the street, said Matt Walhout, dean for research and scholarship at Calvin College, in a statement. If the prediction is correct, then for the first time in history, parents will be able to point to a dark spot in the sky and say, 'Watch, kids, there's a star hiding in there, but soon it's going to light up.'
If they were going to inconvenience me then I was going to inconvenience them, he told the Bristol Herald Courier.
By parroting such conservative political views under the guise of Christianity, the textbooks give those views more legitimacy, making it difficult to distinguish between fact and opinion. While all textbooks, including the secular, cherry-pick narratives and have their biases, these ones fuse a religious worldview with Trumpian talking points using anti-media and anti-immigrant rhetoric.
The connections Barrett's father has to Shell aren't the only potential conflict of interest he poses for her in this case. He spent more than 20 years as an active member of The American Petroleum Institute Subcommittee of Exploration and Production Law and twice served as its chairman, according to a biography on his former law firm's website. API, the nation's largest and most influential oil and gas lobby, filed an amicus brief supporting the oil companies in the Baltimore case.

The power plant bill will be the second major piece of energy legislation from Constantinides in a little over five weeks. In November, he introduced legislation to cut emissions from buildings of more than 25,000 square feet by 80 percent by 2050. That would set what could be a new standard for cities around the world and form the backbone of what proponents have dubbed the Green New Deal for New York City.
The takeaway, as supported from experts across the ideological spectrum, from Brookings to CEI, from labor to UPS, is that deregulation worked - profoundly - and that forced access should be avoided.
After Montgomery's father left, her mother remarried Jack Kleiner, a violent man who terrorized the children in the home. When Montgomery was 11, he began molesting her, according to family statements. He built a special room onto a trailer on an isolated tract of land in Oklahoma where he would rape Montgomery. Later, her parents trafficked her out to other men, telling the teen that she had to pay for her room and board. The men raped, sodomized and even urinated on her, she told a cousin at the time.

It can be the sex that negotiates changing desires (mind you, which can happen for both partners) or maybe the desire to try something new and experiment. From quick-before-the-little-one wakes sex to the we-haven't-had-sex-in-a-while sex and even I've-really-missed-connecting-with-you sex, it's all a part of the evolving narrative of real life mama sex, a space that so desperately needs to be normalized --- for our collective benefit.
Adding Sitecues is a highly visible statement of an organization's commitment to accessibility.

Among them are 21 parents ― 20 fathers and just one mother, cross-country skier Kikkan Randall.
My district has not had an outspoken progressive represent it in the United States Congress. And so I'm looking forward to showing my district that I'm going to work with everyone if it means improving the lives of my constituents.
We need another dictionary to help us describe how these extremes continue to play out and unfold year after year, said Smith, who tracks climate-related disasters that cause more than a billion dollars worth of damage.
Let's start with women. As would be expected, studies including one in 2010 have found that women lie more about their weight. When I met a man for coffee or a drink, I would usually ask how online dating was going for them. And I was surprised how many complaints I heard about women lying about--how shall I put this gracefully?--their body status description. In fact, I heard the same tale so often about a woman with a great headshot and a claim of an average or athletic body build type who turned out to be quite overweight that I wondered if it were the same woman they were all meeting.
Sadaf said that someone who was beaten in jail before told her, 'show them your back or they will break your hands,' Varma said.
The ad has received praise from some audiences, but its progressive message has some outraged some customers, who vow to ditch their razors on Twitter with the hashtag #BoycottGillette.
The number of people who have died in the United States from coronavirus increased by 53 on Thursday, bringing the total number of fatalities in the country to 150.
Local media had urged Kunis, a vocal advocate against gender discrimination, to reject the award given the criticism against Hasty Pudding. She said on Thursday that while she applauded the change, it was important to recognize the influence women have had on the group so far.
He pointed to blockades in opposition to RCMP presence on the Wet'suwet'en Nation territory, where hereditary chiefs oppose a natural-gas pipeline project. Those barricades have paralyzed rail traffic across swaths of Canada for upwards of two weeks.
While exercise and eating nutritious foods is always a good idea, wishing our bodies looked dramatically different is often a way to procrastinate living our best lives, she said. If we decide to live fully now, no matter how much we weigh, how amazing would things be?
Theme parks at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida and Disneyland Paris Resort will close after Sunday through the end of the month, according to Disney Parks. Disney Cruise Line will suspend all new departures beginning Saturday through the end of this month.
Rhodes publicly broke the news in a tweet, calling the eight years since he joined CBS News incredible.
Almost every single one of the men you cast would, outside of this movie, be described as a beloved heartthrob. You really weaponize Bo Burnham's charm, and you've got Seth Cohen and McLovin' and Max Greenfield, who we fell in love with as Schmidt on New Girl, playing predators who think they're decent guys. Did you set out to make the casting of the men a bit meta?
CONWAY: Facts first! Be an apple, don't be a banana!
As Asian-Americans, we have benefited from the work of black and brown activists who literally died so that we could reap the rewards of the Civil Rights movement. And unfortunately, while we have benefited from their work, those communities are consistently left behind. Some would say this is incredibly unfair and as Asian-Americans, we owe it to them to not leave them behind. But hey! We're basically enabling white supremacy when we allow white power structures to view non-whiteness as pleasurable or interesting. We also allow them to control the consumption and appropriation of us! It's like we can bring all non-white people down by accepting this BS as a compliment! Efficiency!
The 1st of January 2017 marked the 18th anniversary of the European common currency, the euro. Despite its success from 1999 to 2007, after 2008 the euro has become a burden for many of its members. For example, living standards in Italy and Greece are below the levels when they joined the euro. Finland is the only Nordic country using the euro and it is also the only Nordic country which has not yet recovered from the financial crash of 2008.
The federal law, which was enacted in 1950 in response to the Korean War, authorizes the federal government to make loans, loan guarantees, purchases, and purchase commitments, to improve, expand, and maintain domestic production capabilities needed to support national defense and homeland security procurement requirements.
Being pushed away from your own people hurts more because you need them more. We're not kidding.
All of the ten faults we analysed ruptured in repeated earthquake cascades at about the same times: 11,000 years ago, then 4,500 years ago, and more recently, around the fifth century.
The benefits of getting all of your ducks in a row before you cook them are clearly many. But how to do it? Insight and tips from chefs can help even the most uncertain cooks feel like the kitchen is your natural domain:
Most Republicans aren't willing to condone the rioting, but equally few are willing to whole-heartedly condemn its participants. In answering a separate question, 22% of Republicans say the actions of those storming the Capitol were mostly right, 23% say they were mostly wrong, and a 46% plurality say they went too far, but they have a point.
There is currently no cure, and that includes herbs and other things you may have heard about on the internet, Harry said. Treatment is supportive until you recover.
Part of the problem is there is no easy mechanism for nations to enforce their rights, she said. The issue is that Nations are not able to litigate the full scope of Indigenous rights violations as part of a judicial review of a project. They are told that to do a full-on civil action for infringement, and those cost millions of dollars.
Lifetime, an American TV network known for programs like Dance Moms and Project Runway, saw its highest ratings in two years when it aired Surviving R. Kelly, an astonishing six-part docuseries featuring interviews with women who alleged they experienced abuse at the hands of the hip hop star.
Right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh endorsed the mob of Donald Trump-supporting rioters that stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, comparing them to American revolutionaries who believed that violence was necessary to create change.
I was sacrificing making my own memories to create content for a platform ― and, in many cases, followers ― that didn't care about me. But I was petrified that if I didn't play the Instagram game and I didn't up my level of visual content, I would be left behind. I'd be a nobody.
I will take personal responsibility for transporting the ventilators, he said. I'll send ventilators, I'll send health care workers, our professionals ... Let's learn from each other and help each other.
There are many Wet'suwet'en Nation members working on this project today who are directly benefiting from the project through training and employment, and who want to see those benefits continue, said Wilton.
Republicans See Trump As Losing Some GOP Support
I can't stress enough that while pandemic stress, seasonal blues and plain old adolescence might be the issue, children may be limited in identifying and attributing to the cause. I'd hate for a parent to miss some other underlying cause, Varma noted.
There, they had some significant outside help. A coalition of liberal groups and unions teamed up to spend tens of millions of dollars and make more than 10 million door knocks, and succeeded in contacting 93% of the 3.1 million voters targeted. The effort was led by BlackPAC (4.9 million door knocks), the labor union UNITE HERE (1.6 million) and the Stacy Abrams-founded New Georgia Project (1.3 million). Another member of the coalition, the Latinx advocacy group Mijente, knocked on the door of every registered Latino voter in Georgia.
Mais le chef de l'État ferait mieux de s'habituer à ce genre de salves. Car les personnalités élues avec l'étiquette macroniste -et s'étant mis en retrait du parti présidentiel en critiquant son fonctionnement- entonnent désormais le même refrain. Nous savons ce que nous devons au président. Mais sait-il ce qu'il doit à ceux qui l'ont suivi et porté? Seuls comptent les citoyens au final, a réagi dans un tweet la députée du Nord Jennifer de Temmerman, qui avait quitté le groupe LREM courant novembre.
They smashed windows, erected makeshift gallows, smoked joints and cigarettes (We can smoke in our house, one of the rioters told The New York Times). They tagged the walls with catchphrases like Murder The Media, smeared feces on the walls, smashed photojournalists' cameras, trampled their own. They took selfies with Capitol police officers, took selfies with each other, took selfies with the gallows, posed for photos in House Majority Leader's Nancy Pelosi's chair. They did so with relative ease and little consequence — a stark contrast to the way Black bodies were treated by law enforcement over the summer during the national surge of Black Lives Matter protests. They engaged in domestic terrorism at the urging of the president of the United States, enabled by cynical political henchmen like Sen. Ted Cruz and Sen. Josh Hawley.
This is a group of people who perceive their relative status is endangered, Darity said. He and others have pointed out that this is hardly new: White Americans rioted during Reconstruction, outraged over the idea that Black people were not slaves anymore and actually had some rights. That violence ushered in nearly a century of repression.
With the Australian government urging us to reconsider all overseas travel at this time, there are circumstances where people still have to get from A to B.
Kevin Hart fielded questions on Wednesday night about the way he's handled the controversy surrounding his resignation as host for the Oscars.
This year I resolve to convince my clients that design elements on ceilings, whether they be coffering, panelling or even a fresh coat of a colorful paint, are equally as important as the design elements on walls and floors. Ceilings are often left white and ignored, but overlooking them can become a true missed design opportunity.
(Vaccination in the occupied territories is a whole other story. Israel hasn't offered to provide shots there, according to media reports, and the Palestinian authorities who govern there haven't asked.)
The data and the 'on-the-ground' results indicate that this is still Donald Trump's Republican Party, he said. You cannot underestimate the strength he has within the Republican base.
Malley said two key considerations would have been at the top of any president's checklist before ordering such a drastic decision — taking measures to protect U.S. forces from retaliatory attacks and the management of allies.
On top of the classic new year's resolution to get healthier in January, nutrition has become increasingly top-of-mind as we fight against a pandemic ― wellness could very well be our best protection. Increase your general state of health and you increase your immunity, lower your susceptibility to disease and give your body the best chance possible to fight COVID-19.
The Paris accord aims to cap the rise in temperatures to well below 2 degrees Celsius and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius to avoid the most devastating impacts of climate change.
61% des sondés n'envisagent pas de reporter leurs vacances et 14% sont indécis. Ce qui veut tout de même dire qu'environ 1 Français sur 4 réfléchit à annuler ou retarder un voyage.
They wrote, President Trump's lengthy brief to the Senate is heavy on rhetoric and procedural grievances, but entirely lacks a legitimate defense of his misconduct. The president would rather discuss anything other than what he actually did, the Democrats wrote.
The picture above shows how the Monte Vettore fault has created a steep high cliff over time. The fault plane goes deep below the surface, to about 10-15km deep. It is at such a depth where large earthquakes generally begin. When a large earthquake occurs, it makes rocks slide vertically on either side of the fault plane. One side, on the left of the picture, is brutally moved upward, and its shallowest part is pulled up from the Earth, forming here a 2m high fresh wall (where people stand).
In September 2016, I teamed up with Jo Cornell, another mom who lost a son to CTE, and filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Pop Warner football in hopes of sparing other families from similar tragedy. That lawsuit is ongoing.
But in private, Trump has been known to present his accomplishments in a different light. In December, just hours after signing the tax cut, Trump was back in Florida at his exclusive Mar-o-Lago club, where initiation fees are $200,000. While dining with some friends and supporters, CBS News later reported, Trump told them what they probably knew already: You all just got a lot richer.
IBS [irritable bowel syndrome] and all the loveliness that entails. I have to avoid certain foods just because I've become so sensitive to them. Not only because of the embarrassing symptoms it brings, but cramps, headaches and flare-ups that come with eating a 'bad food.' – Ashley A.
Also, seeing the adults get so involved and excited adds to it. The level these people go to just to make their homes and events look like a real fairy tale is so special and beautiful.
L'OMS salue les mesures très fortes de la Chine
In 1966, Loral researcher Ralph Baer patented a ball-and-paddle game designed to be played on a home television, which he licensed to Philips' Magnavox, which then introduced the Odyssey, the first-ever videogame console. The Odyssey came with six video game cartridges, including Baer's original Tennis game, which Nolan Bushnell turned into Pong three years later, which included on-screen scoring. But it was the Odyssey that started what is now a multi-billion dollar industry that rivals Hollywood's revenues, a professional eSports league, and occupies way too many of our leisure hours.
The pandemic has changed that, of course.
That's a good question. What does it mean? It is true that women who are out there would have never imagined leaving their homes and husbands and sitting out in the open for days. These are not working women for the most part. Leaving their identities as wives and mothers — that experience will change anybody. In that way, it has got to be transformative for the consciousness of these women. And maybe other women of the same background will perhaps find a voice that they have not had before. It's probably quite a coming into the consciousness for a group of women who are Muslim, in a way that they wouldn't have otherwise. Will this mobilise into a classical definition of political empowerment — what does it mean — more women in education, in the political sector. If you've read the Sachar Committee report, there has got to be more structural changes to make those things happen. When we think Muslim women, we only think religious issues. And that's just not true. Muslim women don't just think about Muslim issues.
The surge in coronavirus cases in Australia has had an impact on consumers and businesses when it comes to takeaway food and dining out.
The plain fact of the matter is that for a lot of Americans, life simply sucks and isn't getting better.
Events that mix the generations briefly might seem sweet but they can prove to be more harmful than not by reinforcing stereotypes and sometimes causing humiliation.
Barrett's own views on climate science remain opaque. During her contentious confirmation hearings last fall, she repeatedly said she was not a scientist and therefore did not have firm views on warming. She called the issue a very contentious matter of public debate and politically controversial.
Eventually, humans adjusted to farming and began surviving somewhat longer, but life expectancy remained in something of a slump for millennia.
About 16 months after my former husband left, I spent five weeks at my grandmother's bedside when she suffered a stroke. I watched my grandfather hold her hand after more than 60 years of marriage, and I lived through the raw pain of what came next when it was her time to pass on. I will never, in all my life, forget what I witnessed between the two of them.
Then, at the start of October, Sanders had a heart attack. For a moment, it seemed like he might be down for the count. The incident kept Sanders off the campaign trail for two weeks and raised fears among Democratic voters about his age and health.
While some people may wait to do their laundry until they're faced with big piles of it, Winner recommended regularly washing your clothes, especially if you are still required to report to work or have been in crowded areas.
I was completely rejected by my peers, my church family and my golf team, all within a few months. I stopped trying at practice, and quickly lost my JV spot. I stopped talking to people and trying to make it better. I gave up, and started to resent myself for being gay. At the end of my freshman year, I had lost any feeling I had for golf, and gave up hope on ever receiving a scholarship. I never stepped back onto the golf course and kept to myself for the next three years.
A scientific audit of Institute records and safety measures would be a routine activity, said Mark Woolhouse, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh. He said that depends on how willing Chinese authorities are to share information.
Hadn't that lie been what I had been telling myself my whole life? In Honor's classes in high school. In college. As a first year teacher. In mom's groups. As a writer. I felt like my whole life, up to that race had been me wrestling with the feelings that I don't belong.

The constant sniffles/cough/dry mouth my meds cause. Really awkward to be certain places and be coughing and sniffling. When my sister had her baby I was holding her and sniffling and some thought I was sick and holding a newborn! No! Sorry, just my meds making me sound like it! – Garnet D.
2. That I would have anxiety before every doctor's appointment. After my first two pregnancies ended in miscarriage, I got so used to hearing bad news at doctor's appointments, that just going to the appointments in my third pregnancy gave me overwhelming anxiety.
How do they treat the waitress, the car hop, or staff at the ice cream shop? Rudeness and arrogance signal low self-esteem and narcissism, Lancer said. Their rudeness to the waiter and hostess could hint at pent-up rage and demanding and possibly emotionally abusive behavior.
Le concept a d'abord été utilisé avec le VIH, rappelle Emma Hodcroft: Une personne attrapant le VIH à vie, il était plus simple d'avoir des échantillons que pour la grippe. Mais depuis, le séquençage génétique est devenu beaucoup plus simple, moins coûteux. Et le traitement de ces données s'est amélioré.

As midnight turned into the early hours, the whole city seemed to be sleeping except for the the forty of us closing in on the first 26.2 miles with still another 26.2 to to go--I never felt so alone in my life and the lies continued, the one I believe we tell ourselves that does the most damage to our hearts--it stops us from living life as we are meant to live it:
How many gazillions of people have seen 'Black Panther' and 'Crazy Rich Asians'? she continued, referring to the massive box office success of the two movies, both featuring ensemble casts consisting primarily of actors of color. That changes things. Just speaking for my own community, people cried a lot in ['Crazy Rich Asians'], and it's not only because it's a great story and a classic romantic comedy — it is because seeing yourself reflected onscreen is really emotional when you don't even know that you're carrying so much grief of never being seen.

I wanted to be here to look out into this audience and witness this moment of change, she began, as audience members continued to bleat out awkward laughs. I'm not fooling myself. Next year could be different. It probably will be. But right now, this moment is real, because I see you, and I see you. All of these faces of change. And now, so will everyone else.

Their first order of business, however, likely will be a bid to pass another COVID-19 relief package. Biden and Democrats have promised to push for $2,000 in direct payments to Americans who meet certain economic criteria — a proposal McConnell systematically blocked as the last Congress ended in favor of checks totaling only $600.
More than 700 people aboard the ship tested positive for the virus after a previous passenger, who had left the ship during a stop in Hong Kong, tested positive. Six people who were onboard the ship have since died from the virus.
With only a week left in Trump's term, there were no bellicose messages from the White House fighting the proceedings on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue and no organized legal response. Some congressional Republicans did defend the president during House debate in impeachment, their words carrying across the same space violated by rioters one week earlier during a siege of the citadel of democracy that left five dead.
While you may feel tempted to simply wait until the seasons change again, it's important to address mental health issues in kids, especially if your child's symptoms are impacting their academic performance, self-esteem, friendships or ability to function every day.
9. They Fail to Challenge People Intellectually
Jamil also places blame on popular culture, and blasts music videos, where the girls are always practically naked and performing rehearsed dance routines for the men, who are sitting there on their arses, sometimes in outdoor winter layers, doing nothing other than enjoying their needs being met.
Adults in California ― the state's citizens and visitors alike ― now no longer have to worry about their car being confiscated for buying some pot. They no longer have to worry about their license plate being photographed outside a store selling hydroponic equipment. They no longer have to worry about their house being seized for growing a plant or two in the back yard. They no longer cringe when helicopters fly over. They no longer fear arrest, fines, or even imprisonment for possessing this plant.
So many journeys for me and my family have started right here, Castro told a crowd at Guadalupe Plaza on San Antonio's west side, blocks from the home where he grew up and the church where he was baptized. Today we begin another one.
The value of your business (or business interest) depends on what exactly needs to be valued, why it needs to be valued, when it needs to be valued and for whom it needs to be valued. A few things to consider:
'Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house,
Day 1: It started with a mild DRY cough and a slightly sore throat. I was very tired that night. — Bjonda Haliti (@baeonda) March 18, 2020
My coping techniques are working for now and I feel relatively stable emotionally, but if things get worse and I feel like I'm headed down the rabbit hole, I intend to arrange for some teletherapy visits. And when this coronavirus crisis is over, I may even physically go to a therapist's office, particularly if I'm not able to conquer my fear of human contact.
This is a simple, yet underrated tip that I picked up from Eric Cressey.
For months leading up to this, I was excited with anticipation. January would be the month the book would debut at Costco. This marketing coup, I had envisioned, would be the answer to this indie author's dreams. So when I found out about this change in direction, I was very surprised by my reaction. I didn't feel awful. Okay, I did feel awful, but I wasn't devastated.
Finding the perfect match will require patience, hard work and effort. Often, it's a job just to find the perfect job, but when you do, the job will grow, change and mold as much to you as you do to it.

The term surged into mainstream political discourse just two months ago when activists staged a protest in now–House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office, demanding that the incoming Democratic majority in the House champion a sweeping climate policy to zero out greenhouse gas emissions and combat worsening income inequality. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) proposed a resolution to establish a select committee on a Green New Deal and garnered support from about 40 House Democrats.

He represents the establishment and a tradition of central control, Milloy said.
On the bright side is the noteworthy G20 Guiding Principle for Global Investment Policymaking reached under Chinese presidency and endorsed by G20 heads of state. It lays out a roadmap for future investment policy and the correlation between investment and sustainable development.
As proof Medicare for All can work, they cite the performance of national health systems in countries such as Canada, Sweden and Taiwan. As proof Medicare for All is popular, they cite surveys showing support among U.S. adults reaching 59 percent. But those poll numbers can be misleading. The same surveys show that when people hear about potential costs and trade-offs that come with Medicare for All, support falls.
I put so much time and effort into my Instagramming. In return, it was robbing me of my time, my confidence and my joy.
It's not clear what kind of consequences these endorsements will have in the early states — especially in Iowa, where Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg have invested so much of their resources. People's Action has an Iowa affiliate, the Iowa Center for Community Improvement, but most of the other groups do not.
Speed skiing was a demonstration sport at the 1992 Olympics, where Swiss speed skiier Nicolas Bochatay died during a practice run on the morning of the finals.
I believe in an outsider. Career politicians are nothing but trouble, said Norris Vivier, a 58-year-old owner of a real estate business in Manchester, New Hampshire, who has already had to lay off workers because of the pandemic.
Nightengale then drove about 10 miles (16 kilometers) north to Evanston, which borders Chicago, where police responded to a report of shots that had been fired inside a CVS. Nightengale had apparently walked into the pharmacy, announced that he was robbing it and fired off shots that didn't hit anyone, authorities said. He then went across the street to an IHOP restaurant, where he shot a woman in the neck. She was in critical condition, Evanston police Chief Demitrous Cook told reporters.

China barred people from leaving or entering Wuhan starting Jan. 23 in a surprise middle-of-the-night announcement and expanded it to most of the province in succeeding days. Train service and flights were canceled and checkpoints set up on roads into the central province.
Arguably the most iconic image of the premeditated criminal is the burglar: An anonymous figure, dressed in all black, operating in the dead of night, wearing a mask and carrying an unmarked bag.
Keep in mind that you should work with a lender that doesn't charge loan origination fees, which might cancel out interest savings. It's also a good idea to weigh the risks of refinancing federal student loans, because doing so would change them to private loans and permanently forfeit federal protections such as income-driven repayment and forgiveness options.
If you do postures without the breathing you will never change anything, Porchon-Lynch told The Huffington Post. When people are known to breathe properly they can survive and do anything. Nothing is impossible when you are in tune with your breath.
Polyester spandex-like material may retain germs longer than cotton-based fabrics, but all types of fabrics can be contaminated, Nesheiwat said.
My internet slowed down to a crawl and no amount of resetting the box helped. Turned out it was something wrong with the box and it was replaced. However, it was still occasionally cutting out. When we moved from Los Feliz to Boyle Heights [in Los Angeles], connection with these services greatly improved. I think it's due to it being adjacent to downtown so that connections are underground and stronger. ― Ruby McNeil
We have not been formally or directly notified, all what we heard were media statements, Badran Ciya Kurd said.
Both congressmen were in Washington on Friday and said they began to develop symptoms of illness over the weekend and self-quarantined. They both urged people to take this seriously and follow health officials' recommendations.
Obviously, a lot depends on Mother Nature, on the magnitude of the rainfall, the magnitude of the mudslides and so forth, the sheriff told reporters on Tuesday.
Losses in Maine and North Carolina meant Democrats needed to sweep two runoff races in Georgia to reach the 50 seats required to control Congress' upper chamber, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris breaking ties. Their hopes rested on two candidates ― Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock ― defying historical trends in Georgia and mounting a comeback after GOP candidates earned more votes in both races in November.
The Department's insistence on secrecy ensures that the Union cannot monitor the parties' relationship or fully require compliance with the parties' collective bargaining agreement, Papathanasiou told Roll Call. He did not return a request for comment from HuffPost.

It's not a song I'd typically thought I'd make a video for, it's a ballad with super snarky, super dark lyrics, but the over the top positive response I got from people when I perform it live made me change my mind, McGovern said in a press release.
When it comes to legislative priorities neither eligible for either budget reconciliation, nor the Congressional Review Act, Democrats are constrained by the threat of a Republican filibuster.
Don't let your expectations on baby-related responsibilities go unspoken: If things aren't equitable and you're shouldering the bulk of the parenting, household and emotional labor at home, speak up, said Dori Gatter, a psychotherapist in West Hartford, Connecticut.
The former USA team doctor and former Michigan State University trainer is already serving 60 years in prison on child pornography charges and awaits sentencing on three more counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree.

The ER is considered a war zone right now, said Heather, a nurse based in Los Angeles County.
Some people gave more than a little blood, some gave their very lives. So to each and every one of you, especially you young people … go out there, Lewis said in March of last year. Speak up, speak out. Get in the way. Get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and help redeem the soul of America.
But this is no Middle East-focused intrigue-filled book like McNabb's gripping trilogy Olives, Beirut and Shemlan.
Airlines are heightening security and imposing new regulations ahead of Joe Biden's presidential inauguration next week as Washington, D.C., prepares for more riots similar to the Jan. 6 insurrection.
Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) announced Monday a statewide stay-at-home order, similar to protocols adopted in California and other states. Residents are advised to only leave home to work if their jobs are deemed essential. People can also leave their homes to attend medical appointments or run crucial errands like grocery shopping or visiting a pharmacy. They can also spend time outdoors, so long as they practice safe social distancing and stay six feet away from others while doing so.
Most of the vaccines being rolled out around the world train the body to recognize that spike protein and fight it. Pfizer teamed with researchers from the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston for laboratory tests to see if the mutation affected its vaccine's ability to do so.
Steel predicted Biden and McConnell, two former colleagues, can find common ground on infrastructure and immigration — policy areas that have stumped multiple administrations. Steel noted a handful of Republican senators, including Marco Rubio of Florida and Rob Portman of Ohio, could face tough reelection fights in 2022, potentially making them eager to cut deals they could tout in campaigns.

It was night-time on a weekend and I was dealing with a man with a potential head injury. We were told pre-arrival that he had collapsed or was fitting and was HIV positive. I was treating him in the back of the ambulance and dressing his head wound when I stopped to put on a new pair of gloves. He then took real exception to me wearing gloves. I explained we had been told he was HIV positive and that we treated everybody the same, it was normal procedure. But he grabbed me and started punching me in the head. Then he bit my forearm. He'd already been bleeding from his mouth so when he bit me it was blood-on-blood contact. The police arrived and we got an escort but when we got to hospital he refused to give a blood sample. Luckily, or unluckily for me, about 20 minutes in he admitted to a nurse 'just be careful, I'm HIV positive. This is why I support this bill, it would be compulsory to give a sample of either saliva or blood. I spent the next year thinking 'I'm going to get the HIV virus'. I had to go on a set of anti-viral medicines and I was very poorly. I was already emotionally injured and these drugs made me physically ill too. My doctor even suggested I take time off. But I'm a bit of a stubborn paramedic, as my wife says. I prefer to say I'm 'independent'.

The isolation for them and the lack of socialization is really challenging, especially senior year. My poor daughter missed everything. ... And that's the only reason you go back, senior year, is [for the] proms. It's the victory lap, you celebrate your education — and [she had] none of it. We did a mock sort of prom at the house ... it was a Saturday night. It was so sad, as a parent, you're like 'Oh my God, my heart breaks for you; you don't have that moment' ... to see her all dressed up, and then she got on Zoom with all her friends and they got together.

Look, you can't tell Black people that age nothing. Like my mother [who is in her late 60s] knows exactly what to do, but what's making me freak out is all of the people coming in and out of her house. I love my nieces and my brother, but I told my mother, they can't be around you if they keep going out. I was the parent instead of her being the one to mother me. Those roles were reversed, but she gets it and she's good. But I am thinking of these other old Black people who love talking about the rapture and love pandemics and want to be outside to see it. Please go wait for it in the house like the rest of us. Stay home. You can still go to heaven if you're inside.

Given that the BJP has only been in power once in Delhi, from 1993 to 1998 (Sushma Swaraj was chief minister in 1998 but only for 52 days), its parliamentary victories were attributed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity, or, as it was called, the Modi wave and the Modi wave 2.0.

But the Social Registry is premised on the notion that citizen information — particularly Aadhaar-related information — shared with any government department can be seamlessly incorporated into a unified database accessible to a third government agency.

Maybe we have seen the writing on the wall that Trump is going to come back. So, this is the time that you appease so that Trump 2.0 will be a little less aggressive on the trade front. I think that's a calculation that a lot of other countries also made when they gave the Trump Administration a renegotiated deal, especially China. Why would China offer a phase 1 deal at the end of January, a minimal but a symbolic victory?

As Washington ― and the rest of the United States ― comes back from its holiday break, pressure to end the shutdown may grow. Americans already blame Trump more for the shutdown than Democrats, by a margin of 47 percent to 33 percent. And if the shutdown stretches on so long that Americans start feeling the effects ― like delayed tax refunds because of a shuttered IRS, or missed flights because of TSA workers striking ― Trump and other Republicans may start getting desperate.
Their work is truly a team effort, and their people feel accomplished when group goals are met. Since these bosses don't believe they are above anyone or anything, they openly address their mistakes so that everyone can learn from them.

He also stressed that almost all heart disease is preventable and that smoking, poor diet and lack of exercise account for the vast majority of deaths in the U.S.
I find it important that we eat together as much as possible because it's our mostly uninterrupted space together for catching up to commiserate about the challenges of the day and, however small, identify something each day for which to celebrate and be grateful. Some days it's that a patient came off of the ventilator and is pulling through, and on the tougher days, we simply say cheers for our own continued health.
Now that you know your ex is not going to have an Aha Moment, and you will remain together till death do you part, you must examine your own actions and thought patterns that keep you engaged in a losing battle. You must change the way you relate to your ex, both in the real world, and in your head.
I'm so grateful for every bit of it -- my own pain in the earliest days of discovering something that felt like a knife's edge, the itchy pain of being alone and figuring out what it all meant after the dust settled, and even the hardest pain of watching this season happen in the lives of the couple who was always my fixed center point and likely always will be.
The mere scale of the pandemic stretched supplies even in better prepared countries. Yet the enduring shortages in the U.S. are not just from a lack of foresight, but also from hesitancy as the pandemic started to sicken and kill Americans.
Let your hands slowly but firmly grip something that is safe (to the object and yourself), or let your abdomen clench, Bouffard said.
The opportunity comes because the 36 states that use the federal code as a starting point for their own personal income taxes are in a position to realize a generous windfall since the federal law eliminates many tax breaks that states might not adjust.
That unexpected extra money has given states the flexibility to rewrite their tax codes without creating as many losers — and the accompanying political hardship — as most tax revamps entail.

For we know that if the earthly tent [physical body] we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God [spiritual body], a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. Here indeed we groan, and long to put on our heavenly dwelling, so that by putting it on we may not be found naked. For while we are still in this tent, we sigh with anxiety; not that we would be unclothed, but that we would be further clothed 2 Cor 5:1-4
According to multiculturalists, advancing the achievements of western civilization was an act of hatred toward other cultures. They encouraged people to define themselves by race, sex, or sexual orientation rather than by the pillars of western civilization, such as nation, family, and God, reads the Abeka American history textbook. However, many conservatives and Christians within America have attempted to quell these philosophies and once again turn America into a united, moral nation.

I was a 3-year-old preschooler when I corrected my teacher's knowledge of the constitutional requirements to be U.S. president.

My parents received a call from an unhappy principal that day. And telling my third-grade science teacher that her knowledge of gravity lacked depth earned me a spot on her naughty list for the rest of the year.

The committees taking up the proposal initially aren't actually the ones that would write a health care bill.

Yet buildings account for about 70 percent of the city's emissions, creating a steep political challenge for a mayor who, to the chagrin of the progressive activists who helped elect him, spent much of his first term wooing real estate developers. In September, de Blasio's rollout of a new set of mandates to cut emissions from big buildings faced blunt criticism from the New York City Council, which accused the mayor of acting unilaterally and failing to go far enough with the proposed rules.

Whether we recognize it or not, our bodies bring the closet with us into adulthood. T Travis Salway, a researcher with the BC Centre for Disease Control in Vancouver, has spent the last five years trying to figure out why gay men keep killing themselves. The defining feature of gay men used to be the loneliness of the closet, he says. But now you've got millions of gay men who have come out of the closet and they still feel the same isolation. We're having lunch at a hole-in-the-wall noodle bar. It's November, and he arrives wearing jeans, galoshes and a wedding ring. Gay-married, huh? I say. Monogamous even, he says. I think they're gonna give us the key to the city. Salway grew up in Celina, Ohio, a rusting factory town of maybe 10,000 people, the kind of place, he says, where marriage competed with college for the 21-year-olds. He got bullied for being gay before he even knew he was. I was effeminate and I was in choir, he says. That was enough. So he got careful. He had a girlfriend through most of high school, and tried to avoid boys—both romantically and platonically—until he could get out of there. By the late 2000s, he was a social worker and epidemiologist and, like me, was struck by the growing distance between his straight and gay friends. He started to wonder if the story he had always heard about gay men and mental health was incomplete.

Some of this turns out to be good news for Trump's critics. When Trump took over the White House, he inherited an enforcement system capable of expelling a quarter-million migrants from the interior annually. But if the shutdown debacle offers any insight into his thinking, it would appear Trump does not care. He'd rather have a wall.
Basically, we accumulate a lot of stuff, much of which we likely don't need, and it becomes hard to let go of it. In Apo's opinion, that's largely because we associate who we are and our success, based on the stuff we own.

Then it hit me, if we need critical success strategies for the first 90 days of a new role, why not a new year?
Peter has been to hell and come back, and not necessarily come back in one piece, Friend added. He's not really even sure if his life is one that's worth living.
The Change the Mascot campaign, a group that has long opposed the offensive logo, welcomed the Indians' decision as a recognition that Native Americans do not deserve to be denigrated as cartoon mascots.
You're not. Enough is enough. Go home and stay home, Trudeau said at a press conference in Ottawa Monday, noting images that have surfaced over the weekend of Canadians egregiously flouting demands to practice social distancing.
Because, Darius, the tank was on, so the Eagles could have a worse record and get a better draft pick for next season, according to many outlets. Pederson claimed he was coaching to win and wanted Sudfeld to get some reps.
In short, it is time for a big, multitrillion-dollar economic relief package ― for the sake of American families and public health. The results of the Georgia runoff make that kind of legislation much more plausible.
I used to have things like aspirations or desires for people to see my depth of character. Turns out that if I don't even try, dudes will just see me as an exotic, submissive lotus blossom who doesn't threaten or challenge their power. White supremacy needs allies if its antiquity is to survive the global majority (memo: White people are outnumbered by people of color on this planet). And what better way to fan the flames of structural racism and inequality than to literally allow yourself to be viewed as the perpetual foreigner who will never be considered fully American until you are white?
Stories that amplify how we feel about living within our looks.
Both sides saw relatively little hope of persuading voters after tens of millions of dollars had already been spent on television advertising in the general election. Ossoff's campaign tested more than a dozen negative messages about Perdue, and a dozen negative messages they thought the Republican would deploy against Ossoff. None had a significant impact on the electorate.
The distance between the two sides seems to be growing, as Trump reneged on a deal Vice President Mike Pence offered last week that would have delivered $2.5 billion for the wall, instead of the $5.6 billion Trump wants. Trump said Wednesday that he wouldn't accept just $2.5 billion.
It's been eight incredible years since I joined @CBS. I'm pleased to announce that I'll soon be handing the reins @CBSNews to Susan Zirinsky, our Senior Executive Producer — David Rhodes (@davidgrayrhodes) January 7, 2019
But I was heartbroken to not be in my classroom this year, especially after the fourth quarter of last year was completely virtual. I didn't get to tell anyone goodbye. I packed up my classroom alone in an empty building in early August, just before my teaching colleagues would return to open up their classrooms and get ready for a new school year. I didn't get closure.
The Italian government has restricted people's movement across the whole country to curb the spread of #COVID19, Foreign Minister Marise Payne Tweeted on Wednesday.
Seasonal affective disorder is a type of depression that occurs around certain times of year when there's less sunlight ― which is typically correlated with the change in seasons, depending on where you live, explained Neha Chaudhary, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, and an adviser at the behavioral health platform Brightline.

First of all, if a mutation occurs to the spike protein (as it has), and if you've been vaccinated and have protective antibodies, your body will still have a strong chance of beating the virus.
Later that month, with Trump's backing and bipartisan support, the House passed a bill to increase those direct payments to $2,000. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) repeatedly blocked that bill from passing despite support from both Democratic and Republican senators. He dubbed the effort socialism for rich people because it would have sent checks to some higher earners.
The warning comes as airlines and cruise ship companies across the globe are reducing or canceling their operations.
Wiehe noted that Iowa has wanted to lower tax rates for a long time. They haven't been able to figure it out, she said. Now, it's pretty convenient to have a couple hundred million dollars so they can do what they want.
Capitalism's cycles between good and bad times, as well as the inequality it produces through vast gaps in income and wealth, cause conflict and division. And these tensions threaten the whole system, as the recent yellow jackets mass movement in France demonstrates. There, a fuel tax rise sparked weeks of protest across the country as those who live beyond France's wealthy urban centers rejected ― occasionally violently ― yet another rise in their cost of living and demanded growing concessions from French capitalism.

Democratic members on a security briefing call Monday expressed concern about allowing lawmakers to enter the House floor, or attend next week's inauguration, without going through a magnetometer. The House swiftly took action Tuesday, posting metal detectors in front of a number of entrances to the floor.
I lost more than my hair. I lost myself. My husband lost his wife. I was a shell of the person I was supposed to be. No one could help me. I was getting shots in my scalp every month for two years. It just got worse. I decided to pursue alternative treatments like yoga, acupuncture and the AIP diet (autoimmune paleo protocol). The diet change was so hard, especially with all the travel I do, and my love for all things cheesy, starchy and bourbon-y.
Again, that's just one preliminary model. But it shows that the stakes to the question of whether COVID-19 vaccine recipients are still infectious are pretty darn high.

Manchin's position on larger stimulus checks could change when his party controls the Senate. And there are also some Republicans who have expressed support for the measure. Notably, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) partnered with Sanders to lobby for the proposal, despite disapproval from his own party leadership. There will additionally be pressure on some Republicans up for reelection in 2022 to support the checks ― especially now that Trump has so vocally backed the idea.

The Trump initiative would allow states to choose between receiving a block grant ― a flat dollar amount per year ― that increases slightly faster than medical price inflation or a per-capita cap based on the number of current Medicaid enrollees that rises at the same rate as medical inflation. The per-capita cap option is less problematic than the block grants and offers states more financial leeway, but both would result in benefit and enrollment cuts, Holahan said.
The sun shines in everyone's backyard. In times of war, men lead. So who will pick up the leadership when the battlefront shifts to the home front? Behavioral scientists around the globe are showing how small changes can make a big difference.
(A methodology sidenote: The new Post/ABC and CNN/SSRS polls are also notable for being the first of this shutdown to be conducted using traditional live-interviewer phone calls, rather than cheaper methods such as online surveys. That fact highlights how much the face of political polling has changed since the 1995 shutdown, when pollsters like Gallup were conducting multiple surveys a week on the political ramifications of the government's closure. Gallup, under new leadership, recently announced it would discontinue almost all 'spot' polls in the U.S. — overnight polls, usually political, of immediate front-page interest.)

The SECC sought a more granular picture of entitlements to capture the increasing financial complexity of the lives of Indian citizens, and the increasingly focused nature of government support schemes. State and central governments were now rolling out schemes that looked at indicators other than annual family income — like school scholarships earmarked for girl students, loans to start small businesses, etc.

I worked full-time from just after college graduation until July 24, 2020, with the exception of the two years my family lived overseas for my husband's work. Even then, when I could have done just about anything I wanted with my time, I was bored and frustrated at not having a real job. I ended up becoming a fixture at my daughters' school, volunteering as a teaching assistant, library aide and substitute teacher. Those two years opened a window for me, and subsequently led to a career change from the legal field to education.
The presentation was accompanied by videos or soundtracks of the songs being performed. Not only did the music come alive, it came alive in a new and powerful way when accompanied by the back story and the subsequent influence it would have on the country.
Good, hard-working employees want to work with like-minded professionals. When managers don't do the hard work of hiring good people, it's a major demotivator for those stuck working alongside them. Promoting the wrong people is even worse. When you work your tail off only to get passed over for a promotion that's given to someone who glad-handed their way to the top­­­­­­­, it's a massive insult. No wonder it makes good people leave.
Atishi lost to former cricketer Gautam Gambhir, fielded by the BJP in East Delhi Lok Sabha constituency. In fact, all seven BJP candidates secured more than 50% vote share in the 2019 parliamentary election, an even higher margin than the Hindu nationalist party's seven-seat sweep in 2014. This time around, Atishi contested and won from the Kalkaji constituency.

My husband and I agree that as long as this little girl gives us reason to hold hope, we will continue the pregnancy. Perhaps this was putting too much on our unborn daughter, but we want to temper our hope and take our cues from her. We name her Clementine, knowing Tiny would be a suitable nickname.
I recently flew from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C., to attend the Aspen Institute's Sports & Society panel discussion on the future of football. Just this month, researchers announced that the results of a new study raise concern that repetitive neurotrauma, independent of concussion, may induce early CTE brain pathologies, even in teenagers and young adults (emphasis mine).

This halo circles around gluten-free foods, too. Many people assume they are sensitive or allergic to gluten and will thus opt for gluten-free items. However, as Ramirez said, Gluten-free foods can be void of certain vitamins and minerals, and some gluten-free foods can have even higher sugar, fat, or sodium contents than the with-gluten items!
Republicans made extensive use of the CRA in the early days of the Trump administration, after learning of a convenient loophole that let them review regulations and guidance that had been on the books for decades — as long as they hadn't technically been submitted to Congress yet. They nixed 16 regulations, including one that had been finalized in 2013.

All but three of the justices are over the age of 65, a key factor that health experts have said makes individuals at higher risk of getting very sick if they contract COVID-19.
President Donald Trump's insistence on downplaying the coronavirus risks reached dangerous levels on Monday as he scoffed at medical advice and proposed opening up the economy despite skyrocketing case numbers.
But there's no unusual crisis at the border other than a high number of Central American families and children, who hardly present a security threat. And to judge from Trump's record so far, he's more committed to the idea of a wall, regardless of the cost, than to actual immigration enforcement.
That triggered a trademark zinger from the congresswoman, who called Rollins a walking argument for a 100 percent tax on misogyny.
He believes that all the technological innovation in the world will be for nothing unless are proud of who we are when we arrive at that destination called the singularity where technology and humanity becomes one.
The distinction, Myles said, is not always clear. Illicit operations often set up shop in urban business districts, where some will go so far as to secure permits and licenses to conceal what they're doing.
One of my favorite stories is the day my sister, who is also a professional Disney princess, and I had two Elsa/Anna parties. (I was the corseted Elsa.) Between events she and I changed and went out to eat. I ordered a chili cheeseburger because I clearly was delirious with hunger and not thinking. When I tried to get back into my corset in the car, I couldn't fit. Had my sister not been there to push, pull and squeeze me back into it, I don't know what I would have done.
Democrats will control 50 votes in the 100-member Senate (two independents caucus with the party). When Democrat Kamala Harris takes office on Jan. 20 as vice president, she will be the tie-breaking vote as the Senate's presiding officer.
Drinking wine has its benefits. It's well-documented that an occasional glass provides antioxidants, can help protect against heart disease and inflammation, may play a role in building bone density, and can positively impact your cholesterol. However, a new multilevel marketing (read: pyramid) scheme that's generating a buzz even beyond your typical glass is clean wine.

It is seems more than plausible to me but rather very likely that if made salient to voters, opposition to a Green New Deal would be deeply dangerous for the primary chances of any incumbent Democrat, Hauser said by email. However the work of making it salient is no small task.
With that in mind, prominent progressives are calling on Biden to immediately deliver on his promise of $2,000 relief checks, as well as to pass a robust COVID-19 recovery package, enact sweeping democracy reforms, cancel student debt, and roll back the Trump tax cuts.

An anonymous website called Cons4DelDuca was created in December to highlight the fact that some of Del Duca's donors also gave to Ford's campaign for PC leader.

The new year is reflective time for singles. Perhaps you are or were flying solo on New Year's, or were in a relationship that ran it's course. Some couples actually broke up between Christmas and New Year's Eve. It can be a painful time, but with a new year, comes new hope.
Similarly, the fall in the cost of cross-border transportation and international cost of telecommunications, which had contributed so much to trade, would also have met its limit. And they probably contribute modestly to the decline of global trade.

Two days later, my sister takes Mom to the ER because she is in terrible pain and unable to walk. She is admitted for observation. My sister is the only person allowed to visit ― a restriction imposed due to COVID-19. The next day, my sister calls. You aren't going to believe this, she says. The caseworker called and said Mom has 72 hours in the hospital. Then Medicare is kicking her out. Not only that, Mom needs family to provide 24-hour care or she goes to a nursing home.
Former organizers and current chapters separated themselves from the national leaders (although the organization is fairly decentralized, and local groups operate with some independence.) Women's rights celebrities spoke out and #MeToo activist Alyssa Milano announced she would not speak at this year's march, shortly after Teresa Shook, who is credited with inspiring the first march with a Facebook post, called for the current co-chairs to step down.

Each individual's investment strategy should be representative of their savings capacity, their current goals, risk tolerance and his or her overall budget, Jack Teboda, president of the Illinois financial planning firm Teboda & Associates, wrote to HuffPost. There is not a 'silver bullet' recommendation that works perfectly for every single person. This is why it is imperative that each person, or family, is working with a fiduciary advisor ― someone who has analyzed the different aspects of one's investment philosophy and then provides a recommendation that makes the most sense for that particular person.
It's been a long road to reach this point, but at last, the sexist tax that saw sanitary products classed as nonessential, luxury items can be consigned to the history books, said Felicia Willow, chief of the Fawcett Society, a women's rights charity.

She sees several possible reasons for the gender discrepancy in terms of attitudes about the virus. Part of it has to do with frontline medical workers: Four out of every five health-care workers in Canada are women. Nursing, in particular, is an overwhelmingly female work force, with more than 90 per cent of Canada's nurses identifying as women.
Another Israeli advantage is that the nation's population is schooled, from a young age, in crisis response. That includes its Arab citizens, although vaccination rates for them are reportedly lower. The main reason for that, according to officials, is that Arab Israelis don't trust the vaccine as much.
Additionally, the isolation of our COVID-19 world, with its increased screen time, remote learning and decreased physical activity, can also worsen the winter blues and make it harder to separate SAD from more general pandemic struggles. Pay attention to significant or sudden shifts in your child and whether their timing has a seasonal nature.

Things look dismal when the episode opens, as BenDeLaCreme practically complains about sweeping the premiere's challenges. This sucks, she says as she wipes away eliminated queen Morgan McMichaels' lipstick mirror message. It's like not winning. It feels really bad. Despite the $10,000 prize for winning the Lip Sync for Your Legacy, and an early positive impression in the judges' minds, Ben's too wrapped up in having to make a tough decision and sending home one of her sisters.

Wages have been stagnant. People can't work enough with the additional cost of living going up, with housing prices the way they are, with rents the way they are.
Researchers say this kind of training, deliberately trying to appear more masculine and taking on a different sex role, is just one of the ways gay men pressure each other to attain sexual capital, the equivalent of going to the gym or plucking our eyebrows. The only reason I started working out was so I would seem like a feasible top, Martin says. When he first came out, he was convinced that he was too skinny, too effeminate, that bottoms would think he was one of them. So I started faking all this hyper-masculine behavior. My boyfriend noticed recently that I still lower my voice an octave whenever I order drinks. That's a remnant of my first few years out of the closet, when I thought I had to speak in this Christian Bale Batman voice to get dates. Grant, a 21-year-old who grew up on Long Island and now lives in Hell's Kitchen, says he used to be self-conscious about the way he stood—hands on hips, one leg slightly cocked like a Rockette. So, his sophomore year, he started watching his male teachers for their default positions, deliberately standing with his feet wide, his arms at his sides. These masculinity norms exert a toll on everyone, even their perpetrators. Feminine gay men are at higher risk of suicide, loneliness and mental illness. Masculine gay men, for their part, are more anxious, have more risky sex and use drugs and tobacco with greater frequency.

Barbara Guzman, who owns a label business in Cape Coral, Florida, and who saw Trump at a 2018 rally in nearby Naples, said Trump would be better off keeping his mouth shut and letting the experts in the government speak, rather than make a series of misleading or false statements that wind up needing to be corrected, thereby confusing the public.

Now the Sunrise Movement, likely the nation's fastest-growing climate advocacy group, is planning a 14-stop tour meant to drum up grassroots support for a Green New Deal across multiple states, HuffPost has learned. It's the first leg of the group's effort to make the policy the defining issue of the 2020 election.
The figures are somewhat surprising for a federal agency with a budget of approximately $7 billion a year. According to the report, federal prisons within the Bureau's Mid-Atlantic Region are authorized to employ a total of 7,373 employees, but only have 6,803 slots filled. This, according to union officials, results in an increase in inmate-on-guard violence, such as the death of USP Canaan housing unit officer Eric Williams in 2013. In response to the report, a Bureau of Prisons spokesperson noted, Actual staffing levels have never been 100 percent. The spokesperson clarified, Staffing levels in the Mid-Atlantic [Region] are consistent with other regions in the Bureau of Prisons.
Lately, I've been trying to nail down whether social media brings out the worst in people or is a great revealer of the worst in people, or is both. I'm not sure. All I know is that the past few days on the internet have left me in a kind of awe, an awe that is perhaps naive. I just can't believe how many black people don't give a fuck about other black people.
While they are a common sight on smog-heavy days in cities like Beijing, face masks are often ineffective against air pollution unless they fit tightly around the nose and mouth. Cheap surgical masks or makeshift barricades like a handkerchief don't protect against much, as air can easily slip through the sides of the mask when you breathe in.
Remove the barriers that create frustration. Your business will make your customers feel more important when you show your team that they are important. Rediscover and nurture the joy of great work. There are people energized by the opportunity to do great work, and there are those who have jobs. The ones that love producing great work add energy to everything they touch. Be one of those people, and if you supervise the work of others, do everything possible to make them feel appreciated. Pay attention to the culture every day. Your culture is your operation's DNA. It is your competitive advantage in a world where products and services are viewed as interchangeable. Something that important shouldn't be relegated to an annual review or assigned to a single group as its keeper. It is everyone's responsibility to nurture every day -- starting with you the leader.

He said he suspects researchers will have more information on this question in the coming months, and they tend to be hopeful the answer will be good.
I've found that mostly, people are just curious because nobody has ever sat them down, so they have questions, he added. Let them ask questions because you need to ask them too.
Audra McDonald -- Can't Stop Talking About Him
One of Muammar's sons, Hanibal, who is married to a Lebanese woman and has been on the run since his father was deposed and murdered, was recently abducted in Syria and eventually handed over to Lebanese authorities where he's been under lock and key pending an investigation into his knowledge about the disappearance of the Shiite trio, although he was too young to be involved at the time of the kidnapping.
He has been fighting for our rights since he was younger, said Allison Rangel, a restaurant hostess.

But what is this document and how seriously should you take it?
I would like to take you on a journey through the Bible, mostly the New Testament, to show you how it can make sense to our modern outlook. I will start by explaining how some of the words translated into English lose their true meaning. I will also introduce some ideas about the makeup of the human being which are necessary if we are to make full sense of what the Bible actually means.
Last month, as the coronavirus pandemic overwhelmed hospitals across the country, the Environmental Protection Agency opted to maintain rather than strengthen air quality standards for particulate matter and ozone, two toxic air pollutants emitted from power plants and vehicles. It also finalized a rule requiring the agency to give greater consideration to economic factors when crafting new public health safeguards under the Clean Air Act.
The worst thing you could possibly be was a French peasant in the 16th century, Lieberman said. Ironically, the lives of many of Hobbes' contemporaries were probably a good deal shorter than those of his Paleolithic ancestors.
So far, this winter has brought ample snows to the Sierra Nevada, the spine of mountains that runs along California's eastern flank. That's good news for Californians, because the range's melted snow provides 60 percent of the state's water supply. Anyone in the United States who likes fruit, vegetables, and nuts should rejoice, too, because water flowing from the Sierra's streams and rivers is the main irrigation source for farms in the arid Central Valley, which churns out nearly a quarter of the food consumed here.
Thunberg, a Swedish activist, has become a symbol for climate change action, as the world faces significant global warming and only 10 years to curb catastrophe, according to the United Nations and other experts.
We're going to keep saying Black Lives Matter, the candidate added.
It's the same old same old, said Diana Mutz, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania. White males have been the group with the most power in our country for a long, long time. They still do have an enormous amount of power, she pointed out, but that's been changing. Change is hard, she said.
The author explained that she's been hurt severely and there is a ton of pain associated with the uproar.

Taken on its own, the In Her Own Words spread is good. The photos are pretty and the words are nice ― the magazine equivalent of a friend's unobjectionable but ultimately forgettable new significant other. But SI Swimsuit editor MJ Day seems intent on positioning the issue as something that means more.
In Spain, El HuffPost reports (in Spanish) that the government will extend a state of emergency until April 11 as some regions asked for even harsher confinement measures. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez warned that the worst is yet to come as Spain's death toll jumped to over 1,700, with more than 28,000 cases of infection.

You have all these people that are now going to be on 'Dancing with the Stars,' he said, using one example of the ways Trump administration alumni have already normalized themselves in their post-White House lives. He added that, for a lot of people, the culmination of Trump's presidency in a riot wasn't really all that shocking: It confirmed what we knew.

Beto O'Rourke is the latest potential 2020 presidential candidate to get behind a Green New Deal.
Getting ready for a party usually takes about two hours, depending on the costume. It goes like this: pin-curl hair, tuck hair into cap, pin wig on with excellent care (never pull on the wig from the front/on the bangs!), stage makeup, colored contacts and multiple layers of clothing, including authentic corsets.

More mild allergic responses are possible within four hours of getting the shot, the CDC says. And the agency urges anyone who has had allergic responses to other vaccines to talk to their doctor about what this means for COVID-19 vaccination. It also states that everyone, regardless of their health background, should be monitored by their physician for at least 15 minutes after they receive a dose.
Sanders' consistency on Medicare for All ― he would introduce it right away rather than three years into his presidency ― as well as his support for a moratorium on the deportation of undocumented immigrants were key to getting CPD Action's blessing, according to Salgado.
There are two things private citizens can do right now to help, he said: stay healthy and stay informed.
As much as defeat or rejections don't feel good, they are just as necessary as victory and success. Only when you know what both feel like, you will be prepared and even more confident and grateful in your future job or relationship.

It's no secret that I'm a big fan of planks. I include them in my clients coaching programs all the time.
Dr. Christopher Bolling, who chairs the American Academy of Pediatrics section on obesity, argued that this racial targeting comes down to a common denominator: poverty. He said kids of lower socioeconomic status are more likely to live in food deserts ― where healthy foods are largely inaccessible and there are the most fast food restaurants per capita. And African-Americans under 18 are three times as likely to live in poverty as white youths. Hispanic children are more than twice as likely as white kids to live in poverty, according to 2017 data from the Annie E. Casey Foundation.
HuffPost talked to doctors, nurses and emergency medical technicians in California, New Jersey, Hawaii and Rhode Island about what it's like fighting the pandemic.

This is exactly my problem with Tarantino. He glorifies violence against women and people of color, makes an industry out of movies centered on violence towards minority groups, and gets called a genius for it.

I am fully aware that kids need to understand and work technology to exist these days and to compete with the rest of the world. I know there are a lot of educational apps and games and books to read. Does that mean we throw out real conversations and books or imaginary play or the arts? I surely hope not. From what I see that seems to be where we're headed, if we're not there already. So many kids don't know how to interact with real people because they spend so much time interacting with their devices.
However, health halos are lurking to throw you off course.
I work in the entertainment industry. All of my sources of income have been cancelled or postponed, wrote one Tennessee woman surveyed. A Utah man in his 80s said that, after being furloughed from the part-time job he used to supplement his Social Security, he was starting to ponder the choice between skipping prescriptions or eating less. One woman in Nevada said she was missing her only child's military graduation, which had been abruptly canceled; another, in Florida, was no longer able to visit her husband in his locked-down rehab facility. A plumber, a food server, an airline employee, a retail worker, a nurse practitioner, a music teacher, a pastor and a firefighter all reported already feeling strain from the consequences of the pandemic.
Contributions made in 2019 to an employee's SEP-IRA can't exceed 25 percent of compensation or $56,000, whichever is less. The nice thing about the SEP-IRA is that your contributions to any personal IRAs don't affect the limits for the SEP employer contributions. That means you could max out both plans if you wanted. However, participating in a SEP plan could affect your ability to deduct traditional or Roth IRA contributions, since the IRS doesn't allow you to deduct as both employer and employee.

Not being able to talk. I forget words, stumble over them, say words that make no sense. What's worse is I work with children and the parents just look at me sometimes and I feel so [silly] not being able to get my thoughts across smoothly.

Speaking Tuesday at the Capitol, Giffords lauded the bill's sponsors for once again moving to expand the federal background check system, despite previous failures in Congress.
It's hard to reconcile these images with my own experiences of entering the Capitol under tight security. For more than 200 years, the Capitol has been a solemn place of democracy. I do not always like what happens in the Capitol, but its halls have always been a place for serious reflection and action. They have always been secure.

Again, most cases of COVID-19 are mild, and experts suggest recovery will be similar to that of the flu (though some research suggests that you still may be able to spread it for a few days after you're recovered). However, people with conditions that compromise their immune systems, those with respiratory issues, and those over the age of 65 are at a higher risk for more severe complications. That's why, if you are not one of those individuals and you are infected, it's vital you stay away from people for their protection.

The per-day admission rates drop dramatically with multi-day tickets, which have also increased. Popular four- and five- day tickets have increased by between $25 and $40 each, which means tickets for a family of four have risen by between $100 and $160.
The initial urge does seem self-serving, a way to retroactively claim credit for knowing better than everyone else. The #MeToo moment should not be viewed primarily as a plum opportunity to hipsterize disliking Louis C.K., to smugly claim, I hated him before it was cool.

It's important to make very clear where the government funding is going, said Andrew Bergman, a doctoral student in applied physics at Harvard University. It can go into the hands of folks like Occidental and Exxon who will make money managing the same waste they've created, or it can go to folks at the municipal level and union workers who work in a collective.

And the reason it doesn't work is because the physical world isn't reliable. Life is, by nature, mutable. Situations and people change. You can have a 401K, money in the bank, and a house in the burbs and still lose it all. You can sign a marriage contract in blood and still end up divorced. Accidents happen. People die. Pets run away. Children get sick. Hurricanes, floods, tornedoes and earthquakes level whole cities.
At the end of the day, though, the way we appear in photos is the way we look to the rest of the world. And that's not a bad thing. In fact, studies have shown that other people generally like the version of you they see, as opposed to the image of yourself you see.
Promising Young Woman — currently playing in select theaters and premiering on video-on-demand platforms Jan. 15 — ends with Cassie dying at the hands of one of those predators, clean-cut Al Monroe (Chris Lowell), a classmate who raped Cassie's longtime best friend, Nina, and effectively drove her to suicide. Al will go down for his crimes not because he violated Nina but because he murdered Cassie and burned her body with the help of his buddy (Max Greenfield). No one truly suffers for their sexual transgressions, and that's part of the point: Rapists often walk free while survivors absorb the resulting trauma. Having learned that her charming beau (Bo Burnham) was also culpable in Nina's assault, Cassie risks becoming even more of a shell of herself. She is shrewd enough to know that showing up at Al's bachelor party to seek retribution might result in her death, but in some ways, Cassie had already died years ago alongside Nina, who was like a sister to her.
Many itemized deductions ... will be capped, eliminated or otherwise diluted in power, said Ben Flood, a certified financial planner and vice president of Bigelow Investment Advisors. Offsetting this for many tax filers is the fact that the standard deduction is significantly higher.

The staff at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas either interacted with mass shooter Stephen Paddock or entered his room at least 10 times before the night he killed 58 people at a music festival from his suite, a hotel representative has reportedly revealed. The day of the October attack, Paddock had a room service delivery and a housekeeping call, the hotel said.

This first-ever DVR, invented by TiVo founders Michael Ramsay and Jim Barton, made it easy to archive and locate hours of recorded shows, pause live TV and time shift our TV viewing. While it would take five years, when cable companies started to incorporate DVR technology into their set-top boxes, to accelerate the demise of the VCR, it was this recorder that triggered the change of how we watched TV.

But the Sierra snowpack has shown an overall declining trend for decades —most dramatically during the great California drought of 2012-2016 — and will dwindle further over the next several decades, a growing body of research suggests. In the latest, published in the peer-reviewed Geophysical Research Letters journal, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory researchers lay out what they call a future of consistent low-to-no snowpack. In other words, a new normal in which the robust snowpack developing this year would be an almost unthinkable anomaly.
That decision was made in the best interest of our guests and employees, the company said in a statement after California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) issued an executive order in response to the public health crisis.

Trump, the first president to lose a reelection bid in almost 30 years, has attributed his defeat to widespread voter fraud, despite the consensus of nonpartisan election officials that there wasn't any. Of the roughly 50 lawsuits the president and his allies have filed challenging election results, nearly all have been dismissed or dropped. He's also lost twice at the U.S. Supreme Court.
Dormitzer said if the virus eventually mutates enough that the vaccine needs adjusting – much like flu shots are adjusted most years – that tweaking the recipe wouldn't be difficult for his company's shot and similar ones. The vaccine is made with a piece of the virus genetic code, simple to switch, although it's not clear what kind of additional testing regulators would require to make such a change.
We're a society fixated on appearance. We're too thin, too fat. That person over there looks like a clown with that haircut, that person a few feet away thinks they're all that wearing sunglasses indoors. Look how wrinkled she is. Look how bald he got. Wish I had his biceps. Wish I had her eye color. On and on it goes. We digitally change people in magazines, we acknowledge our supposed collective frustration about this, yet we often strive to look like the very illusions that blanket the majority of media imagery—even calling them enhancements.

And that's not all. At least one study has found that male online daters find it more acceptable to lie about their current relationship status than women. I myself had the misfortune to date a man who was living with another woman in his second home up north.

The new study goes beyond earlier work by including DNA of parents, children and spouses of identical twins. That allowed the researchers to pinpoint when genetic mutations occurred in two different kinds of cells — those present in just one individual and those inherited by that person's children. They also found mutations that occurred before the developing embryo split into two, setting the stage for twins.

I personally love to prepare these puzzle toys in advance with pumpkin mixed into their kibble and frozen overnight. (I use all sorts of Kong toys). This extends both how much they have to work for it, and so stay simulated, and how long it keeps them distracted.
They believe we can only tackle the stigma associated with mental illness if we have the courage to change the national conversation, to expel its negative associations, he added. So it wouldn't be honest to suppress my story. I want to speak out, and they are my motivation for doing so.
There was evacuation fatigue from the fire, local resident Marco Farrell told the Associated Press.
The most inspirational part: One thing that Google taught me that I will always be thankful for is to embrace change. Prior to Google I had worked for bigger, more traditional companies where day to day things just kind of moved along (Bank of America, McKinsey, Aeropostale). Within just a few months at Google, there was a re-org and my role completely changed. That change gave me the opportunity to work with new people across the company and take on more responsibility. I learned at Google to look forward to change, and to recognize that it creates opportunity. And that, at the core, allowed me to have the confidence to make the jump to starting a company.

In response to Teigen's words, Maroney said in a statement via her attorneys that she was shocked by such generosity.
For the last 50 years, ever since Milton Friedman wrote that the social responsibility of a business is to increase its profits, everything has been about shareholders winning at the expense of stakeholders like workers, communities and customers.
I'm not interested in [talking about Trump] at all, she said in a conversation with co-host Andy Samberg that was published Wednesday in The Hollywood Reporter. What I'm interested in is pointing to actual real change. I want to focus on that 'cause people can pooh-pooh Hollywood all they want — and there is a lot to pooh-pooh, sure — but we also make culture.
You're in luck if you need an advisor. There are many new options available to you that will provide sound investment advice, access to a credentialed advisor and provide you with a comprehensive financial plan. The cost of these services is a fraction of what traditional advisors currently charge (although I suspect their fees will start to come down). Here are two suggestions:
The top thing is that there's not a coordinated national plan, Biden adviser Dr. Rick Bright told The Associated Press.
It is entirely possible that Justice Barrett's father could be a witness at a later point in this case, said Marco Simons, the general counsel at the environmental legal nonprofit EarthRights International. It sure creates a very problematic appearance that she is very close to the facts of this case, and in most cases that would lead a judge to recuse.
We want to work with the UN, Bush said, otherwise we will have to act unilaterally. The President also told the group he believed Iraq could eventually be a democracy. One leading Democratic senator who later voted to authorize the use of force against Iraq told the President, I will be with you on condition we level with the American people ― we'll have to say [in Iraq] awhile. You're right, Bush said. If you can get it done without staying, we'll give you the Nobel Peace Prize, the senator said. I'll support you for President, he added. I don't know whether that will help me or hurt me, Bush said to the room's amusement.
Recent observation-based estimates show rapid warming of Earth's oceans, read the report, which used four independent studies to track ocean heat content from 1971 to 2010. The report also found that the warming rate has accelerated since 1991.
My friend John Lewis is surely smiling down on his beloved Georgia this morning, as people across the state carried forward the baton that he and so many others passed down to them, he wrote.
To combat this type of thinking, Gold suggested asking yourself what all the possible outcomes are ― including the positive ones. For example, in this situation you could take more control by telling yourself that you have the power to do better next time and use that thought process instead to motivate you to succeed, she said.

Republican losses in the pair of Georgia runoff elections Tuesday would throw control of the Senate to Democrats, giving them control of the White House and both chambers of Congress for the first time in a decade — and adding an exclamation point to President Donald Trump's November loss.

Although it may be challenging to find precisely the same COVID-19 virus in animals as in humans, discovering closely related viruses might help explain how the disease first jumped from animals and clarify what preventive measures are needed to avoid future epidemics.
By the day's end, the Interior's Bureau of Land Management approved a nearly 500-acre expansion of a gold and silver mine on public lands near Bullhead City, Arizona.
Bottom line: The change to the Census was the brainchild of Bannon, and Ross lied to Congress about it. Now, he's going to be held accountable for it.
It was horrifying for us. We had never seen anything like this. We realised how polarised Ahmedabad was. We were the only Muslims in a 10 kilometre radius, Naheed said. That was our first experience with the Gujarat model of polarisation.

One-off recipes that convince the reader they just have to make this dish, or recipe roundups from established and trusted food bloggers and chefs.
And that is precisely what it is about making predictability security, comfort and stability your marriage's main priority. While wanting to minimize risks by co-creating a supportive structure that will shield us both from threats and dangers that we would face without a partner is a legitimate and worthwhile desire, too much of a good thing can result in undesirable and unwanted consequences, such as boredom, restlessness, resentment, depression, acting out (as in affairs) and flat-lining of genuine intimacy.

Le ministre italien des sports Vincenzo Spadafora a appelé dimanche à suspendre le championnat avant le premier match de la journée entre Parme et la Spal. Mais la rencontre entre les deux équipes, à huis clos comme tous les rencontres jusqu'au 3 avril, a bien débuté, avec 75 minutes de retard à 13h45. Les autres matches, prévus à 15h00 ont également démarré comme prévu.
The lawsuit against oil giants BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell seeks to recoup billions in climate-related damages the city has already incurred, as well as pay for billions in new infrastructure and resiliency measures to fortify the city and protect its residents moving forward, officials say.

Even amid the current partial government shutdown, the administration has prioritized fossil fuels. The Interior Department, one of the main agencies affected by the shutdown. is still issuing permits for oil companies, according to Bloomberg. And the agency is continuing its push to open Alaska's fragile Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, holding public meetings as part of its ongoing environmental review process, Alaska Public Media reported.
Yet I do not expect anything to change. The Proud Boys have been emboldened by the reception they got in Washington on Jan. 6, which fell just short of a warm welcome. White extremist groups are openly planning another attack the week of Jan. 20 when President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will be sworn in to office, and The FBI has warned of plans for armed protests at all 50 state capitals. Across the city, neighbors are urging one another to take down Airbnb listings and to remove Black Lives Matter signs and rainbow flags from their windows for fear of being targeted.
The one thing that people didn't realize was that there's 12 performers on stage, but there's 48 other people, and they're putting the whole show together, Kunis said, according to the Harvard Crimson. And a lot of them are women. And so, this production has been forward thinking, for many years. For decades.

If that official Democratic response was meant to demonstrate the poise and civility that plays well with the Beltway crowd, Sanders' seemed targeted at average American voters.
That would provide a no-strings-attached income supplement to anyone living on less than $34,000 individually or $48,000 as a couple.

The Lebanon DMV refused, so Stafford took them to court.
Checklists are very effective at motivating individuals and there is research that shows this, he said. Make attainable goals, write them down and go get them.
Gansa elaborated, There was a moment toward the end of last season where I let [Friend] know there was a fairly decent chance he wasn't going to survive. We probably thought he was going to die in the gas chamber. But as these things morph and change, as we got closer to that moment, we found a more interesting way to end it.
Hero Images via Getty Images Understand that some shifts are going to happen in your routine when you quit drinking.
As you think about the next 90 days, think on the following:
Why the shift from original lyrics to a dance focus? It could be that Todrick Hall is now in charge, after the unfortunate public meltdown of former favorite Ru producer Lucian Piane. But that seems wrong, considering Hall is a prolific parodist, and his Kardashian was an original piece. Whatever the case, it gives queens relatively few chances to be funny or impressive — save Shangela, whose Mariah number is minimally about singing and more about camping it up, and Ben, whose hard-rapping Julie Andrews is perfect. Even a cold-hearted Ben skeptic like me can admit she utterly slays this challenge. Under Drag Race rules, she'd have been the sole winner (though, under the same rules, I think Aja would've been the champion last week).
The shutdown, which began Dec. 22, was technically the third to take place in 2018, although the first lasted a mere three days, and the second lasted just a few hours and did not result in any furloughs. There have been 21 similar funding lapses since 1976, but only a handful of major shutdowns in which workers went without pay. Until now, the longest one had been a 21-day shutdown starting in December 1995, amid a deadlock between then-President Bill Clinton and congressional Republicans.
I'm a teacher, or until July 24, I was a classroom teacher. That's the day I told my principal I would not be returning to my classroom for this school year. After learning in mid-July that my school was planning to start the year in person five days a week, I spent several weeks vacillating about what to do.
However, testing is set to increase (link in Spanish) with the government announcing it had acquired more than 640,000 testing devices, and said that number could quickly reach a million. Six million more devices could also be on the way, Sanchez said.
Whether you call it a Sandpit or an Ideas Lab, the methodology does the same thing: it mixes people of different disciplines or professional perspectives to generate provocative discussions that redefine challenges and produce really new ideas.
Back in the day, getting married meant that once some mules, hay and gold changed hands, you left your family for the first time and were off to start a whole new life. Today, most modern American couples live in sin long before they make it official. This left us wondering: How much does getting married these days really change a relationship? Here, seven legally wed folks — from two months in to six years deep — share their experiences.
Mais l'effet des mesures prises par la Chine ces derniers jours se fera ressentir au bout d'une ou deux semaines, disent les chercheurs, car c'est le cycle du virus. Il semble de plus en plus qu'il ressemble au Sras, dit David Fisman. Le Sras était contrôlable, donc on espère que celui-ci le sera aussi, mais on ne le saura que dans quelques semaines. Cela prendra des semaines, probablement des mois, et personne ne sait comment cela évoluera, ajoute-t-il.
Haley blasted the membership of countries like China, Cuba and Venezuela that are themselves accused of rights violations.
What was missing from early mainstream discussions of the marriage between R. Kelly and Aaliyah was a black feminist critique of the relationship. Instead, critical analysis of Kelly's conduct was confined to fan magazines serving mostly black readers. Major papers weren't covering allegations of the urban artist's predatory behavior, nor were they exploring how misogynoir, which describes how hatred directed toward black women is influenced by both their race and gender, affected how the story was being framed.
Nevertheless, I felt a profound sadness as I exited the theater. I agree with The New York Times reviewer who noted the film offers no solutions, and no comfort. The best it can do is put down a marker.
Up until last week, when I finally snapped and said I was too tired to do it, my husband had actually never bought any clothes for our son, said Natalie, who is 36 weeks pregnant. He's three and a half. Maybe clothes don't seem like a big deal, but given how fast a kid grows, having a wardrobe for every size and season — and then packing it away and replacing it with new items — takes so much work and planning. Did you know some of the best snowsuit deals happen in August? This is the kind of information I now store in my brain.
In addition to helping strengthen the core, they can improve posture and alleviate lower back pain.
Our response to this crisis must be transformative.
For one, Democratic control of the Senate will ease the confirmation process for Biden's Cabinet picks and allow Democrats to control the process of what legislation gets a vote.
If you have a doctor that makes you uncomfortable, or you get a massage, or you have a date with someone and they coerce you in a situation like the Aziz one, I don't think there's any sort of criminal charge, but I think that it's good for everybody to learn that that behavior's not acceptable, she continued. It's not a crime, but it's not cool. And it can still really mess with a woman.
Italy has said all shops except pharmacies and food stores will be closed in response to the country's coronavirus outbreak.
Whilst also thinking about your children and the impact on them, parents should also think about the impact on themselves, noted U.K.-based psychotherapist Noel McDermott. As they say in the safety talk on planes before takeoff, make sure you put the oxygen mask on yourself first.
Yet there have been failures as well as successes. Back in 2015, the U.S. programming education company Treehouse declared it would have no managers and a four-day week. Literally, I was, like, fuck the 40-hour workweek. We're going to work 32 hours, because who says we can't, right? Because we write the rules,' founder Ryan Carson recalled last year in a GrowthLab interview. But over time, he changed his mind.
Heroin took my peace of mind and replaced it with a constant state of worry. I lost my innocence a long time ago -- I admit, I miss the blissful ignorance that came with knowing nothing about this drug.
Candace Chen, a disaffected millennial and Bible production employee, first thinks she can stress-eat her way out of the Shen Fever pandemic that paralyses New York City. In the end, she finds herself traveling west with a kind of post-apocalyptic cult that stalks the empty homes and buildings where the fever has decimated families. She survives by continuing some of her behaviours from before the pandemic — moving frequently, albeit now with others. She is highly adaptable, even as she remains a kind of sarcastic, lost loner. She seems to both discover and lose herself in the work of becoming a survivalist.
I felt so alone when I went through my eating disorder, so now, openly talking about it on my Instagram is my way of helping others know they're not alone and break through that stigma we associate with opening up about eating disorders.
In one small aside, Navarro, whose salary is paid by American taxpayers, is not supposed to be campaigning for Trump and bashing President-elect Joe Biden's election under the terms of the Hatch Act. He has violated the law before, but without any consequences, so is clearly unconcerned about it.
The bigger question for us as a province is: What are we prepared to do? What are we prepared to invest in order to make sure that my daughters and the millions of others like them ... actually have a sustainable future? he said.

Since then, multiple experts have reviewed records from Johnson's youth and concluded he has an intellectual disability.
Look at rejections like a sports competition. Each one is a new opponent who is challenging you to perform better and reach your actual potential. If everything in life was easy and went smoothly, we would never know our strength and what we were actually capable of doing in hard times. And we all know that no relationship, no job, and no organization experiences only positive and successful times.
In fact, getting vaccinated against COVID-19 could be really important for moms and their babies.
Binge-watching Netflix or a movie series. Sometimes healthy distractions, like escaping into another world through music and film, can bring relief from stress and anxiety. Plus, if we're going to invest time viewing something intense--like The Lord of the Rings trilogy--then a weekend marathon can allow us to take a deeper dive and transform the experience into a special event. Do it right: Grab pillows and blankets, make popcorn, order pizzas, and hunker down for the long haul.

Dairy is one. On dairy, it is not an issue of tariffs but certification. India has been saying that the American dairy products can surely come into India, but they have to assure the Indian consumer via packaging, that none of the products that are up for sale are procured from animals that have been fed blood meal. Blood meal is a protein supplement that the American dairy industry uses to get greater yield from their cattle. It is derived from dead ruminating animals, dead bones, dead blood and so on. India is putting the argument that it hurts our religious sentiments if products like that are going to be up for sale and no one is going to buy them. So, the U.S. dairy industry needs to create a different production line just to cater to the Indian market. A production line in which cattle have not been fed blood meal and reinvest in a specific packaging for the Indian market. That is what their dairy industry has not been willing to do.
He also said progressives will push Biden to use executive authority. He named two initiatives Biden has called for publicly: ending new drilling on federal lands and raising the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 per hour, even if Congress won't set that floor across the economy. Another progressive priority, canceling student debt under federal loan programs, is something Biden has not said whether he'd be willing to attempt unilaterally.
Perhaps, the most often heard question is, How long did it take you to make that? On its face, the question is matter-of-fact, but many artists take it as a challenge, as though the person asking wants to know how many dollars per hour you earn, so they can calculate it into wages, said Dorothy Fagan, an artist in Cobbs Creek, Virginia, or the person wants to make sure he's getting his money's worth. A snide riposte some artists are tempted to make is, Well, how much do you make an hour? but artists are more apt to soften the blow or reframe the question. Taking the latter approach, one might describe one's method of working, discussing the various steps involved and how ideas form and change during the process. This type of discussion, Fagan said, makes a precise determination of how long the painting took impractical.

But even if it cannot, the study may offer some explanation for why people infected with COVID-19 experience a range of neurological symptoms, including brain fog, or COVID dementia. When freed spike proteins cross the semi-permeable barrier that protects the brain from outside invaders, they may then circulate freely within the brain, throwing things out of balance.
Someone has done this. That's all I know, Sparrow said.
John Weaver, who worked for former Ohio Gov. John Kasich's campaign in those primaries, said Trump won the benefit of the doubt in 2016 from some voters who heard the arguments that he was not qualified to deal with serious crises but supported him anyway because of their dislike of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. In 2016, for all intents and purposes, Secretary Clinton was treated as the incumbent and Trump was the theory. Well, the madness theory is now a fact, Weaver said.

Germany, in contrast, raced ahead with aggressive testing of a broad segment of the population when it had fewer than 10 cases in January. It has experienced far fewer deaths proportionally than the United States.
Beyond the dynamics with the men at the bachelor party, my interpretation of the end is that Cassie is never going to be able to make peace with Nina's death, which means she's never going to truly be able to live her life, which means that, frankly, for her own sake, she can't go on anymore.
Her sniping remarks after being called safe, however, as well as a breakdown during deliberations, make me think these are Milk's true colors. She bursts into sobs over not being in the top — I think that's a lot of emotion for safe, Trixie says in her confessional — and complains that she's not being commended properly for her hard work. She basically throws a temper tantrum because the teacher didn't give her a gold star.

This exchange, if you can call it that, is just one example of what's happening all over the internet in the conversation surrounding both Kevin Hart's bizarre redemption arc and revelations concerning R. Kelly's abuse of young black girls in the recent Lifetime docu-series Surviving R. Kelly. (To be clear: I'm not equating Kevin Hart's tweets with R. Kelly's history of abuse ― telling harmful jokes is not the same as physically abusing someone. But the ramifications of both men's actions lie on a spectrum.)
Black girls are likened more to adults than to children and are treated as if they are willfully engaging in behaviors typically expected of black women, said Dr. Monique W. Morris, the founder and president of the National Black Women's Justice Institute, in her book Pushout: The Criminalization of Black Girls in Schools. This compression [has] stripped black girls of their childhood freedoms [and] renders Black girlhood interchangeable with black womanhood.

Trump's administration was creative with its implementation of the CRA, using it to undo agency rules that dated back to 2013. Now some legal scholars are evaluating how Biden's administration can stretch the law to undo some of the Trump administration's more extreme policies, even if they don't fall into the traditional definitions of a regulation.

In addition to the Green New Deal, candidates must stress that their opponents' inaction on environmental issues hurts American workers and their communities. Florida's former Gov. Rick Scott won a Senate seat this fall even though his gutting of Florida's water management budget by hundreds of millions of dollars likely created the conditions for the unprecedented red tide event that cost Florida's tourism economy over $90 million in one summer. His opponent, then-Sen. Bill Nelson, hardly mentioned that Scott's recklessness and complete disregard for Florida's environment and waterways was a direct blow to small businesses, fisherman and millions of Floridians whose livelihoods depend on the health of the ocean. Meanwhile, evidence shows that 30-year Congressman Dana Rohrabacher's notorious denial of climate issues potentially cost him his seat in California's 48th Congressional District this fall after he routinely ignored the issues plaguing his constituents ― including rampant flooding in Orange County's Balboa Island that has resulted from sea-level rise.

But they also intend to promote the importance to Alberta of resurrecting the Keystone XL pipeline expansion, a project to deliver landlocked Alberta oilsands bitumen to refiners and shippers along the U.S. Gulf Coast that was rejected by the previous Obama administration — a rejection Trudeau seemed to aid and abet with his co-ordinated surrender to Barack Obama shortly after becoming prime minister in 2015, Kenney said.

The lack of transparency has even frustrated the department's officers union. In contrast to the general silence from members of Congress on the issue, Capitol Police Labor Committee Chairman Gus Papathanasiou said in June that the agency should fall under FOIA, partly to force the board that governs it to produce orders and regulations related to working conditions.

Sometimes the year-end and the beginning of a New Year are also thought of as a time for change and new beginnings. That change may be to not spend another year with your husband or wife, and to begin again by ending a bad marriage or relationship. The reasons for divorce are endless, but the holiday season often brings matters to a head -- which makes January open season for divorce.

Cable was essentially anointed party leader after Jo Swinson, now deputy leader, decided not to run. What is the difference between Farron's Lib Dems and Cable's? Well it's an evolution of the same, Cable says. I think the change is not from the Tim Farron era, but pre-2015 and post-2015. We had taken a very bad hit in 2015. I think two thirds of our members have come in since 2015 and that process started under the last leader and its continued since. The membership has changed and the nature of the party has changed and of course Brexit has become an all-consuming issue. Cable, initially sceptical of committing the party to another referendum, has embraced the idea of giving the public a vote on the final Brexit deal. It didn't happen in the 2017 election for sure, he says of the success of that strategy. But we haven't had any real tests of electoral support since then. We do have lots of local by-elections where we tend to do very well actually. I think if there were an election now, there isn't going to be, but if there was, I think our position is much more appealing.

Until the US legislated and started litigating over disability inclusion and accessibility we made little to no progress.

I do not believe we would have seen progress without that legislation and people with disabilities demanding access in the United States via our legal channels.

The analysis, which focused on three popular textbooks from two major publishers of Christian educational materials ― Abeka and BJU Press ― looked at how the books teach the Trump era of politics. We found that all three are characterized by a skewed version of history and a sense that the country is experiencing an urgent moral decline that can only be fixed by conservative Christian policies. Language used in the books overlaps with the rhetoric of Christian nationalism, often with overtones of nativism, militarism and racism as well.
After holding out for several weeks, organizers of France's Cannes Film Festival officially postponed the event, one of the film world's most influential gatherings of the year, held every May. In a statement, festival organizers said it cannot be held on the scheduled dates. But they noted several options were on the table, such as postponing until the end of June to the beginning of July, as soon as the development of the French and international health situation will allow us to assess the real possibility.

Then there are the medications, which we are told have to arrive in Cuba in their original containers, accompanied by prescriptions.

Even sadder, without putting them in a pill sorter for travel, I'm pretty confident I will forget something. But rules are rules.
There are several methods used to value a business, but at a high level, there are two key fundamental ways to think about the value of your business:
I'm mad at COVID for entering our world. I'm mad at our government for not being better prepared to combat the spread of this virus. I'm mad at those who continue to gallivant about in a cavalier manner: shopping and running unnecessary errands, not wearing a mask, having large family gatherings. I'm mad every time I log on to Facebook and see others standing shoulder to shoulder, arm in arm, hugging and enjoying their families and friends. I'm mad I had to be told to quit teaching, not to retire when I was ready. I'm mad I didn't get to tell my students goodbye. I'm just so mad.
If you're not sick, there is no need to wear a face mask. Yes, seriously.
It plays really well with the Trump base. We buy almonds worth $600 million from the U.S. The produce comes mainly from California, which is the liberal stronghold of the Democratic party. Trump saying let's see how big the Indian market is for nuts and let's try selling them pecan nuts becomes an election talking point. Pecan nuts are mostly based in Trump land, the flyover states like Georgia. He says my trade deal with India is really helping you because I just got you another market. Instead of buying almonds, they will also buy pecan nuts. In that sense, the Trump base cares what happens with India.

Juice cleanses ― regardless of whether they have health benefits (doubtful) ― are extremely dangerous! registered dietitian nutritionist Casey L. McCoy of Country Doctor Community Health Centers said with an eye roll. They typically involve restriction of most macronutrients and leaves only vitamins, mineral and sugar for quick energy that then results in a blood sugar crash since there's no fiber. But when we restrict energy to this degree, our bodies go into energy preservation mode, prioritizing survival functions like heart pumping, breathing … but all the other functions go by the wayside. That's why people feel so fatigued and weak when they do juice cleanses.
We decided to travel to Cuba with a group called Road Scholar. The former name for this organization, back in the days when my parents used it, was Elder Hostel. Our hope is that, because it caters to seniors, Road Scholar will take good care of us. So far, we have received reams of information, all emphasizing that Cuba is basically a third world country. No cell phone service or Internet except maybe in our hotel. No handrails and lots of stairs and uneven pavement. No place to buy anything we have forgotten to bring. And if we get hurt or sick, we will need to pay cash for medical care.

The logic here is that co-pays and deductibles inevitably fall hardest on the sick, because they have higher medical bills, and the poor, because they have less money at their disposal. Research shows that these groups will frequently respond to high out-of-pocket costs by rationing their own treatments and, as a result, suffer.

It's easy to underestimate the power of a pat on the back, especially with top performers who are intrinsically motivated. Everyone likes kudos, none more so than those who work hard and give their all. Managers need to communicate with their people to find out what makes them feel good (for some, it's a raise; for others, it's public recognition) and then to reward them for a job well done. With top performers, this will happen often if you're doing it right.

MPs have called for a change in the law to prevent companies exploiting workers. The work and pensions and business, energy and industrial strategy select committees have published a joint report and draft Parliamentary bill aimed at closing loopholes which members say allow companies - including Uber and Deliveroo - to use bogus self-employment status as a route to cheap labour and tax avoidance. They want laws to be tightened to reflect problems within the gig economy and say willingness by companies to take advantage of workers must not be allowed to become a competitive advantage. DWP committee chair Frank Field said: The two committees are today presenting the prime minister with an opportunity to fulfil the promise she made on the steps of Downing Street on her first day in office, with a draft bill that would end the mass exploitation of ordinary, hard-working people in the gig economy. The bill would put good business on a level playing field, not being undercut by bad business. It is time to close the loopholes that allow irresponsible companies to underpay workers, avoid taxes and free ride on our welfare system.

When your partner is starting to feel like a 'best friend' that you want to gossip on the couch with after a long day at work instead of connecting in a sensual and intimate way, it's time to create some space for being lovers and bring erotic energy into your connection together. Flirt, make eye contact, use body language to feel sexy and sensual. Move your body and be intentional about turning your partner on. Instead of turning to your partner and saying, 'Do you want to have sex?' at the end of the night, work on creating anticipation, hints outside of the bedroom, texting and communication that show you are interested in being connected and intimate together. ― Chavez

Most of the time, I can't even zip up the skirts all the way and have to just hope the corset or bodice I put on over it keeps it in place.
So, now the president who entered office promising to deport up to 3 million people is actually removing far fewer people than the Democrat who preceded him ― even though ICE's budget ballooned by more than 15 percent to $7.1 billion last year.

I am in college consulting and education in general, so going to college made a lot of sense--I have to practice what I am preaching. But I never intended to go into business when I first decided on a career in teaching. Over the years, I have seen tons of tech companies launch products at different schools where I have worked. Most were clunky and not teacher or student-friendly. Worst of all, they lacked pedagogy, something that is critical for ed tech tools. And then there were the times when firms would send their best and brightest to evaluate the school's finances. Most of those folks were fresh from undergrad and had a few years of tutoring at a community center between them. They were making decisions that would impact the entire educational system in the city. They made suggestions that were completely irrelevant to schools, and in most cases, damaging.

Great bosses challenge their employees to accomplish things that seem inconceivable at first. Instead of setting mundane, incremental goals, they set lofty goals that push people out of their comfort zones. Then, good managers do everything in their power to help them succeed. When talented and intelligent people find themselves doing things that are too easy or boring, they seek other jobs that will challenge their intellects.

Cela lui permet en quelque sorte de pirater la production de la cellule et de créer des copies de lui-même, de son ARN. Chaque copie va alors aller soit infecter d'autres cellules, soit infecter un autre hôte, explique au HuffPost Sandrine Belouzard, chercheuse au Centre d'infection et d'immunité de Lille.

Trump was acquitted in 2020 by the GOP-controlled Senate and his approval ratings were undamaged. But this time, as some members of his own party recoiled and accused him of committing impeachable offenses, Trump was isolated and quiet. A presidency centered on the bombastic declaration I alone can fix it seemed to be ending with a whimper.
On Jan. 30, the WHO declared the virus a global health emergency while Trump held a packed campaign rally in Iowa. The next day, the Trump administration banned admittance to the United States by foreign nationals who had traveled to China in the past 14 days, excluding the immediate family members of American citizens or permanent residents.

Women learn early on that their greatest and primary value lies in their appearance, and whether that appearance is deemed desirable enough by men. The #MeToo movement is, in part, about exposing the ways in which women's bodies are objectified and then weaponized against them. SI has spent decades making big money off of that objectification, and a handful of artful nudes and big block letters does nothing to counteract that. As the New Yorker's Alexandra Schwartz put it, Sports Illustrated is simply fighting fire with fire.
Experts say a great place to start is by tackling your toxic thoughts. We experience thousands of thoughts per day. Some of these thoughts can be negative and thus detrimental to your well-being. In fact, some research has even suggested negative thinking could be linked to physical ailments such as heart disease.

The southern segment of the Amatrice-Monte Vettore fault might have broken today, possibly completing the rupture of the entire system. But the hazard is not over because other faults exist around the Amatrice-Monte Vettore system: in the north, several faults have not ruptured for centuries; in the west, where there are other faults that are likely to be mechanically connected with the Amatrice-Monte Vettore system; and in the south, where the huge Gran Sasso fault system has not ruptured for centuries.
During a time when so many of us have spent the better part of a year apart, here was a crowd of unmasked people, gathering en masse to storm the Capitol building to hamfistedly attempt to overturn the results of a sound democratic election. They didn't seem to have a plan — not really — other than destruction.
The situation is really very critical, Dr. Maria Neira, director of WHO's Department of Public Health, Environment and Social Determinants of Health, told HuffPost. You shouldn't be breathing air that could be killing you.
He reminds us as well that the Supreme Court has always recognized that the First Amendment doesn't mandate no regulation ever of speech, expression or the spending of money on speech or expression. Courts have declared that society has a compelling reason to penalize libel and child pornographers, for example, as long as the regulation is reasonable. Senator Ted Cruz's scare tactics to the contrary notwithstanding, neither Lorne Michaels, the producer of Saturday Night Live, the NAACP, the Sierra Club or the little old lady who put up a $5 political year sign are likely to land in jail if Citizens United is no longer the law of the land.
If you have a long-term view that you want a fleet of direct air capture scrubbers to scale up and operate over the century, you actually shouldn't be too concerned about what energy supplies are connected to initial deployments, Hanna said. In the grand scheme of things, emissions from the first few percent of plants don't matter that much.
The beast has confessed to have committed the past such crimes, the official told reporters. His DNA was matched 100 percent with samples collected from crime scenes.

READ THE TRANSCRIPTS! the president tweeted from miles away, as he returned to his hotel at a global leaders conference in Davos, Switzerland. That's the transcript of his phone call in which he asked new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiya for a favor.

The Trump administration has also accorded India with the Strategic Trade Authorization - 1 status. India is now the only third Asian country after Japan and South Korea to have that designation for arms export. There is a commitment not only to continue on that legacy but also build on it by making it easier for future administrations to sell more and engage in Indian capacity building.

At a Philadelphia restaurant where campaign staffers had gathered to mark the end of Sanders' bid for the presidency, the 50-year-old Becker allegedly grabbed a woman in her 20s by her wrists. He then forcibly kissed her while physically holding her in place, the outlet reported citing the unnamed woman and people who were there at the time. The adviser had previously told the young woman in front of other people that he had always wanted to have sex with her and made a crude comment, according to Politico.
Subjecting the Capitol Police to FOIA wouldn't necessarily lead to major revelations about the storming of Congress. The law includes nine exemptions, including provisions protecting sensitive national security documents and records involved in an open investigation. All transparency laws include major carveouts that shield departments from disclosing sensitive law enforcement records, particularly during an investigation, LoMonte said.

I met a lady about three years ago at a ballet school where my daughter was attending. She came into the lobby and she checked her daughter in. She had a little boy with her and he looked to be about two years old. Once her daughter went inside she sat down and exhaled a sigh of relief. Almost as if she had the worst day ever. The little boy wanted to come down and play with his toys. As soon as she sat him down he got up and came over to me. She quickly came and got him and apologized. I told her it wasn't a problem. He kept doing it over and over. So finally I decided to get on the floor and play with him. He was a sweetheart and he filled my baby craving fever for that moment. She said to me He is just all over the place today, he won't sit still. Guess what I told her? Yep, the same thing Ms, Mary said to me. [Talk about paying it forward huh..] It sounded like common sense to her and she even said you're right.

C'est quoi, vraiment, un coronavirus ? On en parle depuis des semaines, mais il faut rappeler que le nouveau coronavirus Sars-Cov2 n'est pas le seul de sa famille. Il en existe de très nombreux chez les animaux. 4 souches qui infectent l'homme sont très connues et ne font pas plus de mal qu'un simple rhume. Les trois autres, dont Sars-Cov2, sont plus récentes et plus dangereuses pour l'homme, comme vous pouvez le voir dans notre vidéo.

Lack of focus in vision and strategy: An unclear picture of how you provide value to your ideal customer leads to lack of clarity in vision and strategy.

Daily life for a germaphobe can be a challenge during the best of times, but when a pandemic strikes, it's downright terrifying. Navigating the world becomes a nightmare because danger lurks around every corner, and there is no escape route or safe place.
The treatment my friends and I experience at the Capitol as advocates and activists stands in stark contrast with the way the Proud Boys and other rioters were treated on Jan. 6.

Joe Manchin might not support filibuster reform on Day One, but if Republicans try to obstruct coronavirus relief on Week 3, he might support filibuster reform on Week 4, Green said. Make it less of a process issue and more of a substance issue. Give Republicans a rope to hang themselves with.
I think that increasing the police presence at the school doesn't serve any long-term effects other than helping to increase racial profiling at school, particularly for minority students, Kai Koerber, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas and a survivor of the shooting, told HuffPost. For me that doesn't make a whole lot of sense because the fact of the matter is, most of the time, it's not minority students carrying out these acts of mass murder.
A personal exemption is a sum of money you can deduct for yourself and any dependents from your taxable income. The personal exemption was worth $4,050 in 2017. A family of four, for example, would have received $16,200 in exemptions last year.

The result is a searing, painful, painstakingly documented six episodes, which make for both difficult and essential viewing.

One last thing: The suggestion that stronger borrower relief is worse for taxpayers is short-sighted at best, dishonest at worst. If the Department granted injured students meaningful relief, it would soon have a stronger sense of the enormous costs of allowing bad schools to participate in the federal aid program, and it would remove the worst actors more quickly. I believe that's exactly what bad schools are afraid of. Good schools should want a strong borrower defense rule that drives out unscrupulous competitors, the ones who have given the for-profit college industry its bad reputation.

It was a humbling lesson to learn that in spite of my head full of sex facts, and my uncommon comfort with the topic (I even publicly chronicled my experiences in a memoir, Sex in the Museum: My Unlikely Career at New York's Most Provocative Museum), none of it had truly prepared me for the identity navigation I would need to endure once becoming a mother. Not only was it a mind, body and soul upheaval, but unexpectedly it was also a confrontation with a societal mirror on maternal sexuality that left me totally perplexed. Was I meant to now prove I'm still sexy in spite of being a mother or did sexiness somehow make me maternally inappropriate?

The single greatest cause of death for law enforcement officers each year is suicide, said Jeff McGill, vice president of Blue H.E.L.P.
It would seem that Mat Staver, the founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, and his supporters are trying to prevent LGBTQ people from being protected from lynching as a means to keep them from being protected from discrimination. An anti-lynching law is, according to Staver in an interview he gave to the Christian news siteOneNewsNow, only a baby step to one day passing employment, housing and health care legislation that would offer protections to LGBTQ people. Thus LGBTQ people's lives become a small sacrifice for the ideological comfort and control of the religious right. He and Liberty Counsel seem to care more about what people do in their sex lives than the violence and inequity that they experience because of their identities.
How is SAD treated in children?
All taxpayers and businesses will have this additional time to file and make payments without interest or penalties, Mnuchin tweeted.
These women just speaking with so much confidence and eloquence and clear headed analysis. I think that is a huge shift. Politicians using Muslims as a vote bank, and then putting their cherry-picked people as spokespersons, and then deciding what are the women's questions, I think those days are gone. That is an enormous step forward for women who are Muslim in India. That is terrific. Nobody is going to go back to those men who were not necessarily representative at all. They are just men with a particular kind of political capital. I think this is a huge step forward for a Muslim women's movement or any kind of women's movement.
Every time I feel like I'm about to do something wrong, I hear my father telling me: Choose the right friends. Don't be a follower, he went on. He's my motivation in life. If he wasn't in my life, I don't know where I would be.

Mitchell defended Trump's strong-armed phone call Saturday to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, in a statement to The Washington Post following its bombshell story on the conversation. Raffensperger's office has made many statements over the past two months that are simply not correct and everyone involved with the efforts on behalf of the President's election challenge has said the same thing: show us your records, Mitchell's statement read.
Over the past year, experts have recorded an increase in domestic violence and high levels of alcohol abuse and suicide among Ukrainian war veterans, the Wilson Center noted in a report published Tuesday.

Others worry that privatization without proper regulation would actually drive up Puerto Ricans' energy rates, The Intercept wrote in a lengthy report on the subject.
Sadaf is exceptional in many ways, said Varma. Things that people accept, a bad marriage or injustice at work — people say arre thoda sa adjust kar lo, arre udhar mat dekho bus apna kaam karo — she cannot do that. When it comes to her beliefs, she is uncompromising. She chooses to do the right thing over comfort and convenience.
This week, Trump and his team also quietly appointed Anna Seidman, a longtime lawyer at the trophy hunting advocacy group Safari Club International, to lead the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's international affairs program, as HuffPost reported Friday. Seidman repeatedly sued FWS and other federal agencies during her 20 years at SCI, an organization with more than 50,000 members that has close ties to the Trump administration.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) called climate change the biggest crisis of all in a fiery rebuke of President Donald Trump's televised address Tuesday night meant to drum up support for funding a U.S.-Mexico border wall to reopen the federal government.

The rare impeachment trial, unfolding in an election year, is testing whether Trump's actions toward Ukraine warrant removal at the same time that voters are forming their own verdict on his White House.
As the psychedelic swirls of Sgt. Pepper streamed from radio and hi-fi speakers in late June 1967, 15,000 manufacturers, distributors and retailers checked out 100 exhibits during the first Consumer Electronics Show (CES) at the Hilton and Americana (now Sheraton) hotels in New York City.
The loss of his Twitter account and fundraising lists could complicate Trump's efforts to remain a GOP kingmaker and potentially run again in 2024. Moreover, Trump seethed at the blows being dealt to his business, including the withdrawal of a PGA tournament from one of his golf courses and the decision by New York City to cease dealings with his company.
How would Trump's re-election — if it happens — change the dynamics of this trade deal?
But beyond the sheer numbers, there's an alarming theme in the caliber of Trump's court picks. Many are young and ideological with records of attacking abortion rights, LGBTQ rights and voting rights. Many were also recommended to Trump by the conservative Federalist Society.
So this is the thing about her: She would never, ever, ever do anything that would actually damage a woman. But what she does with Dean Walker and what she does with [Brie's character] Madison is she says, This happened. Do you remember it? Do you think it was right? All she wants is for one person to say, This was wrong, it should never have happened, and I'm so sorry. That's all she's been looking for. From Cassie's point of view, as malevolent and frightening as it is, she's saying, I wanted you to see it. You don't, so I have to show you. You need me to show you. And now you understand.
House Democrats, responding Tuesday to arguments by Trump's legal team, said the president's legal filing confirmed that his misconduct is indefensible.
They don't know the history of other countries. They don't understand economics, he said.

Buhr: It's honestly been exhausting. ICU doctors like me are used to having patients die, but the magnitude of death and suffering has been so much more than usual. Additionally, because of infection control measures, patients' families can't come be with them in the ICU anymore in person. We use video chat to try to keep them involved, but it's not the same. It also means I spend a lot more time calling people instead of involving families on our rounds. It's really challenging to connect with people and have difficult conversations about what is often the end of someone's life solely over the phone.

I can't believe R.Kelly got married to that child, one woman says.
A flurry of litigation against oil giants began in 2015 after Inside Climate News and the Los Angeles Times revealed that Exxon Mobil Corp. had understood the science of global warming decades before the company started promoting misinformation denying that climate reality. Three years later, the Dutch publication De Correspondent unearthed documents showing that even after Shell's own scientists warned that emissions from burning oil were trapping heat in the atmosphere, the corporation's management team chose to emphasize the scientific uncertainties of global warming.
Alluding to Aaliyah as a teenager fails to clearly demarcate that she was under the age of 18 when the marriage license was allegedly issued. Claiming she married her much older producer negates the abusive dynamic at play and makes her seem like a willing participant in a union that by law is non-consensual.
President-elect Joe Biden is facing mounting pressure to drop a prominent lawyer currently working for one of the world's largest oil companies from the transition team's list of potential nominees for solicitor general.
Don't think the coffee market is safe from gimmicks. Sugary Starbucks drinks came under fire years ago when it was discovered how nutritionally void yet calorically dense they were. But now, coffee is disguising itself as a diet aid.
As of 2013, the issue made up about 10 percent of Sports Illustrated's yearly revenue.
House Democrats will be able to argue that McConnell and Trump are standing in the way of paychecks for an estimated 800,000 federal workers ― more than half of whom are simply working without pay. Typically, Congress approves back pay for those furloughed workers, but government contractors will likely get nothing.
The Canadian Olympic Committee and the Canadian Paralympic Committee released a statement Sunday on their decision to pull their athletes out of the games as currently scheduled. The committees also called on the International Olympic Committee, the International Paralympic Committee and the World Health Organization to delay the games for one year.
As innovators, we try to think out of the box, to change the way everyone is accustom to do things. Finding ways to save time and money for companies eventually will make accessibility a commodity that even Mom and Pop websites will be able to have for few dollars. This is why we will have to learn and we do every day, from the market, from our clients, their clients as well educate us. Our goals are to assure that accessibility will be pushed to the front of the stage, instead of staying invisible, as it is today. Amihai Miron, CEO of User1st
In Colorado, Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper has proposed increasing the state's rainy day fund to 8 percent of the general fund, due to better-than-expected state revenue and an estimated $300 million boost from the federal rewrite. But some in the Legislature want the money for highway construction instead.
New research set to publish Thursday in the journal Nature outlines how the U.S. government could once again conjure the full force of its industrial might to build and deploy a massive fleet of machines to suck CO₂ from the sky.

I think a big part of it is that toxic masculinity makes it seem as though experiencing these very real, common insecurities emasculates us and makes us weak; it's not masculine for us to be vulnerable.
Richard Robertson V, a private chef for Double R Catering LLC, on Long Island, New York, breaks it down in simple terms: It's all about having everything you need for your recipe out ― washed, chopped and otherwise prepped, properly measured, in their places and ready to go. And with that, you are, too.
At latest count Monday evening, there were 102 confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. There are going to be hundreds by the middle of the week; there's going to be thousands by next week, warned McCarthy.

In the LGBTQ community, we put guys on a pedestal who have one particular body type, he told the magazine. I wanted to reclaim the narrative that my body needed to look a certain way for me to love it, and to show people who have stretch marks, extra skin and love handles that they should feel confident.
Weinberg believes the insurrection at the Capitol has made things worse, and it's not clear yet if a new administration can repair the damage.
In speaking with some of our clients this morning, all of them wondered whether USAG will change the position they have taken in court that USAG had no duty to warn its member gymnasts even though they knew Larry Nassar was a molester, he said. Until that happens, this move is simply a public relations ploy to save a sinking ship of an organization.
: Customers reward consistent excellence not occasional brilliance. The businesses experiencing this challenge may need to optimize their processes, increase consistency with their existing process, or both. Complacency and lack of urgency: A sense of complacency in an organization can be seen and felt. Customer comments and requests are discounted or even ignored. Decisions seem to take forever. There is a prevailing attitude that says, why do something today that can be put off until tomorrow?

I want this to be about Amy's sweet gesture, not my own, she wrote in an update to the original post. Thinking about how many people have seen this has sparked an idea in me. Can you imagine if that many people did even just one random act of kindness for someone? We need to truly be the change we wish to see in the world.
This is an interesting moment. But there are all kinds of things that Muslim women in India have been doing that somehow don't get counted as Muslim women exercising agency. In the controversial teen talaq movement, there were Muslim women who went to the courts. Even when you think about Shah Bano, Muslim women have been using courts to change laws for a while now. They are trying to change nikah halala. There is a lot happening.
Some of the partygoers were convinced that Sanders needed to run because he was the most electable candidate in a head-to-head matchup against Trump.

Disruptions due to quarantine & denials of entry to ports can have significant effects on travellers.
Of course, a large part of this is being older. We need more stuff to sustain us. Medications. Shoes that don't hurt. Sunblock. Insect repellent. Enough clothing to wear for eight days (no way I'm washing underwear in a hotel sink like I did back in 1968). And for me, makeup. So yes, we need more than a backpack each to get by for over a week.
Although individual events could not be linked directly to climate change, global warming is playing a role, Munich Re said. It expected more frequent extreme events in future.

Going to the grocery store, which I only do every two weeks and no more, requires me to meticulously plan ahead so that I have everything ready for the ritual I need to follow when I return with my food. (I say need here rather than want, because right now it is very much a necessity to have procedures in place to prevent the emotional distress associated with my germophobia). I need to carefully sanitize everything I bring home before putting it away. And I do this in the garage, thereby minimizing the potential germs brought into the house.

The committees want the government to rule out any changes to legislation that would undermine the national minimum and living wage, as well as end loopholes which allow agency workers to be paid less than permanent staff. They also want companies to either guarantee workers a set number of hours each week, or compensate them for uncertainty. Rachel Reeves, chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy committee, said: Uber, Deliveroo and others like to bang the drum for the benefits of flexibility for their workforce but currently all the burden of this flexibility is picked up by taxpayers and workers. This must change. We say that companies should pay higher wages when they are asking people to work extra hours or on zero-hours contracts. Recent cases demonstrate a need for greater clarity in the law to protect workers. Responsible businesses deserve a level-playing field to compete, not a system which rewards unscrupulous businesses. We need new laws but also much tougher enforcement, to weed out those businesses seeking to exploit complex labour laws, and workers, for their competitive advantage.

Of course, when Trump vowed to protect the forgotten men and women of our country, he likely had a specific subset of men and women in mind ― working-class Americans and, in particular, white working-class Americans. Stoking their racial resentment has been a theme of his presidency, just as it was a theme of his candidacy.

Trevor Bedford, directeur du laboratoire Bedford au centre de recherche Fred Hutch, explique dans un blog que le coronavirus semble muter environ deux fois par mois. À côté de cela, il se passe environ 7 jours entre le moment où une personne contracte le coronavirus et celui où elle va contaminer quelqu'un d'autre. On peut donc imaginer que toutes les deux transmissions en moyenne, le virus mute. Encore une fois, ce sont de toutes petites mutations, qui sont souvent insignifiantes, de simples coquilles dans le code génétique.
In late November, Letitia James, New York City's public advocate, held a first-of-its-kind public hearing on climate change. Activists, students and voters packed an auditorium at the Borough of Manhattan Community College for hours, recounting stories of asthma exacerbated by air pollution and homes flooded by rising waters.

Tensions have really reached a crescendo.
He said: The ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross), the most impartial organisation that exists on planet Earth, is funded by states. The funding per se isn't a breach of independence because the largest humanitarian organisations are funded by taxpayer money channeled through states. 2) 'Independent Journalists' The open letter also states: In a context in which both the US and UK governments have been actively supporting attempts to overthrow the Syrian government for many years, this material casts doubt on the status of the White Helmets as an impartial humanitarian organisation. It is therefore essential that investigators such as Vanessa Beeley, who raise substantive questions about the White Helmets, are engaged with in a serious and intellectually honest fashion. Vanessa Beeley is a British blogger who has written extensively about the White Helmets, which she describes as al-Qaeda Civil Defence and calls legitimate targets for military strikes – in direct contravention of international humanitarian law. She is the daughter of the late British diplomat Sir Harold Beeley, and worked in various sales and management roles before turning to activism in 2012, writing about Gaza.

Instead, when I got to the start line I looked around me, at the runners who looked confident and sure, strong and capable -- I told myself the first of a series of lies: You aren't strong enough.
There are no such forces in rebel-held areas. James Le Mesurier, the founder of the NGO that trains the White Helmets, told HuffPost UK: [This idea] asks readers to somehow believe that following a bombing from the Government, that the Government would then send its fire brigade to these areas to rescue the civilians that they've just bombed – which is exactly why the White Helmets were founded. The Fringe Anti-Imperialists Robinson and Hayward have spoken at events alongside Beeley, sharing a stage with, amongst others: Eva Bartlett - a blogger who went on a regime-sponsored trip of North Korea and has since written that western media coverage of the country is designed to garner support for yet another American-led slaughter of innocent people - despite thousands of testimonies of escapees from the brutal regime.
He hopes to make the WRF the go-to yearly gathering for scientists, companies and governments: There is so much science already but what is missing is the connection between the right people.

I've been reassured by the Commissioner and by Gold Command that borough commanders across London will able to use leave from officers, including calling some officers back off leave, to make we have got an increased presence across London so all Londoners can feel safe, he said. At this particular time, you'll appreciate why those of Islamic faith who go about their place of worship, particularly in the evenings, need that additional reassurance. The police will be ensuring there's an increased police presence across London, but particularly those parts of London where there are big Muslim communities around mosques and other places of worship. The Mayor said that there would be an increased visible police presence and a zero tolerance of hate crime. These have been a terrible few weeks for London…We will stay a strong city we will ensure we are not cowed by terrorism. We are united today and we will carry on being united.

After supporters of Donald Trump bent on overturning the presidential election stormed into Congress, the Capitol Police are facing a barrage of questions about why they seemed so unprepared.
The team around Trump is hollowed out, with the White House counsel's office not drawing up a legal defense plan and the legislative affairs team largely abandoned. Trump leaned on Sen.

It was a marked change from Trump's first impeachment. That December 2019 vote in the House, which made Trump only the third president ever impeached, played out along partisan lines. The charges then were that he had used the powers of the office to pressure Ukraine to investigate a political foe, Joe Biden, now the president-elect.
If you decide that making a change would ultimately be beneficial, you don't have to wait until January 1 to make a resolution. While the concept of New Year's is that metaphoric starting line, you can pick any day to begin making an important change and look forward.
A closer examination of the Amatrice-Monte Vettore fault system shows that it is actually divided into four principal, 10 to 20km-long sections, called segments (see figure). These four segments are separated by a gap of a few kilometres or by pronounced bends. The Amatrice-Monte Vettore fault trace is thus jerking from one of its segments to the next.

They don't need all the specifics now. Medicare for All isn't going to become law as long as Republicans control the Senate and Donald Trump is the president. Meanwhile, the lawmakers and staff working on plans have already done more thinking than their conservative counterparts did about mythical, ultimately ill-fated Obamacare replacements.
An IRA lets you contribute pre-tax dollars, which grow tax-deferred. You only pay taxes on the investment gains when you make withdrawals in retirement. One of the biggest benefits to contributing to a traditional IRA is that it's easier to make larger contributions since you don't have to pay taxes on the money. That lets you take full advantage of compounding returns while you're young. Plus, if you don't contribute to a retirement plan through work, you can deduct your IRA contributions on your taxes.

But secrets get old. And as the pandemic wore into its eighth month, with no end in sight, I no longer took comfort in loving someone to whom the world could not bear witness. Witness creates truth. Or witness creates proof, which creates fact, and people say that's as close as you can get. As real as it all felt, there was a way in which without being witnessed, our relationship suddenly crossed from a sweet secret to not really real.
Those variants are causing global concern. They both share a common mutation called N501Y, a slight alteration on one spot of the spike protein that coats the virus. That change is believed to be the reason they can spread so easily.

It's an important lesson, but not one that's likely to help much in the short term. The reality is that the big pharmacy chains now dominate the market, especially in more densely populated parts of the country. That's a big reason why the Trump administration reached out to them.

What Shell is purchasing in getting his time is a lawyer who is known to be a Democrat who had some good clients, and that provides a positive sheen to their cause, said Jeff Hauser, director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research's Revolving Door Project.

One described Trump supporters as people who feel the rug is being pulled out from under them ― that the benefits they have enjoyed because of their race, their group's advantages, and their status atop the racial hierarchy are all in jeopardy.
There were several moments in 2018 when it was difficult to remain hopeful for any sort of meaningful action on climate change. The Trump administration has worked tirelessly to impede a transition to a green economy with actions ranging from opening the long-protected Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, to implementing tariffs on imported solar panels, to the president's own denial that humans are causing unprecedented warming ― despite his own government's comprehensive report stating the opposite.
The question has pretty significant implications for our collective ability to curb transmission, because if the vaccine stops people from spreading the virus to others we're likely to get herd protection much sooner than if it only prevents the vaccinated individual from developing symptoms themselves.

Amid the conspiracies, racism and far-right extremism on Thee Rant, a few posts on the forum pushed back.
During his last full week as president, the Trump administration plans to execute three people on death row, capping a historically unprecedented six-month execution spree. The people scheduled for execution — just days before the inauguration of a president who opposes the death penalty — include a woman with a mental illness untreated at the time of her crime, a man with an intellectual disability that should render him ineligible for execution, and a man who did not pull the trigger in the killing he was convicted of.
2. Ask for what you want & need. Your partner is not a mind reader. If you want or need something from them – tell them.
Rejection sucks. It hurts. It feels personal and very uncomfortable. It is demotivating and hurts our ego, self-esteem, self-image, and challenges all those nice attributes we've manifested and which got us going. Rejection can crash our dreams and even make us lose faith.
Unfortunately, President Trump, who started receiving criticism from an assortment of right-wing ideologues, changed his mind about the agreement, Sanders said. He then read aloud quotes in which Trump said he is proud to shut down the government.
President-elect Joe Biden vowed to inject $2 trillion into programs to convert the nation's electricity supply to 100% zero-carbon sources by 2035, fund mountains of new research and build a massive network of charging stations for electric vehicles. A fraction of that funding would go to researching negative-emissions technologies like direct air capture.
Also unpopular among the experts are detox teas, which, as McCoy put it, are having another 'moment' on social media, especially among celebrity influencers. Just as juice cleanses claim to clean out your system, so do these teas, but the body is well equipped with organs that already work to detoxify our systems, said nutritionist Claire Peacock, who oversees the nutrition department for MenuTrinfo in Colorado. No drink can replace what the body naturally does.
In April 2015, Col. Dr. Vsevolod Stebliuk, a medical adviser for Ukraine's Ministry of Defense, founded a center to treat physical and psychological traumas at the Irpin Military Hospital, located in a forest outside Kiev. Stebliuk himself suffered a period of psychological trauma after working as an anesthesiologist at Ilovaysk, where over 600 people died in clashes between troops and separatists in August 2014.
Many fear that organizations will simply use these tools and then not take the time to blend accessibility standards into the DNA of their technology solutions? Maybe. And if that happens, I believe the community of persons with disabilities should and will continue to fight for their rights via legislative and litigation channels.
We don't think the Turks ought to undertake military action that's not fully coordinated with and agreed to by the United States, Bolton said Sunday, adding that Trump has made clear he would not allow Turkey to kill Kurds.
The first, three-year mandate of the commission ended in December and its future had been uncertain.
For all travelers, I'd recommend returning to destinations because it's a great opportunity to see the parts of town or parts of a country you missed the first time, maybe get to more obscure areas beyond the highlights, and get a deeper appreciation of the people, culture or landscape you've come to see, Lonely Planet travel writer David Else told HuffPost.
Ruby may have been 'skinny' while following that diet, but I think we can all agree there is absolutely nothing healthy about it, she added.
A short time before he was impeached, Trump was in the White House East Room presenting the National Medal of Arts to singers Toby Keith and Ricky Skaggs as well as former Associated Press photographer Nick Ut.
In many ways, it's been a continuum with the U.S. Not only has it taken the baton forward, it has only built on it.
The kids keep me on my toes in this regard, with curveball questions such as: Ariel, why do you have a fin AND feet? or Elsa, can you make it snow right now? or Rapunzel, what's your last name? This keeps my improv and confidence skills up to par.
I look normal? young Jenner responds, seemingly offended by the insinuation that Kim thinks exaggerated facial features are commonplace for the social media star.
In television ads, Democrats doubled down on a corruption argument against GOP Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue that the party largely avoided making against President Donald Trump. And the return of coronavirus relief to the news helped the party develop a sharper, more specific economic message focused on winning larger relief checks for voters.
Veteran footballers Jimmy Greaves and Ron Flowers were made Members of the Order of the British Empire, or MBEs, after a long-running campaign to ensure every surviving member of the team that won England the 1966 World Cup receives an honor.
And in Britain, labor organization Trades Union Congress is calling for a universal four-day week by the end of the century, arguing that any productivity gains from AI or automation should be used to the benefit of all.
But I do have a knack for computer languages. I started Python programming at YoungWonks coding academy at just 7 years old. Today I am among the academy's most advanced Python students, and I used my Python background to teach myself more than a dozen coding languages and interfaces. I am also taking an open-source masterclass on machine learning.

The unfortunate aftermath of being seen as part of a monolith of passive, soft-spoken Asian women is that it becomes much more difficult to be taken seriously when we actually want to move up in the ranks. Give up! It's too much work to try to get ahead and change structural inequity; just keep working twice as hard as your mediocre male peers to get half as far. It makes for good cardio. It also keeps up that pesky model minority stereotype ― the one that says that Asian-Americans are inclined to higher levels of socioeconomic success, and therefore no action needs to be taken to reduce the real socioeconomic disparities that exist.

The group sent to Wuhan by the World Health Organization was approved by President Xi Jinping's government after months of diplomatic wrangling that prompted an unusual public complaint by the head of WHO.
The Secret Service is shaking up assignments for President-elect Joe Biden's detail because of concerns about some agents' worrisome ties to Donald Trump, The Washington Post reported.
Democrats can also immediately start work on undoing some of the Trump administration's most recent policies, like cutting workplace safety inspections, rolling back polluting emissions controls and promoting junk health insurance plans.
Pettine was handed the talented but enigmatic QB ahead of the 2014 season. Manziel then sat behind Brian Hoyer for much of the year, as the Browns raced out to a surprising 7–4 start. But they dropped their final five games before this year's slump—that's a 3–18 close to Pettine's Cleveland career, if you're keeping score.
The different growth paths are a symptom of a general problem that has haunted currency unions for centuries. Competitiveness and productivity develop at a different pace in different countries. Over time, this leads to large competitiveness differences among the members of a currency union. These differences do not usually pose a problem during economic booms, because strengthening aggregate demand supports ailing fields of production. However, when a currency union faces an economic downturn or a crisis, falling aggregate demand hits less competitive industries and countries hard and the financing costs of less competitive countries jump. This is an asymmetric shock.
She's lived a tortured life and she has been broken, Mattingly said. I understand she needs to stay in prison the rest of her life, I do. But the death penalty? It doesn't feel like justice. So many people let her down. I'm just begging that somebody will stand up for her for once.
Three weeks after the start of a partial shutdown of the federal government shuttered many of the EPA's services, Trump sent Wheeler's formal nomination to the Senate for confirmation.
For a germaphobe like myself, things may never be normal again. Right now, I can't imagine a time when I won't be hypervigilant about germs in public and frightened to leave my home or be around other people. What is most likely to happen is that I will need to make some adjustments to essentially create a new normal that minimizes the stress I feel when I think about germs.
While producers have a certain cost, the biggest loses will be borne by exhibitors, who will have to bear the cost of overheads with no recovery till this blows over, an industry expert said.
When Democrats re-took the House in 2007, they reinstated expired pay-go rules requiring any new spending to be offset. But following a decade of frustration with Republicans' willingness to discard their professed fiscal conservatism to cut taxes for the wealthy ― and a burgeoning field of research downplaying the importance of low budget deficits ― many Democrats have soured on pay-go as a vestige of a misguided era of centrist triangulation.
The three states still honor Lee's birthday 30 years after the federal government established Martin Luther King Jr. Day on the same day of the month each year: the third Monday of January. Lee was born on Jan. 19, 1807; King was born Jan. 15, 1929.
Biden did not immediately start making the case that the war was a mistake. In 2005, Biden did start calling his vote for the war a mistake. But he continued to argue for staying in Iraq in 2004.
At 8 p.m. Thursday, shopping malls, amusement parks and bowling alleys in the four states were ordered to close. Earlier this week, movie theaters, gyms and casinos also shuttered, and restaurants and bars are now limited to serving takeout and delivery orders.
Roselló said the move is a response to the power company's decades of inefficient operation, its outdated distribution model and its poor management. The island's power generation system is 28 years older than the standard infrastructure used in the rest of the U.S., he continued, and the antiquated system in place has been poorly serviced.

After leaving the store, Nightengale shot a 15-year-old girl who was riding in a car with her mother, leaving the girl in critical condition, police said. He then went back to the convenience store and fired on officers who were investigating the earlier shooting. None of them were injured, Brown said.
The disaster took place in the same community where just weeks ago firefighters confronted the largest wildfire in the state's history. The back-to-back disasters ― fire and flooding ― may seem like a cruel irony, but they're directly related.
The fire, which was the deadliest and most destructive in the state's modern history, tore through nearly 14,000 homes around Paradise, a rural community about an hour and half north of Sacramento.
WASHINGTON (AP) — For several months, President Donald Trump and his officials have cast a fog of promises meant to reassure a country in the throes of the coronavirus pandemic. Trump and his team haven't delivered on critical ones.
If you need numbers to make every decision, you cannot make long-term plans. I've worked with managers who require that every single thing be an A/B test, whether or not it makes sense ― to the point where no work could get done, because everything needed an experiment to come back, Hogan said. The person who is obsessed with data [...] doesn't have a long-term plan. Everything is short-term, numbers-based decisions, which means you never end up with a vision.

Our bodies need macronutrients to function normally ― that means protein, complex carbs, fats and fiber. However, going on a juice cleanse deprives your body of those important fortifying elements, since your goal is to restrict all actual food and consume only juices.
Four young men at a Kroger grocery store in Texas were stopped and accused of shoplifting by a manager. After producing their receipts, they were given a trespassing warning by police, a family member said.
A Democrat-controlled Senate could help pass more COVID relief bills much more quickly than in recent months. Congress finally passed a stimulus bill at the end of December after months of hotly contested negotiations that often fell along party lines. One immediate change may be that some Americans will see more stimulus money, since Biden promised to approve the $2,000 COVID relief checks if both Warnock and Ossoff won.

Sanders' uncompromising policy stances played a role in other endorsements. Hector Bajaras, a founder of the Deported Veterans Support House, cited Sanders' pledge to roll back a rule requiring the deportation of any undocumented immigrant, including veterans, who commit an aggravated felony, in an endorsement announcement on Wednesday.
Of course, the issues can be even more pronounced in countries where gender equality isn't front of mind, and as the Oxfam report points out, the answers will likely have to come from ordinary people, rather than less affected (and let's face it, more male) politicians. Examples include paid leave, investments in child care, challenging sexist legislation, and supporting the care of older adults and people with disabilities — since the unpaid labor women do isn't just about chores and child care, as Natalie notes.
Some men definitely sexualize you because of the job. There have been plenty of gross comments made both in person and online. The worst part about it is I can't even defend myself in the way I'd like to when in costume, because I'm required to stay in character at all times. One time, when I was Aurora, a teenage boy made a NSFW comment about my rear end. My middle finger was itching as I silently walked away from him.
Newsweek deleted its post shortly after King tweeted at the publication, and apologized.
But outrage over the issue prompted Scheer to ask for a review of the candidate vetting process. A year later, a report was released that recommended, among other things, more thorough police and background records checks for those seeking to run as MPs.
Blaming a dark-skinned other for one's misfortune is an old and redoubtable tactic in American politicking, but the current administration has embraced it with passion. The wall that caused the government shutdown embodies this well: As a promise, it's a baldly phallic, ultimately grotesque monument to the desire to close America off to its southern neighbors. The crude prototype the president posted to Twitter is spiky, dense and, in its crude way, potently symbolic.

The reality is that air pollution is a public health crisis that demands a strong response from governments and businesses.
They change. I leave in the morning and come back in the evening and they've grown. They're starting to talk and now there's some reaction there. They use their faces and hold their heads up a bit.
On Jan. 6, the lackluster response to rioting Trump supporters put democracy in peril, and, at times, the Capitol looked more like the scene of a frat party than the seat of the United States Congress.
While Kejriwal has called for Shaheen Bagh to be cleared up, the Congress's stand is ambiguous.
The scariest part: The scariest thing about leaving Google was the fact that I gave up a good gig, and a salary. I was reporting to the VP of Americas marketing, working on some really interesting projects and I loved my co-workers (one of my closest friends still today is someone I met in my first week of Google). Leaving a well-paying job to bootstrap a company, with no income coming in, is scary. It took me months of discussion and contemplation before actually taking the plunge to start ThirdLove.
The drawing shows a naked female and two hands pulling her braids back, with the word Greta written across her lower back. Below that is the logo of Edson-based company X-Site Energy Services Ltd. It has drawn staunch criticism, and serious concerns that the imagery constitutes child pornography.
I have to check in with myself a lot on this. Whenever I'm feeling too big or not pretty enough or like my makeup isn't as perfect as the other girls, I have to just give myself a moment to breathe and remind myself that my job is to just entertain children and make them happy and bring them the magic of Disney. I do my best. And that's what really matters.

The extent of the damage has yet to be surveyed, and crews are working to clear roads.
Early on, you'll learn a lot more from the right person or manager as opposed to just being at the right company. Because you're young, you can afford to take risks, and the lessons you'll learn early on about the kind of people you do and don't want to emulate will put you way ahead of the curve in terms of personal and professional growth. This isn't just any route, it's a fruitful one. - Roger Lee, Captain401

Trump held a rally for both Loeffler and Perdue in early December — during which he mostly complained about the election he lost a month earlier — and he plans a second one on Monday.
He posted dozens of other short videos, including several in the hours before the first attack, which were viewable until the page was taken down Sunday. In one, he says, I'm going to blow up the whole community. In another, Nightengale appears to groove to the Bee Gee's Staying Alive while laughing.
ASSOCIATED PRESS Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) speaks outside her home on Dec. 31, 2018.

The speed of the vaccines' creation was pretty unprecedented, but that does not mean researchers skipped important steps.
Properties and homes in Japan are tiny! Kondo said. I grew up in a house where my family of five would unfold futons and sleep side-by-side in a room of about 13m x 13m. There isn't much space for storage, so small furniture and appliances are necessary.
Another above-the-line deduction available to student loan borrowers is a deduction on the interest paid. Borrowers can deduct of up to $2,500 in interest per year. The deduction begins to phase out for borrowers with an adjusted gross income over $65,000 and caps at $80,000.
Because staying healthy involves things like washing your hands and not touching your face, some people may think those who get sick are 'unclean' or irresponsible, he said. People have similar beliefs about those who are overweight or have substance abuse problems.
L'Organisation mondiale de la santé (OMS) avait écrit sur certains communiqués que le risque était très élevé en Chine, élevé au niveau régional et modéré au niveau international. Il s'agissait d'une erreur de formulation, et nous l'avons corrigée, a expliqué à l'AFP une porte-parole de l'organisation basée à Genève.
The average person will go through five or more of career changes in their lifetime, and even more individual jobs. Some will be an ugly fit, many of them will be average, and if you are lucky one of them will be the perfect fit for you.
Maybe it's because I've recently come to believe that there is no such thing as failure, really. Yes, while rejection, mistakes and unfulfilled goals are very disappointing, they are not Failures and they should not be perceived as Stop signs. They are merely Detour signs. Life's way of saying, find another way to succeed. Did you fail to win a new client's business, get in to your top college choice, get a publishing deal, a promotion, a dream job? There is a difference between when an objective fails to happen and Failure. Adopting this mindset is powerful. The very thing about failure that's so painful is that it makes us feel weak. It makes us turn inward and feel badly about ourselves. It pricks a hole in our balloon of confidence.

The vow, administered by a coalition of 16 left-leaning environmental groups, commits candidates to adopt a policy to not knowingly accept any contributions over $200 from the PACs, executives, or front groups of fossil fuel companies — companies whose primary business is the extraction, processing, distribution, or sale of oil, gas, or coal.
Anyone who has online dated for more than say, one week, knows just how prevalent lying is online. In my online dating journey (as they say on The Bachelor), I often met men who were lying about something, whether it was as innocuous as their age by one or two years, or something more important, like their current relationship status. At first it made me mad and then it started to amuse me. It was as if men were having fun making up new, idealized versions of themselves online.
What has really been undermined is going to the usual guys about what Muslims think in India and what they prioritise, said Siddiqi, an expert in gender and feminism in South Asia. I think that has really gone. These women are very eloquent about what they think should be done and what they want.
Not being able to process what someone is saying to you and then looking rude for asking what they said more than once because to your brain they may as well be speaking gibberish. – Dani S.
The different streaming options don't offer the exact same packages as the cable companies, meaning you'll almost definitely be missing out on something. If you're one of those people who actually does watch tons of different channels, the live streaming services might offer less that what you're looking for.
The private liberal arts school in Greensboro, North Carolina, was notified last month that the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools' Commission on Colleges had voted to remove its accreditation due to failure to comply with the commission's financial standards.
Americans' level of concern about the coronavirus ― and their willingness to endure widescale preventative measures in response ― are in some cases modestly divided along generational or geographic lines. Fifty-nine percent of Americans under age 30 say they're at least somewhat concerned about the outbreak's spread, the survey finds, while 73% of those 30 and up say the same. About two-thirds of city dwellers are at least somewhat concerned they or a family member will contract the virus, compared to about half of rural Americans who say the same. These divides make a certain amount sense: COVID-19 has proved especially deadly to older people, and the disease's first inroads into the U.S. have been concentrated in urban centers.

Democratic leadership rejected the plan, but the effort succeeded in shifting the climate debate in the direction scientists say matches the extent of the crisis. By mid-December, more than 300 local and state officials voiced support for a Green New Deal in an open letter. Days later, a poll from Yale University and George Mason University found 81 percent of registered voters surveyed said they supported a Green New Deal, including 64 percent of Republicans and 57 percent of conservative Republicans.
In a 2015 interview with Today, Angelica said it's important to let young girls know that beauty comes in different shades.
The Millennials are starting many of the activities traditionally associated with adulthood later in life. The average age at which people get married has reached an all-time high of 27 for women and 29 for men. Children are now allowed to remain on their parents insurance until age 26. Even the age range of late adolescence has increased to age 25.
This amuses me. Yes, I still feel like an oddball for fearing germs to the extent that I do, but now I have a lot of company!
Police in Lahore, Pakistan, have arrested a man for the rape and murder of 7-year-old Zainab Ansari, officials said on Tuesday.
After the sweeping Reagan-era federal tax overhaul in 1986, many states that tied their state income taxes to the federal code changed their laws in 1987, in some cases due to a similar windfall or to align their tax brackets with the federal code. And just like federal tax laws, state codes have changed incrementally over the past three decades, so that neither resemble what they looked like in 1986. But sweeping tax overhauls in the states have been rare since then.
She added, I'm not joking, he took side streets for like four hours just to make a point. But things got far worse after Bell suggested Shepard wear a helmet when it started to rain.
But those calling for change did not appear willing to wait, and after sustained pressure, Scheer announced in mid-December that he'd resign as soon as his replacement was chosen.

There are a slew of business groups ― some decades old ― founded with the sole mission of saving the health care system. The National Business Group on Health and its regional affiliates. The Leapfrog Group. Individual companies from Xerox to Whole Foods (now part of Amazon, as it happens) have tried, too. Success has been limited.

Separating your funds will help you to avoid accidentally spending money designated for bills, she said. You should also have a separate savings account, and even sub-savings accounts for different goals.
Nobody sought balance back in the 1800s or even the 1950s. Back in the Old Days people sought to cultivate traits like virtue (huh?), patience, forgiveness, altruism, objectivity and a kind temperament.
Almost everyone has been struck by white blindness in this novel except for the doctor's wife. (None of the characters have names — a reminder of the way that catastrophe and disaster can strip us of our identities in the social order when things were normal.) Like many women in fictional pandemic circumstances, the doctor's wife goes hard on the maternal side when she becomes a de facto leader of a group gone wild, one of 300 quarantined in a warehouse. She kills to protect them and she also cares for the newly vulnerable. Even in a pandemic ― maybe especially during a pandemic ― shoring up your karma for being a kind human is a good idea.
So far, we've raised over a million dollars towards the 5 million, she said. So we're about 29 days out from the February 1 deadline, and so we're stepping up our efforts in a variety of different ways to raise those funds.
When we think things are worse than they are, or assume that because one bad thing happened that more bad things will happen, it can cause a lot of emotional turmoil, said Robyn Gold, a psychotherapist in private practice in New York City.

Les autorités chinoises expriment la volonté de collaborer de façon plus transparente et plus rapide que pour l'épidémie de Sras, explique à l'AFP Antoine Flahault, directeur de l'Institut de santé global à l'Université de Genève (Suisse). C'est une attitude extrêmement différente par rapport à 2003 même si des questions persistent sur le nombre exact de cas et la possibilité d'une sous-estimation.
There's no role models for athletes because athletes tend to come out after they retire because of fear, maybe of rejection, fear of different pay, fear of people just not accepting them for who they are, he said. I've had the opposite. My career got better since I've come out because I know who I am.
We know this will have an impact on the social fabric of our communities, County Supervisor Kathryn Barger said in a statement obtained by the Los Angeles Times.

Under the new plan, seen as a compromise that will get majority backing, the current requirement for nominations from 15% of MPs and MEPs will be reduced to just 10%.
In May this year, on a Saturday evening. I was called to an incident, single crewed, to where a man was reported to be acting weird in a shop in Hartlepool. I went inside, got a couple of people out. There was a bloke standing next to the till with a half bottle of wine in his hand, off his head on something. I started talking to him and his first question was 'are you here to kill me?' And then all of a sudden he just went 25,000 feet and climbing and pulled out a rather large kitchen knife. Probably about nine inches long, and started waving it around. I got my incapacitant spray out, still tried to talk to him. I shouted at people to get out of the shop, but one didn't. He came towards me with the knife, I backed out and he followed me out, but then went back in and closed the door. The problem was there was a female member of staff still in there and here was somebody armed with a knife. So rather than back off and contain it, I've got to try and go in there and ensure her safety. So I kicked the metal door to knock him off balance. At that point his arm's come round and the knife has gone straight into my forearm. Two or three minutes later the cavalry arrived and he ended up being tasered by one of the other lads.
Prince Harry and Meghan Markle just made a stunning break from royal tradition.
While our world and the way we interact in it may not be normal again for a long time, I look forward to the day when I can return to the classroom as a substitute or part-time teacher, when I can travel to see my daughter, when my husband and I can finally celebrate our 30th anniversary, whenever and wherever that may be. I look forward to the day when I'm not mad anymore.
Many nonunion companies have done the same, whether because of public criticism, the fear of losing workers or the belief it was the right thing to do. Perrone said he believes the increases negotiated by the UFCW have helped put upward pressure on other chains.
In the meantime, he insisted that Delhi's voters would reward his party for the work he had done over the past five years.
Going into first grade, I was fitted for a wig. I don't know what it cost, but I'm sure it was substantial. I wore it on the first day of school when we played a rousing game of duck, duck, goose. As I was running and giggling, my wig flew off and all the kids laughed at me. I came home that day and told my mom that I would never wear a wig again.
Unless and until the aging Supreme Court justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy are replaced by progressives, Hasen writes, no change is possible. For now, he recommends keeping the issue alive with short term fixes (which, to be sure, will face an uphill battle in Congress), such as more robust and rigorous disclosure requirements for donors and multiple matching funds for small campaign contributions.
Data and new developments on COVID come out so rapidly, it can be overwhelming, she said. But people can instantly connect with these anecdotes. They raise awareness of the infection and its potential impacts. They're particularly important for young adults who use social media as one of their sole sources of information and who have been somewhat reckless due to underestimating the risk of the virus.

A country like Italy is just 'wow!' travel writer and photographer Michael Luongo told HuffPost. It has the highest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. So you also have places that are rich in cultural heritage, archaeological heritage ― and just a few miles from wherever you were the last trip, you can explore something completely different.

Le maire de Wuhan a été critiqué pour avoir organisé samedi dernier un banquet auquel étaient invitées 40000 familles. C'était avant la confirmation officielle lundi d'une transmission entre humains, a-t-il expliqué mardi 21 janvier à CCTV.
Several lawsuits in recent years have pressured the Army to change its policies on grooming and dress. In April 2016, Bronze Star recipient Captain Simratpal Singh was granted a permanent accommodation to wear his turban and beard after he sued the military for discrimination. The ruling, however, applied only to Singh. A short video produced by Becket Law, one of the firms that has petitioned for Sikhs' right to serve in the military, explores the history of the Army's rulings on articles of faith:
Democrats' limited expectations about their own power, even with a potential majority, belie the exaggerated claims Republicans have used in the Georgia races.
Is there a cure for the coronavirus?
That includes parents, pregnant women who earn just over the poverty level, and adults who live in states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. The lowest-income pregnant women are exempt, as are people over 65, patients in long-term care, and individuals who receive federal disability benefits.
Trump, the first president to lose a reelection bid in almost 30 years, has attributed his defeat to widespread voter fraud, despite the consensus of nonpartisan election officials and even Trump's attorney general that there was none.
Because I know. Honestly, though, it should have been all along.
NEW DELHI ― The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is set to form the government in Delhi for the third time in six years with Arvind Kejriwal returning as the Chief Minister.
There are also societal attitudes that actively discourage men from seeking help or appearing vulnerable. Sarosi links it to research that's found many men don't fight against climate change, or even adjust behaviour like eating plant-based diets, recycling, or using reusable bags, because they're worried that will come across as feminine.
Carlson, who has continually given air to the baseless conspiracy theories of Trump and allies, continued:
Yes, there continue to be complaints about what Suu Kyi has or has not done. There are concerns she doesn't have enough bench strength to run the country, that her inner circle's too small, her temperament difficult. It's still uncertain whether constitutional barriers can be overcome so Suu Kyi can serve as President herself someday. But she is already demonstrating leadership in direct and indirect ways that are worth noting:
POLITIQUE - En pleine crise du coronavirus , c'est une annonce importante qui vaut à partir de maintenant. Édouard Philippe , invité du journal de TF1 ce vendredi 13 mars, a annoncé que tous les rassemblements confinés de plus de 100 personnes sont interdits à partir de maintenant. Un arrêté sera pris en ce sens.
From all the years I knew him, he had always been a good guy and funny guy, Taylor said. Something had to happen in order for him to break him like that.
As COVID-19 raged and Georgia's small businesses went under, Democratic candidates Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock owned the economic message of putting money in people's pockets, Senate Majority PAC President J.B. Poersch wrote in a memo to donors obtained by HuffPost. This was the perfect contrast to the corrupt GOP ticket, which saw a tidal wave of negative news that we hammered in ads.
As the economy changes and technology evolves, we need an income floor … so that people can still maintain a certain dignity in their lives while they decide what to do if they need to get retrained.
Today, Powell believes entertainment journalists are responsible for holding powerful stars accountable for their actions, even and especially when those actions bleed beyond the boundaries of business as usual.
That means history could be about to repeat itself.

Once you're ready to sit down and craft your budget, the first step is to figure out how much money you have coming in. And in light of the pandemic, that number may be much different than in years past.
Since the evolution of employer-brand-focused websites, companies have been establishing and building their brand in 2016. The trend is actually helpful as candidates can know beforehand the culture, mission, and vision of the company. Thus, recruiters will have to screen only those who have agreed or believed in their company's goals.

If you happen to be in a cold winter climate (or even if you're not), here are some potential benefits of winter hibernation:
Les masques, utiles pour le grand public? L'État français a commandé la fabrication de plusieurs millions de masques, après avoir longtemps hésité sur la question. Alors que d'autres pays recommandent le port du masque, le gouvernement a estimé durant plusieurs semaines que le grand public n'avait pas à en mettre pour aller à l'extérieur. Le 3 avril, changement de ton, après que l'Académie de médecine a recommandé le port du fameux masque. L'institution suggère aussi, alors que les stocks restent insuffisants pour se fournir dans le commerce, que les Français fabriquent leur propre masque en toile. Retrouvez dans la vidéo ci-dessous une méthode toute simple pour en fabriquer un, sans ciseaux ni aiguille.
She explains, Setting up mise en place is essentially doing everything within your control to prepare for a smooth cooking experience. It can ease anxiety by giving you a clear understanding of the step-by-step flow of the recipe so you know exactly what to expect, and confirming that you have all of the necessary resources at hand, allowing home cooks to preview the path ahead and chart accordingly.
The Queen later confirmed that the couple were making the move with her blessing. There will be a period of transition in which the Sussexes will spend time in Canada and the U.K., she said in a statement.
In New York state, the [first] person who tested positive is only the 32nd test we've done in this state, he said. That is a national scandal. The longer we wait to get testing up and running, the worse this is going to be.
Many observers say last week's events highlight the need for Congress to shine more light on the law enforcement agency. American Oversight, a liberal legal group, said Thursday that Congress should amend FOIA to include the Capitol Police to promote trust and accountability. Transparency experts and advocates echoed the sentiment in comments to HuffPost.
Some of Hunter's other policy ideas are to:
It was not immediately clear if his death was already counted in the official toll of 41, of which 39 were in the central province of Hubei.
As a result, the unemployment rate was nearly 10% going into the 2010 midterm elections, contributing to the dismal environment that cost Democrats the House and limited Obama's political capital for the remainder of his presidency, these progressives maintain.
We liked Hulu live until it froze that last 45 seconds of the Super Bowl  ― Darcy Leal DeShazer
The fallout from yesterday's events caps a four-year decline in the cachet of being American, he said. It further diminishes, reputationally, everything we built up since the Second World War.
Conditions prompted an emergency response beginning around 2:30 a.m. Pacific time. In Montecito, a wealthy area near Santa Barbara, mudslides cut a gas line, sparking a fire that spread to multiple homes. Responders have been delayed in some areas due to waist-deep mud, along with downed trees and wires, Eliason said. Helicopters are being used because of road conditions.
I will remember the tremendous energy, joyful spontaneity, possibilities and potential that lie within me to create that which I can imagine for myself.

They also praised how Teck went about engaging with Indigenous communities during the project development and review period.
These are some of my thoughts. What are yours?
You can go in there and very quickly engineer a solution for that, Pollock said. There may be approval issues and new clinical trials, but tweaking a mRNA vaccine itself is relatively simple.
Meyers was particularly blown away by what he called Dr. History's fractured view of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Trump claimed the Soviets had to invade because terrorists from Afghanistan were attacking them.
When the children grow up and have kids of their own, they want to share this destination with their own children. These can often turn into multigenerational vacations, as grandparents enjoy seeing the destination again through their grandchildren's eyes, she said, noting that Walt Disney World, North Carolina's Outer Banks and Cape Cod are popular family tradition spots.
Vanessa Beeley has also described meeting Bashar al-Assad as her proudest moment, and lauds his wife, Asma.
Yet another group that Trump loves to champion is farmers. But Trump this year overturned a regulation that made it easier for independent farmers to sue food companies and large agricultural conglomerates. And now the Environmental Protection Agency is talking about rescinding regulations that prohibit underage workers from handling toxic pesticides.
During my tenure as CEO of TecAccess - I saw a disturbing trend with companies trying to make their ICT accessible and keep it compliant with Section 508 of The Rehabilitation Act. We would help them make their website, applications, services or products accessible. Then within months or on the next release or version update they would kick themselves out of compliance.
I view myself the same way everyone else views me: as an outspoken progressive who is laser-focused on delivering results for the people of New York's 17th Congressional District. That means I am going to work with members of the Squad, as well as progressives who are not members of the Squad, centrists and, yes, even conservative Democrats and Republicans.
Because therein lies the rub: Safe is honestly a generous placement for Milk. Her Celine is weird and frenetic (and in not-very-Celine ways), and her runway is bland. She probably deserves the bottom three spot over Chi Chi this week. She absolutely deserved to be in the bottom two last week. Rather than throwing a fit, she should be glad she's still in this race — because if she continues performing as she has, she won't be around much longer.

One of the best ways to pay down your student loan debt fast is by making more than the minimum payments. Of course, just pay more isn't realistic advice for most people. But hear me out on this one: Even a few one-off extra payments can have a significant impact on your student loan balance.
I would remind the president that under President Trump's watch, we have added more debt at a faster pace than ever since World War II. We have never done this. People need to know that, Manchin told a local West Virginia television station in December after Trump called on Congress to increase direct payments to $2,000.
As Sanders, 77, deliberates whether to toss his hat in the presidential ring, other Democratic candidates are rapidly jumping into the race.
She is described in a medical report as having tubes to feed her and help her breathe. The mother could actually lose weight in other places like her face or arms if a fetus is consuming nutrients, Huls added.
Learning sex from pornography is like learning how to drive from The Fast and the Furious. A terrible idea, she writes.
RWE is seeking to increase its access to the region's supply of lignite, or brown coal. This type of coal is mined in giant open pits. Brown coal is easier and cheaper to access than other varieties of coal, but it is one of the dirtiest fossil fuels to burn. That means the coal that lies underneath Immerath could end up producing billions of tons of carbon emissions over the next few decades.
Yet even these revelations failed to turn the tide of public opinion, because, as Powell put it, the lives of women, and especially poor or working-class women like the ones Kelly preyed on, are simply not valued. The media's reluctance to report on Kelly was ultimately the result of a tangled web of racism, rape culture and celebrity obsession that took years of reporting from DeRogatis and others to untangle.
Regardless of your frustration, they are the future of your organization. There are things that they do better than you and some that they do worse. Complaining makes for interesting dinner party conversation, but it doesn't help your organization flourish in a future of upheaval and uncertainty. You need to change your perspective and lead today to ensure success tomorrow.

Make sure to keep a flat back and avoid bobbing side to side. You can make this movement harder by bringing the feet closer together, or easier by widening them.
The revised return policy on all purchases allows customers to get full refunds to their original form of payment within 30 days from the date of purchase. This includes purchases made online.
(The Church) recognizes the sins of some of her members: the sufferings, the experiences and the pain of minors who were abused sexually by priests. It is a sin that shames us, Francis wrote in the letter.
Austin, though, went through this process last season and reportedly impressed teams in interviews. He comes highly respected, both from his time in Baltimore and now in Detroit. Let him fix the Eagles' defense and find someone to help him with the offense. He's due for a shot.
Visitors can be a huge point of contention for new parents, especially during cold and flu season. Your wife's coworker's offer to drop off homemade lasagna is sweet and well-intentioned, but babies have fragile immune systems; you may be wary of anyone who could potentially carry a virus or illness.
Every single decision he makes is making life harder for people, is disrespecting human beings and is just wrong, he said of the U.S. president.
SANTÉ - Pékin a annoncé mercredi 22 janvier que la ville de Wuhan, d'où est partie l'épidémie du nouveau coronavirus, était placée sous quarantaine. Ce jeudi, la Chine a également verrouillée la ville voisine de Huanggang, alors que le bilan est passé à 17 morts.
There are no prizes for noticing the negative. Bad news is abundant. Yet there is so much good, especially in you and in your loved one. Celebrate yourselves often.
Let's refocus our energy and coverage to policies instead of personality.
Sometimes I have to remind myself that he is still a child. I catch myself mid-sentence at least twice a week, angry that he forgot to pack his monitor and his kit for school.
The Hong Kong High Court gave permission for the cases to proceed during a preliminary hearing on Thursday. The court will hear a separate case regarding civil union first.
Yes, absolutely. Well, meta? Probably not, because I think anything too meta can be a bit alienating. It's funny, a lot of the conversation has been about me casting them against type. Actually, I've cast them completely to type. It wasn't so much that it was meta, but for both the men and women — including Connie Britton and Alison Brie — I really wanted to cast people you like. It was all about testing the audience's allegiances to people. There's nothing we love more than a villain and a very clear-cut victim. We love that as a society and as a viewer because we know who's good and who's bad. What is really discomforting is when we're seeing people that we really like and respect who've been people that we've had crushes on since childhood do stuff we don't like.
Proof of this, they argue, is that it's investment products, and secondarily, durable household goods, such as cars, whose trade has slowed down the most. They note that slowdown of goods consumption affects 143 countries out of 171 under review, including China, Brazil and the nations in the Euro area, among others.
This is not a decision we are taking lightly, but one made with the well-being and safety of our employees in mind as well as in the best interests of our customers, the company said in a statement. We will work with local community groups to responsibly distribute food and drink from our restaurants in the coming days.
Trump's own Justice Department may have complicated what is already a highly improbable effort to upend the ritualistic count Jan. 6. It has asked a federal judge to dismiss the last-gasp lawsuit from Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, and a group of Republican electors from Arizona who are seeking to force Pence to step outside mere ceremony and shape the outcome of the vote.
Ocasio-Cortez has clearly broken through, Sean McElwee, the co-founder of Data for Progress, said by phone. People like Ocasio-Cortez are more than willing to primary a Democrat for not supporting a Green New Deal.
Our goal is to tackle the solution of how we're going to have an agriculture tomorrow that is both organic and healthy and able to feed humanity, and we think space has the key, Gaume said from Bordeaux.
You are good enough to succeed and you will succeed if you work your plan. You have value and are worthy of being honored for the work you do every day. You have a positive impact on those around you and what you do is important. The difference between success and failure is sometimes simply saddling up.
CBD is short for cannabidiol, the nonpsychoactive ingredient that can be found in weed. CBD doesn't get you high (that's what the THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, in weed does). Commercially available CBD has little to no THC in it.
Zacharias had been entangled in some previous controversies over how he had publicly described his academic credentials and over his claim, later challenged in legal proceedings, that he was the target of an extortion scheme related to sexting and sexually explicit photos.

The government should be very transparent and collaborative, said Shin-Ru Shih, director at the Research Center for Emerging Viral Infections at Taiwan's Chang Gung University.
Asked if the PM was giving her personal support to the bill, a No.10 spokesman told HuffPost UK: That's one the Government is backing, so you can take that as a 'yes'. The Ministry of Justice and Home Office are expected to signal on Friday their support for the new legislation. Backed by trade unions and staff bodies such as the Police Federation, an alliance of emergency workers held a 'drop-in' lobby of MPs in the Commons on Wednesday. Bryant told HuffPost UK: I'm really encouraged by how many MPs have come along, listened to emergency workers and said they'll support the Bill. It's not over until the votes are counted though and I'm not counting my chickens yet. All sorts of things could still go awry. Alan Lofthouse, national ambulance officer for the Unison trade union, said: It's only right that the full force of the law is used against anyone who attacks those trying to save lives and protect the public. This bill will help the courts to bring offenders to justice. HuffPost UK talked to five emergency workers, each with their own stories of why a new law was needed.

On the campaign trail in 2019, Joe Biden said that fossil fuel executives should be held liable for climate change and those who refuse to take responsibility should be jailed. We should be able to sue oil and gas companies just like we did the drug companies, just like we did with the tobacco companies, he said in a February debate. And on his campaign website, Biden pledged to strategically support ongoing plaintiff-driven climate litigation against polluters.
Carey articulates it very well. By no means is she going to that cabin on a suicide mission. She absolutely isn't. But we've seen how meticulous she is. There's no way she'd go into a place that dangerous and not have a contingency plan.
Polaris, a nationally known anti-human-trafficking organization, released the results of a three-year study this week that identified more than 9,000 illicit massage parlors in America. The report, Human Trafficking in Illicit Massage Businesses, claims there is substantial evidence of workers being victimized.
Specifically, the SACSCOC found that Bennett did not meet section 13.1 of its Principles of Accreditation guide, requiring an institution to have sound financial resources and a demonstrated, stable financial base.

Since then, nonprofits and law enforcement agencies have reported concrete signs of change. The National Sexual Assault Hotline, which is operated by RAINN, the nation's largest anti-sexual violence organization, told HuffPost that the service experienced a 20 percent surge in calls during the program's air dates.
But some Jewish participants object to the organizers' association with Farrakhan. Rabbi Jill Jacobs, executive director of T'ruah: The Rabbinic Call for Human Rights, will not be joining this year's March because it is being held on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath. As an organization, because we represent rabbis and Jewish community members with a range of practices, we, as a rule, don't sponsor any events that happened on Shabbat, she says. She added that Sabbath observances vary, so for sure among our 2,000-plus rabbis, there are definitely a number of rabbis who will be marching.

A good way to understand it is that really, the baby's going to continue to grow even at the expense of the mom's nutrition, Huls said. So, her weight may not change because she's not taking in additional calories. There may be changes to her body that are going to go undetected in a chronic care condition or at a facility like this.
Le pic épidémique Le pic épidémique est le moment où la courbe commence à descendre, c'est-à-dire, quand le nombre de personnes malades ou hospitalisées ou bien encore décédées commencent à diminuer. Le choix de l'indice peut décaler le pic de l'épidémie de plusieurs semaines. Par exemple, le pic des décès, dans le cas du Covid-19, interviendra deux semaines après celui des hospitalisations. Par ailleurs, le plateau épidémie est quelque chose qui n'existe pas comme montré dans la vidéo ci-dessous. Samuel Alizon, directeur de recherche spécialiste des épidémies au CNRS explique au HuffPost: Pour que la courbe soit parfaitement stable, il faudrait que chaque personne malade en contamine exactement une autre. Ça ne me paraît pas réaliste. Même si le pic de l'épidémie finit par être atteint, il est très probable de voir arriver une deuxième vague épidémique dans plusieurs mois.
Queens officials, including Constantinides, have long blamed the plants for the two neighborhoods' high levels of asthma, which earned one part of northern Astoria the nickname Asthma Alley. In 2017, the city council passed legislation requiring the utility operators to stop using No. 6 fuel oil by 2020 and No. 4 oil by 2030. The new bill would be the first to lay the groundwork for phasing out the plants altogether.

Gay men are, as Keuroghlian puts it, primed to expect rejection. We're constantly scanning social situations for ways we may not fit into them. We struggle to assert ourselves. We replay our social failures on a loop. The weirdest thing about these symptoms, though, is that most of us don't see them as symptoms at all. Since he looked into the data, Salway has started interviewing gay men who attempted suicide and survived. When you ask them why they tried to kill themselves, he says, most of them don't mention anything at all about being gay. Instead, he says, they tell him they're having relationship problems, career problems, money problems. They don't feel like their sexuality is the most salient aspect of their lives. And yet, they're an order of magnitude more likely to kill themselves. The term researchers use to explain this phenomenon is minority stress. In its most direct form, it's pretty simple: Being a member of a marginalized group requires extra effort. When you're the only woman at a business meeting, or the only black guy in your college dorm, you have to think on a level that members of the majority don't. If you stand up to your boss, or fail to, are you playing into stereotypes of women in the workplace? If you don't ace a test, will people think it's because of your race? Even if you don't experience overt stigma, considering these possibilities takes its toll over time.
Those responses are a slap in the face to the Black women and girls who have already endured the indignity of Kelly's continued success. Who have already been told, implicitly and explicitly, over and over, that our suffering and our success is less important than that of our male counterparts.
More than half of people who leave their jobs do so because of their relationship with their boss. Smart companies make certain their managers know how to balance being professional with being human. These are the bosses who celebrate an employee's success, empathize with those going through hard times, and challenge people, even when it hurts. Bosses who fail to really care will always have high turnover rates. It's impossible to work for someone eight-plus hours a day when they aren't personally involved and don't care about anything other than your production yield.
Even without a permanent leader, polls are giving the Liberals an edge over Premier Doug Ford's ruling Progressive Conservatives. So this contest could decide who becomes Ontario's next premier.
Winfrey's longtime partner Stedman Graham told the Los Angeles Times Sunday that she would absolutely do it, referring to a presidential run.
While inmate-on-guard violence and understaffing in federal prisons are serious concerns, this type of approach to solving such issues misses the point. Giving prison guards weapons will provide a minimal level of safety. . . if they see the attack coming. But personal experience has shown me that arming prison guards is often a bad idea. For example, shortly after providing select prison guards at the medium-security FCI Petersburg with pepper spray, one of the compound officers accidentally shot herself in the face with the aerosol weapon when playing with it.

After criticism that Mandalay Bay apparently did not check on Paddock's room for a period of time, Disney World resorts changed its do not disturb sign to a room occupied sign and said rooms would be checked by staff at least once a day. A spokeswoman did not link the change to the Vegas mass shooting but told the Review-Journal it did so for safety, security and guest experience.
This is not solely about athlete health ― it is about public health, the statement read. With COVID-19 and the associated risks, it is not safe for our athletes, and the health and safety of their families and the broader Canadian community, for athletes to continue training towards these Games. In fact, it runs counter to the public health advice which we urge all Canadians to follow.
Canada's Ministry of Natural Resources said in a statement to HuffPost Canada that its core responsibility is to get Canada's natural resources to market and support jobs, while balancing Indigenous and local concerns, and climate change action.
It was, for me, a decision of looking at her performance in its entirety, and realizing that if we went in to try to alter it, we inevitably would have to lose some scenes which I thought were scenes that the fans should have ― that people who loved Leia would have, he said. I would never have wanted to lose her conversation with Luke or her conversation with Holdo or the final moment with Rey. Those are just things that I feel like we deserved to have from Leia in this movie, so that included the scenes where she is lying in her chamber unconscious, and [it's] uncomfortable to watch. It's also part of the story.
My toddler son was once driven to the point of a meltdown when a Capitol Police officer took his snack cup out of my bag for closer inspection because of its odd shape on the X-ray machine. My toddler's snack was inspected by a Capitol Police officer for long enough that my son thought he would never get his snack back.
It wasn't clear, however, if anyone entered Paddock's room that day, or, if they did, what they saw.

Occasionally the recovery piece has been challenging because I come home, and after I've had a big workout, I would normally take a nap. But my son's ecstatic and wants to play, so I end up playing through the afternoon and having to go out for the second workout, she added. But overall thanks to the great support, I've been able to manage.

I don't think any of us believe that Iran would have deliberately shot down an aircraft, but the very fact that Iran – believing such a thing could happen – would be allowing normal civilian traffic, I think, tells you something about the nature of that regime and its priorities.

Staver and his organization have made it clear they would rather see LGBTQ people dead without justice than see them alive and acknowledged as fully human.
TORONTO — Ontario businesses had spent $3 billion on permits to pollute under cap and trade when Premier Doug Ford started dismantling the program, five days into his mandate. Then, for about five months, Ontario had no price on pollution, until the federal government's carbon tax came into effect.
It seems to be an attitude change, it really does, Moe said. The outreach from the deputy prime minister to Saskatchewan has been good, it's been appreciated, and it's a relationship we'll be looking forward to continuing in the future.
It's imperative for us to understand that we need our first-line responders, especially those in hospital and clinical settings, to have access to those, Kindrachuck said. People need to have some restraint as well and understand that those supplies are going to be needed by the medical community.

Now let's say you refinance to a slightly lower rate of 5 percent. Your bill would drop to $212. Not a huge difference, sure. But what if you kept paying $222 each month despite the new lower bill? You'd knock off six months and $335 in interest from your loan. Now imagine what would happen if the interest rate difference was even bigger.
Singapore Airlines said Monday that it will slash capacity by 96% and ground nearly its entire fleet at least until the end of April as nations worldwide shutter their borders amidst the coronavirus pandemic.

If you're on a date with a narcissist, they might tell you that they're looking for a life partner, but can't seem to find anyone who's worth investing in, Lancer said.
Austin Murphy, a senior writer at Sports Illustrated, told me it's important to keep moms in football safety conversations because, When the subjects of CTE and football arise, the mothers, it seems, are often the only real adults in the room. Lindsay Gibbs of ThinkProgress, who often writes about sports from the female perspective, told me, Grieving mothers are some of the most powerful forces for positive change in this society … If we're not including these concerned women in conversations about CTE, and involving them in the task of coming up with solutions to this problem, then we are really missing out and doing a disservice to victims.

The central connecting thread between all of the aforementioned morally ambiguous or nihilistic art and so much more in that vein: it was all primarily by and for white men and wistfully imagined worlds where white men were never held to account for anything. — David Klion (@DavidKlion) February 6, 2018
Her father was one of five brothers, all of whom chose to stay in India following the Partition. One sister moved to Pakistan with her husband's family. They learnt how she had suffered from depression and died in a mental health facility in Karachi, almost a decade after her passing.
According to the October 2016 IMF World Economic Outlook, international trade in goods and services has grown at the mediocre rate of around 3% a year since 2012, less than half of the growth of the previous three decades. Between 1985 and 2007, world trade increased, on average, twice as fast as world production, whereas for the past four years it has just kept pace.
The pop star went on to admonish fans for inquiring about her next album instead of encouraging her to speak up about what needs to change in this country.

It's about taking the time to take the time. It's nice being around family. I really appreciate the time when we're all together.
Johnson's trial was the first federal capital trial of a man with an intellectual disability, according to his lawyers. Although federal law at the time prohibited the death sentence for anyone who was mentally retarded — a now-discredited term that was used to describe a range of intellectual disabilities — courts had limited experience dealing with intellectual disability claims.
It would definitely become harder. The Americans are approaching India with the attitude that if you are not going to do this deal now then wait till President Trump gets re-elected. The Americans are saying that then you will be forced to deal with us again and you may not get the terms that we are offering you currently. You can expect Trump to get a little harsher and unconstrained on trade because he is not going to have the pressures of re-election.
Living in physical bodies, this isn't surprising. Despite what mysticism and science tell us to the contrary, despite all that talk in church about the Holy Spirit and the soul, most of us fully believe we're physical beings dwelling in a physical world. So a belief that contentment and a certain degree of happiness can be achieved through the balance of our physical activities isn't illogical. It's just that it doesn't work.

Again, just to be clear: This doesn't discount the value of Milk's drag. She is one of the most avant-garde thinkers Drag Race has ever seen, up there with Sharon Needles, Raja, and Kim Chi. As she reminded us in the premiere, she has literally inspired Drag Race challenges. But whining that she's not getting kudos — and discounting her fellow queens' performances while doing so — is ignoring the ways in which she benefits from her privilege. She gets to stay in the competition and continue to show her unconventional drag, despite her flawed execution of it.
Then, a specific personal incident involving race and discrimination prompted Clark, 34, to write the lyrics for what would become This Land.
4. They Don't Honor Their Commitments
Maybe you'd like some advice from a guy who seems to be making the world his playground.
In Perdue's and Loeffler's telling, a Democratic Senate would rubber stamp a socialist agenda, from ending private insurance and expanding the Supreme Court to adopting wholesale a Green New Deal that would spend trillions and raise taxes on every U.S. household by thousands of dollars each year. Besides misrepresenting Biden's and most Democratic senators' policy preferences, that characterization ignores the reality of the Senate's roster.

In California, people have been wary for decades, of even such a simple thing as discussing marijuana over the phone. So much for freedom of speech, when the cops can tap a dealer's line and record it to use as evidence. Your personal electric bills were open to inspection by the cops as well, to catch grow houses using an inordinate amount of electricity for halogen lights. Cops would roll up on houses with heat-vision devices to see which houses were glowing too hot ― another sign of a grow house. Growers had had to move inside due to the thousands of flights of helicopters overhead, searching for illegal farms. They even tossed out the federal Posse Comitatus Act when they formed CAMP, or the Campaign Against Marijuana Planting, which was a cooperative effort by local, state, and federal troops. In fact, the heavy-handed efforts and outright legal abuses of CAMP were largely responsible for California leading the initial legal pushback against the entire War On Weed. In 1996, California became the first state in the nation to legalize medicinal marijuana, which was the tipping point down the slippery slope towards full legalization we are traveling on today.

Getting to that point will hinge largely on vaccination. The vaccine rollout has been slow thus far, and there is no approved vaccine for children yet. Health officials have said in the past that most adults in the U.S. should have access to the vaccine by the end of June; it's not clear whether we are still on target for that goal.

In an address released on Twitter, Trump said he was outraged by the violence, lawlessness and mayhem a day earlier when a mob that he egged on to protest his election loss stormed the Capitol while lawmakers were certifying President-elect Joe Biden's Electoral College votes. As it was happening, Trump asked them to go home, but doubled down on his stolen election narrative and then said: We love you.

The Eurozone is in a stalemate. A federal union would be needed to fix its problems, but there is no public support for it. Returning to national fiscal responsibility would lead to defaults and exits. Half-way solutions will prove insufficient but expensive and obfuscate the issues. Therefore, there may be no way to avert the partial or complete break-up of the Eurozone in the years to come. The fate of the euro may already have been sealed.

States could also limit access to certain medications, or eliminate Medicaid's retroactive eligibility standard that covers recent medical expenses accumulated by new enrollees prior to signing up, or impose asset tests that block benefits for people who own homes or cars or other property, regardless how low their incomes are.

Management may have a beginning, but it certainly has no end. When you have a talented employee, it's up to you to keep finding areas in which they can improve to expand their skill set. The most talented employees want feedback--more so than the less talented ones--and it's your job to keep it coming. If you don't, your best people will grow bored and complacent.

The draft rule would impose one of the toughest legal standards the government has ever required of a private party – and impose them on lower-income people who lack the means to meet the burdens, whatever the justice of their claims.

Before aggressively paying down your student loans, you should make sure you paid off high-interest debt such as credit cards or personal loans, said Walsh.

Breitburg concedes that addressing global warming can seem daunting, but she says focused local efforts to protect areas can be effective. She points to changes in the Chesapeake Bay, where nitrogen pollution dropped 24 percent from its worst levels after sewage treatment and protections mandated by the Clean Air Act began. Areas of the bay with zero oxygen zones have nearly vanished, according to Breitburg.
Many of Daniel's ideas came from feeling stuck, losing a sense of purpose and being curious of finding his way out. When 40+ potential employers told him 'no', he had a radical response to prove that he was worthy of it all by finding a job in each state.
Similarly, the entry of Elizabeth Warren into the 2020 presidential primaries ― like Bernie Sanders' effort in 2016 ― moves in the direction of politically mobilizing the increasingly broad social disaffection with capitalism.

Installing Wheeler as the nation's 15th EPA chief is a formality. Last month, Wheeler became the longest-serving acting administrator in the EPA's 48-year history, surpassing Bob Perciasepe's roughly five-month stint as acting administrator in 2013. Acting rules for the EPA are vague and have generally gone unchallenged, and some argued Wheeler could have remained in his current role for the rest of Trump's first term.

The key is making ice cream that helps keep him on track. He is, after all, a Labrador whose attention wanders easily. I use mini disposable 5 oz. bath cups you can find at any grocery store. Fill them almost to the rim with low fat plain yogurt, and then mix in a sprinkle of melted peanut butter (melting the peanut butter in the microwave helps you mix it in). Make sure to choose natural, ground peanut butter to avoid giving them too much sugar. (Read the ingredients. It should just say: peanuts.) One regular-sized 32 oz. tub of yogurt makes about 12 small cups. Freeze them overnight. In the morning you can use them to get your pooch to follow you around in figure eights, or any other kind of healthy exercise in your home, for as long as you want. Works like a charm.
The notion that great marriages are not about comfort and security isn't news to those of us who have been married for a while or anyone who has ever been in a stagnant relationship. While the idea that formalizing a commitment to a shared partnership may be news to those who haven't experienced the reality of long term matrimony, if you are in that group of veterans who have learned that this isn't necessarily the case you might be raising your eyebrows right about now or shaking your head. Still you might want to continue reading. You might learn something new.

Never has so much been asked of America's grocery store and meatpacking workers. They are working through a pandemic, getting sick and in some cases even dying so that others can put food on the table. Most of them are doing it for lower wages than other essential workers who continue to do their jobs as coronavirus cases balloon.
Of course, this was obvious to anyone who has been paying the slightest bit of attention, since California was not the first such state to take such a radical step. Colorado and Washington have enjoyed legal recreational marijuana sales for years now, and Oregon and Alaska weren't far behind. California is part of the third wave of states to fully legalize, along with Nevada, Massachusetts, and Maine. Over 21 percent of the nation's population lives in these eight states ― over one-fifth of American citizens can now buy marijuana without fear of legal consequences or retribution, in other words. All of these states are now openly defying federal law, which states that marijuana is still always illegal, for all purposes, everywhere in the United States.

A concerning parallel between COVID-19 and climate change is how unprepared our governments are to respond to disaster, and how those with the most resources are much better able to weather the storm and recover while BIPOC and low-income communities are left defenseless. The failure in our response to the pandemic reflects the gaps in disaster response we have witnessed in moments of climate emergencies like hurricanes, wildfires and heat waves, and foreshadows how we will respond to disaster in the future unless we address systemic inequality.

The findings offer something of a thought exercise ― and a warning: Either jump-start the carbon removal industry with generous government support now, or risk playing desperate triage in the hotter, chaotic decades to come. At the moment, the technology is primarily produced by two companies ― Carbon Engineering, based in Canada, and Climeworks, headquartered in Switzerland ― that depend on working with major polluters. Carbon Engineering took money from oil giant Occidental Petroleum. Climeworks struck a deal to supply the Coca-Cola Co., the world's biggest source of plastic pollution, with CO₂ for beverage carbonation.

West Virginia, in particular, is working exclusively through small, independently owned pharmacies. That turned out to be a smart move because the independent pharmacies already had strong working relationships with the long-term care facilities. And that enabled them to deal with logistical issues quickly, starting with the need to get consent from patients or (when patients have diminished capacity) their families.

It's all connected though, I think. If you can't do the hard work of putting aside your own selfishness in the earlier years, what do the later years look like? It took 62 years to build what they had, and I understand that. But if there's one thing I've learned, it's that maybe the little things are actually the big things. Honesty and integrity start with lending a helping hand and showing respect and saying I'm sorry and meaning it. If I knew then what I know now. But isn't that always how it goes?

Millions of lives depend on getting the coronavirus response right — and so does the economic and social health of communities around the world, Bloomberg, a former 2020 presidential candidate, said in a statement.
As long as Trump continues to talk about running — whether or not he actually winds up doing so — it will likely make it difficult for other 2024 hopefuls, particularly those who seek to run as Trump's heir by appealing to the racial and cultural grievances that are Trump's specialty.
Whereas the national carbon tax is structured to escalate over time, Pallister indicated that he believes any tax should be flat and low like the Prairie horizon.
Zinke repeated this defense in a parting interview last month with Fox News' Bret Baier.
Public health experts and eventually the Biden transition team called for changing that practice, on the theory that vaccine supply will probably be steady enough to provide second doses on time without holding any back now. The Trump administration apparently agreed and, just this week, called for releasing the second doses.
By 2050, the study found, a direct air capture program expanded with that kind of money could remove 2 to 2.5 gigatons of CO₂ per year. Estimates from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the leading global climate forecasting body, vary on how much CO₂ needs to be removed from the atmosphere annually to keep warming in check, but most models suggest a figure close to 6 gigatons per year by midcentury. The rest would need to be made up with newly planted forests and styles of soil cultivation that trap carbon underground. (There is some debate among carbon removal researchers about whether that much will, in fact, be necessary.)
Francis Scott Key wrote the Star Spangled Banner, not as a national anthem, but in homage to the defense of Ft McHenry in the War of 1812.. The song was a parody, meaning it used the tune of another song and superimposed new lyrics. Parodies were very popular at the time. In this case, Kay used the tune of an old drinking song, from a men's club in London. It wasn't until 1931 that the song became the official national anthem of the US.

Hughes tried last year to go for what he called the big lift of comprehensive tax reform, but he was stymied. He thinks the extra revenue gives more momentum to his efforts in 2018. But Senate President Wayne Niederhauser, also a Republican, said he wanted to wait for deeper analysis of the impact of the tax overhaul from state financial officials.
These new strains aren't unexpected. RNA viruses, they make a living out of mutating, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, has said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that SARS-CoV-2 acquires one new mutation in its genome roughly every two weeks, although those mutations do not necessarily change how the virus functions.
USA Gym Board of Directors executive leadership ― Chairman Paul Parilla, Vice Chairman Jay Binder & Treasurer Bitsy Kelley ― tendered their resignations, effective Jan. 21, 2018, a tweet from the organization on Monday says. The Board of Directors will identify an interim chairperson until a permanent selection is named. The announcement comes during Nassar's sentencing hearing on 10 counts of first-degree sexual misconduct, which began Jan. 16 and will end later this week. The former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University team doctor has been accused of sexually abusing over 140 young girls under the guise of medical treatment over the course of two decades.
After winning both of Georgia's runoff Senate races and taking back the Senate after six long years, Democrats have a window of opportunity to undo some of President Donald Trump's anti-regulation legacy.
In this respect, the period between 2012 and 2016 will have been particularly volatile in terms of world trade, resulting from the collapse of oil and commodity prices. The IMF notes that this fall itself resulted in a 10.5% contraction of all international trade in 2015, when looking at all products.

You would be forgiven for thinking that brand experiences have their work cut out in a world that seems obsessed with 'frictionless' experiences. But in fact, the most memorable real-world experiences have a little bit of friction built in. AirBnB for example took the conscious decision to design in a little friction. They removed their role in managing any issues between hosts and guests. Counter-intuitively this direct connection of guests and hosts deepened satisfaction scores across both. Similarly, brands like Amazon recognise they have a problem with this because interactions with them are so fluid that people aren't actually engaging with the brand. Amazon themselves say they need to build in more of a human touch.
I wanted to tell people outside of my closest circle about the way she hung my shelves, the way she brought me three bouquets of flowers when one would suffice, the time she rang the doorbell of our own house because she was willing to take a risk for me.
When it comes to the question of $2,000 payments and more comprehensive COVID-19 relief, such as expanded unemployment benefits and aid to state and local governments, progressives stand to serve as allies of Biden against both Republicans and the handful of conservative Democrats who are already indicating that they plan to break with Biden on the urgency of economic action.
Lazar, who since joined the Arizona Lincoln Project leadership team as a volunteer, encouraged @SuspendThePres' over 54,000 followers to report rule-violating tweets. Over the course of the last eight months, Lazar previously told HuffPost, the account was flagged four times for posting what Twitter described as tweets glorifying violence and posting misleading information about voting. In each instance, the offending tweets were deleted by the platform and the account was temporarily locked.
Here's what she means by that: Even in hyper-realistic dreams like false awakenings, there's usually one element that tips you off that you're not actually awake. It might be an item that's completely out of place in your house or a person who you never run into on your way to work. Look for the most bizarre part of it and don't dismiss it, she says. This outlying element isn't just a sign that you're dreaming — it's also a clue as to why you're having this kind of dream in the first place.
China said Thursday that it had no new local infections of the novel coronavirus from the previous day, a major turning point in the unprecedented effort to beat back the disease. Thirty-four new cases of the virus were reported, but they all involved people who had come to China from other locations. The New York Times notes that experts say the country would have to record no new local infections for 14 days before the outbreak could officially be declared over.
The federal government provides health coverage to nearly as many people as all employers combined, through programs like Medicare and Medicaid, and Uncle Sam even lacks the clout to push health care providers to change the way they do things.
In some ways, though, the most revealing policy changes of Trump's first year are the ones that affect the very groups he always claims to champion.

3 - YOUR 'WHY' IS UNCLEAR
The legislation calls for researching at least six different types of batteries to store excess wind or solar power for times when the wind doesn't blow and the sun isn't shining. That would, in theory, offer the increased energy reliability needed to replace a network of gas-fired peaker plants on the New York waterfront. Those plants provide backup power when demand is high or there's a malfunction at power stations upstate.
The truth is that being angry often feels good. It's a release, a molten carapace to put up against the continual indignities of lives lived paycheck-to-paycheck or in the shadow of old age or even merely in the knowledge that others are richer and stronger than you are. It's easy, then, to turn on others who are poorer and weaker, or who are unfamiliar, who can be turned into dangerous specters whose banishment would change your life completely for the better.

Our analysis indicates that we are already approaching a scenario in which every hot summer, with or without an El Niño event, has the potential to cause bleaching and mortality at a regional scale, the authors write. The future condition of reefs, and the ecosystem services they provide to people, will depend critically on the trajectory of global emissions.

Americans are growing more concerned by the day about the spread of the new coronavirus in the U.S., a new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds, with the share who say they've been personally affected rising rapidly within the past week. Attitudes toward the outbreak and to the government response, however, remain sharply divided along partisan lines.

Those centers are already starting to be established across the country, everywhere from Detroit to rural Tennessee to Southern California. (Officials just started giving shots at Disneyland.) The incoming Biden administration has pledged to support even more of these centers ― and to secure yet more funding, above and beyond the $8 billion that was part of the COVID-19 relief package that Congress passed and Trump signed in December.

The revelation was made by a hotel representative responding to questions from the Las Vegas Review-Journal concerning reports that Paddock had hung a do not disturb sign on his door for three days as he prepared for his massacre. The hotel has come under fire for apparently failing to check on a guest who turned out to be a mass killer.
And the WFP endorsement crystalized a residual sense from the 2016 election that Sanders had not yet mollified critics in the activism community who considered him unduly articulate about and focused on questions of racial justice. His groan-inducing remarks at the She the People conference in Houston for women of color in April and his absence at the Netroots Nation conference in Philadelphia in July contributed to a sense that Sanders had missed his moment. While those activists do not directly affect votes in the early primary and caucus states, they are influential in liberal organizations and websites that help shape perceptions of candidates.
And second, we need clear, standardized metrics that we can use to track a company's progress. We titled our book Accountable because we believe that's the only way we'll see real progress — when we're better able to hold companies and investors accountable for the impact they have on society.
Biden's team is keenly aware of the stakes. The president-elect will travel to Atlanta on Monday, the eve of the runoffs, to campaign with Ossoff and Warnock for the second time in three weeks. Biden's campaign aides have helped raise millions to boost the party infrastructure that helped Biden become the first Democratic presidential nominee since 1992 to carry the state. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will campaign Sunday in Savannah.
If you say yes because you have FOMO, or say yes because it's what you think you should be doing, you will always come up short. You will feel lost. Dissatisfied. Resentful and the only way through is to follow this trail to the root, and get really honest.
When a fault is immature - that is, producing earthquakes for less than a few millions years - its segments are clearly disconnected so that it is mechanically difficult for an earthquake rupture to travel from one segment to the next. But as the fault produces more and more earthquakes over time and hence becomes more mature, its segments connect more and more to each other. When the segment connection is more complete, a new rupture can progress forward more easily along the fault.
I am feeling sick and scared I have the coronavirus. What should I do?
The uses of rage have been eloquently addressed in three separate books by female authors this year: Rebecca Traister, Soraya Chemaly and Brittney Cooper, in their works lauding the fearsome power of rage among women, tapped the seething seam of anger that is echoing through the electorate on all sides of the aisle.

It's alarming to hear that individuals have had severe reactions to COVID-19 vaccination, but the percentage of people who have had those responses is low. In late December, the CDC said it was looking at about 21 cases of anaphylaxis (a life-threatening immune response) after more than 1.8 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine had been given out.

Being with her felt so lovely, but we agreed we would take some time, to keep it secret, to guard it from the outside world. It was more my rule than hers, but as someone who processes all of my thoughts out loud, I was the one who had harder a time not telling the people closest to us.
In many ways, yes. The Obama administration while leaving talked about India getting status as a major defence partner. In 2016, the Trump administration put that into policy. It's not been grounded in legislative precedent yet. The bill on that has not yet been voted upon, but the executive branch led by Trump has put that into force already.
There's definitely a way of making serious movies about serious things. I think that really bypasses the experience of a lot of people. A lot of nasty things happen in beautiful places. This is a movie about appearances being deceptive. And so it made sense to me that it would look and sound appealing. And from a practical point of view, I didn't want to make something didactic. We set out to make something that would stand on its own two feet as a thriller, as a dark comedy, as a romance. When I sent the script out to people, I sent it with a playlist featuring Britney Spears and Paris Hilton and with mood boards of how it would look. I wanted to be very clear that it wouldn't feel dour, it wouldn't feel preachy, and it would not let anyone off the hook.
Ariel Edwards-Levy/HuffPost The share of Americans who are very concerned about the virus has climbed in past weeks.
Speaking shortly after Trump's prime-time Oval Office speech, Sanders listed the 30 million Americans without health insurance, the millions of senior citizens in desperate poverty and the 40 million young Americans trying to deal with outrageous debt as issues meriting a White House declaration of a national emergency.

It can be tempting this year to feel defeated by what has been laid to waste, to be trapped in the fear, anger, hatred and rage that swirls within and around us. We need to be strong and to take care so as not to become these feelings, to not become corrupted by all that we seek to change.
Since he was first elected governor in 2012, Inslee repeatedly championed incentives for electric vehicles, with the goal of getting 50,000 on Washington state roads by 2020. In 2016, he became the first governor to issue an executive order capping carbon dioxide emissions. A glowing profile published last week in The Atlantic credited Inslee with pursuing arguably the most progressive and greenest agenda in the country, with fields of solar panels, fleets of electric buses, and massive job growth to show for it.

For me, the destinations that draw me back are the ones where I feel a connection with the place or the culture, a need to explore more and dive beneath the surface, said Alex Reynolds, travel blogger at Lost With Purpose. Beautiful tourist sights are well and good, but it's the welcome you get from the local people that leaves a true lasting impression. I can finish checking a bucket list of sights, but I can never stop learning about people and their cultures.

Jeremy Corbyn's mission to hand more power to Labour members has received a major boost after the party's ruling body agreed his sweeping reform plans. The leader's plan to 'democratise' the party was approved by the National Executive Committee (NEC) on Tuesday, and will now go forward for a vote at the annual conference in Brighton. Under the changes, party members are set to get three extra seats on the 35-strong body, with an extra place for trade unions too. The move will further embed Corbyn's vision for Labour and underline its leftward direction since he became leader in 2015, attracting more than 250,000 new members to the party. His reform package, which included a plan to reduce MPs' veto over future leadership contenders, was adopted by the NEC with no opposition. A wider review of party structures, to be led by former MP Katy Clark, will now take place with everything from one-member-one-vote leadership rules to regional structures and new policy-making powers. The only reform not on the review list is mandatory reselection of MPs.
Republicans gained two Senate seats in November, giving them a 53-47 majority in the new year. That means Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) can now afford to lose a handful of GOP votes as he forges ahead with drastically reshaping the courts.

A day when every adult is totally and utterly free to pursue happiness through the medium of marijuana, should they so choose. And, as I began, the sky has yet to fall. January 1, 2018 has entered the history books in California as a day of liberation for millions, because they no longer need fear the racist, misguided, and tyrannical attempts by government to limit the freedom the Declaration of Independence says we are all born to enjoy. The times they certainly are a-changing, out here in the Golden State.

Did you realize that as you were indulging in your weekly fix of Fox's Empire that you were really hooked on a modernized adaptation of King Lear? Or that Disney's The Lion King is essentially a retelling of Hamlet? Don't even get me started on the number of films that are rooted in Romeo and Juliet. It's amazing that Shakespeare's works from centuries ago still have such relevance for us today. But such is the way of true art. It transcends time.
Dissent and politics runs in the family, said Varma. Their father's brother S.M. Jafar was a renowned freedom fighter in Lucknow, who had worked alongside Mohandas Gandhi and Subhash Chandra Bose.

Their great grandfather was Sir Syed Wazir Hasan, a prominent jurist who served as the Chief Justice of the Awadh Court.
He promised to block all new fossil fuel infrastructure, including a controversial pipeline currently under construction in Brooklyn, and vowed to ban all gas hookups in newly built and renovated construction. He called the city's network of roughly a dozen gas- and oil-burning power plants relics of the past, and that's where I'll put them, and promised a fleet of electric buses and subway improvements. He said he'd implement a standing proposal to shutter the infamous prison on Rikers Island and convert the facility to a solar farm and target aid to communities that suffered the worst excesses of both polluters and policing.
Dr. Laura Mercer, a clinical assistant professor and OB-GYN clerkship director at the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix, said documenting a menstrual cycle is as important as recording other vital signs and bodily functions.

Here's what Wall Street doesn't want you to know and is terrified you will find out. Only about 2 percent of active fund managers generate statistically significant alpha (excess returns over their risk-adjusted benchmark). There's no reliable way to identify these fund managers prospectively. Even if you could do so, once the impact of taxes is taken into account, it is unlikely even these funds would beat the after-tax returns of low-management-fee index funds.

Privacy experts had filed a series of petitions in the Indian Supreme Court warning of precisely such a scenario, where the mandatory seeding of Aadhaar in everything from airport boarding systems, to election IDs, to opening bank accounts, to buying mobile connections, to marriage registrations, would allow the Indian government to create a massive surveillance database akin to the Social Registry System.
How the campaign team dealt with that and other issues was studied as part of an external review conducted by former Conservative cabinet minister John Baird.

White House national security adviser John Bolton met for roughly two hours with his Turkish counterpart Ibrahim Kalin and other senior officials at Ankara's presidency complex. Bolton relayed Trump's insistence that Turkey refrain from attacking Kurdish forces that fought alongside U.S. troops against the Islamic State group, a guarantee Turkey appeared unwilling to grant.
I think it depends on what you are spending it on. Obviously if you are spending on education, that's probably a good thing. If you are spending it on a lot of vacations because you are afraid you might not travel again after you have children, you might want to be a little more conscious of putting money aside. It really comes down to what the expenditures are.
What's happening right now is very typical for any sort of crisis, in terms of women mobilizing to be first responders, taking on the care work, she said.
If you're just doing this in your workplace retirement account, you're going to have to look at what's there. It's not like you get a choice of what's in your fund. But if you're doing money on your own, usually the best places to go are Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, they're usually the ones with the lowest fees. But you're going to have to look. You can look these up in Morningstar, can look them up online. And again, index funds are generally the lowest fees.
King told If Beale Street Could Talk director Barry Jenkins that after seeing the James Baldwin adaptation, her son remarked it was the first time that he really saw himself. She also pledged that everything she produced would be 50 percent women, a nod to a new initiative from the Time's Up movement that pushes all industries to fill half their leadership roles with women.
Unfortunately, while our world-class athletes are willing to push themselves to their athletic limits in pursuit of Olympic success, the likelihood that they will be able to properly train in a safe and adequate environment, and replicate the excellence we have all come to expect, does not appear likely in the midst of this global crisis, CEO Max Seigel said.
So go ahead; vent your spleen. Give yourself the tiny shred of comfort that comes from claiming your long-simmering, now-validated disdain. Take the opportunity to try, once again, to have a real debate about the artistic merit of works like Kill Bill and Manhattan. It's a first step to envisioning a world that isn't just rid of monsters, but that actually offers everyone an equal place in constructing our culture.
There are also questions on subjects ranging from why the individual wants to be leader of the party, whether they've ever advocated for a separatist movement within Canada, or have ever been accused of or engaged in activities that promote discrimination or hatred.
My mobility was limited during my pregnancy due to placenta previa, several previous miscarriages and acute bronchitis. Running to the emergency room every month because I was bleeding forced my husband and I to expedite our wedding plans, from two years down to a few months, as we tried to accept the harsh reality that I might not survive after a mandatory Cesarean.
In March of last year, the Census Bureau reported that by 2045, white people in America would be the minority, comprising 49.7 percent of the population. A few weeks later, the Commerce Department announced that for the first time in 70 years, the constitutionally mandated census would include a question about citizenship status. With Trump leading the Republican Party's crusade against minorities, immigrants and the working poor, the decision to tamper with the census sure looks like a clear effort to lower the response rate and undermine the accuracy of the count.

Distrust is endemic in the economy. If you look at survey data, ask people, Do you trust big corporations? and 3 out of 4 people don't, and 4 out of 5 people don't trust business leaders to be ethical or to tell the truth.
But the prospect of losing him rallied activists to his cause.
3. Give yourself a time out.
US coffee chain Starbucks said on Saturday that it was closing all its outlets in Hubei province for the week-long Lunar New Year holiday, following a similar move by McDonald's in five Hubei cities.

A Jan. 29 memo from senior White House aide Peter Navarro accurately predicted some of the challenges faced by the U.S. from what would become a pandemic, though he was hardly the first to sound the alarm. But he, like Pottinger, was viewed by others in the White House as a China hawk and their concerns were rejected by others in the administration who did not bring them to the president.
What can you do to bring lightness into the dark moments that life sometimes presents? Do you have a strategy for challenging episodes? How practically can a blessing of Light make a difference?
On Thursday, The New York Times reported that Trump has been discussing pardoning himself before he leaves office. Presidential pardons only apply to federal crimes, and it is unclear whether the courts would uphold a self-pardon. But whether or not he actually does this, the fact that he is considering it at all is telling. Trumpism is inextricably linked with perceived impunity. Take, destroy, leave death in your wake. Forgive yourself and move on without consequence.

The report didn't ultimately advocate a 32-hour week for all because as executive director Joyce Maroney tells HuffPost, I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all model. But amid stiff competition for talent, she thinks employers should be open to new thinking, especially in careers where home working isn't realistic. The responsibility of employers is to get clarity; what are achievable goals for our firm, how can we help people balance their physical wellness and needs out of work with productivity goals? That's particularly true, she argues, for a sandwich generation juggling childcare and elderly parents.
Organizers behind the amendment have insisted, however, that it is self-executing and neither the governor nor lawmakers may alter it.
Most people fail to keep their resolutions because they don't set the right goals from the outset. If your resolution is focused on something negative (such as bad habits or perceived weaknesses) or what you think you should be doing, I have bad news. You're going to become frustrated, quit and end up right back where you started on January 1, 2017.
A Liberal government should focus on improving wellbeing instead of growing the economy, like the governments of New Zealand and Iceland have, Graham said.
It shows that in a world of frictionless digital experiences, sometimes it's the real-world human touches that really make a difference. Experiential is King in 2017.
Germany has 27,289 confirmed cases and 115 deaths so far, according to data tracked by Johns Hopkins University, making it one of the harder hit countries in the world, behind China, Italy, the U.S. and Spain.
Wheeler's promotion was expected. Trump announced plans to nominate Wheeler to the job in November. Wheeler, the former deputy administrator, told The New York Times that month that he felt he was making a difference.
The complications from Mom's fall escalate. An infection, blood levels out of whack, little appetite, and on it goes. All of it adds up to this: Our mother is not progressing. She is slipping, losing traction, on a downward slide.
CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the song referenced in Newsweek's tweet. It is called Abraham, Martin and John.

Fox News host Ainsley Earhardt told New York Post columnist and Fox News contributor Michael Goodwin that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) wants to tax his paycheck at 70 percent, when that's not what the congresswoman has proposed at all.
Previous studies, including a 2008 paper in The American Journal of Human Genetics, have identified some genetic differences between identical twins.
Previously at BuzzFeed, Arielle publicly shared her weight loss journey in a super relatable article that went viral. If you're working on fitness this year, it's well worth a read.

In December, Warner Bros. announced that it will release all of its movies, including major titles like Dune and Matrix 4, simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max for a period of one month, signaling a major sea change in the industry and angering a slew of high-profile directors in the process.
It's not so much of a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more of a question of exactly when this will happen, she said.
Trump and his allies say those numbers don't matter, because the tax cut will mean higher wages and more jobs ― both of which will benefit American workers. And lately Trump has been touting news of one-time bonuses that companies are offering, supposedly because of the tax cut, as vindication of the GOP argument.
If Pence fails to act, Democratic leaders warned they are prepared to proceed with impeachment. The Wall Street Journal, a leading voice of the conservative establishment, also called for Trump's resignation if not his impeachment.
After Francis Church and the New York Sun, I want to say, Yes, (saint) Nicholas, there is a Virgin -- as certainly as love and generosity and devotion exist. Just not as supposed by your conversation partner in your New York Times column of Christmas Day.

Earlier in the week, he addressed the controversy on social media, where he's amassed more than 6 million followers.
You can't control your ex, his attorney, or the family court system. But you can control your own actions, so be mindful of your thoughts and choices. Set intentions for what you need to do now — file a child support modification or e-mail your ex about therapy for your child — and don't obsess about what will or won't happen. White-knuckling your way to the future will take you out of the present and keep you from enjoying non-divorce-related activities.
Anadolu Agency via Getty Images ROME, ITALY - MARCH 11: People wear protective masks in the Piazza Navona in Rome, Italy, on March 11, 2020. Italian government has extended restrictions which was previously limited in the northern Italy, to countrywide with an aim of the Covid-19 outbreak prevention.
Responding to Rhodium's analysis, May Boeve, executive director of climate advocacy group 350.org, stressed that the Trump administration energy and environmental policies come with consequences.
On Wednesday, the House of Representatives voted 232-197 in favor of Trump's impeachment and ahead of the debate, Pelosi arrived in a familiar dark suit.
As countries drastically reduce entry into their territories, and restrictions around international air travel are introduced, refugee resettlement is being subject to disruptions, said Melanie Gallant, spokeswoman for the UNHCR in Canada. To respond to this new reality, UNHCR and IOM will be temporarily postponing refugee resettlement departures.
I heard one case — don't over-panic on this — they were purchasing swim goggles because they're concerned about face protection, the governor added. Others were just going out and getting gloves from traditional hardware stores and grocery stores. That's not acceptable under these circumstances.
She added: A healthy relationship does not mean you need to be with that person 24/7.
Graham's comments are significant, given that he has been one of the president's biggest allies in Congress, steadfastly urging him not to back down on the wall or else risk an end to his presidency. A three-week continuing resolution signals a walk-back from that hard-line position.
But that idea is totally at odds with the structure of a modern economy, of the benefits of economies of scale, the benefits of trade. We have to take the economy we have and the corporations we have and make them more accountable rather than try and turn back the clock to a time that won't return.
In the United States, roughly 1 in 3 women who give birth do so via cesarean section, making it the most common surgery performed in the country today. In some cases, C-sections are absolutely necessary and life-saving. But in others, doctors who recommend a C-section have deemed a labor risky simply because it is taking too long. Indeed, slow labor is the most common reason given for a woman's first C-section — and women who have one C-section are more likely to go on and have another.
I will not be participating in a project to overturn the election, Sasse wrote in a lengthy social media post.
If you decide to share, consider describing your long-term symptoms, too ― not just those you had at the height of your illness. This can be especially validating for long-term COVID-19 survivors, whose symptoms are generally less discussed in media coverage, as well as useful for researchers and doctors, who are still trying to figure the virus out.
Sandra: I have to fall in love with each and every project in order to be able to design them. It's the 'getting happy with it' stage, a line borrowed from one of my favorite movies Something's Gotta Give. It's when the truth of the space becomes apparent and I can't work on anything else until I capture the essence of the design.
The list of around 70 titles, revealed Tuesday, includes blockbuster projects like Dwayne Johnson's action comedy Red Notice, which also stars Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot, and Zack Snyder's zombie heist movie Army of the Dead. Netflix will also release the Adam McKay-directed Don't Look Up — boasting a starry cast including Jennifer Lawrence, Leonardo DiCaprio, Ariana Grande, Timothee Chalamet and Meryl Streep — the long-awaited Amy Adams vehicle The Woman in the Window, and the Jay-Z-produced all Black Western The Harder They Fall.
I remember running into an acquaintance a few months after my grandmother passed, and she asked me if my grandad was meeting women yet with plans of another wife. I didn't even know what to say to that. He is in his eighties and spent a lifetime with her. There are tears in his eyes still when he talks about her sometimes, and there was not yet grass fully on her grave. Is this really how people do it now? They just skip all the hard parts and move on to the next distraction?
Recently, we've seen a disturbing increase in incidents where airline passengers have disrupted flights with threatening or violent behavior. These incidents have stemmed both from passengers' refusals to wear masks and from recent violence at the U.S. Capitol. This dangerous behavior can distract, disrupt and threaten crew members' safety functions, FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said in a video released by the agency on Thursday.
It is also the case that the Supreme Court poses an existential threat to democracy itself due to the 6-3 hyperpartisan, conservative majority that runs that institution. We have to expand the courts to unrig our democracy.
For the first five years of my life, I was sent overseas to live in Japan while my parents worked long hours in the restaurant in Dallas. In Yokohama, my mother's sister and her Japanese husband had no children and they cared for me as their own. They were loving and doting, but the price of their guardianship was the constant daily reminder that I would eventually need to return the favor. Will you feed us someday? Will you bathe us when we are old? Can we live with you? Look at everything we do for you. Look at how much we love you ― do you love us, too?
But perhaps the most tweetable moment of the night happened when she ran over to the cast of Crazy Rich Asians and a love-fest ensued:

I had poured my heart and soul into this event, and I left that evening with a sense of accomplishment, knowing that my parents understood the day had been orchestrated for them ― my ultimate gift in appreciating all they have done for me.
Kate Middleton's younger brother, James Middleton, opened up about his struggle with clinical depression in a moving essay for the Daily Mail published Friday.
As recently as Tuesday, the White House had detailed on how taxpayers would be able to defer tax payments but had said that tax day itself would stay the same. All you have to do is file your taxes; you'll automatically not get charged interest in penalties, Mnuchin said during that coronavirus briefing.
Had USA Gymnastics not conceded to the requirements, the USOC would have terminated its status as a national governing body.
2017 was the third warmest year since records began in 1910, with a national mean temperature of 22.76 degrees Celsius (about 73 Fahrenheit), or 0.95 degree Celsius hotter than the nation's long-term average, the Bureau of Meteorology said in its annual climate statement.
Randall-Gay, then 17, told officers that Nassar's treatment was unlike the back massages she had been receiving in physical therapy for scoliosis.
If you're more about saving as much money as possible, you might want to give the debt avalanche a shot. With this method, you throw the largest payment you can at your highest-interest-rate debt every month, while paying the minimum payments on your other debts. By focusing on interest rates rather than the balances, you save more money overall.
Quiros, a risk assessment engineer in construction has worked on environmental issues through the UNEP Lifecycle Initiative since 2002. Last year, I went to the World Resources Forum in Arequipa. I thought, what a drive this institute has, bringing together academia, businesses and actually pushing to change minds. In the regional conference next year, she will focus her efforts on the construction industry: the construction sector involves so many resources and stakeholders, it seemed like a logical partnership.
If you had to write one paragraph that summed up what you want your life or your life's work to be about how would it read? Right there is your why.
If you answered yes to all these questions, then perhaps this article isn't for you. However, if you're like most people I know, you have experienced some disappointments or rejection along the way. Things like not getting what you want, not being invited to an interview, not getting the deal, or not being accepted to the dream school or sports team are some examples of how we experience rejection.
Two years ago, De-Grace Omari looked at her Instagram feed and realized something unnerving: All the influencers and models she followed were thin (or slim-thick, the new feminine body ideal) and either white women or light-skinned women of color.
The administration has aggressively rolled back environmental and climate regulations, including President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan, a policy limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. At Interior, Zinke overturned an Obama-era moratorium on new coal leases on federal land, scrapped a hydraulic fracturing rule meant to better protect public health and curtailed a rule limiting the amount of methane that can be released from oil and gas operations on federal and Native American lands.
Israel's success starts with its national health system, in which every single citizen belongs to one of four large, nonprofit health maintenance organizations. These HMOs, which are different from their American analogues in many respects, do not merely pay for care. They provide it directly. They also have cutting-edge data and communications systems in place.
Sarsour added: Our motto eventually will be: In 2020, let's play a competitive primary. And whoever emerges as the candidate who will go up against this administration, that's going to be the candidate of the movement. I don't care who you are, where you are. For me, it's anybody but Trump.
This investment has much in common with collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), which fell into disrepute as a primary cause of the financial crisis. Bespoke tranche opportunities appear to be similar in concept. The change in name is simply a marketing ploy.

The White House vehemently denied the characterization in a statement to 60 Minutes and slammed the lawmaker for her sheer ignorance.
Dr. Michael Ingber, who is board-certified in urogynecology, told HuffPost Finds that people should make sure CBD lube comes from a reputable company. One of the most popular brands among his patients is Foria.
More than 6 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been given so far in the United States. Many health care workers and other high-risk individuals have now received both doses, which means they're one step closer to getting their lives back.

For the study, researchers with NOAA, California State University and Worldwide Fund for Nature Australia examined two populations of green sea turtles living in the northern and southern part of the Great Barrier Reef.
Do one thing every day that scares you. Some days that might just be saddling up. When you get a fluttering, butterfly feeling in your gut as you pick up the phone to make a call to a potential client, saddle up, you are in the right place. As you sign up for that business conference that costs more than any educational training that you have ever attended, congratulations again for saddling up, you are heading in the right direction. When you make a commitment to better the relationships in your life and that involves telling someone close to you, your real feelings, saddle up and share your feelings.
In the end, winning jobs create employees that want the best for the organization and its customers, a win for everyone involved.
Former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, Black Voters Matter co-founder LaTosha Brown and other prominent Black women organizers were especially praised for their consistent work on the ground to register and empower voters across the state.
8. They Fail to Engage Their Creativity
West Coast Creative Director at Homepolish
In my view, the goal of Wall Street -- under the guise of managing your money -- is to maximize the transfer of your assets to itself and to avoid regulation that would hinder its attempt to do so. It succeeds in these efforts through massive contributions to congressional campaigns. In 2014, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), a securities industry trade group, was the top contributor on Wall Street to these campaigns, investing more than $7.4 million.
The New Georgia Project has teamed up with Unite Here and BlackPAC for a massive field organizing and door-knocking project in the state. Mills said the union has employed more than 1,000 laid-off hospitality workers as canvassers who have knocked on more than 1.1 million doors.
Cheap electricity and free water is a godsend he said at the time. People forget that Kejriwal was a newcomer in politics. He fights, he falls, but he does something.
For the Black Lives Matter protests over the summer, the National Guard was activated almost immediately. One of the most chilling sights from that time was the heavily armed, unmarked federal agents in military uniforms throughout the city.
Tips for the perfect pot stirs:
The following year, another resident in the group home talked Johnson into helping him steal a paycheck from another teen. Johnson was sentenced to 20 days at Rikers Island as a youth offender.
This, my friends, is something I hope always sticks.
But that doesn't mean the criticism didn't exist.
We are effectively putting in place what is called a Level Three travel advice, he told reporters on Friday.
Samberg went on to note that several of the show's most memorable moments in recent years involved winners using rousing acceptance speeches to make powerful calls to action, like Meryl Streep in 2017 and Oprah Winfrey last year.
Jonathan Ernst / Reuters President-elect Joe Biden jokingly thanks Georgia for certifying his victory three times as he campaigns on behalf of Democratic Senate candidates Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock in Atlanta on Monday.
It's becoming more common these days to move from job to job fairly frequently. So then you end up with multiple 401(k) accounts. Is that something that you should be thinking about or be worried about?
Here are lighting and ergonomic experts' tips on how to best optimize the power of the sun at your work station:
Some of the trouble has been bipartisan ― plenty of states with Democratic governors pursued premature reopenings over the summer and have struggled with testing and now vaccinations. Some of it is the result of decades of economic non-policy that left the United States uniquely vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. But it is hard to imagine that Biden could do worse than the Trump administration's raving, dishonest incompetence.
I have been in the Capitol when disabled protesters were literally dragged out of their wheelchairs and swiftly arrested for protesting after the Capitol Police deftly blocked the hallway where they had gathered. My children asked why so many people in wheelchairs were handcuffed and guarded so heavily when they would not be able to hurt anyone or run away. I had no answers for them.

The polling ― conducted between Dec. 17 and Dec. 27 by the left-leaning think tank Data for Progress and shared exclusively with HuffPost ― shows particularly strong support for a Green New Deal among women in the suburban portions of the Nassau County district abutting the New York City borough of Queens.
Dear friends of mine have a very challenging family condition. I never hear them bemoaning their lot. They are light-hearted and always find something to laugh about. They are a joy to spend time with.
Well, The Last Jedi was released in December 2017, and, as a result, we learned that Leia will live on in the franchise, despite Fisher's death. There were, however, a few moments in the film that stood out as possible (maybe even unintentional) nods to the actress' passing.
The old maxim, There are no Stupid Questions, may help artists turn a seemingly thoughtless remark into a learning opportunity, helping someone who might be intimidated by art into a potential collector at some point (maybe, right now) or just letting visitors know that artists are normal people like themselves.
Some for-profit schools do a good job. But there's enormous evidence that many for-profit schools, getting billions in federal aid, have engaged in deceptive and fraudulent practices and that many students have been left with terrible outcomes, including insurmountable debt. That's the problem.
One team said they used to have a same two-hour meeting every Monday. They now have a 30-minute meeting every two weeks. There's a really good indication of what you could do differently if you had the power, he recalls.
Forging personal relationships can be tremendously powerful. I've personally traveled to Italy 10 times, said Vogele. Seven of those 10 times I've made at least a pit stop in Bologna because what started as an acquaintance with three of my mothers' overseas colleagues showing me around turned into a treasured friendship with those friends that has grown deeper as our spouses have also become friends, and we've become friends with their friends.
Apparently investors believe that in two weeks, Biden will return the country to normal; that everything will be fine. On Wednesday, amid bloodshed in Washington, D.C., analysts were more interested in the results of the Georgia election, which put control of the Senate in Democratic hands.
According to the Regulatory Studies Center at George Washington University, the new Congress could use the law to kill any Trump regulations that were published in the federal register on or after Aug. 22, 2020.
And now I tell my children: It's OK to be scared. It's OK to worry -- but let's not get stuck there. Let's not hold on to those balloons so tightly that we can't see past them. Don't hold on for so long that we let those feelings hold us back and stop us. Let's face those things that scare us anyway. Show up scared. Show up filled with doubt. Show up not ready. Just show up.
As the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc across the city, other groups authored a 40-page plan for a green recovery, urging the city to spend $16 billion over the next three years retrofitting buildings for energy efficiency, expanding bike lanes, and boosting green manufacturing on Brooklyn's industrial waterfront.
I will approve of and rejoice in my accomplishments, and I will be as vigorous in listing these – as rigorous in remembering them – as I have ever been in remembering and enumerating my failures or lacks of accomplishment.
En 2003, c'était exactement le contraire: le Sras était apparu en novembre 2002 mais Pékin avait attendu février suivant pour reconnaître la maladie, la minimisant et assurant qu'elle était sous contrôle. En juin 2003, le virus avait tué plus de 300 personnes en Chine, avec plus de 5329 autres cas. Sous pression de l'OMS pour rapporter tous les cas, les autorités chinoises avaient aussi interdit aux experts de l'organisation l'accès aux hôpitaux militaires de Pékin.
On an average day, a typical grocery store might handle 800 to 1,200 customers, according to Perrone. But when people began stocking up on food and supplies, that count shot up as high as 10,000 in some locations, putting workers in usually close proximity to shoppers.

Which means it is simply not possible to get sick with COVID-19 as a result.
We wanted to give our daughter more employment options and join the global efforts to reduce the digital divide. In 2001, I created a small technology firm called TecAccess. We helped companies, agencies, universities and nonprofits create, build and maintain ICT products and services that were compliant to Section 508. Our focus was to assure that ICT was accessible to everyone including persons with disabilities. I merged that firm with another technology firm named SSB BART Group in 2011.
She knew the twisty rape-revenge comedy would piss off some people and leave others gleefully pumping their fists. I'm in the latter camp. Fennell's directorial debut, which she also wrote, is cunning and audacious, from its winky pastel palette to its take-no-prisoners finale. We root for Cassie Thomas (a career-best Carey Mulligan), the medical-school dropout at the film's center, as she outwits male predators who assume they can take advantage of her, yet Fennell cleverly coils our allegiance by making Cassie a bit dastardly herself. When Cassie lets an old friend (Alison Brie) think she's been assaulted, or when she dupes an unsympathetic university administrator (Connie Britton) into believing her teenage daughter is vulnerable to the same horror, vengeance starts to feel thorny.
I am not one of those people. I'm not among those who don't think twice about the germs lying in wait when shopping for groceries, grabbing a latte at Starbucks or picking up a prescription at the pharmacy. In fact, germs are on my mind whenever I go anywhere, at all times.
Like his movie, Farrelly's speech glossed over the systemic and institutional causes of racism, revealing a simplistic and tone-deaf mentality that felt completely devoid of substance ― and that didn't jibe with the meaningful moments that characterized the earlier parts of Sunday's ceremony.
What can people do in their own communities to help?
While no announcement has been made on the Ranveer Singh-starrer '83, the Kabir Khan-directorial based on India's cricket world cup victory, sources close to the project said that a new release date will be announced soon as the postponement of Sooryavanshi is bound to have a domino effect on the other big summer releases. A major trailer launch event which was planned for '83, in presence of the actor and the cricketers they play on screen, has been cancelled for now, Mumbai Mirror reported.
In a statement to HuffPost, a spokesman for O'Rourke, whose high-profile bid to unseat Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) propelled the former House Democrat from Texas onto the national stage last year, said he is supportive of the concept of a Green New Deal and how it invests in green jobs.
The situation is under control here, Thai Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul told reporters, saying there are no reports of the infection spreading to others. We checked all of them: taxi drivers, people who wheeled the wheelchairs for the patients, doctors and nurses who worked around them.
My boobs are stupid heavy, my back hurts and I can't wear cute lil shirts without a grandma bra, she complained in an Instagram post in July. She also asked followers for advice about possible post-surgery scarring.
I went to school from that day forward without a wig. Some kids were great, but others were really hurtful. They made fun of me or took the bows off my head that I deliberately put there to cover a spot. Unfortunately, those are the things that stick with you.
Jafar, Varma said, could never stand for injustice in her personal or professional life. She was fighting a long and difficult custody battle for her children. She loves teaching but often ended up leaving for challenging the management.
As with any phobia, being exposed to the thing you fear can be hugely traumatic. Illogical though it may be, the angst is real. A person with ophidiophobia (fear of snakes) or coulrophobia (a fear of clowns) may be able to live their entire life without ever being exposed to the thing that scares them. Unfortunately for germaphobes, it's impossible to completely avoid confronting the thing we fear.
And even he says most of his messages don't get replies, that he spends probably 10 hours talking to people on the app for every one hour he spends meeting for coffee or a hookup. It's worse for gay men of color. Vincent, who runs counseling sessions with black and Latino men through the San Francisco Department of Public Health, says the apps give racial minorities two forms of feedback: Rejected (Sorry, I'm not into black guys) and fetishized (Hi, I'm really into black guys.) Paihan, a Taiwanese immigrant in Seattle, shows me his Grindr inbox. It is, like mine, mostly hellos he has sent out to no reply. One of the few messages he received just says, Asiiiaaaan. None of this is new, of course. Walt Odets, a psychologist who's been writing about social isolation since the 1980s, says that gay men used to be troubled by the bathhouses in the same way they are troubled by Grindr now. The difference he sees in his younger patients is that if someone rejected you at a bathhouse, you could still have a conversation afterwards. Maybe you end up with a friend out of it, or at least something that becomes a positive social experience. On the apps, you just get ignored if someone doesn't perceive you as a sexual or romantic conquest. The gay men I interviewed talked about the dating apps the same way straight people talk about Comcast: It sucks, but what are you gonna do?
Still, people with assets of $1,000 definitely don't want to lose them. Risk tolerance is important, and the ETF Endowment Series has five levels of risk/potential growth, with A being the most conservative. In 2017, the A saw a rate of return of 5.68 percent; the B, 7.97 percent; the C, 10.63 percent; the D, 14.02 percent; and the E, 16.80 percent.

Les autorités chinoises expriment la volonté de collaborer de façon plus transparente et plus rapide que pour l'épidémie de Sras, explique à l'AFP Antoine Flahault, directeur de l'Institut de santé global à l'Université de Genève (Suisse). C'est une attitude extrêmement différente par rapport à 2003 même si des questions persistent sur le nombre exact de cas et la possibilité d'une sous-estimation.
Experts say we're likely going to be living with relatively easy, low-cost public health precautions — again, like masking, distancing and strict adherence to hand-washing — for some time.
Capitol Police, a federal law enforcement agency tasked with protecting Congress, failed to keep hundreds of rioting Trump supporters out of the Capitol, forcing lawmakers, staff and reporters to go into hiding as the mob tore through the highest chambers of government with firearms and other weapons, fueled by the president's baseless claims that the presidential election was stolen from him.
Trump will lose his privileged status with the RNC for purposes of fundraising and visibility when he leaves office on Jan. 21. At that point, the committee will have to adopt a neutral stance toward all potential 2024 candidates.
Fortunately, appointments have been easier to go to the further along I get. But I still schedule them in the afternoon so I don't have to return to work in case I receive bad news.
Labour ran the former minister extremely close in the 2017 election, slashing his majority to just 2,400. But after the boundary review IDS's seat is on course for a Labour majority of 1,400. Another seat that would see a high profile name removed is Tim Farron in Westmorland and Lonsdale, where his narrow majority is set to fall to the Tories after the addition of key Conservative wards from nearby Penrith and the Borders. Baxter told HuffPost UK: The new boundaries look like they will not change the result of the recent election, despite Conservative hopes that they could be worth a dozen or more seats to them. Under the new boundaries, the recent election would still have given the country a hung parliament, with the Conservatives three seats short of an overall majority. Individual MPs whose seats might change hands as new unfriendly voters are transferred in to them include Nigel Dodds (the leader of the DUP at Westminster), Tim Farron, Margaret Beckett, Iain Duncan Smith and Boris Johnson. The initial proposals from the Boundary Commissions can still be modified before they are finalised and the entire recommendations need to be accepted by parliament before they come into effect. And that is not looking certain at the moment as at least fifty MPs wonder nervously if their seats will disappear.
But progressive critics say it's that record of winning smaller-scale victories against oil companies that made him appealing to a company like Shell.
Hillary Clinton has called a sticker depicting teen climate change activist Greta Thunberg being sexually assaulted misogyny plain and simple.
Houck: We literally sat on our couches for two weeks. And we'd start in the morning calling each other while drinking coffee, and when the sun went over the yard, we'd switched to wine, and after a few glasses we'd switch to vodka, and then we'd call each other up crying.

In a letter to the federal environment minister, Teck CEO and President Don Lindsay said investors and customers increasingly want jurisdictions to have a framework in place that reconciles resource development and climate change.
Just as importantly, remember that annoying doesn't usually work both ways. You may be annoying other people without even recognizing it. In either case, you need to understand the dynamics to maximize team performance, and for your own sanity and satisfaction. For any relationship to be maximally productive, both parties must actively manage the relationship.
The good news is this change only applies to new homeowners, according to Josh Zimmelman, owner of Westwood Tax & Consulting. The $1 million cap still applies to homeowners who took out a mortgage before December 15, 2017, he said. New homeowners can take this deduction on mortgages up to $750,000.
I agree with the glowing reviews of The Big Short. The film does a wonderful job of exposing the mendacity of the financial industry and the role it played in almost causing a worldwide economic collapse.
Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison has confirmed the closure of many nonessential businesses starting Monday as Australia dealt with a surge of COVID-19 cases over the weekend. The new shutdown rules come amid global outrage after Aussies and tourists packed many Sydney beaches on Friday, rubbing shoulders and breaking the 1.5-meter social distancing rule.
This type of dream, in which you go through the motions of normal life while still in a dream state, is known as a false awakening. According to Matt Lundquist, LCSW, a psychotherapist and couples therapist, there's no reason to be concerned if this happens to you.
So yes, entrepreneurs and business people alike should go to college, and they should learn the ins and outs of the industry they would like to influence. While we can point to some top entrepreneurs who did not complete their college degrees, we know that Zuckerberg and Jobs did take courses in technology and design at two of the top universities in the world. They are anomalies because they didn't finish and still made a huge impact, but they attempted college and created products based on the information and experiences they gleaned in college.
Rice did not join a handful of other Democrats in the New York delegation in supporting Ocasio-Cortez's resolution for a select committee on a Green New Deal. But in a statement to HuffPost, Rice said she supports robust federal investment in energy-efficient infrastructure projects and training for green energy jobs and said members of Congress committed to this fight should no longer accept campaign contributions from oil and gas companies.
While states that participate may request additional federal Medicaid funds during an emergency, those funds are not guaranteed and would require swift approval to be useful to states during crises. Under traditional Medicaid, the funding would automatically flow.
6th Candle: Community. Building community is a sacred act. One way is to offer help to someone in need. This year at Chanukah, we also ask a person for help for ourselves, which is a gift to him or her as well as to us.

4. Follow Jesus: It seems simple, but it really isn't. Following Jesus doesn't mean that you simply know Him. It means that you know him intimately. It means that your heart is in sync with His heart. It means that you obey Him, you trust Him, and that you allow Him to lead you, even when you do not understand the journey. You will never go wrong by following the One who will never lose His power, credibility or popularity. Allow Him to be your spiritual navigation system as you learn to discern His voice. Let His Word be a light unto your feet and a lamp unto your path. Do not worry about making unplanned or unexpected detours. God has a way of getting you back on His divine path. And when the road gets hard and lonely, He promises to never leave you or forsake you. When you feel too weary to continue the journey, let Him carry you. Trust in Him with all your heart, do not lean on your own understanding, in all your ways acknowledge Him and watch Him make your paths straight.
Vanessa Wruble, a Jewish activist and one of the initial organizers of the 2017 march, said that she was troubled, when working with the co-chairs, by anti-Semitic comments, some of which echoed Farrakhan. Mallory and Sarsour have publicly denied this.
The sight of Aussies and tourists defying the strict advice on social distancing jolted fury from many online, with some comparing the Sydney images to empty pictures of New York City and Los Angeles, which are in lockdown.
I really want Eastern Canada to understand this (sticker) is the craziest thing possible, Narang said. There's way more good news stories and we love our environment.
A 2001 Montclair Times opinion piece remembering Aaliyah's life by Jeff Harrell similarly places the onus on the young singer for Kelly's allegedly criminal behavior. Aaliyah's life was not filled with enough sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll to kill a rock god, Harrell wrote, referring to the singer's public persona. Of course, if the bare midriffs in her videos and lyrics like 'going all the way with an older man' are any indication, there was sex. Aaliyah was a mere teenager when she reportedly married her producer, the Grammy winner and older man R.Kelly.
She's never been more beautiful to me than she is now.
The debt snowball method is ideal for people who need to experience wins right away. With this strategy, you'll begin paying the smallest balance off first, Anderson said. Continue to make the minimum payments on your other accounts and put as much money as you can towards the smallest balance. Once the smallest balance is paid off, combine the amount you were paying on that balance with the minimum payment on your next-smallest balance, and so on. This strategy can help keep you motivated and encouraged since you should start to see some results right away, Anderson said.
Paul and Le respectively pulled in around 2 million and 2.6 million views on their promotional Mystery Brand YouTube videos in one week. Content creators can earn an estimated rate of up to $5 per 1,000 views on the platform from ads. After coming under fire, Paul addressed the controversy in a pair of snarky tweets last week before reminding children not to gamble. Le filmed a subsequent video acknowledging he was somewhat in the wrong for doing business with Mystery Brand, lamenting other YouTubers had done the same in the past without major scrutiny, and complaining the ordeal had been blown out of proportion. Neither Paul nor Le responded to HuffPost's requests for comment.

I had gone to golf camps every year, competed in different kid's league tournaments, and had enough practice that I made it on the team my freshman year of 2011-12. I was very excited to do something I truly enjoyed on a high school level, and I practiced with my dad the summer before school.
Our data shows that the losses from wildfires in California have risen dramatically in recent years, Ernst Rauch, Munich Re's head of climate, said in a press release. We have experienced a significant increase in hot, dry summers, which has been a major factor in the formation of wildfires. Many scientists see a link between these developments and advancing climate change.
The actress recently opened up about one of the couple's dumbest fights, which occurred early on in their relationship. It all started because of music choices during a road trip to meet each other's families.

The Madrid region accounts for 628 deaths and 7,165 cases. Spanish authorities said on Friday they would turn a Madrid conference center into a giant makeshift military hospital for thousands of coronavirus patients.
How Americans would feel about this is a big unknown. As employer insurance gets more expensive, employers are passing along some of those higher costs to their workers in the form of higher co-pays and deductibles, to the point where some of the employees struggle to pay bills. And employer coverage often requires dealing with limited networks of doctors and hospitals.
The same goes for cult favorite Bulletproof Coffee, a favorite of keto fans that's enhanced with grass-fed or clarified (ghee) butter and MCT (medium-chain triglyceride) oil. This intentionally high-calorie beverage is often used as a meal replacement and beloved by keto dieters and intermittent fasters (both lifestyles that have their own hosts of problems when taken too far or for too long, asserted Peacock). However, its efficacy again is in the caloric deficit it creates by taking the place of a meal. In and of itself, it's not doing anything else to help your fitness goals. In fact, although it's fine in moderation in conjunction with a balanced diet, Ramirez cautioned that if you are drinking it, be aware that it is high in fat and bloodwork should be monitored accordingly.
The truth is, and New Yorkers and all Americans deserve the blunt truth, it's only getting worse, de Blasio told NBC's Meet the Press. He suggested the number of confirmed cases is expected to surge in April and May.

May we pause often and give thanks.
Mr. McComis, who runs the leading for-profit college accreditor, told you that this proposal feels a little stacked against the student. He described the multiple constraints to debt relief as belts and suspenders on pants that are too tight.

The treatment my friends and I experience at the Capitol as advocates and activists stands in stark contrast with the way the Proud Boys and other rioters were treated on Jan. 6. Whereas I have come to expect metal detectors and strict enforcement of the rules that have kept the Capitol safe for over 200 years, the Capitol Police opened barricades for the rioters and waved them in despite their display of such overt symbols of hate as the Confederate flag and a Camp Auschwitz shirt.
Another favorite was the time I was Cinderella and posing with a little boy who was dressed up as Prince Charming. I asked if I could kiss his cheek and he said yes — then, just as the photo was being taken, he turned his head and kissed me right on my mouth. The parents and I were in stitches.

Given that my family and I have been healthy with a roof over our heads and food on our table, I know that it's unfair to complain about what I've lost during this time. I know that millions of people all over the world have lost so much more: loved ones, homes, jobs, coping abilities. I know that my losses are insignificant compared to those of so many. But COVID stole from me, too.

A date? I wish. This isolation is so real right now, especially for single and childless folks like myself. What I wouldn't do for a hug.
At other times, the laugh can be enjoyed by all. I was at this one show, and an old farmer walked by, said Hamden, Connecticut painter William McCarthy. He took a look in my booth, then said about one painting, 'How long did it take you to do that, 10 minutes?' He was a large man, not to be reckoned with, and I said, 'Oh, maybe about 25 seconds.' He then let out a big belly laugh, and we started talking. He actually said he liked my paintings. The farmer was not a buyer (he may have bought a hot dog there), but a testy situation was defused. In rare instances, McCarthy has found that what starts as a confrontation turns into a sale. Visitors enter his booth display and begin voicing criticism of one thing or another (People think that artists are invisible, that they leave their feelings at the door, he said), such as that they hate the painting, they hate the colors, they hate the frame. Although he was not part of the conversation, McCarthy may interject himself, saying, 'Well, the intention of that painting was...' or 'I wanted to use those colors, because...' or 'I thought that frame was appropriate, because...,' which catches people off-guard. They take a second look. In fact, some sales have resulted, which surprised me: They started out saying that hated a painting that they end up buying.
Reps. Jayapal and Pocan promised Wednesday that they would introduce a bill overturning pay-go entirely.
Elena Ferrante's My Brilliant Friend is a marvel, the author a literary wunderkind -- and I saw in Elena and Lila's friendship a reflection of my own girlhood. This story of the complexities of female friendship reverberated from an impoverished 1950s Italian neighborhood to my suburban childhood a half century and an ocean away. As a child, every significant moment feels as if it could break you, or change you forever -- a sensation that dulls as these experiences, once sharp in their singularity, are repeated over the passing years. These feelings of desperate longing, unspeakable humiliation, and unadulterated joy are made electric in the pages of My Brilliant Friend. With Ferrante's tender and sharp insight into the workings of a young girl's mind, I was transported back to the insecurities of adolescence and the earth-shattering experiences of first friendships, loves and heartbreaks.

2. Fear Not: We are commanded numerous times in the Bible to fear not. In John 16:33, Jesus warns that trials and tribulations will come, but to be of good cheer. Why? Because He has overcome the world. We live in a fallen world, where it can be easy to give in to fear and panic. But do not be moved. Go ahead and start that new business venture. Give love another chance. Go back to school if that is what you desire. Do not allow the what ifs to hold you hostage. Live your best life in 2016, with no regrets. When challenging circumstances arise and try to paralyze you, stand on this promise from Isaiah 41:10: Fear not, for I am with you. Be not dismayed. For I am your God. I will strengthen you, I will help you, and I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. That means whatever you face in 2016, God will be there with you every step of the way. He will protect you, give you peace and will calm your heart in the midst of the storm.

The accessibility testing and remediation process can be complicated. Even with software that guides developers and testers through the testing process, they will still need to figure out how to resolve the issues that are found. Furthermore, testing can take a lot of time. Even with automated testing, users will frequently need to sift through thousands of violations on hundreds of pages or more. Alchemy addresses these issues.
But Democratic leaders were confident they had the votes. By Wednesday night, it became clear that even incoming Rep.

Well, what they want is to get rid of the CAA. I think that would be an incredible and most empowering achievement for Muslim women in India. That would give people a new kind of voice and hope. It would be incredibly empowering to individual women. It's really hard to do these things. But if they can keep a sustained pressure on the government and they can generate the protests that are coming up all over the country, that's an achievement. If they can get the government to respond in any kind of way, including the newly elected Aam Aadmi government, which has pretty much refused to acknowledge this, that would be a real achievement. Beyond that, how women choose to organise really depends on local issues. It was really clear that very few women thought that teen talaq was a huge issue, but then it became a national issue. The nikah halala is definitely an issue.

In a response aired on nearly every major network, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) accused the president of using the backdrop of the Oval Office to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear, and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration and of holding hostage critical services for the health, safety and wellbeing of the American people. They made no mention of climate change.

In 2009, when Barack Obama's White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel wanted to change the census chain of command so that the bureau would report directly to the White House, Oversight Republicans, led by my former boss Darrell Issa, blasted the action as a shamefully transparent attempt by your Administration to politicize the Census Bureau and manipulate the 2010 Census. The appearance of White House interference in the census prompted House Republicans to introduce a resolution calling on the secretary of commerce to use all legal and reasonable means to count every living person in the 2010 census. The resolution, by the way, made no mention of citizenship or legal status.

It's not that you can't get anything done in the minority or get everything done in the majority, but having the gavel, having that leadership control can be the difference in success or failure for an administration, said Jim Manley, once a top aide to former Democratic Senate Leader Harry Reid, who held his post opposite current Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

Arana: After I started dating my wife casually, I got serious. I met her when I waited on her at a restaurant. When I decided to get serious, I didn't have money to buy her a ring to propose. But I told her that I was going to be successful. I told her that I would be driving down PCH in my car and that I wanted her sitting next to me. She trusted in me. She supported my dreams. She believed in me. And that was what I needed. I hear her tell her friends this story so this is what she says.

Corey was a follower. Corey would go along with anything anyone in the family — our group — would say, Darold Brown, a member of the New Jersey group, said in a 2011 affidavit. If, hypothetically, you would say to Corey, 'let's rob a bank,' Corey would be there with you. He wouldn't analyze whether it was a good idea. Corey's view was that he'd do anything for the people he considered his family.
In March, Trump signed a Republican bill rescinding the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Act, an Obama-era law that required federal contractors to disclose and then address violations of labor law and worker safety regulations. In August, the Trump administration announced it was postponing implementation of the so-called fiduciary rule ― another Obama-era legacy ― that requires investment managers to act in the best interests of their clients. It's widely understood that the administration is merely buying time for a more formal rewrite or outright repeal of the regulation.

This novel focuses on several characters during a time of cholera that was brought on by poor sanitary conditions in the Caribbean. Like his father Dr. Marco Aurelio Urbino, who died in quarantine to protect his loved ones, Dr. Juvenal Urbino is fascinated with studying all he can to stop the spread of a cholera epidemic. One of the major themes of the novel is the way that love and nature persist even in times of distress and unease.

Johnson and Duncan Smith helped lead the Vote Leave campaign that triumphed in last year's EU referendum, with a 52% vote for Brexit. The former Mayor of London is seen by his supporters as the most popular successor to Theresa May. But if the analysis is accurate he could be toppled as Tory leader and PM in the 2022 general election. Nigel Dodds, the deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), the Conservatives' likely partners propping up May's minority government, is also set to lose his seat. The changes to the Westminster boundaries were included in the 2017 Tory manifesto, repeating a pledge made by David Cameron to reduce the number of Commons seats from 650 to 600 and to make constituencies more equal in size. Johnson could now join several Tory MPs who are pushing for the boundary review – due to be completed in 2018 – to be shelved yet again or axed. Given that many of the seats facing abolition were in Labour areas, it was expected that the changes would net the Tories at least 12 seats. But the 2017 Labour surge, particularly in London, puts in play several previously solid Tory seats once the boundary review includes Labour wards to the newly created constituencies. New polls suggest Labour is ahead of the Tories for the first time in years, but even if Corbyn's share of the vote remains the same as in 2017, the study shows seats would fall to the party under the new boundaries.
In addition to the lawsuit, New York City intends to divest the approximately $5 billion the city's pension funds have invested in over 190 fossil fuel companies. The move comes more than two years after de Blasio announced plans to divest $33 million from coal, one of the dirtiest fossil fuels.
The wave of legislation came as the United States became the epicenter of COVID-19, the rapidly spreading respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus. By Friday, the U.S. death toll topped 1,000, with more than 100,000 confirmed cases, overwhelming hospitals and forcing doctors to publicly beg for basic medical supplies. The economic fallout exceeded even the worst expectations: 3.3 million Americans filed jobless claims this week ― topping both Goldman Sachs' 2.25 million forecast from last week and smashing the previous one-week record of 695,000 reported job losses. Yet, as experts blamed the White House's back-footed response for inflaming the crisis, the Trump administration appeared to ramp up its environmental agenda, ordering the Environmental Protection Agency's enforcement division to temporarily stop policing polluters, approving a slate of mining projects, auctioning off new drilling leases and reviving a dormant fight over auto emission standards. The efforts on both the state and federal level offered jarring real-time examples of what the author Naomi Klein dubbed the shock doctrine: the phenomenon wherein polluters and their government allies push through unpopular policy changes under the smokescreen of a public emergency. While we are all paying attention to COVID-19 and the congressional stimulus packages, state legislatures are quietly passing fossil-fuel-backed anti-protest laws, Connor Gibson, the researcher at Greenpeace USA who tipped HuffPost off to the bills' passage, said by email Friday. These laws do nothing new to protect communities.
Connecticut's success might be easier for other states to replicate. A big factor there was the discretion given to health care providers to deviate from eligibility criteria when the alternative was slowing down the process or discarding unused vaccines altogether.

Infectious disease experts aren't surprised to see these new variants. Coronaviruses mutate all the time — most of the time, those little mutations don't make a difference in the virus's behavior.
So early this morning as I am lying in bed sleeplessly with both kids curled up next to me snoring while their little legs periodically kick me in the back, I feel a tremendous sense of gratitude. I am grateful for those early wakeups, grateful for those kicks in the back, grateful for my husband and kids, grateful for being together, and grateful for being alive. I am grateful for the wonderful people in my life and grateful for those who I do not know personally but who work tirelessly to keep me and my family safe, healthy and warm -- car mechanics at the repair shop, our local policemen and firemen, the engineers at the gas company, all the doctors, delivery people, garbage collectors, shopkeepers who I see often but rarely say thanks to. And I am realizing that feeling this much gratitude feels deeply rejuvenating, which is exactly what I need more in my life. So instead of fancy resolutions and intentions, all I want and need for the new year is more gratitude...
The senator said John started feeling sick while she was in Minnesota and he was in Washington, D.C. The two have been in different places for the last two weeks. As such, Klobuchar said she won't seek out a test based on the advice of her doctor.
People got mad at me, they said, 'Hannity, you were talking about, well, rich people won't buy boats.' No, rich people won't go to restaurants, because they won't have the money, he claimed without evidence. Rich people won't invest in companies, that means they're not going to hire people.
After people called the website out on Twitter, it took down a section of its terms and conditions that stipulated it could refuse to issue prizes to users who don't claim them within one hour. Angry reviews on Reddit and Mystery Brand's Facebook page claim some users received fake merchandise or never got their prize items at all. Critics, including controversial Swedish YouTube influencer PewDiePie, who has stoked outrage over his anti-Semitic videos in the past, have raised another issue: In their promotional posts, Paul and Le curiously won items of far higher value than unsponsored users did in their Mystery Brand videos. Le quickly won an $11,000 Chanel purse which, according to odds listed on MysteryBrand.net, he had a less than 0.17 percent chance of doing.

Over at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, a panel voted 2-1 to rubber-stamp construction of both the Jordan Cove liquefied natural gas export terminal in Oregon's already-polluted Coos Bay, and the 230-mile Pacific Connector Pipeline. The decision, The Oregonian reported, stunned Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D), who warned that the state had not yet approved permitting in the midst of a national emergency.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the coronavirus is usually transmitted through respiratory droplets (from an infected person sneezing or coughing) rather than through fomites, objects and materials that when contaminated can transfer disease. However, the CDC notes that evidence suggests that the novel coronavirus may remain viable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials, which includes clothing.

Reuters reported Wednesday deaths from China's new flu-like virus rose to 17, heightening global fears of contagion from an infection suspected to have come from animals.
The party quickly made a crucial decision. Rather than pursue swing voters, they would focus on turning out the Democratic base, especially Black voters. The choice wasn't obvious. There were roughly 100,000 voters, mostly in the Atlanta suburbs, who cast ballots for Biden and Purdue in November. But knowing Republicans had roughly 300,000 more high-propensity voters in the state than Democrats, the campaigns wagered their best bet was to fire up Black turnout.
And don't fall for scams claiming to have a cure. Those include supplements or any other healing product that wellness influencers or gurus post on social media.
Ottawa is imposing its tax on provinces that have refused to meet the national standard for pricing carbon emissions: Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario. The national tax was initially imposed in New Brunswick as well but that province came up with its own tax after the election, which has since been approved by the feds.
We're not doing this work for you, we're doing this work for us and what Black folks did last night wasn't about saving the Democratic Party, it wasn't about saving America, it was about saving us, Brown said. And to the extent that wherever Black people have actually won, it makes things better for all of us, all of America. And so part of what is embedded into our experience is that as we literally have been on the frontlines of fighting for democracy, it's not only been good for us but it's been good for all of America.
He was arrested and in the process he bit three police officers and he's HIV positive. They had to go on the prophylactic drugs for six months. I spoke to one of the officers and he's newly married, trying for a baby and now can't try for a baby for six months. He pleaded guilty and was put away for a year, but he's out now. I saw another crew and they asked me about him because he's pseudo fitting again. And I thought 'oh no'. Four years ago, I took a patient to hospital. I turned my back on her and completely unprovoked, she jumped out of her chair and grabbed my hair and started kicking and punching me. Clumps of my hair fell out. Maybe if there was a change in the law, it would be a deterrent. The doctors and nurses get a lot more abuse than us, because these people are waiting hours in hospital. Our time with them is short lived. I've been spat at too. I'd rather take the punches than be spat at. That's the worst thing. You think of the diseases, the TB, the hepatitis, and we are going home to our families, it's just a worry. Adam Heslop, 28, British Transport Police, Lancashire
3. There is something you still need to learn or realize before you get there
Sunrise Movement co-founder Varshini Prakash, whose climate-justice group spearheaded the push for a Green New Deal, said the growing number of 2020 presidential contenders backing the policy shows how much the movement has shifted the conversation on climate in American politics.
If your partner regularly mocks or derides your sex drive, that's not a good sign. All couples have sex drives that are mismatched to some degree, but it's important to be respectful of each other's needs even if they don't match our own. ― Marin
Founded officially in April 2017, the Sunrise Movement traces its roots back to the start of the decade, when the Occupy Wall Street protests put a national spotlight on the widening income gap. By the mid-2010s, the student activists who would go on to found the Sunrise Movement were leading efforts to pressure their universities to divest from fossil fuels. Drawing on lessons from the 2016 presidential bid of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the group finally took form a few months after President Donald Trump began a full-on assault on environmental regulations in a push to bolster the oil and gas industry.
Off 7–9 and 6–10 marks in 2013 and '14, respectively, Coughlin entered this year likely knowing he needed to bounce back in order to hold onto his job. He finished 6–10 again, with a 3–7 mark outside the NFC East.
But the remedy has the social cost of job loss, and that could fuel the already high risk in the United States and Europe of fragmented national politics.
Democrats will now be able to chair committees, and Biden has control over nomination processes for key government posts.

Be mindful of the motivation behind why you are correcting your child. Is what they're doing really that bad? Use judgment but couple that with the peace of God. If you are tired, exhausted, frustrated, annoyed, or even upset, understand that anything your child does will enhance whichever feeling you're having. Make a decision to change your attitude. There is no point in staying in that emotional place when you have a child to look after. Stop worrying about what others think about you. Like an older woman said to me once If you live long enough you would pat yourself on the back for taking on the job of being a parent. Those older ladies know because they've seen a lot. Always offer a word, compliment, or a pat on the back when you see another parent in distress. Don't just tuck your earphones in and put the music louder. You may feel apprehensive to do this because this world has become so cold, but season your words with love and kindly say something to break the ice. It may be just what that parent needed. Don't place your worth as a parent in the arms of your children's behavior. If you are doing everything to ensure that they're being raised well, then trust that. Wake up everyday and tell your self that You are a bomb parent.
In one of a number of standout stories in the recently released anthology A Phoenix First Must Burn, Sixteen Stories of Black Girl Magic, Resistance and Hope, Jordan Carter is a high school student who realises that the Contaminant in the city's water — inspired by the ongoing public health emergency that is the Flint, Michigan, water crisis — has damaged a lot of other people. But instead of weakening her, she discovers that this epidemic has given her an extraordinary power. She double-checks the surreal nature of how crises show us where we are stronger and more magnificent than we could have dreamed with her crush.
Looking forward to reviewing it and sharing feedback with the next Conservative leader, Scheer wrote.
For me it is mainly when writing a new book, when it is going well and flowing spontaneously, when I feel I am taking dictation from an unseen force. But it is also when I make a quick decision on a particular investment that I am sure has high potential upside; and also when I am discussing a new idea (new to me) or project over lunch. Books clearly take quite a bit of time to write; but the two other times when I feel I am achieving most can take place in small fragments of time, measured in a few hours or even minutes. And I know when a book is going to sell well, because it is fast and easy to write, and really the ideas come almost automatically.

The chamber also has enormous power in shaping the nation's judiciary. Democrats have watched in dismay as the now-outgoing Senate majority leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has won confirmation of scores of conservative nominees to federal district and appellate courts ― as well as three justices to the nine-member Supreme Court — and blocked a host of legislation from ever getting voted on.

Seek out artists and learn about their practice. I find that great art that is meaningful to my clients is generally the best way to create an inspiring space that represents theirs style. Befriending artists, touring their studios, and asking them about how they create not only helps you understand their work, it inspires you to be creative in designing your space.
By the time the midterm elections began, the Sunrise Movement had started carving out a place for itself, helping to elevate candidates who took climate change more seriously than just declaring a belief in the basic science. The group helped run a ground campaign for left-wing candidates like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Michigan gubernatorial hopeful Abdul El-Sayed. The Sunrise Movement also bird-dogged powerful incumbents like New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who was forced to make an embarrassing public reversal after a teenage activist got him to promise to stop taking fossil fuel money on camera.
Without directly mentioning Trump, Cuomo referred to the president's suggestion Monday that the economy could reopen sooner than expected.

The broadcast aimed to push back against a narrative developing in the media that Sanders would have difficulty retaining his 2016 staff, as well as to pre-emptively refute questions about the diversity of his staff and surrogates in a hypothetical 2020 run. In addition to Brezler, the speakers included Nina Turner, president of Our Revolution, and RoseAnn DeMoro, former executive director of National Nurses United. The discussion also featured contributions from Roy Tatem, the former deputy director of Sanders' 2016 African-American outreach; Cori Bush, an African-American nurse and former progressive congressional candidate; and Belén Sisa, an undocumented immigrant activist and former member of Sanders' Latino outreach team.

Managers who get too invested in being nice are bosses who rule by ruinous empathy, as Kim Scott writes in Radical Candor: Be a Kick-Ass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity. Per Scott, these bosses create the kind of work environment where 'being nice' is prioritized at the expense of critiquing, and therefore, improving actual performance. Without necessary criticism, your career is likely to stall and you may even get fired.
It's totally plausible that this bill has no effect on public opinion relative to baseline, political scientist Jonathan Ladd tweeted Tuesday. But that's with our baseline being [that Republicans] are behind in the congressional generic ballot by around 10 points. And that's a margin that should make Republicans nervous.
Georgia's voters delivered a resounding message yesterday: they want action on the crises we face and they want it right now, Biden said in a Wednesday morning statement. On COVID-19, on economic relief, on climate, on racial justice, on voting rights and so much more. They want us to move, but move together.
It's now important that we take advantage of this consensus, and fast. The 2018 midterm election should be a clear lesson for the still-forming roster of 2020 presidential contenders: What Americans crave the most is a government that works for the people, not just some of the people. Americans, first and foremost, want their basic needs met and candidates who are willing to listen to their concerns and then work to address them in Washington.
Cable adds that while domestic issues such as the NHS, education, housing and broader economic policy matter, Brexit is so central to parliament and the future of the country we have to prioritise it.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), who leads the state with the most COVID-19 cases in the U.S., issued an urgent plea at his daily press conference, warning that the rate of growth for cases continues to increase and will peak in 14 to 20 days, making it essential that the state strengthen its hospital capacity and obtain much-needed medical supplies.

My parents divorced when I was 6 years old. By the time I was a teenager, I had experienced a decade of my mom modeling what it means to be a strong, independent, self-sufficient woman, and wondered if I would ever want to get married simply because marriage didn't seem necessary. It was around that same time that she began dating the man that she would marry and spend the next 25 years with, until he passed away two years ago. Their marriage was full of love and laughter, and demonstrated that it is possible for two individuals to share a life together without having to sacrifice their own interests or independence. They also showed me that even though marriage isn't necessary, with the right person, it sure can be a lot of fun ― and 15 years in, mine just keeps getting better. ― Susanne Kerns, blogger and contributor to But Did You Die?

Many organization gurus might tell you that junk is junk, and it's not worth holding onto items for sentimental reasons. But Kondo doesn't pass any judgment on what show participants decide to keep. In fact, she dedicates an entire step to tidying sentimental items, even breaking the rules in Episode 4 by allowing Margie to sort through her late husband's belongings ahead of schedule. Kondo shows that it's perfectly fine to hold onto these things, but in a way that brings you joy, of course.

But despite these rising questions, the classic films ― Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill ― seemed untouchable, and disliking them remained taboo. If you've ever told a date, a classmate, a mentor or a friend that you can't watch Tarantino because you find his work to be exploitative of women, only to be informed that you simply don't understand his art, the indisputable revelation this month that he's a bona fide creep is, in a small but real way, liberating. It's something solid to cling to, at last, evidence that you're not overreacting or too obtuse to appreciate the aesthetic perfection of his tobacco-spit trajectories. Distaste for his work, often cast as a mental flaw or tragic unhipness, has become, in an instant, a mark of discernment.

Small amounts of time can lead to large achievements. And these particles of time are often a source of pride that lasts a long time.
The other side of the coin concerns federal prisoners. It's not enough to search for ways to put prisoners down more efficiently when they engage in violence. That misses the point. Do pepper spray and batons work? Sure, as long as the guard sees the problem developing and isn't caught unaware. By the same token, guns and tasers also work. But this is how you control behavior, not change lives and win minds. This isn't the recipe to reformation or rehabilitation, but the recipe for negative reinforcement.
Globally, medical students and midwifery students are still taught the 1 centimeter per hour benchmark, and the World Health Organization recommends the use of the partograph — a chart used to document the course of a normal labor, based on Friedman's concepts — to manage labors worldwide, Oladapo said. Levine agreed that it is the textbook answer expected in medical school, though she believes that in the United States at least, that has changed in the last several years.
Articles of clothing, according to public health specialist Carol Winner, can hold respiratory droplets, as we use them every single day.

The entrepreneur said that delivery options have been feasible for restaurants in the past because there were significant dine-in or takeaway sales contributing to revenue. However, the virus has led to a surge in delivery orders.
Be prepared for growing travel delays and disruptions, including taking into account what this could mean for your health, and for your family, work or study responsibilities.
What impact do the mutations have?
I have to say, the best part about this job is the kids ― whether there are five or 40 of them. I've been a babysitter and nanny since I was in middle school, and I've always adored kids. I love their bright minds and pure hearts. They make the magic real for me every time. I'm almost always moved to tears by something they do or say, and they keep me LAUGHING.
As someone whose eating disorder was heavily influenced and reinforced by my desire to look like the thin, chiseled men all over Instagram and magazine covers, I kept thinking of the power these images may have on someone who's desperately trying to live up to those unrealistic beauty standards that impacted me, and that they may see my photos and think, Hey, I look like that, maybe I can be kinder to myself!
When wildfires flared in Southern California, state officials acted fast to send alerts to some 8 million smartphones in the area. But Gater said that an alert system shouldn't be overused.
Similarly, in September, he told NPR that he supported Bush putting inspectors in Iraq, not waging a war.

Six years ago, her husband took a job with the International Ski Federation, which allows him to work in Europe during the winter while she's there racing full-time. It was great because we could actually see each other, and now it allows him to be available in the summer to take care of our son while I'm out training twice a day, Randall said.
Like all families whose path it crosses, heroin has ruined some of the best parts of mine. We have fought with one another out of desperation, out of anger. We have said things we cannot take back.

You have to use the apps in smaller cities, says Michael Moore, a psychologist at Yale. They serve the purpose of a gay bar. But the downside is that they put all this prejudice out there. What the apps reinforce, or perhaps simply accelerate, is the adult version of what Pachankis calls the Best Little Boy in the World Hypothesis. As kids, growing up in the closet makes us more likely to concentrate our self-worth into whatever the outside world wants us to be—good at sports, good at school, whatever. As adults, the social norms in our own community pressure us to concentrate our self-worth even further—into our looks, our masculinity, our sexual performance. But then, even if we manage to compete there, even if we attain whatever masc-dom-top ideal we're looking for, all we've really done is condition ourselves to be devastated when we inevitably lose it. We often live our lives through the eyes of others, says Alan Downs, a psychologist and the author of The Velvet Rage, a book about gay men's struggle with shame and social validation. We want to have man after man, more muscles, more status, whatever brings us fleeting validation. Then we wake up at 40, exhausted, and we wonder, Is that all there is? And then the depression comes.
Ocasio-Cortez did not respond to HuffPost's request for comment on Earhardt's remarks, but she did fire off a response on Twitter after President Trump weighed in.
3. Don't be discouraged in the first 10 minutes if it feels like you are listening to a different language. In fact, Shakespeare made up words that even people of his era didn't understand. It takes time to acclimate your ears to the language; the actors will work with you. By the time the real action starts, you will be up to speed.

Gillette believes in the best in men, said Gary Coombe, president of Procter & Gamble Co.'s global grooming division, which owns the razor company. By holding each other accountable, eliminating excuses for bad behavior, and supporting a new generation working toward their personal 'best,' we can help create positive change that will matter for years to come.

The report did not discuss the party leadership process.
The day before New Year's Eve as I was preparing for our journey home and packing our car at my mother-in-law's house I couldn't help but feel annoyed -- the kids received way too many presents, my husband had not packed his stuff fast enough, the car is dirty, the garage is cold. Finally at 9 a.m. when everything and everyone was loaded into the car, I realized through the error message on the dashboard that this car is not going to take us anywhere that day.
I usually get home from work around 7 p.m. lately and am on email and writing research papers or grants until 8 or 9 p.m. When I can squeeze in a Peloton ride, walk the dog, watch some Great British Bake Off or listen to a podcast to turn off my brain a little, I'm pretty happy about it.
And as an old mentor of mine known as Dr. Value would say:
Loeffler was also seen as more vulnerable than Perdue, having survived a bruising November election in which she battled Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.). The race was an open election, meaning candidates of all parties ran together. While Loeffler and Collins battled for largely the same voters, Warnock emerged relatively unscathed and consolidated the Democratic vote.
So one upside of being old is that I no longer chase somebody's grand hallucination. I stick to basics of getting work done so that people who need it can have a better experience.

The Smithsonian Institution, for example, follows the spirit of FOIA, even though it's not required to by law. The Government Accountability Office also follows FOIA-like disclosure regulations. There's precedent for doing something like this — it wouldn't be that complicated to do, FOIA expert Michael Ravnitzky told HuffPost. A situation like this may be a catalyst for some sort of records access procedure, one that's suitable for the modern world. It's probably long overdue, but this makes it more evident.
International banks and law firms operating in the Asian financial hub have been keen to see visa rules for people in same-sex relationships eased to help attract global talent. Thailand could become the first Asian country to legally recognize same-sex couples under a bill that would allow civil partnerships.
Say you're arguing with your S.O. about how you deal with your parents, Negendank said. You might say something like, 'I feel frustrated when you criticize how I am handling things with my parents because it seems like you don't trust me to make the right decisions for myself. I would like you to be supportive of me and only give me your input when I ask for it. I know you care about what is best for me, but when it comes out as criticism it just hurts me.'
Local officials released numerous warnings in the early days of January as heavy rainfall was forecast, but they chose not to send out emergency alerts to cellphones until after the flooding had begun. They worried that the disaster-fatigued residents might not take an alert seriously, and didn't want to be seen as crying wolf.
Sure, he had a rough start, unable to land a job after graduating from the University of Southern California in the midst of the recession. He suffered countless job interview rejections for several years to follow, was named the Most Rejected Man in the World and became desperate for an opportunity. But now looking back, he understands the formula and motto of going for it:
With nearly 30,000 employees, Disneyland is the largest employer in Orange County and generates more than $5 billion for the southern California economy, according to Disney. Over 157 million people reportedly visited a Disney theme park in 2018.
Silence never creates change, Narang said. It's sad to me (the sticker) went through a supply chain of people, who thought about it, printed it and distributed it. It blows my mind anyone would think it's funny.
Trump's shifting timetable for pulling U.S. troops out of Syria has left allies and other players in the region confused and jockeying for influence over a withdrawal strategy that appeared to be a work in progress.

Houck: You can make an impact and it doesn't matter how much you have. The fact that people know that there's someone out there who gives a shit, for lack of a better term, makes a difference. One night, my daughter made cards to put into the bags for sending out meals. They were little hand-drawn cards that said, Be well. Stay safe. We'll get through this together. Since then we've had volunteers who have made cards, and a card goes out with every meal that we send.
My husband and I launched into action (a comfort zone for both of us) trying to find a certified local mechanic in an unfamiliar town during the holidays, unloading and towing the car, researching alternative transportation options and alternative holiday plans for the six of us.
But four months later, Biden was again portraying himself as a war critic, without any mention of his support for the invasion. And his campaign defended his comments, telling CNN he was referring to how he immediately opposed the specific way we went to war ― without giving diplomacy and the weapons inspectors a chance to succeed, based on hyped intelligence, without sufficient allies and without a plan for the day after ― and the manner in which the war was being carried out.
We can begin with supporting our care workforce ― if we invest in making home care and child care jobs good jobs ― raising wages, offering benefits and real opportunity, we not only improve life for the care workforce, we help enable the rest of America to get back to work, knowing that our loved ones are safe and in good hands. The president-elect has already named this as a priority for economic recovery, as part of his 21st Century Caregiving Plan. Now we must make it a reality.

In 2017, the march did a really good job of turning out people that say women's rights matter and women are people too, Fisher continued. You can't just go around grabbing people by their genitals, and you certainly shouldn't be able to get elected president if you do that.
What they don't understand is that even if they get rid of these websites, sex trafficking will still exist, she said. It will just push these crimes further underground and inhibit the ability of law enforcement to intervene. That is not a fix. The best thing we can do is keep it above ground.

• Tale of the tape: Kelly's Eagles made the playoffs in his first year as head coach, taking the NFC East title with a 10–6 record. They finished 10–6 in 2014 as well, before regressing this season. Philadelphia was 6–9 when Kelly was fired; the team won in Week 17 against the Giants under interim coach Pat Shurmur.
• What went wrong: The writing was on the wall here from the beginning. CEO Jed York forced Jim Harbaugh out the door (it was called a mutual decision, but the truth was obvious), and with him went offensive coordinator Greg Roman (to Buffalo) and defensive coordinator Vic Fangio (to Chicago)—the brain trust behind a franchise turnaround that led to three playoff berths and a Super Bowl appearance from 2011 to '13.
Other safeguards relate to the sharing of Aadhaar-authentication logs. These logs contain data on location and time of the authentication, apart from the demographic and biometric information of the Aadhaar holder. At present, the rules forbid an authenticating agency from sharing authentication logs with anyone apart from the holder of a particular Aadhar number.

Besides fighting for change, you mean? (Which is really the most important thing of all, because we shouldn't really accept the situation.) The only way you can really adjust is ultimately to try to live within your means, if that is possible. And I use the word if here because, in fact, with things like education, it's going to be very hard to truly live within your means on things like that. It's an extraordinarily difficult proposition, and it's why people are often in financial trouble.
But remember, this isn't a one-size-fits-all approach. While some may prefer programs like Alcoholics Anonymous, others might find seeing a therapist or going to another group organization to be more their style. For Melchor, AA personally wasn't a solution for her. It's all about finding what consistently works for you.
Thousands of Iranians have joined protests in the streets to express their outrage over the government's delayed admission that its own military shot down a commercial plane with Iranian citizens on board.
For example, the Civil War wasn't about slavery. It was, instead, a war over three economic systems that were not able to function together. The South: labor-surplice economy, in which people were the currency. The North: an industrializing economy, in which money was the currency. The West:a natural resources economy, in which land was the currency. And the victory of North over South (i.e. the victory of industrialization over labor-surplice) put in motion all of the events that occurred for decades after.
Pallister has signalled his willingness to work with Ottawa, in stark contrast to the other openly hostile Prairie premiers, Alberta's Jason Kenney and Saskatchewan's Scott Moe.

He is the most NFL-ready of any college coach, by most accounts. His schemes and game planning certainly are there, as is his calm, consistent demeanor. While teams have kicked the tires on Shaw's pro desires before, this could be the off-season that sees him make the leap. It feels almost inevitable that he will do so at some point. If the 49ers want to reestablish stability, this is the move.
With such a thin hold on power, that means Democrats will still have to overcome major opposition from their Republican colleagues in order to fully enact their agenda.

Cities can work on many levels to promote cleaner air. As we are doing in Atlanta, we can expand mass transit, use electric vehicles in our public fleets, increase the inventory of parks and greenspace, introduce solar energy to municipal buildings and partner with our business sector on conservation goals. The city of Atlanta leads all U.S. cities in President Barack Obama's Better Building Challenge, which calls for a 20 percent reduction in water and energy usage by 2020.

In the U.S., gambling is generally defined as paying to place a bet or wager to win a lottery or other prize, and is restricted for minors. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has ruled that internet gambling on a game of chance is not prohibited by law, however the Justice Department maintains that all internet gambling by parties in the U.S. is illegal. Within the European Union, there is no broad policy on gambling regulation, so each member state enforces its own laws.
There were the Christian flags, like the ones she used to pledge allegiance to in school, waving alongside American flags. The rioters' rhetoric, focused around saving the country, defeating enemies and promoting the will of God, could have come straight out of one of her childhood classrooms, where she said she was taught a distorted version of history with nods to white Christian supremacy. Last week's insurrectionists could have been her classmates, her teachers, her pastors. She felt a wave of recognition as she watched the pictures on social media.
We are having a political argument about whether people should be legally protected from lynching. Lynching. Extrajudicial and generally identity-based killings. I am incensed that, in an unsurprising expression of self-righteousness and moral control, self-proclaimed Christians are leading the fight against the measure.
It's time to do something different in New York City, isn't it? he said. We're going after those who have profited — and what a horrible, disgusting way to profit.
Talented employees are passionate. Providing opportunities for them to pursue their passions improves their productivity and job satisfaction. But many managers want people to work within a little box. These managers fear that productivity will decline if they let people expand their focus and pursue their passions. This fear is unfounded. Studies show that people who are able to pursue their passions at work experience flow, a euphoric state of mind that is five times more productive than the norm.
There really is no objective criteria one can use as a measuring stick to make these selections, except, maybe, for sales. But some important/impactful gadgets didn't sell particularly well at their genesis, and other gadgets are based on earlier products. I also differentiate impactful products from impactful technologies, and therefore didn't consider the first product in a new technology wave, such as the first of many CD or DVD players from a host of suppliers.
Lawmakers in Iowa, which last changed its overall tax structure in 1997, are looking at broad rate changes and other rewrites. Colorado has been looking at sweeping tax changes since at least 1984, mostly directed at sales taxes, but broader changes are getting a push this year from the federal rewrite. Idaho considered significant tax changes in 2015, but fell short, and now lawmakers and the governor are talking up those changes again. Big tax overhauls also are on the table in Michigan and Missouri.

The other hurdle is that the Indian government brings down the prices of American pharmaceutical products like coronary stents and any implants by nearly 65% to 80%. We do that because our consumer base is largely middle income that cannot afford to pay humongous prices for these vital products. The Americans say if you want to do that then do that, but why should we take a hit on our per unit cost. You do that on the landed cost. You give us our margins on the per unit cost. The Indians are countering that by saying that don't think about the per unit cost, but think about the big market that you are entering. The sheer quantity that you will sell will give you your numbers.
The leading option for cutting the average American man's 40.8-hour week (or the average woman's 36.2 hours) now, however, is enabling people to produce the same amount in less time. In practice, that means automating or ditching time-wasting activities to focus on what matters. Look at your work and ask your people what would it take to carve an hour off, advises Maroney. That doesn't mean every idea people come up with is going to be brilliant, but people who do the job every day have a better sense of it.
In his remarks nominating Pelosi for speaker, Jeffries, who is perhaps the favorite to take over for Pelosi, characterized this period in history as one filled with trials and tribulations and a lot of pain and suffering and death.
Unforgettable bosses are human, and they aren't afraid to show it. They're personable and easy to relate to. They're warm. They realize that people have emotions, and they aren't afraid to express their own. They relate to their people as a person first and a boss second. On the other hand, they know how to keep their emotions in check when the situation calls for it.

Rather than trying to change their minds, to convince them and reassure them that the system is real, that the democracy works ― as you would do if you cared about the country or the people who live here ― our new leaders will try to silence them, Carlson said. What happened today will be used by the people taking power to justify stripping you of the rights you were born with as an American. Your right to speak without being censored, your right to assemble, to not be spied upon, to make a living, to defend your family, most critically.

According to Dr. Gottman, 85% of relationships [2. Dr. Gottman makes this claim on page 283 in The Seven Principles that Make Marriage Work.] go wrong because partners find themselves unworthy. If you believe yourself not to be good enough, you will always anticipate for what is not there in yourself and your partner. And whether you want to see it or not, any person you fall in love with will be lacking desirable qualities. After all, they are human.
This whipsaw effect is confusing for voters and businesses and sabotages climate action in the long run, says Ontario Liberal leadership contender Steven Del Duca.

Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has warned Theresa May to halt planned police cuts in the wake of the Finsbury Park attack and a terrible few weeks for London. Speaking near the site of the latest violent incident that left one person dead and 10 injured, Khan made clear his anger at the Government's plans to slash budgets further for the Metropolitan Police. He pointed out that the force had had to cope with the terror attack on Westminster Bridge, London Bridget and now Finsbury Park. I've been saying for 12 months now my concern about the resources the Met Police and others have, he said. My message to the Government is, the plan you have to make the further cuts of £400m: don't do it. My message to the Government is, the plans you have to change the police funding formula so London loses more money: don't do it. My message to the Government is, we need to get the right level of funding for a capital city.

The industry had the science 30 years ago and knew what was going to happen but made no warning so that preemptive steps could have been taken, Harold Koh, a professor of international law at Yale Law School who served as legal adviser to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, told Inside Climate News. The taxpayers have been bearing the cost for what they should have been warned of 30 years ago. The companies are now being called to account for their conduct and the damages from that conduct.
The United States is withdrawing from the UN Human Rights Council as the organisation is not worthy of its name, President Donald Trump's UN envoy has said.
Despite all the talk of our chosen families, gay men have fewer close friends than straight people or gay women. In a survey of care-providers at HIV clinics, one respondent told researchers: It's not a question of them not knowing how to save their lives. It's a question of them knowing if their lives are worth saving. I'm not going to pretend to be objective about any of this. I'm a perpetually single gay guy who was raised in a bright blue city by PFLAG parents. I've never known anyone who died of AIDS, I've never experienced direct discrimination and I came out of the closet into a world where marriage, a picket fence and a golden retriever were not just feasible, but expected. I've also been in and out of therapy more times than I've downloaded and deleted Grindr. Marriage equality and the changes in legal status were an improvement for some gay men, says Christopher Stults, a researcher at New York University who studies the differences in mental health between gay and straight men. But for a lot of other people, it was a letdown. Like, we have this legal status, and yet there's still something unfulfilled. This feeling of emptiness, it turns out, is not just an American phenomenon. In the Netherlands, where gay marriage has been legal since 2001, gay men remain three times more likely to suffer from a mood disorder than straight men, and 10 times more likely to engage in suicidal self-harm.

If they are displaying mild symptoms, it may be best to talk to a doctor via telemedicine to avoid exposing other people to the illness you have, whether it is the flu, a common cold or the coronavirus disease, Dean said.
Any time there's extra money around, competition is fierce. In Maryland, for example, Republican Gov. Larry Hogan has pledged to rewrite the state tax code to lower rates in an effort to blunt the $400 million in higher state taxes residents could otherwise expect.
Perhaps it wasn't my best life decision to go it alone, but I've gotten by OK for the most part. The recent coronavirus outbreak has greatly complicated things, though. It has created additional emotional and logistical challenges. Germ avoidance requires vigilance like never before.

When defending the change in farmer lawsuits, Trump administration officials made the same basic argument they did for most of their regulatory changes: that they were merely reducing frivolous lawsuits and eliminating paperwork, so that businesses can create more jobs.
We all understand the tremendous pressures gay men face to have the ideal body, and the lengths so many of us go to in pursuit of that physique, often at the expense of our physical and mental health, and yet we've normalized it as simply what we have to do in order to be desired, fit in, and gain social capital within the community. And it's so complex because it's not just about bigger men; both thin and muscular men experience body dysmorphia and it shows that no matter what our bodies look like or how much we weigh, we have a tremendous dissatisfaction with our body image and feel like we need to change it.
Great bosses play chess not checkers. Think about the difference. In checkers, all the pieces are basically the same. That's a poor model for leadership because nobody wants to feel like a faceless cog in the proverbial wheel. In chess, on the other hand, each piece has a unique role, unique abilities, and unique limitations. Unforgettable bosses are like great chess masters. They recognize what's unique about each member of their team. They know their strengths, weaknesses, likes and dislikes, and they use these insights to draw the very best from each individual.
Donald Trump may love power plants, but we know the 21st-century future is a green grid, said Constantinides, who chairs the council's Committee on Environmental Protection.
I have long said that the bipartisan COVID-19 relief bill passed in December was just a down payment. We need urgent action on what comes next, because the COVID-19 crisis hits red states and blue states alike, the president-elect said.
In 2006, Inslee, then one of Washington's 10 U.S. representatives, spearheaded an effort to set a renewable portfolio standard in the Evergreen State. In 2007, he co-authored a book called Apollo's Fire: Igniting America's Clean Energy Economy, which, as the title implies, laid out a vision for bolstering the renewable-energy and electric-vehicle industries. In 2009, he co-founded the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition in the House of Representatives. Later that year, he sponsored the federal cap-and-trade bill known as Waxman-Markey.
Kondo says that if something you own ― whether a sweater, a pair of shoes or pair of pants ― sparks joy, you can keep it. If it doesn't, you can thank it for serving its purpose and let it go.
It takes a while for immunity to build up, explained Edgar Sanchez, the vice chairman of the infectious disease group with Orlando Health in Florida. Experts believe it is likely that the first shot alone offers some level of protection against COVID-19, but it's not clear how much — or at what point that immunity boost kicks in.
The prosecution's theory of our case was bullshit, he wrote in a 2012 affidavit. Dustin didn't threaten me. I was not scared of him. Dustin didn't make me do anything, that night or ever. Haynes said he was drunk and high when he shot the women and was not thinking straight. He added that Higgs was angry at him for killing them.

The Lunar New Year is a time when many Chinese return to their hometowns to visit family. Li, the health commission official, said measures were being taken to monitor and detect infected people from Wuhan, and that people should avoid going to the city, and people from the city should stay put for now.
As hazy as the immediate political impact of the shutdown may be, its implications for the future are still more unclear. In the past, those effects have often been ephemeral. The 2013 government shutdown sent ratings for the Republican Party falling to historic lows, but faded quickly from public memory and didn't prevent the GOP from claiming victory in the midterms a year later. As the current shutdown stretches on, however, there's still room for that calculus to change.
HuffPost spoke with O'Leary, who is managing director of impact investment firm Engine No. 1, about distrust in companies, what it will take to make them truly accountable, and how people can push them to take genuine action on climate change.

Sparks: I said to Kate: Give me 24 hours. Let me think overnight. Kate was freaking out. We have our life savings in this. We have our blood, sweat and tears and our love — everything — is in this thing for us, emotionally. I called my mom, who was, is a single mother of five kids. I said, Mom, this is the situation. She said, Micheal, listen. Your [partner] is a doctor. Kate and you have good roots. You're not going to hurt as much as other people. You're going to be OK. Figure out a way to help people. I had this epiphany overnight. I don't know whether it was a dream or sitting up thinking. What do we do when people are sick? I said, start making soups. So I called Kate the next morning.
We used the connective friction of music to spread the feel good vibe throughout the whole morning to help everyone experience Good Mornings from belVita.

Our fear often causes us to stay away. Stop visiting. Being near someone who is experiencing this stage of life may remind us that this could happen to us. We attempt to protect ourselves and others from the sadness and pain we feel when someone dies.
The responsibility of the Senate is to remain operational. You are not protecting an institution by rendering it unable to function, Schatz tweeted, just hours before the Senate gets ready to vote on a coronavirus relief bill. Remote voting must be instituted immediately, so that the federal legislature can do its job, not just today, but for the duration of this crisis.

It's the once actually established part that puts most people off, I think. With our focus fixed on the world circus, absorbed by the trials of our own tumultuous lives, seeking outside solutions, we believe we don't have time for such pastimes as meditation. But if we genuinely knew it was a scientifically reliable answer to all the unhappiness and flailing around we do ... ?

It was in Shinbuya in Tokyo together with my wife. We were standing on this big road and watching all the people crossing the street. It appeared to me the picture of a big river; a river full of people that were waiting at the traffic lights. People are waiting to have green lights again and I think this can be used as a metaphor for our life. Sometimes we have red lights because of obstacles and waiting is a bad feeling but you have to remember one thing: there will be green lights for you again. Just be passionate and you will get a new chance in your life.

There is a big difference between marijuana legalization and two other historic political battles for liberation, of course. Both the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s and the leaps and bounds gay rights have made in the past decade or so were also struggles for liberation ― both of which have not fully been realized, even today. These fights for equality, though, ran a whole lot deeper than the fight to be left alone to smoke a joint in peace. You cannot change the color of the skin you were born with, and as Lady Gaga will tell you, people don't choose to be who they are sexually, they are born that way. But nobody is a born pot smoker. It's just not an inherent part of a person at birth.

As the post-wedding bliss begins to dissipate these last few months, I still feel as if a weight has been lifted. In some ways, marriage was the most significant milestone to usher me into adulthood. My parents have long let go of trying to dictate my life, but these days I've also let go of the resentment I've harbored all these years. I've vowed to take the lessons from this experience to help me be a better mother to my own children ― to let them live normal lives, express their emotions and, most importantly, learn how to be happy.

You have more control over this than you might think.

The mobilization effort paid off. Turnout among Black voters jumped across the state, from Atlanta to smaller cities like Savannah to rural counties with large Black populations in the state's southwest, after lagging behind other groups during the general election.

One particularly infuriating video shows a Black man weeping at what he describes as the documentary's insinuation that one Black man is the No. 1 pedophile on the planet.

The Democrats have generally built alliances with those segments of the employee class who most need government support (those paid below median wage and salary levels) and with those who welcome those social trends such as secularism, urbanism, diverse sexuality and immigration that upset the people who the Republicans target for alliances. The so-called culture wars in the U.S. both reflect and reinforce the class alliances constructed inside the two parties.
Trump spent many weeks shuffling responsibility for leading his administration's response to the crisis. He put Azar in charge of the administration's virus task force before replacing him with Vice President Mike Pence toward the end of February.

They told stories of a neighboring tavern that had since been shut down after the authorities discovered it was a brothel. I smiled and nodded, and googled the term when I returned home. Incidentally, yikes. They went on to describe the proprietor, a woman whose name I can't recall, so I'll make up something dignified. Apparently, if you gave Old Beaver Jugs a single dollar, she'd climb a step ladder in an ill-fitting skirt, hoisting her business district skywards and presenting the patronage with a view of the second thing I had to google that night. Incidentally, yikes.

I avoid touching things on display in a store because I know that if I can touch something in public, other people can, too … and probably have.

There was the revelation that we have two distinctly separate food supplies, one for retail — supermarkets, groceries, and convenience stores — and the other for institutional food service in restaurants, schools, and the like. When these institutions closed, foods designated for them had no place to go and had to be destroyed. At the same time, the millions of people thrown out of work had no means of buying food. Many lined up for hours outside overstretched private food banks.
In 2015, she crusaded against plans to build a liquefied natural gas terminal off the coast of Jones Beach. In 2017, she co-sponsored legislation to mandate 100 percent renewable energy by 2035. Rice proposed legislation last year to prohibit members of Congress from serving on public companies' boards, and fought for more aid to victims still struggling to recover from 2012′s Hurricane Sandy.
The more you can embrace the spirit of thanksgiving and the profound presence of praise and admiration, the more fulfilling your relationship will be.
If you like rice or tapioca pudding, we can pretty much guarantee you will love its lighter cousin: This dish uses chia seeds to turn almond milk into a thick and rich custard. You simply combine the two ingredients along with a couple of flavorings (vanilla, maple syrup, cinnamon) and let the mixture sit for two hours (or overnight), stirring occasionally. A topping of diced persimmons and pomegranate seeds lends vibrant color and flavor.
Ornato also helped arrange Trump's dangerous political rallies where — often in violation of local laws — maskless supporters were jammed elbow to elbow. The rallies were linked to COVID-19 case spikes and deaths from the disease.
2 - A CASE OF 'COMPARISONITIS'
Even worse, the more I studied what other influencers were doing, the more it stomped out my own creativity. I became envious and depressed when comparing my feed to others. I knew better, but I couldn't help but be sucked into the comparison vortex. Why were they able to get that dream shot with no people in the background? I asked myself. How does she always look so flawless while traveling? Why don't I have as many followers? As many likes? More brands that want to work with me?
Americans spend $3.5 trillion on health care every year. That's 17.9 percent of the economy or $10,739 per person. The number of people working in health care more than doubled in the last 18 years — and there's still a health care worker shortage.
So I'm not focusing on Doug Ford. I'm not focusing exclusively on just the fight. What I'm focusing on is … having Ontarians think about where they want to be over the next 10, 15, 20, 30, 50 years. And reimagining Ontario by asking big, bold questions.
You can now understand this is a trend, Perez-Escamilla said. The truth of the matter is the [companies] have plenty of opportunity to self-police and self-regulate, and over and over again we're seeing it just doesn't work.
I don't think at this point she's actually considering it, King said on CBS amid an outpouring of speculation sparked by Winfrey's stirring speech at Sunday's Golden Globes. She loves this country and would like to be of service in some way … but I don't think she's actively considering it at this time.
That dealt a blow to a sector already struggling with thin margins, stiff competition and falling prices.
His research assistant, Daniel Van Noord, found that the two stars in the system shared an atmosphere, like two peanuts sharing a single shell, Molnar said.
To the women on my 2016 campaign who were harassed or mistreated, thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for speaking out. I apologize.
I managed to deflect—something like Sorry, you're not my type—then I spent weeks afterward worried about what he was thinking about me. But he never brought it up. All the bullying took place in my head. The trauma for gay men is the prolonged nature of it, says William Elder, a sexual trauma researcher and psychologist. If you experience one traumatic event, you have the kind of PTSD that can be resolved in four to six months of therapy. But if you experience years and years of small stressors—little things where you think, Was that because of my sexuality?—that can be even worse. On TV I was seeing all these traditional families, James says. At the same time, I was watching a ton of gay porn. ... So I thought those were my two options. Or, as Elder puts it, being in the closet is like someone having someone punch you lightly on the arm, over and over. At first, it's annoying. After a while, it's infuriating. Eventually, it's all you can think about. And then the stress of dealing with it every day begins to build up in your body. Growing up gay, it seems, is bad for you in many of the same ways as growing up in extreme poverty. A 2015 study found that gay people produce less cortisol, the hormone that regulates stress. Their systems were so activated, so constantly, in adolescence that they ended up sluggish as grownups, says Katie McLaughlin, one of the study's co-authors.

According to the National Women's Law Center and its calculations based on the Department of Education's Civil Rights Data Collection, black girls are suspended five times more than white girls, but don't commit more severe offenses. That's why on Jan. 5, the organization shared a video starring black girls portraying students who have been mistreated in schools, such as the South Carolina high school student thrown to the ground by a police officer.

Overall he's been a very adaptable kid because we travel all over ― we're in different time zones and hotels all the time. And he just kind of rolls with it, said Randall. He's been a very solvable kid. When he's upset, you can usually figure out what he needs. So that's made it good because I think if he were more temperamental or difficult, then that would definitely wear on the sleep and recovery piece.
Literally no other Democrat has announced their candidacy for speaker. The question then is: Am I going to do something that would empower the Republican leader Kevin McCarthy? The answer is obviously no.
All MGM Resorts properties follow a health and welfare check operating procedure that stipulates a welfare check be performed after two consecutive days where a do not disturb sign has been displayed on the door and the guest has not interacted in person or by phone with housekeeping or other hotel staff over the same period, the representative said in a statement, Fox TV reported. Our staff reserves the right to enter the room if it is deemed appropriate to conduct a welfare check.
After news of Zinke's resignation, the liberal environmental group Western Values Project launched a website detailing Bernhardt's work with special interests. In an accompanying statement, the nonprofit's executive director, Chris Saeger, called Bernhardt the ultimate DC swamp creature.
Describing the COVID-19 outbreak as the greatest challenge it's faced in its history, the airline said it was unclear when it could begin to resume normal services, given the uncertainty as to when the stringent border controls will be lifted.

By comparison, 57% of the public thinks the government has a responsibility to make sure all Americans have affordable health care coverage, with 24% saying it does not. By a 10-point margin, 45% to 35%, the public supports the idea of all Americans getting their insurance from a single government plan. (Half of those surveyed saw the coronavirus questions prior to the other questions about health care, and half after; the order did not appear to make a significant difference.)
If you decide to step away from friends who aren't supportive of your efforts, it might feel a little lonely at first. Ever wanted to join a bowling league? Interested in doing that pottery class? How about a book club or aerial yoga? Now's the perfect time.
Inslee is the second governor to sign the pledge, following newly elected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D). California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), who was sworn in this week, took a similar pledge ― called Oil Money Out ― but the oath was limited to the oil industry in the Golden State. But Inslee is the third likely contender for the next Democratic presidential nomination to take the pledge, after Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.).
During the team's six-game winning streak, Rodgers has averaged 33 throws per game, 10 less than the 43 he was attempting during the Pack's quartet of consecutive defeats, when they were seemingly out of the postseason race.

Biden will need his negotiating skills to navigate the left flank of his own party as well. While progressives say they've lowered their expectations of what's possible — even under a Democratic Senate — they still intend to push Biden.
Second, I believe that some of the correcting we do can be attributed to how we want to be perceived by others. We want others to view us as a GREAT parent. And a lot of what constitutes a great parent is looking at their offspring and judging them by that. But isn't that unrealistic?!?! God made these kids with their own DNA and their own characteristics. Now don't get me wrong, a lot of who your child will turn out to be will be heavily dependent on the environment that they're raised in and also the things that they're exposed too. But for the most part, they are their own person. So you can't allow for everyone else that is on the outside to dictate whether or not you are a good parent solely based on how your child acts in public. You need to know that you are a good parent because you've taken on the most demanding job with the lowest pay possible. That simple!!!
The Trump administration also said it will immediately begin turning back migrants on the southern border who attempt to cross between official ports of entry. They pinned the decision on efforts to prevent the spread of coronavirus in detention facilities, arguing that the virus could harm Border Patrol agents. There are currently fewer than 100 reported coronavirus cases in Mexico, whereas U.S. cases have blossomed into the thousands.
Make sure you aren't holding your breath
Senate Republican operatives have pointed to Trump's refusal to accept the election results as a major reason for Warnock's and Ossoff's victories, saying it limited conservative faith in the election and deprived them of arguing Loeffler and Perdue's victories were necessary to prevent unified Democratic control of Washington.
A series of local events might make for a flashy start to the year, but the Sunrise Movement's 2020 election push won't end with the monthlong roadshow. The group plans to confront presidential candidates directly, forcing each of the Democratic hopefuls to take a position on the Green New Deal and on whether to accept donations from the fossil fuel industry. It's also preparing to stage protests at as many Democratic debates as possible ahead of the Democratic National Convention in July 2020.

For the Social Registry to be relevant all times and its utility for various government programs the NITI Aayog said it must be linked to birth, death and marriage Registers, to account for migratory changes. The ministry agreed to incorporate the suggestions, shows a note dated May 20, 2016 by Dhruv Kumar Singh, director in the ministry.
The RNC member, though, said he doubts ambitious politicians such as Hawley or Cruz or others will simply sit idly waiting for Trump to decide on another run and will instead actively start building their own operations. That's just human nature, he said.
This first cellular phone was one of two hand-assembled working prototypes (the phone on the left in the photo), demonstrated by Motorola executives Martin Cooper and John Mitchell to an astonished media in the penthouse suite of the New York Hilton - the site of the first CES six years earlier. These DynaTACs were the culmination of a crash six-month project, meant to convince the FCC not to give AT&T a monopoly over the new cellular service. However, with no cellular network to connect to, the demo DynaTACs were also the first cordless phones. In either event, these prototypes led to the Motorola DynaTAC 8000x (right, in photo), the first commercially-available cellular phone which went on sale 11 years later, and triggered a communications revolution.
Alopecia has shaped me and my beliefs. Everything that I teach in my burlesque classes comes from this place of understanding. I think women are beautiful, and it is my job to help them see that. I want to empower women and empower my audience. But in empowering others, I forgot to empower myself. I had to dig deep and practice what I preach. I had to see the beauty in myself. I had to look twice.

The ongoing shutdown has stretched into its fourth week with no end in sight as President Donald Trump has remained steadfast in his demands for some $5.7 billion for a wall along the southern border. He has walked back from plans to declare a national emergency to do so without congressional approval, but Republicans and Democrats remain at an impasse as to how they can resolve the conflict.
Most of the measures in Del Duca's plan go after the largest source of Ontario's emissions: transportation.
Social media lavished praise on Abrams, who founded the voting rights advocacy group Fair Fight Action after her controversial gubernatorial loss in 2016, for her work battling voter suppression and engaging citizens.
There was a room in the basement that I set up as an office, but it turned out that I didn't need a separate room to work, since I was living alone half the time. When my friend Stace, who was also in the middle of ending a marriage, needed a place to stay, I cleared out the unused desk and borrowed a bed from my parents to turn my office into a guest room. I had stayed at my parents' house on an air mattress for the better part of a year, and understood Stace might need a little time to save up for an apartment of her own while paying off her debts.
The only way out of this critical cycle is for both of them to change. And changing yourself when you desperately want someone else to change feels like an impossible task. It takes courage to compassionately communicate our needs or to turn towards a partner who talks about your flaws.
We do not take into account things like health care-related costs, destruction of natural capital, physical and mental distress, Crouch said. It could be stated that these costs are to the best of our ability but they are really a low point to the true total cost.
The center provides soldiers with ergotherapy, or treatment through physical efforts, as well as an Interactive Rehabilitation and Exercise System (IREX), where patients receive therapy through virtual reality and video games. The center also has a meditation room.
The country has 19,343 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 195,000 people have completed testing, according to the White House. (Completed testing means they were tested and have received their results.)
It is possible for children to have SAD, just as it's possible for them to have anxiety, depression and other concerns, said Margaret Cochran, a psychotherapist and licensed clinical social worker based in San Jose, California. It can develop in younger children, but it most frequently manifests, as do many other disorders, around the time puberty begins.
Knowinnovation had been running Sandpits and Ideas Labs for a dozen years, covering topics from protecting data privacy, to re-engineering photosynthesis, to determining the origins of life on earth and in space. For this Sandpit, the challenge was to make the methodology designed for scientific problems work for an economic development problem.
The risk in business is that most corporations get a lot of conflicting demands ― demands to make a profit, demands to do good for society, demands to be good stewards of the environment ― and when faced with all these conflicting demands (some of them are conflicting at least on a short-term basis), the rational response is hypocrisy. They say one thing to shareholders, they say something else to stakeholders. They'll have an annual report for shareholders and a separate corporate social responsibility report. In one they'll talk about the good things they're doing for the world and in the other they'll talk about dollars and cents and profits.
The federal government feared this would concentrate too much power in one province and grow to rival Quebec and Ontario, the authors argue, though there is little historic evidence proving this.
Undeniably, policymakers have ample precedent for the detrimental effects of government dictating rail routes and pricing. So too, as Wilner notes, do the most vocal proponents of forced access.

In 2018, its editors decided the magazine needed an update ― to, as Vanity Fair's Erin Vanderhoof wrote, make a magazine where models were as much participants as objects. The cover of the issue is still as conventionally sexy and tropical as ever, featuring model Danielle Herrington, the third black woman to land a solo swimsuit issue cover, posing in a hot pink bikini in Aruba. But the magazine also includes a nude spread titled In Her Own Words in which models chose descriptors like Truth, Progressive, Artist, Strong, Woman and Nurturer to be written on their bodies. In Her Own Words was shot by a woman photographer, Taylor Ballantyne, with an all-woman crew ― a first for the swimsuit issue.
Not everyone will take the little bit of extra time to do this, and that's what Google and Getty are counting on.
And yet, there is still a critical mass of people defending Kelly. Many of the 2.6 million tweets posted over the last week expressed support for the artist, exposing deep-rooted stereotypes about black women and the way this nation tends to devalue the lives of black girls specifically.
Does that suggest that the stories were invented? Not at all. They didn't invent them, your dialogue partner said. Absolutely right -- if invention refers to an inventor with designs and desires to influence the public. Across the whole world, no one ever invented a story with power to draw souls into awareness of divine grace. People rather discovered the stories, by the grace of God -- together, in communities, according to their most sublime and practical needs. The origins of the stories are shrouded in mysteries that need no probing (although they can withstand any amount of it) because an open heart and mind receive quite naturally the meaning of a godly story. It has nothing to do with fretting its facts. Faith's cares are different. So of course anyone is Christian who feels drawn to the light of the story like a wanderer to a candle in a window. On this question, the Apostles Creed has no vote.
Here's what gives me hope. There's a traditional bifurcation in peoples' lives where they separate themselves into one part moral and one part economic. In other words, traditionally we are in a society of let me maximize my income during the week and then I'll give it away during the weekend, which is best embodied by the Warren Buffett giving pledge [where ultrawealthy people commit to giving away at least half their fortunes].
• Ideal hire: McDaniels. Maybe ideal is the wrong word here, since there are unknowns about McDaniels that cannot be answered until he gets another shot. How has he matured as a coach since his failure in Denver? Can he succeed without Bill Belichick's guiding hand? Regardless, he is almost certain to receive a second chance somewhere, and soon.
Mark Spitz is a self-described middling talent, one of three survivalist members of a Zone One unit sent to clear an area in Manhattan after a pandemic has devastated the world. Spitz struggles with hallucination brought on by a condition called Post Apocalyptic Stress Disorder. His main coping mechanism appears to be learning to adapt to the world as it is now, even if he does have to eat a stand-in for breakfast called morning paste. He's got a gun and a survival pack to deal with the undead who pop up as they search buildings to resettle New York City.
It's common for Russell to have an hour or more of work to do when he gets home, making phone calls and finishing documentation for his patients, so that things go as smoothly as possible until he heads back in the next day. After dinner, we'll unwind with a favorite show and maybe make it through one episode before he falls asleep on the couch.
There have been extensive efforts made by organizers to address this [over the years], hampton told Pitchfork, referencing the #MuteRKelly movement which is discussed in the series. But now there is a larger movement led by black women. There is strategy and social media to heighten it. And more people are paying attention now.
Somewhere in there, perhaps later in the year, is the appointment and confirmation of two new leaders to the Surface Transportation Board (STB). Putting nominee prognostications aside, two things are clear: the STB will soon have five members for the first time ever - with a 3-2 Republican tilt - and the Board, even though the rail industry has asked for a freeze to all major rulemakings, will pick up where it left off in considering a bevy of regulatory proposals.
Another new coronavirus strain has been identified in South Africa, just a few weeks after health officials discovered a more infectious strain shooting across the United Kingdom. The new variant, known as the B.1.351 lineage, has quickly become the dominant strain in South Africa, driving a rapid increase in infections up and down the coast.
So programming for the left brain and relationship coaching for the right brain keeps me sort of balanced. It must be working because I have been married to the same wonderful woman for 40+ years and I have a pretty good relationship with all three of our children.
This story was updated to include earlier polling that showed Rice's favorability rating.
A newly deployed rapid test could help change that. But it's not ready for actual use in great numbers. New Hampshire, for one, received 15 rapid-test machines but only enough cartridges to run two. I'm banging my head against the wall, Republican Gov. Chris Sununu said Wednesday.
The international comparisons come with two very important asterisks. One is that not every country is tracking vaccine administration the same way or with the same accuracy. In many nations, including the U.S., data may be lagging behind actual shots.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some of which cause the common cold. Others have evolved into more severe illnesses, such as SARS and MERS, although so far the new virus does not appear to be nearly as deadly or contagious.
I've saved Milk for last, even though she's just safe this week, because there's a lot to say about the lactose queen. During the premiere, while Trixie, Kennedy, and Bebe seemed happy to be called safe, Milk looked annoyed. This week, she doubles down, whispering angrily to fellow safe queens Trixie and Aja at the back of the stage after her performance as Celine Dion registers as neither spectacular nor disappointing with the judges.
Most of us know by now that public health advice strongly encourages staying home when sick. But for some restaurant workers, this isn't an option because of America's lack of important social services, as Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) pointed out in a recent tweet.
Trump also had little desire to pressure Beijing or criticize its president, Xi Jinping, with whom he wanted to secure cooperation on ending a yearlong trade war before the reelection campaign kicked into high gear. When Trump fielded his first question about the virus in Davos, he enthusiastically praised Xi's response, going well beyond the calibrated risk-reward messaging his aides were encouraging.
It's an injustice, she said. He is being executed for something that he did not do.
That, however, has now changed. Twitter has finally listened. They are no longer idly standing by and allowing the President's account to subvert their platforms rules.
I have lived in D.C. for over 20 years and have never been afraid of going to protest or just being near one. This was different, in no small part because of the way the rioters seemed to be treated like honored guests, posing for selfies on the Senate dais and parading through the halls of the House with the speaker's lectern.
We generally want moms to be 6 centimeters for up to six hours before we say there's an arrest of dilation where they're not actually dilating, Dr. Lisa Levine, a maternal fetal medicine specialist with Penn Medicine, told HuffPost. If in that six hours, they've changed two or three centimeters, that's still enough that we still proceed with things. Levine cautioned, however, that it is not yet clear whether the new guidelines have actually decreased C-section rates nationally or improved outcomes for women and babies.
'Pat, give yourself up. The police know you're behind the bombs. They're going to hunt you down. Times have changed. It's different being on the lam these days, there are cameras everywhere. They'll listen to you if you walk in of your own free will.'
Rejection isn't failure. Failure is giving up. Everyone gets rejected. It's how handle it that determines where you'll end up. -- Richard Castle
Given the severity of the challenge we now face, it would be easy to see 2018 as an irreversible step backward, the sealing of our already grim fate. Yet despite all this, 2018's midterm elections showed that politicians do have a path forward with American voters when it comes to comprehensive action on climate. The message, as it turns out, isn't any sort of brilliant political calculus either. It's a return to kitchen-table issues: jobs and economic opportunity.
Tommy Taylor remembered meeting Nightengale at a movies in the park event in Rogers Park, a Chicago neighborhood that borders Evanston. They hung out over the years.

Instead of asking for what they want, narcissists often arrange events to make them happen, he explained. If your date insists on planning out the entire date, it could be a fun sweep-you-off-your feet experience, but it could also signal something far more ominous: someone who demands that everything always goes their way.
Before you think I'm a technology hating mother who only lets my kids play with pen and paper, I will tell you my kids do play games on my iPad and my phone. But, they do not have their own devices. Why do a 7 and 5 year-old need their own iPads or tablets or kindles? I'm sure many people have their reasons, but they're not enough for me to take out my credit card.

In the U.K., the death toll reached 104 after a further 32 people died in England. They were ages 59 to 94 and all had underlying health conditions, HuffPost U.K. reported. The U.K. has also announced all schools will close on Friday until further notice.
Do a simple Google search for Asian women and you'd think we were on sale. I'm not condemning Asian women for being sex positive, but the pervasiveness of unrealistic and hypersexualized images of Asian women feed the stereotype that Asian women are sexually available to Western men. These images aren't just dehumanizing, they put us at risk for violence. As Rachel Kuo writes: These stereotypes leveraged against East Asian women have been normalized, just like rape culture. These tropes can be found in representations in media, comments that harass us sexually and racially, and ways we're constructed via laws and policy.
Late last year, Walsh and Meridian Township police chief David Hall called Randall-Gay to apologize for how the department had handled her report. Recalling that phone call on Thursday, Randall-Gay said she broke down in tears.
This isn't inviting, it's not persuasive, it's demanding, it's entitled.
Perhaps the hardest thing for me to stop doing is that I make my life much harder than it has to be, because I expect extraordinary things of myself every single day. I was devastated to realize that tiger parenting had taught me how to achieve, but never how to truly live.
I encouraged her to move on, telling her that's why our country is so great: we can change our leaders every four years. Sometimes you get who you want, sometimes you don't, but it all balances out. Then she asked me who I voted for. After I told her, her tone changed. I have to go. I can't talk anymore. I asked her to keep talking, but she simply hung up, and I haven't heard from her since. The election cost me exactly what I was hoping to avoid.

Some corals, however, are able to recover if ocean temperatures return to normal and they're given enough time to build up their health. But it usually takes 10 to 15 years for the fastest-growing species to recover, the paper states, and far longer for the full complement on a reef.
As an adult, Montgomery's life mimicked that of her childhood. She lived in poverty and was unable to care for the four children she had in the course of four years. Her mental health deteriorated. Lisa was so out of touch that she often did not respond to her own name, her lawyers wrote in her clemency petition. She mistook ammonia for vinegar while cooking. Her home was filthy. She could not dress her children or help them with their hair.
She later met Walsh and Hall in person and discussed how the department could change for the better.

I grew up in a household that treated death as a secret. Dead and dying pets were whisked out of the house. When a relative died, my parents would disappear to North Adams, Massachusetts. I only learned as an adult this is where we had a family burial plot. Eventually, I attended funerals, but the details of life-threatening illness were left out.

People who are 13 or older can sign up on MysteryBrand.net to buy virtual mystery boxes, which range in price from $1.99 to more than $1,299.99, and are marketed to contain an item from brands including Apple, Ralph Lauren, Xbox, Gucci, Supreme, Nike and Rolex. After paying for a box, users can open it on-screen to reveal their prize, then either order the item for delivery or sell it back (typically at a much lower price than the cost of the box) to receive online credit and try again. They can also select prizes to create their own box with customized odds, which tend to be far more expensive. Little information about Mystery Brand is publicly available, though the website states its terms and conditions are subject to Polish laws.
I'm the only one saying don't need any more studies, we need to do this right away, he said.
How to get men to care
Despite its socially destabilizing business cycles and income inequality, U.S. capitalism has been able to reproduce itself. This was achieved through the employer alliances constructed within both major political parties.
This might come as a shock, but we're about two weeks into (official) winter and, yes, it's still sweater weather.
RZIM staff members have been badly misled by our secretive board and senior leaders, he continued. RZIM must change its name, remove Ravi's material, repent for its many failures, and provide a restorative response to the harm that Ravi's victims experienced.
The DMV had to accept his form of payment because the US Coinage Act of 1965 says that coins are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes and dues.

Chip Kelly's desire for more control led to his unraveling as coach of Eagles
I will continue to fight for the injustices served those kids by anyone who would negate their sense of self or deny their very existence. Whether we are parents, family, teachers, neighbors, or religious leaders, it is imperative that we assure gender-nonconforming and LGBTQ children they are perfect just the way they are. And we must instill in them the four most important traits of personal leadership: confidence, hope, optimism and resilience.

We did not do a good job in the media, in the music industry, in the community — even in social justice spaces — of saying this guy is a sexual predator and his victims are young black girls with aspiring music careers, said Kenyette Tisha Barnes, co-founder and national organizer of #MuteRKelly.
Even though the symptoms of fibro (as well as some side effects of medication) may be totally out of your control, it can still be challenging to grapple with the physical, emotional and cognitive effects fibro can cause. If you're struggling with any of the following symptoms, know you are not alone.
Sandra: We updated our brand to better reflect our outlook and to incorporate the tenets of our business: authenticity, beauty, honesty, and simplicity. One thing that hasn't changed is my focus on philanthropy and on supporting organizations and businesses that share in our vision of leaving things better than we found them.
We start our first job and sit at the same desk every day. We work with the same people day in and day out, and suddenly, a year or two has flown by and nothing has changed. Not our titles. Not our salaries.
What's needed is for nations to take aggressive action that addresses the linked needs of people and nature.
We need to know when complaints were brought forward and to who, the USOC statement read. This investigation will include both USAG and the USOC, and we believe USAG will cooperate fully. We will make the results public.
In last 24 hrs there've been prominent US voices calling for a stop to social distancing, citing rationale that they're worse than impact of COVID itself, Tom Inglesby tweeted. These big social distancing measures take time to work. … To drop all these measures now would be to accept that COVID pts will get sick in extraordinary numbers all over the country, far beyond what the US health care system could bear.
Democrat Raphael Warnock defeated GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler early Wednesday morning, and Democrat Jon Ossoff is expected to win his race against Republican David Perdue. If both seats turn blue, it will mark the first time since 2010 that Democrats have full control of the federal government.
We strive to maintain as much routine as possible, but the phrase 'expect the unexpected' has become the overarching theme of our pandemic life, Murtaugh said. We are not only dealing with the consequences of the pandemic on our daily lives like everyone else, but because we are both involved in the pandemic response, albeit in different ways, it's become a constant presence in all aspects of our life.
Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking House Republican, warned in a memo to colleagues that objections to the Electoral College results set an exceptionally dangerous precedent.

With the 2015 regular season coming to an end, which coaches and GMs will get their walking papers? Read on for updates, reactions and analysis as the firings of Black Monday roll in.
Trump's tax cut and health care efforts have gotten a ton of attention. But they by no means capture the full extent of his governing agenda ― or the different ways his policies break his promise to American workers.
But what makes a place so meaningful and compelling? HuffPost spoke to a number of travel experts to find out.
I have diarrhea. My stomach problems interfere with my life constantly. This past Thanksgiving I had to sit and watch everyone eat. I was too terrified to eat myself because of diarrhea. It never ends. I sometimes go days without eating because of it. – Melissa G.
The B.C. government said in a statement to HuffPost Canada that it is committed to working collaboratively with First Nations and project stakeholders to provide employment and address cultural concerns.
But don't make firm plans around watching the event. Not only is there no exact date beyond 2022 ― give or take a year ― but no one has ever really made a prediction of this nature before.
Known as direct air capture, such technology could eventually extract roughly half the atmospheric CO₂ that United Nations forecasts show needs to be removed to keep the planet's temperatures from surging to catastrophic levels. The machines essentially function like giant vacuum fans that pull carbon from the air and magnetically attach it to calcium or potassium molecules, transforming the emissions into a substance that can be injected underground for permanent storage, to prevent its return to the atmosphere.
We were misled in economics back in university with the concept of an invisible hand, the unseen forces that move the free-market economy. In reality, the economy is just a reflection of all our individual decisions.
BJP's loss in Delhi on Tuesday follows a string of defeats in Assembly elections in the country. Last year, nearing the end of BJP's five years at the centre and ahead of the parliamentary election, the party lost Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chattisgarh.
Here are some statistics and numbers worth looking at.
Local health departments are overwhelmed, the states don't have extra money, and the federal government hasn't provided enough support.
There is an excellent chance it did that without you, since just slightly over half of American adults own stock. If so, you might be wondering if the opportunity to ride the stock market wave is passing you by while you ponder if you have enough money to invest.
These state programs are pitched to employers as relatively inexpensive ways of preserving and strengthening a social solidarity that includes and so supports capitalism. The programs are pitched to employees as benefits flowing from the capitalist economy if and when they have voted to put the government in Democratic Party hands.
Police officers' apparent involvement in last week's deadly and unlawful insurrection makes clear just how effective the president's onslaught of disinformation has been at radicalizing people — even members of law enforcement — to try to keep him in power by any means necessary. Some elements of the nation's police have closely aligned with Trump and embraced anti-democratic conspiracy theories over the rule of law, and to anyone monitoring these online groups, that's been clear for a long time.
I value and continue to travel to these familiar places because I know exactly what I'll find when I get off the ferry, or finish the six-hour drive through Pennsylvania's vast countryside, he said. The predictability is a draw. That same little downtown may have a few new shops, but it's still basically the same. The lake, the man in the ferry boat who takes us across, all of them are deliciously familiar.
This is a strategy document prepared for the leader of the party, Scheer's spokesman Simon Jefferies said in an email.

Oh, only you knew half of what I've gone through because of this. Half of the tears that have been shed. The disappointment and heartbreak.
Emotions around the holidays and New Year's are at an all-time high if you're single. Watching your friends post lovey-dovey shots on Facebook and Instagram, or change their status to In a Relationship or Engaged, can hit a nerve big-time. It's enough to make you scream, Bah, humbug and turn off both your computer and phone to unplug, but please don't do so on January 3rd, when you have the greater chance of connecting with someone new.
The Bureau of Land Management announced plans to auction off 45,000 acres in southeast New Mexico and West Texas for oil and gas development. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, meanwhile, closed the public comment period on a proposed rule to permanently weaken protections for migratory birds, despite calls from environmentalists to extend that and other comment deadlines because of the pandemic. The rule would codify a 2017 policy change that legalized all unintentional killing of migratory bird species, opening the door for gross negligence by fossil fuel, chemical and agricultural interests.
I'm not sure how I'd be holding up without him at home. - Russell Buhr
A lot of money is invested in marketing. Most producers spend the most on the last 10 days. There are delivery of the prints that need to made by a certain time, so logistically, everything just goes for a toss.
Her endorsement helped nudge Stacey Walker, the chair of Iowa's Linn County board of supervisors, into Sanders' corner. And Ocasio-Cortez also played a role in securing Sanders the endorsement of the Center for Popular Democracy Action.
Both COVID-19 vaccines take time to be fully effective, because they require two doses spaced fairly far apart: 21 days between doses for the Pfizer vaccine and 28 days for Moderna's. Even after the second booster shot, full immunity isn't immediate. Trials measured the efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine at preventing symptomatic spread seven days after the second dose, and 14 days after the second dose of the Moderna vaccine.
Some Democrats are supporting a bill that would provide backpay for people like Howard who work under federal contracts and lost wages because of the shutdown. Such a bill has not made it into law in the past. I hope that Congress will step up to the plate and pass some kind of bill for the contractors who aren't getting anything, Howard said.
Representatives from BJU Press and Abeka did not respond to inquiries about how many schools use their products. However, a 2017 HuffPost investigation found that about one-third of Christian schools participating in private school choice programs used a curriculum created by these two publishers or a similar company called Accelerated Christian Education, amounting to around 2,400 schools. The number of schools using these company's products that do not participate in a voucher program likely amounts to thousands more. (Voucher programs allow students to use taxpayer funds to attend private schools.)

Une manière d'éviter à la population de croire que le coronavirus était devenu plus mortel. Pourtant, le coronavirus Sars-Cov2 a bel et bien déjà muté. Il y a même eu plusieurs mutations. Mais contrairement à ce qu'on pourrait penser, c'est totalement normal. Ce phénomène est si classique qu'il est utilisé par les scientifiques pour tenter de mieux cerner, traquer et endiguer le nouveau coronavirus.
To his most avid supporters, the president has done all these things, and they're not about to let his handling of the coronavirus — and potentially the thousands of extra deaths it could cause — change their minds.
We cannot undo the darkness of our past or our present by protecting Black men who abuse Black women under the auspices of racial solidarity. Furthermore, attempts to let men like Kelly off the hook because of their race implies that Black men are either inherently predisposed to sexual violence or that Black girls and women are inherently incapable of being be victimized.
Doctors, nurses and specialists have been questioning the government's management of coronavirus, including a decision not to postpone local editions last Sunday. Doctors have also called for a policy of total containment and raised doubts over resourcing in hospitals.
On Dec. 10, a judge dismissed all the lawsuits when Stafford was provided all the phone numbers in court by a representative from the state's attorney general.
The more things change, the more they stay the same. This year promises to be a busy one in Washington, with a new administration and Congress promising plenty of action and reform. Confirmation hearings, budget negotiations, tax and regulatory reform and a rumored infrastructure package all dot the map.
It's important to have goals for your money, but don't worry about achieving complete financial freedom immediately.
Sandra: I find the most challenging element to be indecisiveness. I am a professional decision maker, so I find it unsettling when a client is waffling. But, that's the job -- for me to provide enough information and inspiration to engender trust so that we can move forward with decisions. Change can be scary and I ask our clients to make changes every single day.

But wiping out private insurance would also mean ending the insurance arrangements that the majority of Americans now have, either through their employers or through Medicare Advantage, which is the private insurance option for seniors on Medicare.
Again, I know how lucky I am, this is not me having a full-out pity party. I don't need you to get me cheese for my whine. We can get by on my husband's salary, we will be OK, we are all still COVID-free, I wasn't going to teach forever.

Their methodology is reliable and there's not really an equivalent in my opinion, said Ward, a Rice University associate professor of history whose main area of research is human trafficking.
I wouldn't even think about reading the magazines in the waiting room at the doctor's office, and I use my own pen to fill out their forms. When going out to eat, I wash my hands in the restroom immediately after reading the menu and placing my order. During the meal, if I need to touch things like the salt shaker or ketchup bottle, I use hand sanitizer afterward. I bring my own water bottle, but if I order a beverage, I use my own cleansing wipe on the glass.

Lauren Oya Olamina, a 15-year-old hyperempathic girl in the year 2024, leaves her Los Angeles-area home during a post-apocalyptic event. To survive, she practices her shooting aim. She learns to control whose emotions she takes on so the pain of other people's feelings doesn't kill her. She also shaves her head to appear more gender-nonconforming when she travels with an ad-hoc group to a designated safe space in the Pacific Northwest.

Food system failures tend to highlight the lack of control that everyday citizens around the world have over the products they consume ― beyond the fairly passive act of selecting one item at a shop over another. As food supply businesses grow in size and spread across national borders, consumers can begin to feel increasingly distant from the farmers and workers who actually grow and make the things they eat.
Two members of the House of Representatives — Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) and Ben McAdams (D-Utah) — announced they had the virus last week, making them the first known members of Congress to test positive for it.

Investigators on Sunday were trying to determine a motive for the Saturday afternoon attacks in which police say 32-year-old Jason Nightengale apparently chose his victims at random. Police killed Nightengale in a shootout just north of the city about four hours after authorities say he shot his first victim in the head in a South Side parking garage.
It was hard to say no to the money, but I felt like in my position it was better for me to save hundreds if not thousands of people from losing hundreds if not thousands of dollars, he said. It really hurts me to see so many kids losing their money. A hundred dollars to me or to other creators isn't a whole lot, but to these kids it might be their savings or their holiday money.
She calls to say, This is the guys' week. The grandsons are looking after Grandma. I only have to stay one night. I hear the relief, the giddiness, in her voice. This shift in the family pattern is a new beginning, a new way of relating to one another. A weight lifts off my chest.

The crowd skewed younger and whiter with a roughly even gender balance. About half of those present were active in the Democratic Socialists of America, a dues-paying organization that saw its ranks explode in the wake of Sanders' 2016 run.
Buhr: The biggest thing at this point is the way we talk about COVID as if it's either you die in the ICU or you're totally fine — and if you're young and healthy, there's nothing to worry about. I have seen people in their 20s and 30s without previous medical problems in the ICU for six weeks on life support or die. The road to recovery after being even moderately sick — and not necessarily hospitalized — can be long and hard. I see patients in clinic who had COVID and weren't admitted, but three months later are short of breath when walking up a flight of stairs or can't remember anything short-term anymore.
The paper concludes on a somber note and urges global action to address climate change.

I have many clients who come to me during the holiday season with expectations that things in their marriage would be better if they could just get through the holidays. However, January is the busiest month for new divorces. There are many reasons for this, including the fact that people have unrealistic expectations about the holidays.
Try replacing a self-deprecating thought with something more supportive. Donaldson suggested making a list of three things you do really well and three things you love about yourself.
As Nazi U-boats plagued the open sea in late 1940, the U.S. government launched an emergency shipbuilding program. In the first year, the program ramped up production at a breathtaking rate of 20% per month, supplying allies ― and eventually its own combat forces ― with about 6,000 vessels by the time World War II concluded five years later.

The #MeToo movement emerged as an urgent reckoning around sexual abuse and harassment in the workplace, but it's churned up discussions of issues beyond that ― not only sexual abuse outside the workplace, but also a broader culture of misogyny. Those discussions have revolved around the art of abusive and chauvinistic men, and how their visions have defined our culture, often in ways that harmed women. They've also included talk of how white critics have long taken up the air in the room; how they've been empowered to curate an artistic canon by and about them, while people of color, women and other marginalized groups have not.
Replacing your alcohol habit can occur if you manage it incrementally, Silva said. Trying to deprive yourself at first will result in bingeing later. Set up incremental goals of reducing the amount per session then graduate to daily, weekly and monthly.

And don't go out and get just any old CBD oil and try to use that as lube, either. Like oil-based lubricants, CBD oil can break down the latex in condoms and be irritating down there.
Some officers who expressed support online for last week's violence appeared to take inspiration from QAnon, which was a major promoter of the bogus and viral electoral fraud claims that led to the Capitol siege.
That could be true, or maybe it isn't. Brent Donellan, a professor at Michigan State University, points out that Dr. Twenge's research misinterprets data from which her conclusions are drawn. His research finds that there has been no significant change in the self-esteem scores of youth from 1976 to 2010.
If the #MeToo movement is going to amount to sustained culture change ― rather than simply a weeding out of the worst actors in a broken system ― we need to renegotiate the sexual narratives we've long accepted, wrote HuffPost's Emma Gray. And that involves having complicated conversations about sex that is violating but not criminal.
Daniel Seddiqui runs a unique career exploration program, providing students a platform to experience different types of jobs and cultures across America and more importantly gain the confidence to Go For It. But before that, he has worked 50 jobs in 50 states, including a cheesemaker in Wisconsin, a reverend in Las Vegas, a lobsterman in Maine, an Amish woodworker in Pennsylvania, and a weatherman in Ohio.
I contacted success coach Michael Neill for his insight on how to overcome the feeling of being stuck, and he provided me with some insight on the matter: The only thing that can truly get stuck is your thinking. Life is continually changing and flowing, and our businesses and careers change and flow with it. But from time to time we get stuck in a certain mindset or idea of how things should be (as opposed to how they are), and if we start to take it too much to heart, it can bring us out of the creative flow and make it look like we need to make a major life change to get things moving again.
I first realized my obsession with Instagram had ventured into unhealthy territory when I was staging a shot of breakfast in bed at a hotel in Bali. Most people wake up and order room service with sleep still in their eyes, bed head and a makeup-free face. That is the whole point (and luxury) of getting breakfast in bed ― you don't actually have to get out of bed or make yourself presentable to the world. Not for me. I had to shower, put on a full face of makeup, curl my hair and then mess it up a bit so it looked more natural, fluff the blankets and the pillows and set up my tripod. After ordering way more food than I could possibly eat, I painfully posed hundreds of different unnatural ways to achieve the ultimate breakfast goals shot. One hour and 400 photos later, the food was stale, the coffee was cold and I was feeling anything but relaxed.
But when I attempted during both Q&A sessions to ask a question as the only CTE mom present, I was glossed over. Nine of the 10 panelists were men; the one female panelist was an Aspen Institute employee. I'd flown 3,000 miles to be there, and I was ignored.
More serious symptoms may call for phototherapy, or light therapy. Many doctors recommend using daylight replacement bulbs and putting special SAD lamps, also known as light therapy boxes in the space where your child does virtual learning or homework after school.
Parable of the Sower by Octavia Butler (1993)
For many voters who backed Trump in 2016 and continue to back him now, that unconventional style is still attractive, even if it might lead to some poor decisions. They believe Trump is doing the best he can, and they doubt anyone else would have done much better — even Republican governors who had run against Trump in 2016 like Florida's Jeb Bush or New Jersey's Chris Christie, both of whom had experience guiding their states through natural disasters.
In a statement sent to UberEats customers last week, the food delivery service said new options were being made in respond to the coronavirus outbreak.
And, most poignantly, I should have been decorating my house and planning menus for when both daughters would be home and we would all be together as a family. Since we made a family decision in early December that our younger daughter would not fly home from California for the holidays, it was our first Christmas ever where we were not together, and I am so sad about it.
Mary Reed, a Tucson resident who now runs the TEDxTucson nonprofit, recalled being shot three times in 2011 while shielding her then-17-year-old daughter from gunfire.

• Ideal hire: Gase. Again, this might be an answer for several teams. But if the Browns do have any hope of maxing out Manziel's ability, Gase's talented offensive mind would come in handy. He has spent several years under John Fox and at 37 now is viewed as one of the coaching ranks' rising stars. Gase nearly took the 49ers' job last year.
The Critics Choice Awards, which were expected to take place on March 14, too have been cancelled while Zee Cine Awards, the tickets of which were already sold, will now be a television-only event instead of a live ceremony with fans in attendance.
When it was announced that Sandra Oh would be hosting the Golden Globe Awards alongside Andy Samberg this year, people were ... confused.
The likelihood of transmission on a general flight isn't high enough yet for experts to recommend avoiding all air travel. If you're traveling somewhere that's considered low risk, like in the U.S., the CDC recommends practicing good hygiene by washing your hands frequently and avoiding contact with sick people. You can also wipe down common surfaces like your seat and tray table.
It's incredibly difficult for me to enjoy my own accomplishments. Before I started therapy, a setback in my business didn't mean I made a human mistake that I could learn from, it meant I was worthless. Deep down, that's how I felt. And when my business was succeeding, I hid my success because I felt no one could give two shits.
According to experts, law enforcement officers die by suicide at a higher rate than those in other occupations, aside from the military. Common threads between suicides have been cited, including pressures of the job.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has called on the Trump administration to act urgently in facilitating the production of additional medical ventilators needed to respond to the coronavirus pandemic.
The first is an emotionally unavailable partner. When Kris continues to ignore Susan's complaint about him leaving his shoes and socks in the living room, she is likely to start escalating the issue by criticizing him in hopes to get a reaction. She may start calling him a slob and irresponsible instead of kindly reminding him to put his shoes in the closet. The shift from complaints to criticism is understandable, but unhelpful since the criticism makes Kris less responsive.

I took my time walking back down the road. All kidding aside, things look pretty bleak in Randsburg. Most of the houses are missing windows, and it clearly rains every time someone plays that piano. The abundance of antique stores makes you feel as though the town is selling off everything it has left. The locals seem to treat their conditions as most small towns treat a brothel. Everyone knows it's there. Everyone knows what goes on inside, but what are you gonna do, bring it up?
Between 2005 and 2017, CO2 emissions in the U.S. fell by about 14 percent. Administration officials have touted these declines to explain their push to boost fossil fuels, as well as to defend the president's decision last year to withdraw the U.S. from the historic Paris accord on combating climate change.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert, recently said vaccines are designed to recognize multiple parts of the spike protein, making it unlikely a single mutation could be enough to block them. But scientists around the world are conducting research with different vaccines to find out.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, was alerted to the virus around the same time — and within two weeks was fearful it could bring global catastrophe.

That builds trust, reliability, and responsiveness all around. Be brutally honest with yourself about what is triggering your actions which increase annoyance.
None of this should be particularly surprising. Trump has fabricated a vision of the border untethered from reality to sell his wall proposal. But it has become increasingly common, as the shutdown drags on, for Trump's Republican backers in Congress to defend the president's intransigence as a common-sense plea for a long overdue commitment to a more vaguely defined border security.

It's time to start with this trial, said White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, the president's lead lawyer in brief remarks as the proceedings opened in public.
Extensive road closures are seen on a street near the White House.
I'm someone who likes hotels. I like the simplicity of living out of a suitcase, having staff available 24/7, and having someone make my bed! said Boyes. I typically use credit card points for hotel stays, so when I find a hotel that's friendly, pleasant, convenient and good value for using points, I love returning. There are small things that enhance my returning experience, like being greeted at hotels as a returning guest.
I had to get it out. It's 34 years of dealing with this. I was thinking about my family. My grandmother. My great-grandmother. … Fuck it. We're here, he told HuffPost. There's no denying it. There's no stopping it. We're all going to die. We're all going to be buried and scattered somewhere and we're all going to come together. It's like, what are you going to do?

A lot would obviously depend on the details ― that is, precisely how low a Medicare for All proposal would push prices and, critically, how long it would take for those reductions to take place. There's a vast difference between cutting hospital rates by 10 percent over three to four years and cutting them by the same margin over seven or eight.

A motion from the TSSA train workers' union is to be put before the party's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) this month, with the aim of watering down MPs' power of veto over future candidates.
Honestly, I could go on about this forever. I have yet to callus to it all, and I don't think I ever will, no matter how many more kids I meet or how many more times I have to sing Let It Go. It's a remarkable job and such a blessed opportunity. It's the reason I got to move to LA to be with my sister, pursue my career and make immeasurable connections, memories and friends.
When a mob of President Donald Trump's supporters overtook the building, officials rushed a number of lawmakers, reporters and staffers into a protected, undisclosed location.
I can suggest a few expected presenter pairs: Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner. Emily Blunt and John Krasinski (bonus points for marriage!). Constance Wu and Randall Park. Some less expected: Melissa McCarthy and Michael B. Jordan. Lin-Manuel Miranda and Idris Elba. Ryan Reynolds and Tiffany Haddish. Write them some good jokes and we'll tune in.
Anybody that needs a test, gets a test, Trump said on March 6. They have the tests. And the tests are beautiful. He said the same day, Anybody that wants a test can get a test.
Many are inspired by Japanese philosophies. For instance, there's the ancient Japanese philosophy of wabi-sabi, which Kondo described as experiencing beauty in simplicity and calmness and said is considered a virtue in Japanese society. Wabi-sabi comes from Buddhism and is often described as the art of finding beauty in the imperfect, impermanent and incomplete, as House Beautiful notes.

Food companies spent $11 billion on television ads in 2017, and 80 percent of that, about $8.8 billion, was spent on their unhealthiest offerings ― sugary soda, fast food, candy and unhealthy snacks. What's more, black teens are more than twice as likely as white teens to see commercials for these items, the study found.

Neither of the vaccines that have been approved for use in the U.S. contain the live virus that causes COVID-19.
President Donald Trump on Saturday accused medical professionals of thoughtlessly wasting the protective masks now in short supply, but those who work in emergency rooms have a very different story to tell.
The political capital that needs to be invested, the intense gathering of allies to push this through Congress, just requires an all-out effort, Inslee said. That's not going to be done just because somebody now decides they're interested in climate change. It takes someone who's frankly cared about it for years and years.

Ford's government did introduce a climate plan in 2018, but Ontario's auditor general says it'll likely fail to meet its targets. Environment Minister Jeff Yurek has since called the plan a draft.
Your ability to turn towards your partner during conflict
You cannot make decisions about the future, without an understanding of the past. Our country is now stuck in the present moment, with no understanding of the past and no vision for the future.
It is what happens when governments lack the courage to defend the interests of Canadians in the face of a militant minority, the United Conservative leader said. The timing of the decision is not a coincidence.
As a 27-year-old woman [with] both fibromyalgia and endometriosis I often suffer from really bad hot flashes. It's embarrassing to suddenly start fanning myself or taking off certain items of clothing in an attempt to alleviate the discomfort. – Emily G.
I think part of what I wanted to make was a female-led revenge movie, but with a real woman inside it. And we're so used to seeing angry men in movies punch a stranger, and we never think, That poor guy! What if he has a family? He's bleeding on the floor! We're like, Oh, poor [male protagonist]. He's really hurting. We know that he's hurting because we don't care about the people he punches or murders or whatever. So I'm conscious, for example, of the fact that Bo, I think, as far as people are concerned, is just the heartthrob of the movie. It's so important they don't know that he's been cast in a subversive way.
The city's 2020 Democratic primary cemented climate as a winning issue. Green New Deal backers won more than half a dozen seats in the state legislature and in the U.S. congressional delegation, unseating entrenched incumbents.
I'm the youngest member of House leadership. And I have a responsibility to every member of the freshman class to represent their needs and their concerns. So my role is a little different in that way from the role of the progressives in the caucus who don't have those responsibilities.
Things did get real, as the account promised. Real snarky.
When it's really bad, I spend some days sick to my stomach, with very little strength and lacking the motivation to even get out of bed.
So yes, there is the possibility of getting sick if someone infected with COVID-19 is standing right beside you and sneezes while you're both searching for a ripe avocado, or if a droplet from an infected person lands on a package of cereal that you touch and then proceed to touch your face before washing your hands. But we still don't know how much of the virus needs to be present in order for transmission to occur.
Sixteen major climate- and weather-related catastrophes caused a record $306.2 billion in damages and killed at least 362 people in 2017 as the United States suffered its worst wildfire and hurricane seasons in modern history, according to a report released Monday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
I said I made a mistake trusting that he would not use force. ... The extent to which I misspoke was, my public statements were that we were doing this all the wrong way, Biden said. We should not have done it the way we did it, and we should be supporting the troops if they're in there, but we should be getting an international coalition to support this, etc.
It takes one hell of a lot of nerve to name the #BuffaloDeclaration after an animal sacred to First Nations, when most of their complaints stem from how Canada keeps stopping them from rampantly screwing over Aboriginal populations, and destroying the land. #abpoli #cdnpoli — Jeff Rybak🍁 (@JeffRybak) February 21, 2020
Past examples include the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate-change agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and the Iran nuclear deal, which included the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany, he said.
Taraji P. Henson is a 47-year-old black woman starring in an action film.
At a press conference Wednesday, de Blasio said that while there may have been climate change deniers in New York City before Sandy, he doubts there were any left afterward. The world, he said, is facing a painful, horrible reality and the city will no longer participate in a system that endangers our very own people.
It is impossible for us to predict what the prevalence of the virus will be in any given country or part of the U.S. at any future date, she said. Community transmission is now occurring in the United States, so at some point soon it may be no more risky to leave the country than to stay where you are. Some public health experts advocate restricting travel as a means to stop the global spread of the disease, but that is a public health measure not aimed at individual safety.
I'm just an individual who doesn't feel that I need to have somebody qualify my work in any particular way. I'm working for me.
And, Robertson assures, you'll look just like the chefs you see on TV! Because sometimes a little swagger is all you need to feel more like you can handle the heat in the kitchen. That perception of yourself might be just what you need to start feeling like you're doing the right thing.
There are Libyan rogues who invariably pop out of the past.
Trump stewed about the collapse on his Feb. 26 flight back to Washington and lashed out at aides over comments made by a top CDC official, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, during a briefing the prior day, when she warned Americans that they would have to prepare for fairly severe social distancing.

Nick Kristof, your words and cares have brought light and life to souls in untold numbers. To call yours gifts of God can turns our face toward the One. Of course you are Christian.
Senning suggested applying what he calls the rule of too, telling HuffPost, If you hear that little discretionary voice in your head asking: Is this too much? Is this scent too strong? Is this hemline a little too low or too high? Is this fabric a little too sheer? Is this knot in my tie a little too creative? you should err on the side of caution.
Former Bucs GM and current ESPN analyst Mark Domenik tweeted the following immediately after news of Smith's firing broke: With Lovie Smith fired I would expect Dirk Koetter to be named head coach within the week. They still will interview a few other candidates.
Recall, Trump recklessly pulled the U.S. out of trade deals and diplomatic agreements; started a futile and costly trade war with China; and alienated global trading partners. And, of course, he failed to control a public health disaster that's led to the deaths of more than 360,000 Americans, increased hunger and poverty, and destroyed untold numbers of businesses. The White House's draconian immigration crackdown, meanwhile, discouraged people who might have come to the U.S. to start a company or further their education from emigrating here. Just this week, there was another embarrassment involving Chinese companies and the New York Stock Exchange.
If you are a Baby Boomer still hanging around, the Millennial sense of idealism might remind you of what it felt like to have a purpose - like protesting the war. They could also just make you feel old. You might even feel sorry for them. The Millennials, after all, haven't yet had their idealism crushed by the need to conform in order to support a family and pay a mortgage.
In 1955, a milk arsenic poisoning case was linked to the deaths of more than 100 children. Soon afterward, in a separate scandal, scientists documented horrific symptoms among people who had eaten seafood in Minamata in southern Japan. Minamata disease, discovered in 1956, was connected to the release of mercury in industrial wastewater from a nearby chemical factory.
It's also a fact that sometimes people ― even those who consider themselves casual or social drinkers ― can go overboard. That may lead to a desire for a break from drinking altogether or just a plan to cut back. (Looking at you, Dry January participants!)
For months, I agonized over tiny touches, dug deep into my childhood to find the right details, and feared if it was not good enough, it would all be a missed opportunity.
There's a lot of fear surrounding the coronavirus. The pathogen, which is spread through respiratory droplets, has infected people across the globe and here in the United States with the disease officially known as COVID-19.

HuffPost Australia reports that at least 450 people in Australia have tested positive while five people have died after contracting COVID-19.
The first Women's March, in 2017, was a reaction to the election and inauguration of President Trump. The following year, it was a push for the polls for the 2018 midterm election. This year, with no upcoming national election, the movement has had to rethink its purpose — amid ongoing controversy over connections between some of its leaders and the anti-Semitic, anti-gay Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. Some women who have marched before are sitting it out or attending separate rallies unaffiliated with the national organization. Thousands of others, though, will be in Washington, D.C., on Saturday.

A day before the 2018 Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue dropped, the official SI Swimsuit Twitter account tweeted One day above a photo of a woman's midsection, cutting off her head and her feet. It felt almost too on the nose ― an image of a woman's body meant to tease an audience, erasing the parts of her that allow her to communicate and move about in the world.
Houck: He was all bright and cheery. What do you want? What are you so happy about? He said: I know what we're going to do. A lot of our chefs were being laid off or they were put on part-time stuff. We're going to call our crew and we're going to start making soups and bread, and we're going to start delivering it into the community. And we did. That first week we got 175 meals into the community, and by the end of September we had sent out over 60,000 meals into the community. We had put it out in the paper and said: Anybody who has been laid off, or if you're sick, or if you're a frontline worker, or if you're pissed off about this thing and you want soup, let us know. We'll get it to you.
But whether that co-operation extends to watering down the federal carbon pricing regime for Manitoba seems unlikely.

The rapid development and approval of COVID-19 vaccines for use in the U.S. has been truly remarkable. Millions of Americans have already received at least one dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines (two doses are required for both). And public health experts are working hard to improve distribution across the U.S.
The fresh $900 billion in relief Congress passed last month includes a welcome $300 per week boost to federal unemployment benefits ― half that of CARES, and set to expire on March 14 ― along with a $600 per person check for households making less than $75,000 a year.

Most Americans think the government should be taking action: A 62% majority say the federal government has a lot of responsibility to help manage the outbreak, with 60% saying the same of their state government, and 53% of their local government. About half, 47%, say regular people in their community bear a lot of responsibility. Just 35% say the same of big companies like Walgreens, Target, Walmart and CVS, whose efforts Trump stressed in a recent press conference, and just 27% say the same of local business owners.

We can thank public health far more than we can thank medicines, Lieberman said, noting that by the time antibiotic use became widespread after World War II, mortality rates had already plummeted. In 1870, the average person in Europe or America lived to their mid-30s. Life expectancy rose steadily from there, reaching 58 to 65 years in 1950.

That Save America PAC could give him $150 million or more to help lay the groundwork for a 2024 presidential run. Such committees, however, have few restrictions, and he could just as well use the proceeds to pay for his personal expenses or even give himself a seven- or eight-figure salary.
Asked about the accusations on Tuesday, Inslee said the Tacoma facility had already begun permitting and that his administration was going to follow the law and allow the process to play out, though he said he requested additional carbon dioxide analyses of the project.
Another unfortunate aspect of being a germaphobe during a pandemic is that I fear not only potentially contaminated surfaces like door handles and shopping carts, but people, too. Anyone could have the virus and might pass it on to me. It's difficult for me to admit this, but when I'm in public and others are nearby, I am deathly afraid of them. I don't want anyone near me, six feet or otherwise. Because of this, I've only gone out a handful of times in the last six weeks, when absolutely necessary.
Students at a Jacksonville, Florida high school protested on Monday demanding that their African American history course be taught year-round.
Its chief rival, the BJP, ran a divisive and mostly joyless campaign focused around the presumption that the integrity of the Indian republic was compromised by a group of peaceful demonstrators camped out on a national highway, near the neighbourhood of Shaheen Bagh along Delhi's south-east border. Much of the BJP's campaign was focused on the controversial new Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), that critics say violates the secular tenets of India's Constitution by making religion a basis for citizenship and the BJP claims is in national interest.
I am sure that my depression will rear its head again in the coming years and I will fall into old patterns from time to time. My marriage will have difficult days ahead; my mother has already begun speculating whether I am pregnant or not, and when the time comes, I will torment myself over what it means to be a good mother. But for now, I share this story because it is worth celebrating a rare moment in which two vastly different Asian generations can reach a deep understanding of the love they have for each other. For now, I feel free.

There's a running joke among the Style editors here at HuffPost about who has the heaviest handbag. It's easy to blame our back-breaking loads on iPhones, magazines or heels. But when we dump the contents of our purses out in search of gum, those aren't the only things weighing us down ... it's our makeup.

When my clients are feeling highly anxious, I guide them through grounding exercises that connect them with tangible objects in their environment, shifting attention away from the chaos in their head and toward the details in their physical space, Dickman explains. But most importantly, by cleaning, cutting, measuring and organizing ingredients, you can engage in all five senses to mindfully interact with each component of a meal. For example, you can feel the water flow over your hands as you wash produce, listen to the sound of your knife chopping, smell the aroma of fresh herbs, taste the zing of citrus and then see the full array of ingredients laid out in their respective bowls, she adds.

And this is why T4A launched Political Entrepreneurship: building leadership in a public private ecosystem, which was presented to global innovative entrepreneurs last October at Opportunity Collaboration. It was exciting to see the development of a productive dialogue on public policy from the side of entrepreneurs.
The test mandates, 1. That State Action should be lawful - i.e. with the backing of enacted law. 2. It must pursue a legitimate purpose. 3. It must have rational connection to the object sought to be achieved by the law under which such state action happens. 4. Such state action must be necessary to achieve such objective. And 5. Such state action must be proportionate i.e. the least restrictive of all means available to achieve such objective, Prasanna said.

Why are you searching for a job when you could be starting a company or doing freelance work? What's holding you back from independence? Fear? Risk? The unknown?

Look at the facts. Since the Department started taking borrower defense seriously after the collapse of Corinthian and ITT, it has received about 99,000 claims. 98.6 percent are from students who attended for-profit schools.

Howard had to ask his landlord for leniency on his January rent, paying only $400 of the $800. He also asked for more time to pay his electric bill ― an indignity he says he shouldn't have to suffer.
Ramirez called out Skinny Coffee Club as one particular culprit. The company sells coffee that's been reformulated to burn fat, boost antioxidants with many more benefits, according to the brand's website, promising noticeable weight loss within a week, higher energy and an improved complexion. However, what any coffee does is act as an appetite suppressant and provides energy, giving the impression that you are 'healthier,' she said. Once you stop these products, you'll go back to your old habits and, thus, there is no permanent weight loss.

The core promise of a political campaign ― often betrayed, sometimes ignored ― is the simple idea that your life doesn't have to be like this. Things are bad and they don't have to be. Barack Obama's tremendously galvanizing 2008 campaign was premised around a core of hope, the hope for transformative change that could erase smallness and stagnation and travail. In these uglier times, rage may be a better motivator.
Don't just create a budget ― create a realistic budget, said blogger Kumiko Love, aka The Budget Mom. Your budget should be created based on what you are actually spending, not what you want to spend.

The general consensus among health experts is that sanitizing the groceries is overkill, but it's just something I need to do right now. I'm not the only one, either. COVID-19 has heightened nearly everyone's awareness of germs, and people who might have previously thought my germ-avoidance tactics were extreme are doing similar things. A few have even produced YouTube videos with instructions on how to sanitize the groceries.

For instance, I find over and over again, that people seem to have barely any idea of how their retirement money is invested. They just don't have any clue when I ask.

O'Rourke had won plaudits for taking the No Fossil Fuel Money pledge administered by the watchdog group Oil Change USA, which bars politicians from accepting contributions over $200 from PACs, executives, or front groups of fossil fuel companies. In December the investigative news site Sludge found that he accepted $430,000 from individuals working in the oil and gas industry, 75 percent of which came in the form of donations over $200. Fossil fuel executives made at least 29 large donations.

This is a word we made up to convey one of the principle concepts of a Sandpit. The Sandpit uses an iterative approach: each time a group presents its thinking, the other groups give feedback--highlighting the positive attributes and pointing out, constructively, the problems or gaps in thinking that must be addressed. In this way, every participant's fingerprint is on every project, and the entire group, while competing for funding on individual projects, is also working in solidarity to solve the overall problem.

Second, we must pull our current youth helmets from shelves and create new ones specifically designed for kids between 14 and 17 years old. This includes correcting current design defects, such as weight. For decades, football parents have been led to believe that youth helmets adequately protect their children, but this gear wasn't designed with kids in mind ― it's merely a smaller version of what professionals use. We recommend bringing in an outside organization to promulgate sports equipment standards. This would allow independent researchers, engineers and advocates to act on behalf of consumers' best interests, rather than putting our trust in the companies who profit from the products we buy.

Verbal abuse is very, very common. It's absolutely got worse. There's more people, we are busier than ever. Drink and drugs plays quite a big factor in things and that's more readily available. In 2015 I was called to a patient listed as fitting in a Budgens supermarket. It wa very busy, six o'clock in the evening, lots of people around. When it became apparent that he wasn't fitting, he realised we knew and started verbally abusing us. We thought let's get him out of the shop and that will calm him. However, when we got him outside the shop he became more and more aggressive. And then he kind turned. I said to my crewmate get back in the ambulance and we will lock the doors. He came up to my window, was smashing the glass saying 'I'm going to kill you'. I actually though he was going to strangle me. It was very, very frightening. He started jumping on the bonnet saying to my crewmate 'I'm going to kill you both'. It was a very busy junction, there must have been a hundred people around and nobody wanted to intervene. One girl that picked the phone up, dialed 999 and said 'he's trying to kill the crew and smash the ambulance'. He heard her say that and chased her into a very busy road, jumped her and smashed her face into the floor. She was a deputy head and she was the only person who decided to help.

As a result of this increasing violence in federal prisons, Union officials and Pennsylvania lawmakers have advanced the idea of arming prison guards to keep them safe while on the job. Senator Bob Casey, a democrat from Pennsylvania, co-sponsored a bill which would permit many prison staffers to be armed with pepper spray. According to Casey, Guards face thousands of assaults every year, so it's important we give them the necessary tools to stay safe on the job.

At least 13 law enforcement personnel from eight states reportedly attended the riot and are under investigation for their alleged roles in the unrest — including a police chief and an officer wearing a hat with the text, Trump 2020; Fuck your Feelings. Many former cops joined the mob, too; a retired Oakland officer who rioted told local media that the insurrectionists would accept the legal consequences of their actions if the Democrats who committed fraud take the criminal charges of treason. A former North Miami Beach officer even livestreamed from inside the Capitol, telling his viewers, The people give the power. And we're here to take it back.

With the spotlight now on Tarantino, news outlets are digging up other disturbing moments from his career. Thurman wasn't the only actor he'd choked during filming ― he'd also choked Diane Kruger for a scene in Inglourious Basterds. Perhaps most damning, audio surfaced from a Howard Stern interview in 2003 in which Tarantino not only defended director Roman Polanski against his notorious rape charge, but insisted that his 13-year-old victim wanted to have it.

If you were discussing something serious ― or something that needs to be resolved eventually ― table the discussion for later or the next day, when cooler heads prevail.
Even as the two agencies fought, there was no influential voice in Trump's orbit pushing him to act swiftly on the pandemic. Trump had surrounded himself with loyalists and few in the administration, including national security adviser Robert O'Brien, were able to redirect the president's attention. In mid-January, meetings were being held at the White House, but the focus was on getting U.S. government employees back from China, which was still playing down how contagious the virus was.
Those goals are easier to say than do. Burma is no exception. But saying them is certainly a welcome contrast to an American election year dominated by negative personal attacks and catering to special interests.

That must have cost a few hundred thousand dollars.)
When the relationship system is unbalanced (excessive ballast keeping the risk so low that there's insufficient challenge, play, change or spontaneity) or insufficient grounding which exposes the couple to extreme financial, emotional, physical, or material risks, the system will be disrupted with potentially highly damaging consequences. The challenge in cases where there is any type of a relational imbalance is not to look for an either/or, my way or the highway solution, but rather to identify the needs of the relationship as opposed to focusing on the accommodation of either partner.

The world's oceans in 2017 were the hottest ever recorded, scientists revealed in a new study published on Friday.
I remember this one time when I was teaching some elderly women a dance for an upcoming show they were having. They were so delightful to work with. I typically would bring my daughter with me to these rehearsals. She was about 3 or 4 at the time when I was teaching and I would usually bring toys with me to keep her occupied. This one particular day I didn't. I was already annoyed that I left the toys at home and I was running late so I couldn't turn back. I went into the rehearsal feeling irritated. As I started rehearsing with the ladies, my daughter kept going in between the dance lines and trying to dance with them. I kept giving her the eye (most Moms know what that is) but she wasn't catching it. Finally, I went and got her and put her on my hip while I was teaching. For some reason she was more active than normal and me being irritated did not help at all. I gave the ladies a five minute break and then I took that time to talk with her. While talking with her, one of the ladies, Ms. Mary, came up to me and said Baby, let her be a child. She isn't a statue so she isn't going to be still. Just let her be. Well that shut me up for the evening. I think Ms. Mary sensed that I was annoyed and bothered.

As a parent who lugs around a kit filled with sugar tablets, a glucose monitor and a preloaded insulin pen just in case my son's OmniPod fails, I have unwillingly become the go-to person among my peers for any diabetes-related information. It's almost like I'm stuck in a twilight zone of people trying to give me solace by telling me it could be worse or offering horrible comparison stories about their Aunt Jane who died 10 years ago from Type 2 diabetes.
Most of the Democrats likely to run for president in 2020 are now giving their support to a Green New Deal. Sen.

Of course, it is still possible for you to get arrested in California for smoking a joint, but you've really got to try hard for it to happen. If you were stupid enough to travel up to Yosemite National Park and spark up a doobie in front of a park ranger, you would get arrested and tried under federal law for doing so, since the park is federal land. They've even got their own jail and federal judge, so you wouldn't even have to leave to park for this to happen. But short of blatantly smoking weed in front of a federal law enforcement officer on federal land, nobody in California has to fear such a prospect again. Of course, there are still state and local laws banning consumption in public, but it's hard to see the cops caring much except in the most egregious cases (Please just put out the joint, sir or ma'am, and move along is much more likely). The federal government might also conceivably attempt to bust growers, middlemen, or retailers, but the sheer size of the market means it would be absolutely impossible for them to even make the attempt at arresting people for merely possessing or consuming marijuana ― hopefully, ever again. Adults in the Golden State can now buy marijuana with only slightly more hassle than it takes to buy a sixpack of beer, a bottle of antihistamines, or a pack of cigarettes. Which is as it should be. Everywhere.
The idea that we have to be athletic and muscular with thin and chiseled bodies is spoon-fed to us in our early teens and sometimes before that. We're told our whole lives that we should aspire to achieve a certain physique and that we should normalize diet and gym culture in pursuit of that body at whatever cost it may have on our physical and mental health.

But employer coverage is still popular, at least according to industry polling. As the 2017 fight to repeal Obamacare and pretty much every other health care battle has shown, change of any sort is scary.

Republicans who called the storming of the Capitol going too far, but said the rioters had a point:
No major Republican has felt a similar need to affirm loyalty to capitalism; everyone quite rightly assumes it. Yet the two major U.S. political parties' shared celebration of capitalism raises basic questions about U.S. society that deserve more attention than they get.

The mainstream media doesn't really know what to make of it all. They run bemused stories which still fall back on stoner humor, or they offer sober assessments of how the new marijuana economy will change things, or they still attempt to warn of the direst of consequences. Almost none of these stories hinge on the aspect of sheer liberation, however.

In just the past year, Inslee kiboshed two major fossil fuel projects and added new regulations on existing infrastructure. Last January, he personally intervened to reject permits to build what would have been the nation's largest oil-by-rail facility at the Port of Vancouver. He signed a bill in March putting a new tax on pipelines, forcing the operators to fund a state program to protect against oil spills. In May, he blocked construction of a $680 million coal-export terminal on the Columbia River.

Rice, who has built a strong base of support over the last five years, has not faced a primary challenger since she made her inaugural bid in 2014. The former Nassau County prosecutor's votes in favor of environmental legislation and against deregulatory efforts earned her a 100 percent score on the League of Conservation Voters' 2017 ranking. Her lifetime score is 95 percent.

So much exhaustion. So much despair. Some glimmers of hope. (Here's lookin' at you, incoming Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff.)
Seikatsu Club has sought to reassure producers that it will continue buying from them so that the next generation will feel comfortable taking over from their predecessors and continue producing, says Ito. Still, she worries that in the future it will become harder and harder to sustain the same level of agricultural production. It's the co-op's responsibility to continue working on that issue, she says.
I am optimistic based on the basic science information previously described that the vaccine will at least reduce transmission risk, Robinette said. For now, the safe thing is to assume that only the person who has received the vaccine is protected from COVID-19.
As things stand, the Modi government remains deeply invested in the Social Registry. Manoranjan Kumar, the man who first penned the foundational note that kicked off the process, has retired but his successors in bureaucracy continue to support the Social Registry in the slogans of the Modi regime.
Bennett College reported surpassing a $4 million fundraising goal from 2017 to 2018 and saw an increase in first-year enrollment, according to the Associated Press. The college also said its financial audit for that year came back clean, per AP.
A few other depotting dos and don'ts:
Similar assumptions exist around organic foods. Organic foods are sometimes deemed healthier than their conventional counterparts, but that's not necessarily the case, Peacock said. Just because a box of cookies is made from organic flour and sugar doesn't make it any less a box of cookies. It could even have more calories, fat, sugar, sodium, carbs, and ingredients overall than the mass-market regular brands.
Boot praises Ocasio-Cortez as down-to-earth and quick-witted, but criticizes her for caring more about ideological correctness than factual correctness. Then he ends with a comparison to Palin that neither woman will appreciate.
Amit Tewari, founder of vegan burger chain, Soul Burger, acknowledged what these companies were doing but said it's not enough.
Once you've subtracted your essential expenses from your income, the money that's left over is available for discretionary spending. This part of your budget has probably changed a lot in the past year.
The pandemic has also impeded Montgomery's family's visits. Diane Mattingly, Montgomery's sister, said that prison officials canceled her last scheduled visit with her sibling because of a COVID-19 outbreak. She is afraid she will never see her again.
We return to the doctor soon after for invasive testing ― a big needle plunged deep into my abdomen to capture some of the baby's cells and solve this tortured mystery.
Market purists bring up the idea of Adam Smith's invisible hand. They'll say it's not for us to debate responsibility and sustainability, that every company should focus on maximizing its share price, its profits ― that ultimately they are accountable to the bottom line.
I never thought my 35th year would find me single. I can see that I'm a misfit in a world of speed dating and swiping right and perusing the dozens of possible matches waiting for you on your phone. But if this season of my life has taught me anything, it is to be true to yourself and value strength of character and steadiness and honesty above all else. I'm grateful for the chance to start all over and do it right. And I don't care how long it takes. The truest pieces of a life well-built always grow slowly.
8. You are part of a team that values, appreciates and acknowledges you. The sum is greater than the parts, and being on a team that is properly managed, will help bring out your strengths and allow you to become a more effective employee. When your team appreciates and acknowledges you, you will want to work harder, do a better job and feel more fulfilled.
The Congress Party, which ran Delhi for 15 years from 1998 to 2013, was rendered irrelevant in this election, ending up with zero seats again. There were a few rallies that Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi addressed, but these barely registered with voters.
9. You jam-pack your schedule with other obligations, leaving little time for each other.
Several highways around Santa Barbara County were closed early Tuesday, including stretches of U.S. 101. As daylight broke on the West Coast, a fuller picture of the damage became clear: mud, branches and large boulders clogging roads and crashing into homes. In another image, a mud-coated car appears tangled in a tree.
It motivates producers to continue their decontamination efforts while still producing products, Ito says.
USA Swimming sent a letter to the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee formally requesting the Tokyo Summer Olympics be postponed until next year due to the coronavirus outbreak and related disruptions.
It all started while flipping though a well-known magazine that uses illustration prominently on their cover and interior. After going through a big stack and counting the number of illustrations they printed and what percentage were drawn by women, we saw there was a big bias in hiring. And it seemed to be similar for some other publications as well.
Parrow said he tried different options in an attempt deny who he is, including gay conversion therapy ― a program based on the idea that gay, lesbian or bisexual people can change their sexual orientation if they pray enough. It has been thoroughly discredited by all major mental health associations, and the American Psychological Association says it can have serious potential to harm young people because it attempts to make people believe being gay or bisexual is a personal and moral failure.
The nation's third-hottest year on record is now officially its costliest for billion-dollar natural disasters.
Maybe the most surprisingly effective element for Green Bay, though, has been the running game, once completely dormant following the season-ending injury to starting back Eddie Lacy, along with a knee injury to backup James Starks.
Too many coincidences: A new terror-filled thriller on Ireland's troubles with links to Libyan mischief, as the real detention in Lebanon of a Qaddafi son makes headlines, while a study reveals connections between then Neanderthal migration from today's Middle East to the Emerald Isle.
But, yeah, he totally used to be a boy, right?
Hawaii's Iolani School offers students multiple opportunities to interact with kupuna or elders. For example, the One Mile Project teaches students about issues facing older adults and then turns classroom learning into community services projects with elders.
Taking into account both the challenge and the redeem-a-bad-look runway, some of the other results are puzzling. Trixie Mattel is safe after a terrific Dolly Parton impression, I'd imagine because it's too expected for her (though personally, I'd have put her in the top three over Bebe). Aja joins her; her Amy Winehouse is tame, but a spectacular reworking of her Princess Disastah runway keeps her in. Chi Chi DeVayne falls just outside the bottom two, even though her Patti LaBelle is a laugh riot. The problem seemingly lies with her reworked neon look, which judge Carson Kressley knocks as basic. Her dancing diva sister Kennedy Davenport is not as lucky, as a poorly executed Janet Jackson impression lands her in the bottom two.
Some London subway stations are set to close and 20,000 troops have been put on standby as the UK prepares to take the next steps to control the coronavirus. HuffPost UK reports that buses in the capital will be reduced and people are being urged not to use public transport for anything other than essential journeys.
I think somebody was able to get through to him and convince him that even if it's only performative, he needed to do something to mitigate the damage he caused ― only to himself, of course, because that's all he cares about, she told MSNBC's Joy Reid.
At one campaign stop this week, Ossoff said Perdue's ridiculous attacks blow my mind. He scoffed at the claim that his policy ideas, which align closely with Biden, amount to a leftist lunge. But the challenger agreed with the incumbent on how much the Georgia runoffs matter.
The rapid spread of the disease is now making a clear case for why this initiative would be harmful to vulnerable Americans. According to one estimate, the cost of COVID-19 treatment can exceed $20,000.
New Year's resolutions often include finding love.
They never wanted that project, and they were not willing to employ any political or diplomatic leverage against a political decision by a U.S. administration to violate the spirit of NAFTA, which was about, in part, open access to the U.S. markets for our energy exports.
All but one Republican voted to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, despite him wailing through his confirmation hearing about revenge-minded Democrats besmirching him. In the first two years of Trump's presidency, amid dozens of judicial confirmation votes, there have been only two cases of GOP senators not supporting one of the president's court picks on the Senate floor: Sen. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) voted present on the Kavanaugh vote and Sen. John Kennedy (La.) voted against Gregory Katsas.
Running into the comments section of some blog like The Shade Room that posts Hart's Ellen apology and goes on and on about how Ellen is invited to the cookout because she gave Hart a platform for his redemption arc doesn't change the fact that she's essentially forgiving him for comments he made about a community she doesn't even belong to.
For the entire week, offer your partner at least one genuine compliment each day. The compliments I give include the event I noticed and a characteristic I love about my partner. It goes something like this, I love how you smiled at the little boy in the stroller at the grocery store. You're such a compassionate and kind person. As you are doing this, notice how it impacts your relationship, your partner and yourself. Don't be phony and make things up. Notice the positive qualities of your partner. Rejoice in them. They are there!
The idea is similar. Identify the times in your life - and in the last week - when you feel you've been particularly productive, achieving more of value to yourself and other people in a few minutes than in many hours of lesser work. What were the common denominators? For achievement islands, you may find it is a few types of activity. Yet you may also find it is working with a particular person or people, in a specific place, or at a particular time that is predictable and repetitive. Try it now.
Although I had a graduate degree in Anthropology with a focus on gender, had the unique distinction of being the Curator of the Museum of Sex for more than a decade, and was even dubbed by Cosmopolitan Magazine to be a sexpert supreme, I can now admit it was officially the process of becoming a mother that was the finishing school of my sexual education.
Essentially, one person talks first and the other mirrors or reflects back exactly what they heard until the person is done sharing, she said. Then, they switch. This way you both are heard and understood.
The piece opens by saying that the new congresswoman has already gotten more publicity than she deserves and that the former bartender is a person of little significance — one of the most junior members of the House, she can expect to wait decades before exercising any real power in this hierarchical institution.

Anyone who actually goes into the Senate Chamber has to surrender their phone and go through a second security point before being let in. Once inside, security is even tighter. Actor and activist Alyssa Milano had a clipboard confiscated during the hearings to confirm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court because it had a sticker on it that read, I Believe Survivors. A friend's preteen son lost his pencil and paper because no doodling is allowed, either.

But I am fine. I pretend I am fine. I pretend I am rolling with the situation and not a worried wreck. I imagine Mom in a nursing home, sitting in a vinyl recliner, sleeping with her mouth open. In the county where she resides, long-term care facilities' residents and staff make up 69% of COVID-19 deaths. Placing our mother in a nursing home during the pandemic feels as though we would be issuing her a death sentence.
The second-worst outbreak in Europe showed no sign of slowing as the death toll jumped by more than 300 from the previous day.
Scheer is a dual Canadian-American citizen, but that information only became public during the campaign. The issue dogged him for days, along with a suite of other problems that forced his campaign off message.
Less than 24 hours later, he collected hundreds of rolls of pennies to pay his taxes at the DMV. He then hired 11 people at $10 an hour to help him break open the rolled coins. It took them four hours to do this, costing Stafford $440. He then bought the five wheelbarrows, which cost him another $400. All in all, Stafford spent $1,005 to get 10 phone numbers and drop off a bunch of pennies at the DMV.
While we continue to metabolize everything that has happened and demand that the people who incited the violence face consequences, let's try to show ourselves some grace. We are all sorting through the emotional rubble.

In 2019, we'll be organizing all across the country to build on the momentum and make it clear to all politicians that if they want to be taken seriously by young people, they need to sign the No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge and back the Green New Deal, she said by email.
Another friend was escorted out of the Capitol with her baby son in his stroller for leaving a Post-it note on a senator's door while Congress was out for recess. A member of Congress was offended that the note she left suggested that the Senate was not doing enough to curb gun violence and requested that the Capitol Police remove them from the building.
She suffered a brain injury and underwent intensive speech and physical therapy. She has been advocating for gun control ever since.
In the week since a mob laid siege to the Capitol in a stunning display of violence, police officers in D.C. and beyond have struggled to make sense of what happened. The Jan. 6 attack, which claimed the life of one responding officer and preceded the suicide of another, pitted law enforcement against one of its most loyal allies: Trump supporters.
To Reed, a gun owner raised in Texas, everyone should be able to agree on the need for universal background checks.
The bill is aimed at holding websites that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking ― including ones that promote illicit massage parlors ― liable for those crimes. While the bill might sound good on the surface, Mehlman-Orozco said its passage would make it even more difficult to identify and rescue trafficking victims.
I'm tired, I said instead. I need to go to bed.
Not only can this make payments a little easier to manage, since most people get their paychecks every other week, but paying half every two weeks equals one extra payment made each year without even noticing the difference, said Sean Moore, a certified financial planner and founder of SMART College Funding.

In 2018, Mutz published a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that found that in 2016 those who voted for Trump did so because of anxiety over race and social standing, not economic distress. Indeed, many of those voters were doing better economically at the time.
For her part, Virtue told Reuters: It feels great but even better than the world record is the feeling we had when we ended the program. We're really pleased with that performance. On the world's biggest stage when the pressure is mounting, it's nice to be able to deliver like that.
The way this situation is, there's no other choice but try to persuade them that they'll get that money ... when I can get it to them, said Howard, who is an activist with Good Jobs Nation, a union-backed group pushing for higher pay for federal contractors. It's just ridiculous that people have to suffer and go through hardship and be stressed out.
When you're facing that kind of a threat, it shouldn't become a partisan political football. And that's what it's become, the former cabinet minister told HuffPost Canada.
Referring to other candidates, Amber Watson, a sound engineer, said, They haven't run in any presidential elections.
And here's the thing: It's impossible to know what to do with this. It's impossible to know how to enter a conversation with someone who dismisses me as a white man's whore or an agent of white supremacy because I won't defend men who have offended or harmed people within my own community. Where do you begin? Is it even worth it? A part of me feels that it has to be, because true solidarity is the only path to true progress. A part of me wants to reach out one by one to these people I've interacted with on social media and explain with tenderness that we can't all be free if only some of us are free.
The Voice of Change ad follows a transgender person's transition from female to male through the sound of his voice.

Many Democrats do not support Medicare for All. But at this point even Democrats unwilling to endorse it are frequently calling to expand public insurance programs in some fashion ― if not by creating a new government plan that enrolls everybody, then by opening one of the two big existing programs, Medicare or Medicaid, to more people.
But this is a tightrope the brand has always been comfortable walking, delighting in its own naughtiness, begging its critics to expose themselves as prigs while also winking about its own chauvinism. Either way, people are talking. Either way, the money rolls in.
Ocasio-Cortez's first piece of legislation was the Green New Deal, social and economic reforms to address climate change and economic inequality, issues that are also core to the NDP platform. Sanders, a U.S. senator, has made public health care a core part of his campaigning.

Many Americans' views about race relations had improved at the time that Obama was inaugurated. Unfortunately, Americans' views of race relations declined after Obama came into office. Race riots in places such as Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, Maryland, greatly escalated racial tensions and worsened strife between minorities and local police. President Obama's attempts to resolve these problems often seemed to make the situation worse.
Conversely, large amounts of time can be achievement and happiness deserts. Again, the best way to achieve more is to spend less time achieving little or nothing. Lie fallow. Enjoy yourself. Do what you were doing in the previous achievement islands. Wait for inspiration or opportunity to come. If you are too busy, you will miss the muffled knock of chance, the opening that may come - and go - in a flash. Life is only too short if you don't enjoy it or nurture your unique creativity.

Every day I'm getting calls from my members about their extreme financial hardships and need for a paycheck, Hydrick Thomas said in a statement. Some of them have already quit and many are considering quitting the federal workforce because of this shutdown. The loss of officers, while we're already shorthanded, will create a massive security risk for American travelers since we don't have enough trainees in the pipeline or the ability to process new hires.

According to a 1989 Sports Illustrated history of the swimsuit issue, this reaction amused Laguerre. This kicked off a decadeslong tradition of publishing letters to the editor from people who were prudishly scandalized by SI Swimsuit.
Even with bipartisan support, H.R. 8 will likely face a tough road to passage. The 2018 midterm elections gave Democrats control of the House for the first time since 2010, thanks in part to victories by candidates who vowed to take action on gun reform. But Republicans still control the Senate and White House, and it seems unlikely that Senate Republicans or President Donald Trump, who claims to be a staunch pro-gun ally, would deliver a victory to Democrats.
These revelations are particularly significant at a time when India's Home Minister Amit Shah of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has openly spoken of creating a National Register of Citizens to weed out so-called foreign infiltrators that Shah claims are hollowing out India like termites. Shah has never provided any evidence to support his claims.
But of course, there are favorites. A great example is a recent project in Glen Ridge, New Jersey. The residence is a colonial revival style house built at the turn of the century. We collaborated on the design of the kitchen, powder room, and basement. One of the foremost reasons that it's a favorite project is the amazing clients. We worked very collaboratively to a stunning end. The clients are a brilliant lawyer and an accomplished architect. What could have been quite intimidating, was actually an amazing experience. We had wonderful meetings-of-the-minds over strong coffee on Sunday mornings throughout the project.
In those years, I became obsessed with beauty. What made someone beautiful? Was I beautiful? Could I be beautiful? I would pose in front of the mirror and try to do things I thought were beautiful. I would sit very close to the mirror and look in my eyes and try to make sexy faces. I wanted to be beautiful, and I wanted other people to think I was, too.

In 2015, digital marketers were greatly sought after. In fact, they were one of the most hired digital professionals of the year. They are also more in demand compared to project managers. By the start of 2016, experts say that we are already in the post-digital age. In other words, hiring digital experts are no longer as relevant as last year. Why is this so?

The home personal computer revolution began during the summer and fall of 1977 when, in succession, the Apple II, the Commodore PET 2001 and the Radio Shack TRS-800 were introduced. But none would have been developed without this breakthrough device. Featured on the cover of the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics, the Altair 8800, invented by Ed Roberts, and manufactured by his Albuquerque, N.M., company, may have lacked a keyboard or screen, but it inspired a fertile hobbyist culture in the San Francisco area and the development of every PC that followed.
Images from the Capitol riot felt more familiar than shocking to 28-year-old Mel Garman, who grew up attending evangelical Christian schools.
Read news, financial statements, press releases and earning calls. Read everything, he said. You will find hundreds of words you don't understand, so look them up (Investopedia will have a majority of them). In the beginning you will struggle, however, as time goes by, you will start to understand. If you do not like reading, learn to like it. There is no way around this. If you find yourself investing without reading tons, you are going to lose.

The results: By mid-century (2039–2059), the average annual snowpack will fall by 54.4 percent compared to the late-20th century baseline. By the time today's teens are in their 70s, it will be 79.3 percent beneath the old standard. To analyze massive amounts of water, planners think in acre-feet—the amount needed to submerge an acre of land by one foot. At the end of the last century, the Sierra Nevada captured an average of 8.76 million acre-feet. By mid-century, they project, the average will fall to 4 million acre-feet, and by century's end, 1.81 million acre-feet.
But while the company initially saw a huge surge in new subscribers during the early months of the pandemic, other platforms, including HBO Max and Disney+, have become increasingly competitive by building out their own bingeable libraries of original TV series and films and partnering with major studios.

Large-scale decarbonization of the power sector, as well as direct and indirect electrification of other industries and technologies, should be prioritized as a cheaper climate change mitigation solution, said Mahdi Fasihi, a researcher at Finland's Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology who published a 2019 paper on the issue in the Journal of Cleaner Production.
The idea of creating a single national health insurance program for all Americans has been a big topic of political conversation since 2016, when Sen.

The Sandpit is a unique methodology, originally designed to produce innovative ideas to solve scientific problem. These problems require multi-disciplinary attention and expertise, and yet the training that scientists undergo to become experts is becoming ever more specialized and narrow in focus. A U.K. funding agency, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, noted this trend more than a decade ago, and set out to help scientists produce collaborative research that's innovative across disciplines.
However, the predicted shift turned to be not true as digital marketers still topped as the most in-demand jobs in 2016. While there has little to no change in this area, there are new trends in the field of human resources, too.

While I will always be grateful for the amazing experience of pregnancy, going through a pregnancy after loss can be difficult.

With an estimated 34,000-plus deaths from flu in 2018-19, we have a long way to go in managing risks, Chapman said. The respiratory virus risk in restaurants is really more about being in the same location as a lot of people, some of who can be depositing the virus on surfaces like tables, doors, menus, and managing that with a hand washing and alcohol-based sanitizer regime is an effective step to reduce risks of both COVID-19 and Influenza.

While it may be difficult to talk about the less-than-glamorous symptoms fibro can produce, being honest and open about the many ways it can affect someone is an important step toward raising awareness of this complex and often-misunderstood condition. That's why we asked The Mighty community to share some of the embarrassing fibromyalgia symptoms they've experienced – symptoms we may not talk about often, but ones that deserve recognition and understanding nonetheless.

Over the years, I have searched for the right words, and the right thing to do. My teachers have steered me toward knowing the discomfort of uncharted territory. Choosing to allow the conversation and make every effort to not shut it down.
The standard advice here is to take deep breaths, in and out. When you're really in anger though, and the breathing, counting or similar techniques aren't working, it pays to take cues from your physiological sensations.

And then there's the growing suspicion, encapsulated in David Graeber's bestseller Bullshit Jobs: A Theory, that many modern jobs have little real value. Harper adds, If there's this very widespread sense of dissatisfaction with work, combine that with the fact that one in four sick days off work is attributable to overwork and you have the conditions in society (for) the idea we should working less.

For the purposes especially of this product, we do not try to parse those apart, Deke Arndt, chief of the monitoring section at NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information, said on a call with reporters.

Another reason Canada seems a likely choice to Treble: Meghan's distaste for U.S. president Donald Trump, who she had previously called divisive and misogynistic.
Two years ago, I quit my real estate career, sold my house and got rid of 90 percent of my belongings so I could travel the world full time. I decided to sacrifice my comfort and knowledge of the familiar so I could become a travel writer and experience what I imagined would be a life of adventure and exploration. Since then, my husband and I have visited Europe, South America, Asia and the Middle East, documenting every step of our journey.
Black people didn't save you. Black people saved ourselves, once again. Black people saved themselves in a state that tried VERY hard to prevent that from happening again.
We learn our baby girl has non-mosaic Turner Syndrome ― meaning she has only one X chromosome in all of her cells where there should be two. There are a broad range outcomes for these girls if they are born. Most women miscarry with no clue their daughter was afflicted (or perhaps was even a daughter). Some girls who are born show no signs of having the condition and only find out they have Turner Syndrome later in life when they themselves have trouble conceiving.
The best thing I ever did out of school was travel around the country for four months to interview people I admired about their career paths. These informational interviews gave me a reality check for each job (i.e. what it's really like) and gave me a connection at each company and in each industry I could call on down the road. If you're looking for a job, interview someone with that job. - Brett Farmiloe, Markitors
Have you always believed that Quentin Tarantino makes dreadful movies? Have you always wondered how a director could be so celebrated for work that luridly depicts the abuse and degradation of women and black people, and that offers little more than exploitative '70s pastiche?
In this environment of despair and stagnation, Republicans have taken full advantage of the power of rage. Trump's campaign and his presidency have sought to shunt American rage outward, blaming other nations all over the globe for the precipitous decline in American fortunes, and straining alliances with bellicose rhetoric. More viscerally, his campaign and those of Republicans in the 2018 midterms took advantage of a tried and tested means of eliciting fear and anger: stoking the flames of xenophobia and racism. It sufficed to hold the Senate.
The UN committee said it is concerned by the refusal to consider free, prior and informed consent in regards to these large-scale development projects, and alarmed by the escalating threat of violence against Indigenous people. It urges Canada to guarantee no force will be used against them.
It got so bad that I used to go to the grocery store that was 40 minutes away instead of the one that was 10 minutes away just because I was so afraid to walk down the gay street. The word I hear from Paul, from everyone, is re-traumatized. You grow up with this loneliness, accumulating all this baggage, and then you arrive in the Castro or Chelsea or Boystown thinking you'll finally be accepted for who you are. And then you realize that everyone else here has baggage, too. All of a sudden it's not your gayness that gets you rejected. It's your weight, or your income, or your race. The bullied kids of our youth, Paul says, grew up and became bullies themselves. Gay men in particular are just not very nice to each other, says John, the adventure tour guide. In pop culture, drag queens are known for their takedowns and it's all ha ha ha. But that meanness is almost pathological. All of us were deeply confused or lying to ourselves for a good chunk of our adolescence. But it's not comfortable for us to show that to other people. So we show other people what the world shows us, which is nastiness. Every gay man I know carries around a mental portfolio of all the shitty things other gay men have said and done to him. I arrived to a date once and the guy immediately stood up, said I was shorter than I looked in my pictures and left.
Murtaugh: As an ICU doctor, he is rarely ever completely off the clock. The amount of work that is required outside of the hospital is huge. The documentation, phone calls with insurance companies, and meetings with patients' families are all part of a patient's care. Even when he's not in the hospital, he is often on call, so we have to plan our life as if at any time we may need to stop what we're doing so he can make it into the hospital to manage an emergency.
We must investigate to figure out the many flaws in @USAGym system, Raisman tweeted. We must understand how this happened to make sure it never occurs again. This problem is bigger than Penny and Nassar. The system has to change so that athletes are safe. Enablers need to be held accountable.

William attended his best friend's birthday celebration last March. Shortly after, we went to a diner, ordered food and jumped on the subway. While commuting back home, my son started exhibiting signs of distress and quickly became overheated.
I also ended up attracting partners who saw my gifts of emotional availability as turds. I was called needy and hopelessly romantic. Granted I was. In part due to my beliefs about myself and in part due to these beliefs attracting women who didn't treasure my gifts.

Ultimately, that should take place without a looming regulatory deadline.
Congress has already appropriated funding for roughly three-quarters of the federal government, leaving many agencies unaffected by the shutdown. House Democrats, who assumed the majority last week, passed bills that would reopen shuttered agencies other than DHS, which is at the center of the funding dispute. But Republican leaders in the Senate have refused to take up those bills and stood alongside the president, who threatened to veto any legislation without full wall funding.

The new strain isn't thought to cause a more severe, deadlier disease, and all the precautions we've been taking to protect ourselves will work just fine against any new variants that come our way.

Then-Columbia professor John Romano quickly rebutted Didion in a letter to the editor, describing her review as a result of pique; the letter twice describes Didion as complaining. Meanwhile, critic Roger Ebert had a startling take on the artistry surrounding Allen's character's sexual predation, writing, It wouldn't do, you see, for the love scenes between Woody and Mariel [Hemingway] to feel awkward or to hint at cradle-snatching or an unhealthy interest on Woody's part in innocent young girls.

I saw three speakers. One was a young Muslim man from JNU (Jawaharlal Nehru University), who was very outspoken. There was lawyer from Patna and there was a Muslim woman community leader. I had never seen such an Islamised way of talking in India. The way that mubarak was being offered to these women was very openly Muslim. I think a lot of Muslims in India have realised that it is now or never to create a space where you can be a citizen and not be apologetic about being a Muslim citizen. I think the Shaheen Bagh movement feeds into that. There is an emerging Islamophobia which makes it hard for Muslims to be heard. This is a moment where Muslim hopefully can confront those issues of Islamophobia while standing as Muslim citizens of India. I see people calling out Islamophobia without having to apologise for being Muslim.

Your high-conflict ex creates drama to keep you engaged. You know you've taken the bait when you catch yourself yelling, crying, cursing, or sending an invective-laded email. As tempting as it may be to retaliate, responding to your ex's drama with your own drama will just invite more attacks. So stick to the facts when communicating. Deflect outbursts with Nevertheless, or I understand. You will never truly be divorced until you learn to manage your own emotional reactivity to your ex.

Despite President Obama's call for racial harmony, his eight-year term of office saw an intensification of racial discord. Several controversial shootings of black men led to protests, some of which were violent and destructive with black communities bearing the brunt of most of the destruction.

Mixed messages from the Obama administration, the Department of Justice in particular, seemed to increase the racial discord.

The things I have to do right now to keep my invisible nemesis at bay can be overwhelming.

Protests have been planned at 40 train stations across the UK after average rail ticket prices rose by 3.4% today - the biggest rise in five years. Campaigners have warned that people are being priced out of getting to work, with many commuters seeing their season tickets rise by more than £100. Meanwhile, average season tickets into London terminals have gone up by £146 this year, according to the Campaign for Better Transport (CBT). The government uses the previous July's Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation to determine increases in regulated fares. But new research has shown that Britons fork out up to five times as much of their salaries on rail fares than other Europeans. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald described the situation as an absolute racket, telling BBC Radio 4′s Today programme that the current rail franchise system has completely and utterly failed. People have got to the end of their tether, and understandably so, said the Labour MP.

I had been reading about coronavirus for a while and knew that this wasn't going to end well. Donald Trump is selfish and this country is dirty, so no, I'm not surprised. I recently had the dumb luck of being in New Orleans, Los Angeles and New York — three cities with some of the highest rates of [COVID-19] in the U.S. — and it didn't seem like people were taking it seriously initially. A girlfriend of mine was talking about going on a date and I was like, Are you out of your damn mind? It's called social distancing! Now, three weeks later, she's terrified. Meanwhile, I have a mask on to take out the trash.
The biggest change for us was that, for better or worse, once we got married we decided to divide and conquer and make sure each family task was handled by the more adept person. Like, I'm really good with bills and budgeting and he's not, so that's my domain, and he doesn't have to worry about it. And he's a terrific cook... meaning I haven't really looked at an oven in five years. I handle our social calendar. He handles anything to do with the car. The plus side is that most things get done quickly and efficiently, with minimal fighting. The down side is that I have no idea how to pump gas anymore. - Jillian, married 5 years

The Army will continue testing for safety hazards posed by accommodating articles of faith, Fanning said. And for the time being, soldiers with religious accommodations to grow beards will be restricted from military schools and positions where proximity to toxic chemical agents may arise.
As Coronavirus is officially declared a pandemic, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has weighed an extension of travel restrictions and asked Australians to reconsider their need to travel overseas.
But claiming the Senate majority does offer Democrats some reasonable grounds for optimism, should the clear electoral indications from Tuesday hold. For the next two years, at least, President-elect Joe Biden's party will be able to control what bills receive votes and when. Most importantly, Democrats will have much greater influence over the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic and the economic support that must go hand-in-hand with national public health efforts.
The makeup aspect of the job is thrilling for me, due to the fact that I've been into makeup since I was 10. My skills have improved drastically since I started doing princess parties. Now, I even do makeup professionally on occasion and film makeup tutorials (both everyday and princess) on a YouTube Channel (Melody Ricketts), thanks to the support and encouragement of my incredible Instagram followers on my princess account, @melodysprincesslife.
We started putting him on the bunny slope there. Then my dad, who's a big alpine skier, has been taking him out every day and just doing a few runs on the alpine skis. So he's one of those kids who's gonna be able to say he was on skis as soon as he could walk.

I was able to edit our holiday hours on Google My Business to 'closed' but could not edit the reason why, White said via a message to The Dot. It appears that state holidays take precedence over federal holidays.
There was a lady at a pie store who I thought might be the one. An anesthesiologist for dogs who I also thought might be the one. Before we met, they all had the possibility of being the one. Sometimes I felt the zing and rush of attraction, but it wasn't mutual. So I worked to be the kind of person who wasn't swayed by feelings. After all, when I was nineteen, I had fallen in love, and swept myself into marriage which ended in ruin. I wanted to be past falling in love as a concept. I needed to tamp down my feelings and think more. I told my therapist I was trying to be a robot. She didn't approve, but I still tried.
If you make it through the entire season of Tidying Up, you see that the daunting process of organizing a messy home has a transformational impact on the participants' lives. Relationships are strengthened, old wounds are healed and houses become homes.

(According to the Sachar Committee report published in 2007, the literacy rate among Muslims was 59.1%, lower than the national average of 65.1%, but Muslim women were at 50%, at par with women from other communities).
The BJP's campaign appears to have struck a chord, with the party's lead rising marginally from 2015, and close contests in some seats, but it is unclear if the hard-edged campaign brought out the base or scared off swing voters.
The other asterisk is that different countries started vaccinating on different days because government approvals of vaccines didn't happen simultaneously. The U.K. started first, then came the U.S. and then, finally, the European Union. Adjusting for that factor, the performance of the U.S. comes closer to that of the U.K., but several European countries, like Denmark, Ireland and Italy, come close to or look better than the U.S.
They are asking the government to review and amend the law on marriage, currently defined as between a man and a woman, to the union of two persons, according to their lawyer Hectar Pun.

HuffPost's previous investigation of these textbooks found that they also dismiss evolution as junk science, characterize Nelson Mandela as a marxist agitator who helped drive South Africa to radical affirmative action, and suggest that Satan hatched the idea of modern psychology. Many of the schools that use these books also ban LGBTQ students and families, and the books repeatedly condemn homosexuality. At one point in an Abeka textbook, slavery is described in purely economic terms, saying that slaves seemed to be better investments than indentured servants.

NEW DELHI — On 5 June, 2019, the Trump Administration removed India from its Generalised System of Preference Program (GSP), a preferential trade agreement for developing countries under which Indian goods worth $5.7 billion had gone into the United States duty free. A day after the U.S. President Donald Trump announced his first official trip to India, his government removed India from a list of developing countries that are given trade benefits on the grounds that India is a member of the G-20. This naturally makes it harder for India to regain its GSP status, a key demand from New Delhi in the fraught negotiations with Washington.
Though the government's containment efforts within Canada have so far been successful at preventing community spread, — transmission from person to person in Canada — the global picture makes it more and more likely Canada will face an outbreak as well.
Most surveys report a margin of error that represents some, but not all, potential survey errors. YouGov's reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling. If these assumptions are wrong, the model-based margin of error may also be inaccurate. Click here for a more detailed explanation of the model-based margin of error.

Today's tax bill fares at least as badly when compared to the Affordable Care Act on other measures. Just 27 percent of Americans in CNN's most recent survey think that President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans made a good faith effort to cooperate with Democrats on the tax bill.

Such a scheme could also preserve a role for private insurers, providing the same kind of alternative, tightly regulated coverage they do for seniors on Medicare today. Hybrid systems with both public and private insurance are actually pretty common around the world ― and succeed in establishing health care as a right, just as single government programs do.

To move in such a direction would be catastrophic as well as tragic, he wrote. Retreating to a safer, more secure past was infinitely more attractive and desirable than proceeding into a reckless future that seemed to offer the revulsive prospect of 'social equality.'
With social distancing being encouraged, more people are turning to drive-thru options or delivery services for meals. However, it's come at a cost for some restaurants hurt by UberEats or Deliveroo commissions, or a decline in people dining in.

No president has ever been removed from office by the Senate. With its 53-47 Republican majority, the Senate is not expected to mount the two-thirds voted needed for conviction. Even if it did, the White House team argues it would be an 'unconstitutional conviction″ because the articles of impeachment were too broad.

The third-ranking Republican in the House, Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, said there had never been a greater betrayal by a president. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told colleagues in a letter that he had not decided how he would vote in an impeachment trial.
Often, the knowledge to turn a conversation around takes practice. Artists who sell directly to the public need two quite separate sets of skills, the first is the technical ability and a conceptual framework to produce the desired work of art, while the second is the capability to put that technique and concept into words and to be a good salesperson. Salesmanship is not only concerned with negotiating the terms of a purchase, which assumes that prospective buyers know exactly what they want, but trying to answer the questions that are really being asked. It may help, for instance, to show a booth visitor a sketchbook, so that that person may see how things get started: A little idea becomes a work of art. The question of where an artist gets his or her ideas turns out to be concerned with the mechanics of the artistic.
All options offered by the WB are feeble cases, far weaker than many states in India have to offer, Manoranjan Kumar, the economic advisor to the Rural Development Ministry at that time, wrote on March 15, 2017. He suggested the ministry should look at the Social Security System of the USA as a model, which not only helps track the economic status of individuals but also traces individual's interaction with any government program.
It helped Democrats that the 2020 Senate map put Republicans on the defensive. The GOP had to defend upward of 10 competitive seats, while Democrats were only in real danger of losing two incumbents. The sheer number of high-profile candidates stretched Republicans' resources thin.
But the breakthrough came in November, days after the election.
This disparity in the way white supremacist terrorists and Black Lives Matter protesters were treated was blatant enough to be noted by President-elect Joe Biden when he said that no one can tell me that if that had been a group of Black Lives Matter protesting yesterday, they wouldn't have been treated very, very differently than the mob of thugs that stormed the Capitol.
Scientists in Iceland sequenced DNA from 387 pairs of identical twins — those derived from a single fertilized egg — as well as from their parents, children and spouses. That allowed them to find early mutations that separate identical twins, said Kari Stefansson, a geneticist at the University of Iceland and the company deCODE genetics, and co-author of the paper published Thursday in the journal Nature Genetics.
One other Capitol Police officer, Brian Sicknick, died Thursday after rioters hit him in the head with a fire extinguisher during the siege. The FBI said it had deactivated two improvised explosive devices placed near the Capitol as rioters stormed Congress.

Underlying the widespread condemnation of the riots are highly polarized interpretations about what they reflect and who enabled them. Democrats say, by a 47-point margin, that the storming of the Capitol reflects a broader movement in American society, while Republicans say the same by a smaller 33-point margin.

Trump met with Democratic leaders on Wednesday at the White House, but there was once again no real movement.
This expert committee has proposed amendments to the Aadhaar Act to allow the government to capture this information without running afoul of the 2018 Supreme Court judgment that restricted the use of Aadhaar and reiterated individual privacy as a fundamental right.

South Korea has reportedly seen the peak of the outbreak and seen a decline in coronavirus cases after mass testing. More than 7,300 coronavirus infections have been confirmed throughout South Korea with the death toll at 50.
When we talk about the body positive movement as it relates to women, we're often quick to point to the progress or lack thereof with regard to broad acceptance and inclusiveness of bodies of all sizes. But the pursuit of self-love is hardly a female-only problem, and the movement frequently fails to acknowledge just how much the burden of poor body image affects men.
We certainly understand the sensitivities of the logo ― those who find it insensitive and also those fans who have a long-standing attachment to its place in the history of the team, he said in a statement.
First off, if you experience only the occasional false awakening (once a year or once every few years), Hohne says it's likely due to a change in your schedule or an increased sense of urgency around an upcoming task. This sort of false awakening may occur the night before a trip, major life event, or anything that requires you to be on your game. The pressure to perform likely stresses you out to the point that that those concerns bleed over into your dream.
I am excited that I will be interning next summer in the artificial intelligence division of one of the largest technology companies in the world. I used my charm offensive in the interview! My boss is a famous female scientist who worked with Stephen Hawking. For my fourth-grade spring research paper, my Helios teachers will allow me to choose a topic that is related to my internship. I have a big support system of parents, relatives, family friends, mentors, teachers and doctors who are happy to help me. But I also know that I am very lucky to have this kind of community because most kids with special needs have to struggle to find resources. Well, I wrote a lot, so thanks for reading!

Americans say, 47% to 39%, that they approve of the government's handling of issues related to the coronavirus. They're about evenly split on Trump's handling of the crisis, with 45% approving and 43% disapproving. Slightly under half, 46%, are at least somewhat confident that the government's statements on coronavirus are reliable and accurate, with 41% not very or not at all confident. Opinions are again polarized: Republicans are 55 points likelier than Democrats to approve of the government response, and 69 points likelier to approve of Trump specifically.

Committing to remove some of the centuries of carbon emissions that countries such as the U.S., United Kingdom and France have produced since the dawn of the industrial revolution could prove a powerful tool in global climate negotiations. Developing nations such as China, India and Vietnam, whose emissions make up the bulk of those that could push the world over its climate threshold, have complained it's unfair to demand they sacrifice fossil-fueled economic growth that lifts their populations out of poverty at the behest of countries that grew wealthy exploiting coal and colonizing their ancestors.
No one is going to tell a pollster they voted for racism or that they would characterize it that way, Angela Hanks, the deputy executive director at Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive economic group, told HuffPost in November for a story exploring how Trump voters claim the economy was their priority – at a time when it was clear that the economy was tanking because of the out-of-control pandemic.

The board's continued secrecy, not only to the employees they oversee, but also to the public who rightly want full accountability, has irreparably damaged the board's credibility, Baker-Hytch wrote Dec. 20. The only way I can see the public credibility of this organisation being restored is for there to be a brand-new Global Board of Directors and Global CEO, none of whom are Zacharias family members, and to file Form 990s ... for the years they haven't been filed.

At that time, the White House was criticized for failing to create the kind of robust war room that President Bill Clinton mobilized during his own impeachment fight.

All we have in this life is our perspective. We can't control what's placed in front of us, but we can determine how we respond. Things will get hard. You will be challenged, but the fear that comes along with that is nothing more then a chance for us to be brave.
All of us have stories about not being good enough and narratives about the parts of ourselves that love ones labeled inadequate or a burden. As we are experiencing these heartbreaking moments time and time again, we can't help but believe them to be truths. Instead of a person's opinion of you, it becomes a fact. And once that happens, the true torture begins. We begin to criticize ourselves.

While much of what we learned about COVID-19 in December centered around vaccination, there's still plenty of research happening about how exactly the virus functions. A highly preliminary animal study published in the journal Nature Neuroscience found that the virus's spike protein is able to cross the brain-blood barrier — suggesting that the virus as a whole may be able to do so as well.

The biggest obstacle to American firms doing so is cultural, says Monograph's Amaya. If you have a deeply held belief in the American way of doing business, it's not going to work. You have to commit to having a more balanced lifestyle and enjoying the process along the way. While progress will move a bit slower, you have more time for reflection, make better long-term decisions, and have happy, more productive employees.
The same can be said for our own lives. There are people that become attached to you as much as leaves are attached to branches. However, as the seasons change in our lives those people may disappear. Sometimes it seems several disappear at once and you are left bare much like trees in winter. For whatever reasons, those individuals were only meant to be in your life for a season. Yes, it hurts when those who you thought were going to stay forever leave your life before you are ready, but it is the nature of our organic lives.

A majority of states will see a revenue increase if they do nothing, but their taxpayers also will pay more. That's because the new federal law eliminated many tax breaks, meaning federal taxes are assessed on more income. The federal tax code, however, tried to help taxpayers out by also increasing the standard deduction, lowering their tax liability. If states use the income line from the federal form as a starting point, but don't adjust the deductions underneath, state residents would pay more.

Trump frequently talks about factory workers, and just this week he was in western Pennsylvania pledging to fight for them. But in the past year he has delayed implementation of rules designed to protect workers from inhaling toxic substances, including beryllium (a major hazard for steelworkers) and silica dust (a major hazard in construction). The plan, once again, is to scale back the rules in ways that expose many more workers to the hazards.

The change in status is the result of a federal lawsuit Spires and a group of lawyers at the Yale Veterans Legal Services Clinic filed against the Air Force in November.
It's been disheartening and demoralizing to see black people (especially black women) trot out the same tired defenses of terrible men. They usually hinge on some sort of persecution theory ― white people are out to get men like Kelly, Hart and Bill Cosby. To believe allegations about them, or not forgive them, is to buy into the white man's devious plan. If Kevin Hart can't use gay slurs and be forgiven, then what about the Amy Schumers and Sarah Silvermans of the world? Sure, Kelly allegedly raped a few girls, but what about Woody Allen and Harvey Weinstein?

Gaither recommends looking at the ingredients of any CBD lubricant and avoiding any with chemicals and artificial scents. Oil-based ones might degrade latex in condoms, making them less effective, so look for a lube that's water-based, Gaither said.
A few of those workers became national news, like Leilani Jordan, a Giant store clerk who had a disability and was among the first grocery store workers to die. Infections have also hit hundreds of poultry and beef processing workers represented by the UFCW and its affiliate, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. At least three workers at a Tyson Foods plant in Georgia have died.

If you're Jimmy Kimmel, you're just doing it to promote your late-night show.

Hundreds of women have sat on a public road in a locality called Shaheen Bagh in south Delhi, demanding lawmakers to repeal the CAA, which critics say makes religion the basis of granting Indian citizenship. When combined with the National Register of Citizens (NRC), an exercise to identify people living without documents, critics say, the CAA discriminates against Indian Muslims. Women of all ages have sat, sang, spoken and sloganeered, day and night since December, even on nights when the temperature dropped to 2 degrees Celsius. They have moved thousands, and, on some days, lakhs of people into making their way to the vibrant protest site in the nation's capital. They have inspired other Muslim women to lead the anti-CAA protests in cities across the country.

The state just emerged from a five-year drought emergency, which Gov. Jerry Brown declared officially over in April of 2017. The long drought period, which experts say is among the extreme weather patterns exacerbated by climate change, made the land especially fire-prone. Not surprisingly, 2017 saw the largest and deadliest wildfires in California's history.
The mystery of Jack's death has fascinated fans of the series with hints ― a battery-less smoke detector, a defective crock pot, etc. ― sprinkled throughout episodes. Last week's installment ended with a major cliffhanger, as the family's home burned down.
Democrats could also try to move additional coronavirus relief via a wonky process known as budget reconciliation. Republicans turned to that process ― which can be used to pass bills on specific topics in accord with certain guidelines ― to push through their tax cuts in 2017.

Before being sworn in at the Interior Department on Aug. 1, 2017, Bernhardt, a Colorado native, worked for eight years at the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, where he lobbied on behalf of oil, gas, mining and agricultural interests. He also previously served as a top Interior official under former President George W. Bush, leading an attempt to open Alaska's pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas development. (Last month the Trump administration took a significant step toward its goal of allowing drilling in the refuge, which Zinke said stands out among the most impactful Interior accomplishments in terms of bolstering America's economic strength and security.)

There's a lot of people calling for the end of violence, Limbaugh said Thursday on his radio program, The Rush Limbaugh Show. There's a lot of conservatives ... who say that any violence or aggression at all is unacceptable, regardless of the circumstances.

While the prison guard unions might support an arms race inside American prisons, those who understand criminal behavior, mental illness, and substance abuse disorders understand that it's not about how successfully you repress and incapacitate someone, but about what you do today so that when they are released they never return. I for one support policies that focus on the objective being the reformation of damaged character and transforming prisoners into responsible citizens, not merely warehousing them and putting them down harder and faster when problems arise.
The Nevada caucuses went notably more smoothly than the first caucus-style contest of the cycle. Iowa's Democratic Party is recounting votes from 10 precincts in the state after the apparent leaders in that race, Sanders and Buttigieg, both requested limited recounts.
Based on the successful examples of Soldiers currently serving with these accommodations, I have determined that brigade-level commanders may approve requests for these accommodations, wrote Secretary of the Army Eric Fanning in a letter announcing the decision.
As in the case of COVID-19 and climate change, the most vulnerable populations generally suffer the earliest and most damaging setbacks because of where they live, their limited income and economic means, and their lack of access to health care. Government response to climate-induced disasters — hurricanes, floods, droughts, heat waves, wildfires, and related events — inherently benefit whites and more affluent households, and leave behind the most vulnerable. Long before Hurricane Katrina devastated the U.S. Gulf Coast, people of color learned the hard way that waiting for the government to respond can be hazardous to their health.
The undulations and disruptions of segmented faults worldwide have recently been analysed. Independent of their size and location over the world, most faults are divided into a similar number of principal segments, generally three to four.
Les détectives des épidémies n'ont pas de boule de cristal et insistent sur le fait qu'ils n'ont que des informations parcellaires sur le nouveau virus, apparu en décembre.

In essence, Surviving R. Kelly got the wider public talking about a man who had, in the words of the documentary, hidden in plain sight for years, abusing women and girls of color with relative impunity. (Research has shown that while black women and girls experience high rates of sexual abuse, they are less likely to report those crimes or find justice for their suffering.)

You want to make sure that the lube you're using is right for your body, so it's important to check the list of ingredients — some could be more harmful than helpful. Alcohols (almost anything that ends with -ol) can become drying and irritating over time, and certain sugars and glycerins might make you prone to infections, Ingber said.
The Congressional Review Act is a 1996 law that gives Congress the power to nullify any major regulations an executive branch agency finalized within the previous 60 days, not counting periods when Congress was out of session for three days or longer. Republicans used the act, known as the CRA, to hack away at Obama-era rules; before that it had only been used once, in 2001.

There was a lot of stuff happening, he said. What you're seeing in the news, growing up in the South … I felt this kind of climate change and it reminded me of when I was a kid. I grew up in the '80s and '90s in Texas. It could get a little bit funky there sometimes.
Trouble is, if all it took to fix what ails the American health care system were a handful of tycoons sitting in a room, those problems would be fixed by now. During decades of rising costs, however, employers' main innovations have been raising everyone's deductibles and enrolling workers in wellness programs that don't work.
Unfortunately, I live in a germ-riddled world. So do you. We might not be able to see germs, but we know they're everywhere. Before the coronavirus pandemic, the realization that germs are prolific in public places caused little or no concern to most people. They routinely touched all sorts of things in public (and then their faces) with nary a thought about the thousands of others who did the same.
We're at that very low level, and we want to keep it that way, Trump said. We're very, very ready for this.

Just this week, Teck Resources backed out of a $20-billion Alberta oilsands mining project, blaming Canada's unclear climate change policy. Across the country, Indigenous protesters have blocked major railways in solidarity with Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs who oppose a natural gas pipeline in B.C.
We had been spending a lot of time together anyway. We were going out to dinner on our nights without the kids, attending concerts that started too late for my bedtime, calling each other at 3 a.m. after mediocre dates when the pain of our dissolving lives felt too much to bear alone. When she moved in our friendship became quieter. We cooked dinner, watched television, came to know the names of each other's co-workers and employees. When my son's pet mouse escaped in his room, Stace and I both jammed ourselves into the cramped space below the bed while my children yelled directions from the doorway.
The new form of coronavirus, a close cousin to respiratory illnesses such as SARS and MERS, originated in China and has spread rapidly in recent weeks.
As I drove I found myself pushing away the soft feelings in my belly with a litany of rational thoughts: Dating someone who lives with you is too convenient and easy; dating a friend is cliche; it would get too serious too quickly; my kids didn't need me involved in something serious; it would destroy our friendship.
These hazmat shipper groups' assault on railroad rates and profits defies explanation, as it is railroad profits that make possible safety enhancing renewal of plant and equipment, which includes the costly design, development and implementation of Positive Train Control, and improved handling of the dangerous cargoes their members tender railroads.
Rising nutrient loads coupled with climate change — each resulting from human activities — are changing ocean biogeochemistry and increasing oxygen consumption, says the study published in the journal Science. Ultimately, such changes are unsustainable and may result in ecosystem collapses, which ultimately will cause societal and economic harm.

What disturbs me the most is the silence when a little girl gets raped, Khan told the AP. It has to do with the honor of family. Parents tell their daughters: 'Don't talk about it. Don't tell anyone.' Our silence is saying it is all right to sexually molest a child.
Front-line health care workers in Los Angeles, the current epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., are stretched thin, working under grueling conditions. The long days spent treating so many seriously ill patients — some of whom end up dying alone, forced to say their goodbyes to loved ones over the phone — take a toll.

Because there is no public support for a federal European Union, many have envisaged alternative ways to fix the euro. The CEO of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) Klaus Regling has proposed that euro could be saved by a combination of the banking and capital market union and a rainy day fund. This fund would allegedly be used when asymmetric shocks occur. The fund would be financed jointly by all euro countries. However, because of the persistent differences in competitiveness, its transfers would become permanent, like in the US. Only the most competitive members of the Eurozone would have sufficient income to finance the fund. Any financing through the European Central Bank (ECB), would need to be covered by European tax-payers later, when it would become evident that weaker countries are unable to pay back their loans and when seigniorage revenues would be unable to cover the losses of the ECB.

The concept behind block grants and similar proposals for Medicaid is simple: Instead of open-ended federal funding to cover whatever costs the state's Medicaid beneficiaries require, the state gets a flat amount of money it must stretch over the year. And that amount is less than states get now.
In January, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, which was proposed by Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), cleared the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.
A primary goal of Alchemy is to streamline the testing and fixing process. How is this done? When pages are tested, Alchemy evaluates each violation instance and recognizes the characteristics of the element that make it unique. Elements are tagged with a signature so they can be identified by the tool in the future. When a component is reused on multiple pages, Alchemy recognizes that elements match signatures for previously-resolved issues and automatically deploys the resolution, with no additional work by the tester. This means violations need only be reviewed and resolved once and the resolution is applied to all other instances of the same component. Learn more at: www.ssbbartgroup.com
Other contenders for mayor have signaled concern about the issue. Maya Wiley, the former mayoral counsel and MSNBC host, promised to place making New York more resilient in the face of climate change among her top priorities as mayor, a spokesperson said.

As the Urban Institute policy brief illustrates, this financing mechanism wouldn't be adequate to cover current costs, let alone higher expenses associated with growth in the number of people using Medicaid or the costs of COVID-19 treatments. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services projected last year that Medicaid spending would increase 6% annually between 2019 and 2027. By contrast, medical inflation has risen less than 3% in recent years, according to the brief.
Authorities in Michigan's Meridian Township issued a public apology on Thursday to Brianne Randall-Gay, a woman who told police that former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar had groped her breasts and buttocks and attempted to penetrate her vagina during an appointment for back pain in 2004.

It is time for a big, multitrillion-dollar economic relief package ― for the sake of American families and public health. The results of the Georgia runoff make that kind of legislation much more plausible.
Biden's transition team did not respond by press time on its strategy for the Congressional Review Act. But with control of the Senate, it certainly makes the president-elect's campaign trail promises to undo Trump's regulatory legacy a little more likely.
But King insisted it was absolutely not true that Winfrey meant the speech to be a launching pad for any future political plans.
Seeing and following people who look like you helps create feelings of acceptance and connectedness, she told HuffPost. It's human nature to want to fit in and be part of a tribe.
CBD is thought to decrease inflammation, increase blood flow and help with muscle relaxation, which might make CBD-infused lubricants a reliable option for women who have pain during intercourse, according to Gaither.
When a window is directly behind your computer screen, your monitor is surrounded by light and this causes eye strain. If you are seated with the window behind you, the sun will reflect on your screen ― and that can create a headache-inducing glare, too.
Has all this self-reflection with your work, the daily oppression you face and what's going on right now pushed you toward therapy? I talked to fellow author and your friend Samantha Irby recently about therapy, which she's like, wow, no thank you for right now. [Laughs]
This is truly disheartening, but it's okay when looting and rioting are considered 'peaceful protest.'

They will undergo a two-week quarantine as well as a throat swab test and an antibody test for COVID-19, according to CGTN, the English-language channel of state broadcaster CCTV. They are to start working with Chinese experts via video conference while in quarantine.
The Camp fire was the costliest last year, at $16.5 billion in losses, including $12.5 billion of insured losses. The next most expensive disaster was Hurricane Michael, which barreled through Florida in October, killing nearly four dozen people and wrecking entire communities.
He was finally heard from hours after the vote, in a subdued video that condemned the insurrection at the Capitol and warned his supporters from engaging in any further violence. It was a message that was largely missing one week earlier, when rioters marching in Trump's name descended on the Capitol to try to prevent Congress from certifying Biden's victory.
Foreign nationals from all 26 countries of the Schengen Area, which make up most of Europe, will be barred from entering the U.S. for at least 30 days as protection against the spread of coronavirus, Trump announced Wednesday. The United Kingdom and Ireland are not part of that group, but they do have cases of coronavirus — and Trump golf resorts.
The legislation includes no funds for state and local governments, and according to economists Mark Paul and Adam Hersh, is at least $2.1 trillion short of what the economy needs to return to pre-pandemic health. Paul and Hersh assume that government spending is about or a little more efficient at boosting economic growth than its direct outlays ― payments are spent on other activity, which in turn encourages more activity.
The same goes for women who are considering getting pregnant. Experts stress that there is absolutely no evidence that getting vaccinated causes infertility. That's a lie often spread by anti-vaccination activists about various vaccines, Yancey said.

I sit at the window of my home beside the Atlantic Ocean. My work is almost done. Having led me through so many dark and bloody chronicles, this book comes to an end. The question with which it began is answered.
I had a little situation with somebody that took place in front of my child. He [my son] was asking me what was happening and I didn't want to explain to my child why this guy upset me. I didn't want to explain to him at three and a half years old because he doesn't see that, Clark said about discrimination. It just made me so angry. So we got 'This Land' after that.

But the cost and death tolls are expected to climb as new data on Puerto Rico's post-hurricane destruction emerge. The official body count after Hurricanes Maria and Irma ransacked the island territory and destroyed its electrical grid sits at 64, but an analysis by The New York Times pegged the figure at 1,052, and climbing.

And if you are a caregiver, for whatever it's worth, I want you to know that what you're doing is important. And essential.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that globally 1 in 7 persons have a disability, 1 billion people or about 15% of the population. These numbers will continue to grow for many reasons especially due to aging societies. Think about the implications - would you want to build a system that 15% of your customers could not access?
To begin the year and this conversation, I'd like to showcase a pointed 2014 rebuttal of the most troubling of the wayward proposals - forced access - from former STB Chief of Staff Frank Wilner. It is a must-read for all current and potential Board members, dispelling many of the arguments for railroad re-regulation.
The debate about Medicare for All is about to get more serious ― and more complicated.
I know some people feel like the timeline is rushed. But honestly, if we poured a basically unlimited amount of money into science, had a disease that was affecting the entire population, and had the whole world working on it all the time, we could probably get treatments and vaccines to market on whole hosts of disease fast. It's a good example of how well science can work when we give it adequate resources and provide government assistance in getting it across the finish line.

The results suggest the overwhelming popularity of Green New Deal-style policies could propel upsets in districts beyond the diverse, left-leaning urban bastions that gave rise to socialist darlings like Ocasio-Cortez and others in her cohort. The findings also indicate potential challenges of selling moderate Democrats from more conservative districts on the populist branding of policies packaged in a Green New Deal.
When the movie first opens and we get the introductory scenes with Cassie, we are fully rooting for her to one-up these predatory goobers. But that starts to get tricky when she has lunch with Alison Brie's character. And it gets even trickier when she's making Connie Britton's character think that her teenage daughter is being sexually assaulted. What did you imagine the audience would be feeling at those two moments?

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has announced a massive economic aid package equal to around 20% of the country's gross domestic product. The measures, worth a total of 200 billion euros ($219 billion) between loans, credit guarantees, benefits and direct aid, aim to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the economy. In a televised address, Sanchez said the government would mobilize 117 billion euros for the package, with the rest to come from private companies. HuffPost Spain reported that coronavirus cases surpassed 10,000 today, with the death toll rising to 491.

• Tale of the tape: Only Bill Belichick and Marvin Lewis have longer head coach tenures with their current teams than did Coughlin, who took the Giants' job in 2004. He won nine games and qualified for the playoffs in 2005, en route to 102 career regular-season wins with New York. Coughlin also delivered two Super Bowls (2007 and '11), but the Giants have missed the playoffs four straight years since that second title.

In response, employers have built political alliances with some parts of the employee class. For example, inside the Republican Party, they worked long-standing deals with evangelicals to, for example, oppose abortion and coalesce around Supreme Court nominees, while inside the Democratic Party, they made alliances with large groups of religious and ethnic minorities.
Evangelical Christians were one of Trump's most important voting blocks. Though white evangelicals only represent about 15% of the electorate, they made up about 23% of the vote during the 2020 election, according to the Associated Press. About 8 in 10 white evangelical Christians voted for Trump last year.
Reaching out is an act of self-preservation. Maybe don't physically touch anybody, unless it's a fist bump with gloved hands. Texting and emailing is cool. Phone calls are also a good look. Here are some other lessons to be learned from a few fictional characters:
Green predicted that Senate Republicans' excessive use of the filibuster against popular legislative priorities might eventually soften Manchin's opposition to getting rid of the tool ― or at least, dramatically curtailing its use.
Climate change is clearly the culprit, Owens told The Washington Post.
In October a United Nations report warned that the world is running out of time to reduce greenhouse gas emissions before seeing potentially catastrophic effects of climate change. Diplomats from all over the world reached a deal in December to adopt rules to implement the Paris pact and track countries' emissions.
More recently, Trump's Interior Department finalized a rule that permanently slashed protections for hundreds of species of migratory birds by legalizing all unintentional killings, including those caused by oil and gas infrastructure, power lines and wind turbines. And the EPA completed a so-called science transparency rule that will block certain peer-reviewed scientific studies from the rule-making process.

Dax Shepard believes that if he is in a state that does not have a helmet law he should be 'observing the local culture' and not wear his helmet, she said. This morphs into an even bigger fight and we ended up compromising on if he was on the highway, he had to wear the helmet. But if he was on side streets, he didn't have to wear the helmet.
Some people stayed in dead-end relationships so they wouldn't be alone through the holidays. It's a dreadful feeling to know that you're with someone you can't see yourself going the distance with long-term. Thoughts of another New Year's Eve with that feeling isn't something you'll want to repeat. Often, couples will break up right after the New Year, or even before Christmas, in order to not to go through another holiday with the wrong person.
Masks and distancing are still necessary.
Yep, you read that right. Folks are using CBD for everything, including, it seems, getting it on. So, what the heck is CBD lube used for? Are there any sexual benefits to lubricants with CBD in them?
It's unclear whether an overhaul of New York's power stations would trigger utility cost increases for ratepayers, but industry groups likely to oppose the bill are expected to argue that it would.

Reste à voir si les sondés font bien ce qu'ils disent.
There were many, many opportunities not to end up where we are, Dr. Ashish K. Jha, director of the Global Health Institute at Harvard, told AP.
Set clear relationship boundaries and honor them. Manager versus employee relationships can be annoying when boundaries are not respected. Team members may forget you are now the boss, or anyone can make inappropriate comments or demands. Draw the lines of intent and expectations clearly, and never allow yourself to be the prey.
If you have been vaccinated, you can believe that your own risk of getting symptomatic or severe COVID-19 disease is significantly reduced, said Eric Robinette, a pediatric infectious disease specialist with Akron Children's Hospital in Ohio.

Wheeler delivered. In August, he proposed gutting fuel economy standards for new vehicles in a move seen as a giant giveaway to oil companies even as electric automobile technology made historic leaps forward. Weeks later, he unveiled a rule to weaken a landmark Obama-era power plant regulation, allowing by the EPA's own calculus enough pollution to cause an additional 1,400 premature deaths per year.

Love Black women every day, not just on election days. — Be A King (@BerniceKing) January 6, 2021
Hasen advocates levelling campaign financing up as well as down. Spending limits of $25,000 per election with a two year aggregate cap of $500,000 (and an exemption for media corporations which cover elections), he claims, would neither benefit incumbents nor inhibit competition. A $100 voucher, which every eligible voter could give to a candidate, political party or advocacy support, might even enhance political participation. Pointing to decades of experience with campaign finance limits in the United States and from the much stricter systems in Great Britain and Canada, Hasen insists that his proposals will not endanger freedom of speech or freedom of the press.
If you're returning to Australia from Italy, as an Australian citizen or permanent resident, you'll need to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival in Australia from 1800 (AEDT) on 11 March 2020, DFAT's SmartTraveller.gov.au said.

• What went wrong: What went right? The Browns' three wins this season came against the Titans, Ravens and 49ers, all of whom will hold top-10 draft picks. Arguably, the high point of the season was a 26–23 overtime loss to the then-undefeated Broncos.
It's too risky, I said. I need you.
Black women have been told that the misogyny of rappers must go unchecked. That the largely Black and male artists who dominate the genre must be allowed to tell their truths without restriction. We've long understood that the violent, racist nature of law enforcement means that we cannot seek police aid when we are harmed by one of our own men without risking the possibility that he will be harmed by a responding officer. We know that those same officers are unlikely to believe us or show us the sort of empathy befitting a victim. We've also been taught to believe that fast Black teen girls are to blame when adult men engage them for sex that they cannot legally consent to have.

Ansari's alleged sexual misconduct quickly launched a national conversation about what constitutes consent, and even Saturday Night Live aired a sketch about the story. Schumer, who's been open about her history with sexual assault, is hopeful that this dialogue, no matter how uncomfortable, will not only continue, but spur change.
Under the Trump policy, announced in January, a state facing increasing Medicaid enrollment or higher spending on medical care for enrollees could choose to jettison people from the program or eliminate covered benefits. The alternative would be for the state to increase its own spending to maintain coverage and benefits, which would be significantly challenging because nearly all states must balance their budgets and can't turn to deficit spending. And given that this proposal is designed to appeal to Republican state officials, tax increases to finance additional spending would be unlikely.
It's not how you start. It's how you finish.
This is classic American conservatism on trade.
Milk is a hot, white man out of drag. That does not make the work she does in drag any less artistically valid. But it does mean we have to keep perspective on why she's able to do the drag she does. If, for example, Kennedy's drag was half as outré as Milk's, she'd be relentlessly blasted by fellow queens and trolls alike. We know this because Kennedy gets hate just for doing her drag as-is, much less something so unconventional. Milk receives the benefit of the doubt in a way someone less classically handsome (or non-white) would certainly not.
Maroney, best known as one of the Fierce Five at the 2012 Summer Olympics, revealed in October 2017 that she had been sexually abused by Nassar from age 13 until she left gymnastics at age 20. She has said the abuse led her to thoughts of suicide.
Some Democrats want to fund their own priorities but also are holding back due to worries about underfunded pensions, cuts to federal government programs such as Medicaid, the federal-state health plan for low-income Americans, and the Children's Health Insurance Program, and other concerns.

In December, Wheeler handed two more victories to the coal industry that paid him to lobby until mid-2017. In the first week of the month, he proposed softening a rule requiring coal-fired power plants to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. By the end of the month, he announced plans to relax a rule restricting how much mercury and other dangerous pollutants coal-fired plants can release into the air.
Landry says this is likely because playing music involves multiple senses. With touch, for instance, a violin player has to feel the string on her finger, but she also needs to listen for the right sound to be produced when she's pressing on the string.

I tell myself this several times as I drive two and a half hours to my mother's house. She is 84 and fell a few days earlier. I have not seen her since last Christmas, prior to the coronavirus pandemic. My husband and I had not planned to travel during the holidays. He stays behind. I will sleep with the window open and the door shut. I will sleep in fuzzy pajamas and socks. I will wear a mask indoors. I will be OK. She will be OK. When I arrive, she is bruised and stiff, using a walker. Prior to her fall, she zipped around unassisted and lived alone.

Here it is important to note that the real Syria Civil Defence already exists and is the only such agency recognised by the International Civil Defence Organisation (ICDO). What the WG refers to here as the real Syria Civil Defence is an official force also referred to as self-protection squads. They are part of the Syrian Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Defence, are trained by Syrian Army and operate only in government-held areas of Syria.

I had to think about the fight scenes as dance choreography, she said. Instead of a plie or a pirouette, it's a punch or a kick or uppercut. I had to throw a 200-pound man over my shoulder. You know, it was just a lot of fun. It was dangerous, though. A couple times I could've gotten really hurt.

Yet momentum is growing for a greater effort. On Thursday, a vast coalition of researchers from some of the nation's top universities is set to publish a new website laying out a book-length primer on the need for carbon removal. And even some on the political left, where skepticism of direct air capture has been most pronounced, are now arguing that the technology could be used to decolonize the atmosphere.

There is now a $10,000 cap on all state income taxes, personal property taxes, sales tax and local taxes, he said. Prior to 2018, there was no cap. This will hit individuals who are higher income and live in states with income tax the most, Rosatti said.

Kaepernick became a free agent after the '16 season and has not been signed by another team.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney and Saskatchewan's Scott Moe, speaking at a panel discussion at the Wilson Center's Canada Institute, acknowledged the cold front that moved in after voters in their provinces froze out the climate-conscious federal Liberals last October, in large part over perceived federal hostility to Canada's emissions-causing oilpatch.
When you look at the words that he uses, which are historic dog whistles of white supremacy. When you look at how he reacted to the Charlottesville incident, where neo-Nazis murdered a woman, versus how he manufactures crises like immigrants seeking legal refuge on our borders, it's — it's night and day, Ocasio-Cortez continued.
My son William persevered from the womb.
Wild Card weekend 2017, which kicks off this Saturday, will feature two of the hottest teams in the NFL. The Steelers boast a seven-game win streak and feature a trio of superstars, including unlikely MVP candidate Antonio Brown.

Executive chef Maria Grubb of Underground Dining Club and ― until COVID-19 forced its closure ― renowned Gallo Negro in San Juan, Puerto Rico, reminisces, It reminds me of being a kid and watching local chefs on the 12 o'clock cooking segment during summertime … all those clear ramekins with ingredients going into mixing bowls and pots made me smile.
The conversation illuminates the way many Americans understood sexual violence at the time — especially as it pertains to black girls, who are often perceived as older, less innocent and more knowledgeable about sex than their white peers. Like the women in Philly, many of Kelly's fans were shocked and dismayed by Kelly's relationship with Aaliyah. But they aimed their disgust at the younger woman, who was presumed to be either sexually unsatisfactory or suspiciously seductive ― never a victim or a survivor of abuse.
However, there are many of us who still see the kitchen as a fiery den of potential panic. Cooking with anything but the simplest ingredients can seem daunting at the end of an exhausting day, prepping can feel overwhelming, and whatever do you mean by fold in the cheese?!

Nothing burns good employees out quite like overworking them. It's so tempting to work your best people hard that managers frequently fall into this trap. Overworking good employees is perplexing; it makes them feel as if they're being punished for great performance. Overworking employees is also counterproductive. New research from Stanford shows that productivity per hour declines sharply when the workweek exceeds 50 hours, and productivity drops off so much after 55 hours that you don't get anything out of working more.

Joining them in the top is 10th queen Bebe Zahara Benet as Diana Ross. She effortlessly proves why less is more: She has few lyrics to lip-sync to, but every movement, every facial twitch, and every affect is right. Here's the key that everybody should look at for that: You didn't do much to embody Diana, head judge Michelle Visage says. Subtlety won out for her. Still, it'd be tough to argue for her win, considering how little she does compared to Shangela and Ben.
These Christians instead choose to play God vying for the position of arbiter of whose life is worthy of protecting. This is antithetical to Christian values of grace, love, kindness, gentleness and caring for those on the margins. In this political environment, it has become clear over and over again that a few lives of people considered unworthy are worth sacrificing for the moral control and power that oppressing them brings to powerful Christians.

For example, if you had a mortgage or student loan placed in deferment, you'll need to add that payment back into your budget. If you paused your 401(k) contributions to free up cash flow, this is a vital item to include in your post-pandemic budget. And if you dipped into your emergency fund, you'll need to include a line item in your budget to build it back up. Experts now suggest saving beyond the previously recommended three to six months' worth of expenses, given the unpredictability of the job market.

Author and activist Kevin Powell was a senior writer at Quincy Jones' Vibe magazine when the publication printed Kelly and Aaliyah's marriage certificate in 1995. I interviewed Aaliyah first for the publication, and I remember her sounding deeply connected to R. Kelly in a way I thought was not right, given she was a minor and he an adult, about my age, Powell wrote in an email to HuffPost. I mentioned that fact to folks at Vibe and to the best of my recollection we were the ones who published their marriage certificate first, and talked about the marriage being annulled.

Look at some of the allies that America has — Japan, South Korea, Canada, Mexico, the UK. Trump has a style of insulting and being brash about things on Twitter, but mostly issues with these countries have been solved behind closed doors because their relationships have been institutionalised over 40, 50, 60 years. With institutionalised relationships, a lot of these differences get divided down the political ladder, where empowered cabinet secretaries can make decisions. With India and the U.S., it's a one step forward and two steps back kind of situation.
The CBO is probably wrong; Paul and Hersh are probably right. And in a $21-plus trillion economy, a gap of a couple trillion isn't really that big.

I've reached out to therapists, but not in recent years. I do think therapists are helpful and could help me work through certain things and I am open to finding one. But right now, when I think about what's causing my anxiety, a therapist can't fix everything. They can't pay these bills or make money more accessible to me. So unless they're paying me in cash, they can't fix my problems. [Laughs]
If you've never really invested before, or you just have a small pot of money right now, what should you do? We asked financial experts that very question, and here's what they said:
Self-deprecating thoughts can batter your self-esteem, self-worth and self-confidence, said Karen Donzaldson, a communication and body language expert and certified confidence coach in Toronto.
Pictures of Ansari, smiling and dressed in a pink jacket, circulated in news reports and on social media, contrasting with the particularly gruesome details of her rape and death. The tragedy attracted international attention and incited calls for the government to take action.
Again, the mob traipsed through the city, unmasked and sure there would be no threats against their livelihood. The shedding of the masks was a subject of internal debate for the group, a move that some felt would grant their organization added legitimacy and respectability, the Post reported.
There was a failure of leadership at the top of the Capitol Police, said Pelosi, who noted on Thursday that Sund had not been in touch with congressional leaders to discuss the violence.
ROBERTO SCHMIDT/AFP via Getty Images Supporters of President Donald Trump rampage through the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 as Congress met to count the Electoral Votes that named Joe Biden the winner of the November election.
Costa Constantinides, the Queens councilman behind the city's major 2019 climate bill, said he is now serving as Stringer's climate adviser.

As the event came together that Saturday, I was enraptured watching my parents throughout the night. From the first few thumps on the drum, my mother's face lit up in delight as the lion dancers made their grand entrance for a daring bench routine. They clapped along enthusiastically to an upbeat tai chi dance choreographed by my friends from a college dance troupe. And as my husband's cousin performed a moving rendition of the Butterfly Lover's Concerto, I could see my father's eyes welling up knowing too well why I had chosen this musical number.
Johnson's own trial lawyers relied on a psychologist with no expertise in intellectual disability. That psychologist claimed Johnson did not have an intellectual disability, based on an interpretation of Johnson's IQ test score that is now considered inaccurate. Therefore, the jury was never asked to consider whether Johnson had an intellectual disability that would disqualify him from a death sentence.
My sister and I have butted heads often, even as adults. During this time, we are gentle with one another. Several weeks in, my sister's car unexpectedly dies and she must buy a new one. She drives from the dealership to Mom's. Under the pretense of going for a spin, we drive around the neighborhood.
Because of the ending? Was that a problem with potential studios, too?
2016 was a successful year in terms of continuing to achieve lasting change in poor countries, cities, and neighborhoods with the international team of Thought 4 Action (T4A). This personal mark of our methodology in fighting poverty and building a robust middle class, maintains the magic and the purpose to continue! At T4A, we are proud to keep the movement alive and make the inspiration of change a reality for millions of people in the appropriate ecosystems.
That is indeed a story of liberation. It is a story of freedom. The freedom from fear. The freedom to say the word marijuana on the phone without cops showing up to ask you about it. The freedom not to worry about what the mailman sees when you open the front door to sign for a package. The freedom from any paranoia at all, in fact, whether legitimate or imagined. As F.D.R. might have said: the fear itself of possessing marijuana is no longer to be feared.
Naturally, the only way to know for certain what someone is willing to pay for the business is to put it on the market, but knowing how similar businesses transact will get you in the ballpark.
Amy Schumer is weighing in on the allegations against friend and fellow comedian Aziz Ansari stemming from a viral story about a woman who says he coerced and pressured her for sex.
The agreement with Keith Wildhaber was finalized Monday, hours after St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar announced he is retiring, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.
Britain officially left the bloc's vast single market for people, goods and services at 11 p.m. London time on Thursday, giving it greater scope to set its own laws. A new U.K.-EU trade deal will bring new restrictions and red tape, but for British Brexit supporters, it means reclaiming national independence from the EU and its rules. They pointed to the abolition of the tampon tax as an early positive change from Brexit.
Authorities warned that land damaged by recent wildfires is especially prone to flash flooding and debris flows because burned soil is less absorbent, repelling water as well as pavement in some cases. Water that would normally be absorbed into the ground instead runs off, picking up ash, silt and debris along the way and threatening nearby areas.
A new law to protect emergency workers from assaults has won the personal backing of Theresa May after police, paramedics and nurses lobbied MPs for tougher sentences. A private members' bill to specifically target abuse against 999 staff has secured the Prime Minister's approval, HuffPost UK has been told. The Assaults on Emergency Workers (Offences) Bill, tabled by Labour MP Chris Bryant, is due to have its Second Reading in the Commons on Friday and is now expected to get enough Parliamentary time to get on the statute book. Dubbed the 'Protect The Protectors Law', the bill follows a rising number of incidents where NHS, firefighters and police staff have been abused, attacked or spat at in the line of duty. The legislation will for the first time deem assaults on emergency staff as aggravated, and subject to heavier sentences. It will also force suspects to provide samples of saliva or blood to ensure rapid testing of HIV and other illnesses.

It's not just that they are a larger share of the early vote than they were in the general, it's that there's a lot of African American voters who didn't vote in the general who are being drawn out in this race, Bonier said.
For too long, people of color have been stereotyped with these kinds of hurtful symbols ― and no symbol is more hurtful than the football team in the nation's capital using a dictionary-defined racial slur as its team name, Oneida Nation Representative Ray Halbritter, the group's leader, said in an emailed statement.
There are other kinds of rage, though, and other uses for it. Anger is loaded with information and energy, wrote Audre Lorde in a 1981 address titled The Uses of Anger. I have suckled the wolf's lip of anger and I have used it for illumination, laughter, protection, fire in places where there was no light, no food, no sisters, no quarter.

During the 2019 election, Trudeau aligned himself with Thunberg on the campaign trail by positioning the environment as a key issue. When the Liberals released their climate plan, they were called out by the NDP for buying the Trans Mountain Pipeline.
But that message, partially motivated to warn off legal exposure for sparking the riot, ran contrary to what Trump has said throughout his term, including when he urged his supporters to fight for him last week. Trump said not a word about his impeachment in the video, though he complained about the ban on his social media.
How did The Underground Kitchen and The Underground Kitchen Community First get started?
When the majority of the runners gradually got farther and farther ahead of me -- with only a handful of runners behind me -- the lie grew bigger: You aren't good enough.
Ed Avol, a professor of clinical preventive medicine at the University of Southern California, has been living in Los Angeles for decades. An avid runner, he explained that refraining from walking or exercising along busy streets can help you avoid air fouled by vehicle emissions.
This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.
I say short timeline to prevent too much hesitation and developing excuses. You'll never do it, unless you say when. When Daniel decided to work 50 Jobs in 50 States, he wanted to do it all in 50 consecutives weeks, a timeline that was obtainable and kept him focused. Otherwise, he would find himself, years still on the road or have given up. If you wait for perfect conditions, you'll never get anything done.
The move follows a similar announcement by Canada, which said Sunday it would refuse to send any athletes to Japan if the event was not postponed.

Even if AA doesn't work, [it] absolutely does not mean you can't get and stay sober, Melchor said. There are so many other resources available, especially now with the internet.

We are now in a reactive, fear-driven time in our history. Suri was asked what will have to take place, in order to change the fear-driven course we are on now. The answer was 1. the millennials-a new generation, with a new perspective 2. creative leaders 3. getting money out of politics.
We are in a lot of trouble organizationally. - John Milloy
You're far too powerful to entrust someone else with your happiness, take back the reigns.
While he acknowledged the ban went against the freedom-loving instincts of the British people, he said it was essential to achieve the 75% reduction in unnecessary social contacts required to reduce the rate of infection.
Sandra: Yes. Many of our clients have lived in the city or currently live in NYC. There's a refined element there. The look tends to be rooted in a more traditional point of view. It's not as casual and laid-back as I think of the West Coast. Scale is also very different as East Coast spaces tend to be smaller, both due to the value of real estate and the age of the homes. Of course, our suburban clients often have larger scale to play with.
Five states ― Arizona, Georgia, New Mexico, North Carolina and South Carolina ― experienced their warmest year on record. Annual temperatures in another 32 states, including Alaska, ranked among the 10 warmest years on record.
Virtue and Moir are in first place in ice dancing at the 2018 Olympics. A win would be their second gold medal at this year's games. They also took home gold at the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver, Canada, and silver at the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Russia.
Some researchers believe the fibers in porous material catch the virus particles, dry them out and break them apart, Amler said. Smooth surfaces like leather and vinyl can be wiped clean.
A passage from an Abeka high school history book.
Authorities have since imposed transport restrictions on nearly all of Hubei province, which has a population of 59 million.
We need more diverse messages and messengers: There are hundreds of exceptionally qualified Black & Brown, Native, LGBTQ+, multilingual, multicultural public health and health care leaders who are better versed at communicating and connecting with the diverse communities they come from. Public health and health care have to elevate diverse leaders to positions of authority and visibility and learn how to speak the language not of science, but of the people ― by connecting with community leaders, faith leaders, and everyday Americans long before the point of an emergency.
The 2018 SI swimsuit issue seems to have made the women in it feel really good, and certainly made a handful of people a bunch of money, but did it bestow any real, actual power on women as a whole? Absolutely not.
Objective #1: You're trying to incentivize your key employees with stock-based compensation.
Just days into the new year, the U.S. Army has already handed a major victory to religious liberty advocates.
To those of us who live in D.C., another contrast was blatant. Just months earlier, when Black Lives Matter protests filled the streets of the city demanding justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and the countless other Black lives lost to senseless police violence, we saw how D.C. can quickly mobilize a large and terrifying force when it has the will to do so.
On Thursday, Google announced that it plans to remove the View Image button from its image search results interface. The feature made it easy for users to find the original image, which is usually a higher resolution than the thumbnail displayed in the search results.
The president of USA Gymnastics, Steve Penny, resigned in March 2017 amid the investigation.
According to the organization, at least 159 officers took their own lives in 2018 — the same number of suicide fatalities it tracked in 2017 and 19 more than in 2016.
The U.S. death toll from the coronavirus topped 241, with 18,170 confirmed cases as of Friday, according to a CNN tally. The nation reeled from shortages of protective gear, ventilators and testing kits, and doctors pleaded for help, comparing the experience to being at war with no ammo.
For one, Ocasio-Cortez did not propose taking 70 percent of anyone's income. In an interview with 60 Minutes, the 29-year-old suggested applying this marginal rate only to earnings amounting to more than $10 million. This means that those impacted would pay a much lower share of their income overall and the average tax rate for working Americans could potentially go down under her idea.
Christmas and New Year's came and went. Winter snows will fall and melt away. Essential workers are having their turn to get a COVID vaccine and after, I'll be in line for mine. I want to prove that COVID has me down right now, but not out.
Still, air pollution hit an all-time low last year after the city tightened heating oil rules.
You have to ask yourself, why do I follow this person? she said. What interests me about them? Is it their lifestyle? Is it simply their beauty? How do I feel when I see this person and look at their posts? Do I feel inspired? Do I feel like I've found someone I can relate to? Do I simply enjoy their aesthetics? Or do I simply want to be [like] them?
Like Graham, Tedjo is in his mid-30s and has never held public office.
The irony is not lost on me, that the same words I wanted to hear my whole life were the words I tearfully told them as a newly married woman.
Let me start by saying that I believe there have been great strides made in how heterosexual relationships divide the domestic stuff. More men are cleaning, cooking and organizing than was ever imaginable even 30 years ago.
4. ASC recreates the theater experience the way Shakespeare's audiences would have enjoyed it, with the lights on (universal lighting). Audience members are encouraged to sit on stage and, at times, even interact with the performers. And get there early. Just as in Shakespeare's time, before the show the cast sings and plays contemporary music related to the play, such as songs by Lady Gaga and Weezer.
The big question is how doctors, hospitals, drugmakers and all the other industries related to health care would react. Some would figure out how to become more efficient or live with lower margins. Some would react simply by reducing capacity, right at a moment when millions of newly insured people were seeking it.
The conventional wisdom on negative emissions has so far been to focus on what can be done cheaply while directing government spending toward arresting the growth of emissions by replacing fossil-fueled transport and energy production with zero-carbon alternatives. But reaching those levels of emission removals by 2050 means going through a lot of costly trial-and-error in the next few decades. And though direct air capture requires prodigious amounts of energy to work ― demanding, at the scale modeled in the study, up to 25% of the nation's electricity production ― existing sources of reliable, 24-hour power could render the technology affordable to run at present prices.
We are proud to be the first city in the South to have the foresight and wherewithal to build its own mass-transit system, MARTA (Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority), which was a major component in our winning bid to host the Centennial Olympic Games in 1996. MARTA now serves as the backbone of an expanding public-transportation system which will provide greater connectivity for working families to our job centers and world-class universities.

It can't just be: 'Hey, who wants to help, let me know!' We need to know who is going to produce what and when, Cuomo said. This is a national emergency.
With all the injustice in the world, it's beyond rich that the unelected and unaccountable United Nations would seemingly single out Canada — one of the greatest champions of human rights, democracy and rule of law, said Minister of Energy Sonya Savage in a statement.
The 29-year-old woman, who has been incapacitated since age 3, was sexually assaulted, police say, and they are trying to track down the assailant. Investigators are collecting DNA from the facility's male employees and anyone else who may have had contact with her.
There is a very proud, strong, legitimate massage profession, and people across the country love to get legitimate massages, Myles said. The legitimate businesses are very frustrated that these imposters that have nothing to do with actual massage have weaved their way into the industry and sell sex by exploiting vulnerable women.
But we often feel guilty if we place our own needs ahead of things we feel obligated to do. That can end up backfiring: Not only do you get burned out, you also won't have energy to spend on people you care about.
I can tell you, seeing something on someone that looks like me makes everything easier and [my feed] so much more enjoyable, Omari said. It gives you a sense of acceptance. You feel 'seen.'
<strong>1. Do what you know.</strong> Mixing up exercise is great advice 11 months out of the year, but during the stressfest known as December, you <em>need</em> routine. When you're overwhelmed by obligations, the workouts you're most likely to do are the ones you know by heart, say researchers at the University of Southern California.

We can stop talking about how white Americans voted for Trump because of economic interest. His appeal was never about money. (And Trump is leaving office with the economy in tatters, by the way. On Thursday, 1.15 million more people filed for unemployment.)
The state senate also approved resolutions for constitutional amendments to let people vote absentee without an excuse and to eliminate a 10-day cutoff for registering for elections. The latter measure is necessary to implement same day registration. Lawmakers will need to pass those amendments in the next legislative session, which begins in 2021, in order to send them to the ballot for voters to approve.
New York City follows cities and counties in California and Colorado that have either filed or announced pending climate impact litigation.
Weeks of federal indecision on the regulatory approval process and inaction in the face of illegal blockades have created more uncertainty for investors looking at Canada, said Kenney.
During the campaign, Biden repeatedly vowed to strategically support ongoing plaintiff-driven climate litigation against polluters as part of his pledge to wage a whole-of-government fight to curb planet-heating emissions.
Fully exhaling and emptying the lungs with each breath will help you get more serratus anterior recruitment, better posterior tilting of the pelvis, better anterior core engagement, and relaxation of overused supplemental respiratory muscles. (1)
Palin was another talented young communicator who made a big splash in national politics before having her lack of knowledge painfully exposed. Instead of studying up, Palin gave up any pretense of seriousness and has now disappeared from the debate. This is a cautionary tale for Ocasio-Cortez, Boot writes.
Legal experts said Barrett's father, who now works as a Catholic deacon in Louisiana, could be called for deposition as part of the case.
Obviously it's too simplistic to say these textbooks are causing people to think something, but they play a unique role in giving visual credibility to these ideas by having them be in a very traditionally trustworthy artifact, said Adam Laats, professor of history and education at New York state's Binghamton University. There's a sense that they couldn't put it in a schoolbook if it wasn't true.
A reporter also asked Trump about the five Republican senators now in isolation — Paul, as well as Sens. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.).
Mr. Wilner's column is a good place to start. Because while things may change, bad policy will always be bad policy.
Nelson barrelled into the Steelers' sidelines after pushing running back Jordan Todman out-of-bounds. Munchak may have felt like Nelson unnecessarily shoved his running back into the sideline -- Todman was nearly out-out-bounds when Nelson hit him, and the extra push sent Todman crashing into the bench.
Consistently saving money and paying bills on time can be tough, especially when money is tight. That's why you should take the flawed human element out of the equation, said Tiffany Aliche, better known as The Budgetnista.
In March 2016, the government had also roped in the NITI Aayog to offer their suggestions.
Worst of all, however, was the lack of concern for state and local governments. Back in July, the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning think tank, estimated that the coronavirus crash would create state government budget shortfalls of about $555 billion ― a figure that would increase substantially if local and tribal governments were included in the calculation. The CARES Act included just $150 billion in state and local government relief.
You probably have an image of 'gifted' kids as weird bookworms with no social skills. But I think of myself as any other normal, happy kid.
First, we need to understand the nine worst things that managers do that send good people packing.
The Senate confirmed Bernhardt as Interior's deputy secretary in July 2017. Before his confirmation hearing, 150 conservation groups signed a letter opposing his nomination, citing his ties to the industries he is now charged with regulating and labeling him a walking conflict of interest.
Comme le Sras, cette nouvelle maladie se transmet entre humains et appartient à la famille des coronavirus. Mais Pékin a changé d'attitude comparé à l'épidémie de 2002-2003 (774 morts dans le monde dont 349 en Chine continentale et 299 à Hong Kong) qui lui avait valu les critiques de l'Organisation mondiale de la santé (OMS).
It is surprising to notice how we change when we consider these small things about ourselves. I welcome any comments and experiences that arise for you as you consider these thoughts.
California saw some of the worst fires in state history late last year; the Thomas fire burned over 1,000 structures.
No objective person who reads my books and those written by authors like Larry Swedroe, John Bogle, Burton Malkiel, William Bernstein and many others would continue to be seduced by the marketing hype of Wall Street. Movies like The Big Short do a great job of exposing the underlying greed that pervades the industry. But don't be fooled. While the financial crisis dealt a devastating blow to the retirement dreams of many, it pales in comparison to the daily plundering of assets that occurs when investors listen to the recommendations of those who claim an ability to beat the market.
But what does back actually mean when the U.S. is still in the grips of the coronavirus pandemic, and the vast majority of Americans are not vaccinated? Is it safer now to spend time around friends, family or other daily contacts who haven't gotten their shots? Can you see someone who has been vaccinated even if you have not?
But Perrone also said the pay increases already secured might not be easy for employers to retract once the pandemic passes, since so many workers believe they deserve the higher wages at all times.
While you're resisting the temptation to empty store shelves, remember to exercise this restraint with masks, too. If you're not coughing or sneezing or caring for someone who is, you probably don't need to wear one.
I just really wish they would focus on the people they're affecting, Speaks said. Workers like her husband and his colleagues are out there risking their lives, she added, and they're not getting paid. It's not fair.
My modest upbringing didn't give me lots of new clothes or fun vacations, but it did give me a solid work ethic. Both of my parents instilled in me the importance of doing a good job, of completing a task, of doing my best at everything.
Perrone said many of the union's members feel the same way. The UFCW often holds focus groups of grocery and meatpacking workers to gauge how they view their jobs. Even in tight labor markets, he said, a high share of them would say they feel replaceable at work.
Using custom magnetic palettes can also save consumers money when they purchase refills instead of the standard product. Ha breaks it down: There is a $3 differential between the MAC eyeshadow and the MAC eyeshadow refill. For consumers who purchase multiple products a year, the savings will begin to add up!
The Killing Eve star, who made history last year as the first Asian woman nominated for the Emmy award for best actress in a drama series, has long spoken out about the importance of diversity and representation in Hollywood, and the paucity of roles for Asian actors.
Completion of the report, and its promised public release, is still weeks away. But on Dec. 22 the law firm submitted a dramatic  interim update  to RZIM's executive committee, which made it public the next day.
Towards the end of the first quarter of the Steelers' Wild Card matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals on Saturday night, Munchak yanked a handful of Bengals safety Reggie Nelson's dreadlocks.
In the Trump era in particular, award show hosts have had to toe the line in deciding whether to delve into politics.
POLITIQUE - Une ultime tentative qui s'est avérée vaine. Malgré l'investissement personnel d'Emmanuel Macron dans la campagne parisienne, qui a demandé à Cédric Villani de se rapprocher de Benjamin Griveaux, le candidat dissident s'est montré inflexible: il ira jusqu'au bout coûte que coûte. Et ce n'est pas son exclusion de La République en Marche annoncée ce lundi 27 janvier qui devrait changer la donne.

New York now has 20,875 positive cases, including 5,707 new cases since Sunday. About 13%, or 2,635 people, are hospitalized, a rate which Cuomo says has gone down from the last few days. Six hundred and twenty-one people are in intensive care.
I bring the perspective of a person who has lived with the consequences of a Liberal government for 15 years, the good and the bad, she told HuffPost. I know what it's like to struggle to meet a payroll, I know what it's like to worry about paying rent.
At this time, most regions of the United States have not been identified to have local spread of COVID-19, Dean said. This means that those at highest risk for having the illness would be people who have had known exposure to COVID-19 or have traveled to an area of local spread.
At first things didn't feel any different, as we had already lived together and had been dating for nine years before we got married. But a few months in is when I noticed a bit of a change. It seems obvious, but we simply hold more responsibility toward one another now. We're both fairly independent people, so making all these major decisions together, like merging bank accounts and logistically talking about where we want to live in the next three to five years, has opened the doors to what true communication and compromise means (not like the old days of talking in hypotheticals or deciding what Ben & Jerry's flavor to eat that night). Compromise has been the biggest, hardest and most rewarding difference. - Angela, married six months
Gun safety groups say an expansion of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), established in 1994 under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, is long overdue. Since that law's passage, background checks have blocked an estimated 3 million prohibited gun purchases, according to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Under current regulations, as many as 1 in 5 firearm transfers takes place without a background check.
Our experts agreed that if possible, it's not a bad idea to have some non-perishable food on hand in case a situation arises that prevents you from food shopping.
All that extra squeezing (think walnut crackin' between those cheeks) increases recruitment of the deep abdominal muscles (transverse abdominis) by increasing overall tension and muscle recruitment.
Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said there isn't an exact science for predicting the scope of a disaster.
It's a very strange time for us, and anything we can do to bring each other together is great, said Michelle Shaw, who joined in from Australia.
On Jan. 6, there was a choice not to be prepared, to go easy on the white domestic terrorists who infiltrated the Capitol. There can be no clearer sign of who we are as a nation.
According to WHO's published agenda for its origins research, there are no plans to assess whether there might have been an accidental release of the coronavirus at the Wuhan lab, as some American politicians, including President Donald Trump, have claimed.
The bill, announced Tuesday and set to be introduced Wednesday, marks a significant step toward weaning the nation's largest and most economically influential city off fossil fuels. Six cities across the United States already generate 100 percent of their electricity with renewables. The city council in Washington, D.C., passed a bill last month requiring the city to offset 100 percent of its electricity purchases with renewable energy credits by 2032. But it would be a historic first for a metropolis like New York to shutter existing gas plants like these, and the city's move would likely ripple far beyond the five boroughs as other big cities sought ways to slash climate-changing emissions.
I want to be very clear: I unequivocally condemn the violence that we saw last week, said Trump. He added that no true supporter of his could ever endorse political violence.
At one point, a community participant took offense. It was difficult moment; we had to navigate a misunderstanding about the key terminology--smart and marginalized. But we soon realized that these words have an edge to them, and that one of the keys to being inclusive is anticipating sensitivities to the terms that we use to describe these challenges, and making sure the definitions are clear, and appropriate, from the start.
There is ongoing litigation over the constitutionality of the process, given the apparent cruel and unusual punishment it would inflict. Several of the plaintiffs were executed before seeing the result of their legal fight. Some medical experts now warn individuals with COVID-19 who are injected with a lethal dose of pentobarbital will likely experience pulmonary edema faster, resulting in more conscious pain and suffering.
Then there's Thorgy, bless her heart. Thorgy was a fantastic competitor on Drag Race season eight, continually scoring high in the challenges, until her lack of wins and imagined rivalry with eventual champion Bob the Drag Queen got the best of her. When she started overthinking things, she sunk into a pile of self-doubt, and never fully recovered.
Oh man. I got in trouble before because I was a little too blunt about it, he said, referring to
The rest of the road trip, I think through Ohio up to Michigan, we were fighting so bad we both lost our voice because we were screaming at each other on the motorcycle, she said. And I refused to hold onto him, so I held onto the back of the motorcycle, like a boss. The fighting got worse when Shepard finally met Bell's mother. Watch the video above to hear the rest.
In a live update on Facebook Wednesday evening, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said that hospitals around the state reported they were running short on supplies they needed to treat patients during the coronavirus pandemic.
I think all people can benefit from throwing out the idea of 'thinspiration' and just start following people who make them feel like they can also become their best selves, she said.
I avoid using any modern slang or referring to anything that has to do with modern technology, and I often have to play dumb when adults and teens try to mess with me and get me to talk about something a Disney princess definitely wouldn't know about.
When Biden was vice president, he, too, presided over the session as the Electoral College presented the 2016 vote tally to Congress to confirm Trump the winner. The session was brief, despite objections from some Democrats.
Here's what keeps me up at night when thinking about this trip: The domestic flight to Miami has one set of rules. The flight from Miami to Cuba has different rules. I guess we repack when we get to our hotel in Miami. Maybe that's why Road Scholar has an orientation meeting and dinner to prepare us for traveling to the airport at 3:15 am for our flight to Cuba.
Democrats can't do much to stop McConnell from confirming objectionable nominees; Republicans have been blowing up Senate traditions that previously gave the minority some leverage. And the reality is that even though Republicans have a slightly stronger hand now, all the GOP senators have been voting for Trump's court picks nearly all the time, meaning the vote outcomes in the new Senate likely won't change.

The bottom line is that Bernhardt is too conflicted to even be Acting Secretary, Saeger said.
By design, the technology architecture of UIDAI precludes even the possibility of profiling individuals for tracking their activities, the authority stated in the affidavit. Dismissing the concerns of privacy advocates, the UIDAI falsely claimed that contention of the petitioners that on the basis of a single identifier, Aadhaar will enable the government agencies to track and profile and do surveillance is completely unfounded and denied.

If you live with a chronic condition like fibromyalgia, you may be all-too-familiar with the frustrating and undesirable symptoms it can cause. Although there's no reason to feel ashamed of any symptoms or side effects you experience, it can still be embarrassing when brain fog causes you to forget what you were saying in the middle of an important work meeting, or a sudden burst of pain makes you drop the dishes you were putting away in the kitchen.
I know I'm richly blessed and live a privileged life, wrote Middleton, 31. But it did not make me immune to depression. It is tricky to describe the condition. It is not merely sadness. It is an illness, a cancer of the mind.
L'OMS a rendu publics six rapports de situation depuis le début de la crise. A partir de son troisième, le 23 janvier, elle a établi une évaluation du risque. Dans son sixième rapport de situation, diffusé dans la nuit de dimanche à lundi, l'OMS a corrigé son analyse, assurant que son évaluation du risque (...) n'a pas changé (...): très élevé en Chine, élevé au niveau régional et élevé au niveau mondial.

Her advice if you're an employee of this kind of boss? Make sure that you build relationships with your manager's peers, or other people in positions of power, and go to them for feedback and support. The goal is for more people to know what a great job you're doing. Spread the surface area of how you're being managed, Hogan advised.
Whitver and other Republicans argue that revamping the state tax code and lowering tax rates would result in economic growth. But even in the best of cases, that growth can take years to materialize, and, Whitver says, the windfall from Washington could help tide the state over during the adjustment.

Different camera lenses can change the way people look in photos. For example, Perry said that if someone wanted to look slimmer, he would choose a longer lens because the shorter the lens, the wider it's going to make your face.

Dry Farm Wines even makes the claim that its wines are hangover-free, which is impossible, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, since alcohol is the main cause of hangovers.

After understanding your why, start looking for resources or support that helps address that specific issue. Endale said that over time you'll be able to replace alcohol with healthier habits. However, this isn't something you have to do on your own.
I got my hair done and bought a new bathing suit. With a few props in tow, I traveled back to Bali to stay at a popular bucket-list hotel and attempt to get the ultimate tropical waterfall shot. Instead of enjoying the luxurious resort with its unreal infinity pool and world-class spa, I dedicated my entire day to getting a picture that would truly wow on Instagram. After reviewing photos and video taken over six hours, I felt completely disheartened. None of them were as good as those of other girls I had seen in my feed. I felt too fat, too blemished, too plain. I scrapped the entire project and retreated into a dark hole.
The sore throat is sort of like smoking a pack of menthol cigarettes when you're already a little sick. And you'll feel very tired, she wrote. You'll be surprised how much your eyeballs hurt, and ice packs on your eyes won't help.
Issa suggested reminding yourself that you can be happy right now if you try to work on these things through small changes, and that you will have a greater probability of getting where you want to be if you are happy. Take the first step by eating a healthy meal or signing yourself up for a dating app. Revel in those tiny steps, which can add up quickly.
These are not the kinds of results one would expect with a hard-liner in the White House. But it's a perfectly logical outcome for Trump, who campaigned on a border wall to solve a contrived crisis of illegal immigration at a time when unauthorized crossings stood at 45-year lows.

All of this is true, but the verdict of success is misplaced. Congress badly misjudged the nature and scope of the coronavirus crisis with the CARES Act, and then took six months to assemble a fiscal Band-Aid for its mistakes. By the time Congress finally passed an eleventh-hour re-up on some of the law's provisions, 1 out of every 6 American families with children were going hungry. And what they passed was a paltry influx of cash ― far short of the $2,000 per person that Democrats, and even Trump, called for.
We had the image analyzed by our experts in child exploitation matters. They determined that it does not meet the threshold of a criminal matter, so there isn't an investigation underway, he said.
Attorney John Manly, who represents more than 100 Nassar victims, called the resignation a public relations ploy in a statement to HuffPost.
Fresh moves to create more female Labour MPs were also set to be adopted, with more all-women shortlists for Parliamentary selections ahead of any snap general election. A new plan to crack down on anti-semitic and racist abuse was also approved. Expanding the NEC to include 39 members is a key move in ensuring it reflects the Corbyn-supporting membership. At present, just six seats are reserved for Constituency Labour Party (CLP) representatives, while 12 go to trade unions. Under the changes, there will be nine CLP reps, and an extra union seat, to reflect shopworkers' union Usdaw's large membership. Key ally and Momentum founder Jon Lansman told the Indepdendent this week: Out of 35 members, half a million members have just six representatives. It's absurd.
If you have tried a certain budgeting method in the past and failed, that does not mean you are a failure, Love said. It means your process failed you.
For instance, imagine two separate lists — of PAN numbers and cell-phone numbers — each seeded with their respective unique Aadhaar numbers. It is now easy to create a unified database of PAN numbers and phone numbers using Aadhaar as the common identifier.
The technique typically involves applying a form of heat to the bottom of the packaging (as demonstrated in the tutorial video above) to help the product come out. Traditionally, most depotting was done in the oven or on a flat iron, whereby low heat was used to gently melt the glue holding the makeup pan in the packaging, so that you could then carefully lift it out, explains Shteysel.

MysteryBrand.net, which is riddled with grammatical errors, quietly removed its top prizes ― including beach vacations, premium California real estate and luxury vehicles ― following a maelstrom of scam accusations on social media in the wake of Paul and Le's viral videos. Its now-deleted photo of a $250 million Most Expensive Los Angeles Realty mansion was actually an image of a $188 million Bel Air home, The Daily Beast and others reported. And until recently, Mystery Brand's prize list included a 2018 Lamborghini Centenarió ― only 40 of which have ever been produced (all prior to 2018). The same goes for its Real Car Rolls-Royce Phantom 2018 ― no such car was made last year.

Wash your hands with warm, soapy water and scrub for at least 20 seconds. (Sick of singing happy birthday to yourself? This hilarious Twitter thread gives you some better alternatives.) Wipe down surfaces, especially your phone. Wash your hands. Try to limit how often you touch your face, especially in areas like your nose and eyes. Sneeze and cough into your elbow. Oh, did we mention you should wash your hands?

It was the first time I heard people had the same feelings that I did, he said. Being there, I realized I am gay and that is not going to change. Because one of [conversion therapy's] premises is that it's a choice. It's not a choice. You're born this way. So right there, that's a flawed philosophy. … I'm not a doctor and I can't prove that, but I can tell you why I know [it doesn't work].
Most surveys report a margin of error that represents some but not all potential survey errors. YouGov's reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling. If these assumptions are wrong, the model-based margin of error may also be inaccurate. Click here for a more detailed explanation of the model-based margin of error.

Air pollution is a universal threat to the public, and not just in cities with smoggy reputations like Beijing, Mumbai and Los Angeles. According to the World Health Organization, about 6.5 million deaths are associated with fouled air annually, and, shockingly, 9 out of 10 people worldwide live in a place where the air is simply not clean enough for human health.
At this point the only way to fight this coup is with another 'coup.' Obama purged many of the patriot/warrior types out of the military but Trump must have some idea of which generals he can call on, one post read. Do it, Donald. Military tribunals. Use the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) to run the story 24/7 while the traitors are rounded up.

The flagship coronavirus legislation was the CARES Act, passed in late March with a unanimous Senate vote. Conventional wisdom in Washington regards the law as a smashing success. Even the chronically malcontent left has cheered the CARES Act for temporarily boosting unemployment benefits by $600 a week ― a level that put modest upward pressure on wages, since some workers found themselves better off financially after losing their jobs. Generous provisions for big business prevented a financial panic, and though clumsy, the hundreds of billions of dollars allocated to support small businesses did not go to waste.
No, admittedly the iPhone was not the first smartphone - not even close. But the iPhone provided the basic form and function for every smartphone that followed, and today the smartphone is, by far, the best-selling gadget in the world, perhaps of all time. As noted by Steve Jobs in January 9, 2007, introduction at MacWorld, iPhone absorbed and integrated a host of the historic technologies documented here - portable music listening, video player, internet communicator, personal computer, portable navigation and, duh, cellular telephony - wrapped in an operating system designed from the ground-up for a touchscreen phone. iPhone's popularity not also ignited sales of all smartphones that followed and sparked the sale of billions of cases and accessories, but also birthed the billion-dollar app economy.
While the Fujitsu Plasmavision 42 ($13,999.99) was the first plasma flat panel display to go on sale, this Panasonic was the first large, wide, flat screen TV - in included an integrated tuner - that consumers could buy. At 3.5-inch thick it was a fat set by today's standards, its 852 x 480 resolution and composite video inputs was ultra high tech for the time, and its price was insane, even by today's standards. But it made fat tube TVs as anachronistic as black & white.
During the Reconstruction era, a period lasting about a decade after the Civil War until 1877, biracial governments came to power in cities across the South. Still reeling from defeat of the Confederacy, Southern Democrats often retaliated against this new power structure. On Nov. 10, 1898, a mob of white men marched on City Hall in Wilmington with their pistols and rifles to overthrow the local government and remove Black and white political leaders from their posts. They were successful. White supremacists took over. The mob destroyed Black-owned businesses, including the town's Black newspaper. Dozens of Black residents ended up dead.
This is truly a situation where prevention is the best cure, and right now the best prevention is physical distancing and getting vaccinated as soon as one is able to.

When discussing protests against the Iraq War and President George W. Bush's low approval rating at the time, the Abeka 11th-grade U.S. history book points the finger at the media in part, saying that much of the war opposition in America was the media, supported by a large number of Hollywood entertainers, and that spurred on by the media, many Americans wanted a change from the policies of the previous eight years.

Of course, partners' levels of desire may fluctuate over time for a number of reasons ― for example, the birth of a child, health problems or medication side effects. And there are relationships in which both partners are perfectly content with infrequent sex or not having sex at all.

A lot of the women are working as a subcontractor, so when police come in and catch them attempting to provide erotic services, the proprietor will blame the woman ― 'I didn't know she was doing that, go ahead and arrest her,' Mehlman-Orozco explained. Because of deception, indentured servitude and the fear of being deported, the victims typically won't cooperate with law enforcement. Even if the proprietor is charged, they'll plead down to tangentially related crimes, which result in a slap on the wrist.

In terms of depression, the stereotypes don't necessarily reflect the truth. First, there isn't a lot of historical data on depression or suicide. Certainly open conversation about it has been relatively recent, and parents were not as active in seeking help for their child. We do know that suicide rates have gone down since 1990 according to the Youth Suicide Prevention Program. That would seem to indicate that if depression rates have gone up, it is being more effectively managed.

Raheem Morris flopped and Greg Schiano was an abject failure for the Bucs. Smith appeared to have this thing back on track again after an extended struggle, so the switch away from him must mean either a) the front office has unrealistic expectations for this season, or b) the Buccaneers are hellbent on keeping Koetter in the fold.

A beautiful place and a pretty girl. The swimsuit issue may have evolved over the years, shifting with the cultural winds. The models may have gotten (ever so slightly) browner and blacker and occasionally bigger while the swimsuits got smaller; the presentation may have moved away from the blithe Lycra colonialism of its older shoots. But even with these new trappings of wokeness, the issue is still ultimately about those two things: beautiful places, and pretty girls who don't talk or move, who are ultimately present for the pleasure of men.

The American Hospital Association estimates that the nation would need to vaccinate 1.8 million people a day, every day, from Jan. 1 to May 31, to reach the goal of having widespread immunity by the summer. That's also called herd immunity and would involve vaccinating at least 75% of the population.
But letting Black men escape accountability isn't some sort of retribution for our ancestors who were murdered over false accusations, or for our peers who languish behind bars for crimes that they did not commit. Those of us who really care about justice should focus on creating a world where the race of an abuser will not protect him from punishment, nor ensure that he will be unduly punished.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) slammed as resentful a Washington Post op-ed that compared her to former presidential candidate Sarah Palin.
Still, the GOP has stuck with its almost exclusively negative messaging ― relentlessly working to portray both Ossoff and Warnock as radical extremists. Republicans are hopeful Trump will pick up on that message during his trip to northwest Georgia on Monday night, rather than focusing on his ongoing feud with Georgia election officials over their refusal to indulge his fantasies about voter fraud.

No one should storm the Capitol, but we should ask who these people and backgrounds are. They may or may not be Trump supporters, because most violence has come from the left like antifa after Trump demonstrations in D.C. before.

Twitter threads like Powers' and Haliti's ― or Instagram stories detailing symptoms ― are not just easily digestible for readers; they also put a human face on the rising numbers of cases. They drive home the severity of COVID-19 in a way that statistics can't, said Kirsten Hokeness, a professor and chair of the department of science and technology at Bryant University.
Speaking at a press conference outside a utility complex in Astoria on Tuesday morning, Constantinides said, It's time for a greener future here in western Queens.
The right answer for American corrections, outside of better training and monitoring of prison staffers, is to rehabilitate, educate, and train those who come into contact with incarceration. This is a perfect time to treat drug and alcohol addictions, teach appropriate anger management techniques, and help prisoners obtain a basic level of education and learn a trade so that when they return to society, of which the majority will, they will be prepared to act as a law-abiding citizen should.
There all many schools of thought about how to start and have a successful year. Some say making new year's resolutions is the way to go. Others say creating a vision board works best. Or perhaps just pick one word for the year and that be your goal and focus. While the ritual of each process is great, the outcome will be no different than waiting on another year if there is no behavior change.

Raisman, along with Olympians Gabby Douglas and McKayla Maroney, have alleged that Nassar abused them for years under the guise of treatment.
No, but it became clear pretty soon. I think the truth is that I wanted it to end the way everyone wanted it to end, but once I'd finally gotten to the place of the revenge movie where we're all begging for blood and where she's getting out weapons, I didn't believe that Al wouldn't lash out and wouldn't do everything in his power to stop it from happening. And also statistically, it just seemed like the odds were against it.

Every penny of the more than $3 trillion spent on health care each year goes into people's pockets, and none of those folks are going to let Bezos, Buffett and Dimon pick their purses without a fight. And these are people who don't lose very often.
'Treatment sessions' with him always made me feel tense and uncomfortable, Raisman wrote in her book Fierce. I would grit my teeth trying to convince myself that all this was part of the healing process.

A student would have to put in all the hours of classes, studying, commuting; find child care; commit personal and family money, Pell grants, GI bill; and take out the high-interest private loans often needed to attend expensive schools. Most of that time and money would never be regained. All this alleged scam could achieve is possible cancellation of federal loans — far from the whole thing, and far from guaranteed.
This is a drastic change from the usual coverage on LET whenever a police officer is injured while on duty or there is a perception that law enforcement is under threat. Over the past year of protests against police brutality, the site has featured profiles of many injured officers and published numerous far-right conspiracies against anti-racism protesters. On Tuesday, the site's front page story was an article criticizing the president of a tiny Michigan liberal arts college for issuing a statement condemning the Capitol riot and defending the anti-racism and police brutality protests from the past year.
But House passage of the bill is unlikely to change much. Even though the Senate unanimously passed a clean continuing resolution at the end of December ― a stopgap spending bill extending operations without border wall money ― Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has vowed not to bring up another bill in this new Congress until there's agreement from Trump.
Dr Anna Banerji, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Toronto, said the decision on whether to cancel travel plans to non-restricted destinations is up to the individual.

Times of rising unemployment and shrinking incomes tend to lead to large increases in Medicaid enrollment as people find themselves with less or no earnings and become eligible for the program. That leads to higher Medicaid spending. And a nationwide outbreak of a highly contagious virus that can lead to tens of thousands of dollars in medical costs will drive spending even higher this time. During the recession that began at the end of the last decade, millions of Americans enrolled in Medicaid.
The strategy was risky, considering that Trump lost the state. But they gambled that they needed to energize and turn out Trump's base in order to win ― even at the risk of energizing Democrats even more or alienating more moderate Republicans and independents.

We're deeply invested in the myth that medicine has drastically increased the human lifespan and will continue to do so. As Lieberman pointed out, the health care industry heavily markets its own importance and pushes treating illness over preventing it with lifestyle modification.

While Staver says that he is generally opposed to lynching (does he really want credit for that low bar?), he and his organization have made it clear with their opposition that they would rather see LGBTQ people dead without justice than see them alive and acknowledged as fully human. Liberty Counsel, which once advocated for Kim Davis and her refusal to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, uses quotes around language like transgender and gay on its website to invalidate the lived identities of people who obviously exist.

The candidates — three former cabinet ministers and three others who have never held office — call the delegated model confusing and inaccessible and say that it discourages people from joining their party.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday addressed Indians on the coronavirus outbreak and the efforts to contain it. In his first public remarks on the pandemic, Modi outlined the dangers of the disease and stressed the importance of social isolation. He has also called for Indians to observe a janata curfew, or people's curfew, on Sunday, March 22.

The idea that regulation stifles the economy, ultimately hurting consumers or workers more than they help, is one that conservatives believe sincerely ― and that, in any given case, is a reasonable subject for debate. But on the rule change for farmers, even some of the president's allies thought it was more about helping powerful friends. They're just pandering to big corporations, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said. They don't care about family farms.

In China, for instance, the traditional color of mourning is white, while in Thailand widows wear purple while mourning their spouses. And traditions, in general, continue to change.

An RCMP senior commander has been in contact with representatives from Coastal GasLink, Indigenous communities, including hereditary chiefs, and the province to ensure protests are lawful, peaceful and safe, Saunderson said.
The same can be said for our own lives. There are people that we have relied upon and with whom we have built a long-term relationship. We have truly let them into our lives. However, as the weight of whatever burden you need bared by them increases, that friend gives under the load and breaks away from you in a permanent and irrevocable manner. Yes, it hurts but just as leaves come for a reason during a season, branches are there for those life-long lessons that we will take with us long after the branches have broken and been swept away. That is the nature of our organic lives.
Trudeau said he agreed with her.

A Democratic Senate still would clear an easier path for Biden's nominees to key posts, especially on the federal judiciary, and give Democrats control of committees and much of the floor action.

To build greatly in America, one must recognize with the appropriate and unsparing fury the quiet horrors unfolding in suburban houses and on street corners and apartment buildings and rural towns within it. To build greatly, one must bank a great reserve of rage in one's chest, ready to harness it to break what must be broken, and to build good out of the wreck.
JOHANNESBERG — World-renowned virologist Gita Ramjee became the first Indian-origin South African to die after contracting the novel coronavirus in the country.
On Dec. 11, Nick Stafford pushed five wheelbarrows full of loose coins into Department of Motor Vehicles in Lebanon, Virginia, according to a statement he made on his company's website.
That makes the prospects for passing democracy reforms, another top progressive priority, seem bleak. Democracy reform refers to political process changes ranging from the adoption of public campaign financing and an end to partisan gerrymandering, which House Democrats have already approved, to more ambitious goals like bestowing statehood on the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.
Last January, Mayor Bill de Blasio decided to sue five major oil companies over infrastructure damage linked to sea level rise. A federal judge dismissed the suit in July, but California and seven other states signed on to New York City's appeal in November.
As hard as we might try, we cannot really change anyone but ourselves.
The Trump-led furor over a migrant caravan that formed a superheated prelude to the midterm elections was an expression of visceral rage, of fear, of a terrible anger to which Trump's supporters have responded eagerly at his legions of rallies. A DHS memo on the Christmas Eve death of a Guatemalan 8-year-old in custody that used the word illegal five separate times offered more of the same fear-mongering rhetoric, claiming that migrants are harboring illness.
One reason is that Congress is limited to one budget reconciliation bill per fiscal year, restricting how much legislation it can pass with a simple majority and heightening competition for what takes precedence. Because Congress has not yet used a budget reconciliation bill in Fiscal Year 2021, which began in October, it can pass one such bill for FY2021 and another such bill for FY2022.
The Lip Sync for Your Legacy is much more evenly edited this week; thank you, Drag Race, for learning from the premiere's Aja snub. I agree with Ru's decision on the lip sync: Shangela pulls out all kinds of tricks on the Pointer Sisters' Jump, while Ben mostly relies on the joke that she's copying Shangela's moves.

As a mother, from what I see, they're still hurt, they're upset, they're frustrated. My 19-year-old has not left the house at all. He hasn't even stepped outside for a breath of fresh air, she said. That's totally unlike him.
Iowa stands to gain $106 million next year and $138 million in 2020 from the federal tax changes if nothing is done to the state tax code, according to Iowa's Department of Revenue. That's about 2 percent of the state's $7.3 billion budget.

Throughout all of these episodes, congressional Republican leaders did nothing and continued to allow King to serve on the House Judiciary Committee, the committee that's responsible for immigration policy in America. So it's been interesting watching Republicans, after all this time, pile on the anti-King bandwagon this week.
If wealthy Americans were taxed more ― or, in Hannity's words, if their wealth were confiscated ― rich people are not going to remodel their homes, they're not going to build new homes, he claimed.
The Hollywood Reporter noted the change back in August, adding that Heath will be played by Brendan Scannell. We expect the actor will add the same wit and snark to the role Doherty originated ― and then some.

Back in 1999, Puffy bought a magazine called Notorious. He bought it because it was called Notorious. My friend Tiarra was the editor and assigned me a cover story on Prince. The magazine flew me out to Minneapolis where I spent a day with the Artist Formerly Known As. At one point Prince walked in on me while I was noodling on one of his guitars in Paisley Park recording studio, and he invited me to jam. So I wound up playing guitar with Prince and Larry Graham, and that was fun.
In that light, it seems clear that the 2016 rule is not a lucrative racket for crooked students at honest schools. Instead, it's basic protection for honest students at crooked schools.

I typically do parties on Saturdays and Sundays. The work is part time, but it usually covers my rent. It isn't totally consistent, however, so I also work as a part-time nanny and take any gigs I can get doing photography, makeup or singing.

Disney World and Disneyland are closing down as the coronavirus pandemic persists, Disney officials announced on Thursday.
On my last night at her house, Mom prepares salmon patties for our dinner while I chop and roast vegetables and boil grits. She stands tall and unassisted at the stove, her attention on cooking. It feels like so many other times in her kitchen, before the pandemic, before her fall. I joke about my past attempts to cook the patties, unable to achieve the flavor and texture she produces each time. She laughs. When I drive home, I am grateful we were spared a decision that would bring none of us peace. I do not know what may happen in the future. But as a family, we pulled together until Mom could stand on her own.
Read on for updates, reactions and analysis as the firings of Black Monday roll in.
We not only have the capacity to act, it is morally incumbent that we do so. Low-income and minority communities are disproportionately impacted by the adverse impacts of extreme weather. Our most vulnerable citizens, such as children and the elderly, are hit hardest by the public health consequences of toxic dumping, untreated brownfields, and air pollution. Climate action is not only about protecting our environment and our economy, it is about justice and quality of life for our communities.
Myth #3: The vaccines can change your DNA.
The decision came after unions representing immigration judges and prosecutors from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement called for the shutdown. A dozen current government employees working in the U.S. immigration system told Reuters on Tuesday that they were concerned courts had remained open for so long despite the spreading outbreak.
At least four people reportedly died Wednesday in the chaos, and dozens more were injured. Nooses, unambiguous symbols of mob mentality and racial terror against Black Americans, were strung up on the Capitol grounds to remind everyone exactly what the rioters stood for — and who they stood against. It was an apt end to a presidency fueled by white backlash to racial progress, as Georgia turned blue for the first time in 28 years, as the state voted to send its first Black senator to Washington, as Kamala Harris prepared to take her place as vice president.
WASHINGTON (AP) — His place in the history books rewritten, President Donald Trump endured his second impeachment largely alone and silent.

If you're underage, there's no such thing as consent, Neal reiterated. People still can't wrap their heads around that, and so much of the blame gets placed on the 'black girl being fast,' which is a false narrative.
Murtaugh: Even the mentally tough reach a limit at some point. What I notice more of in Russell now is a darker tone of frustration when the hospital is overwhelmed because people are not following masking and social distancing guidelines and the precarity of basic supplies like personal protective equipment and oxygen. It comes from a feeling that the severity of the pandemic and burden on the health care system was largely preventable. There is also more sadness from the increased amount of death he has seen, especially in young, otherwise healthy people that have died alone in the hospital as a result of COVID complications.
It makes sense because this is the people's house ― and it ought to reflect the amazing diversity, and the imagination, and the incredible ingenuity that defines the American people, he said. And while much of the music that you will hear this evening ― gospel, R&B, rap ― is rooted in the African-American experience. It's not just black music. This is an essential part of the American experience ― it's a mirror to who we are, and a reminder of who we can be.

Still, those who have had issues with regular lubricants could benefit from one with CBD in it. It could be just the thing to ~spice~ up things with yourself or your partner.
That follows general male attitudes towards health care. A U.S. study found that men were much less likely than women to regularly see doctors, and much more likely to skip suggested appointments. In general, men who have the most traditional, macho views about masculinity are the least likely to get routine check-ups and necessary medical care, according to Harvard Men's Health Watch.

And that's unusual, but not unique. There's growing interest worldwide in the idea of working four days, but still being productive enough to get paid for five.
Much like was the case with Mike Pettine in Cleveland, the argument to remove Smith could have started on defense. That side of the ball was Smith's expertise coming in, but Tampa Bay struggled to grasp his complex system last season and continued to go through the motions at times in Year 2. During the season-ending four-game skid, the Buccaneers surrendered 29.8 points per game, although the offense's eight combined turnovers certainly contributed to the elevated number.
About a year later, I interviewed him for another magazine and we had pizza at the Sbarro's in Times Square. This was in 1994, at the height of the east coast west / coast rap feuds, and Tupac had just been shot a few blocks from where we had pizza. When the meal ended I remember being relieved to get away from Puffy because being shot by accident while standing next to Diddy is a stupid way to die.

Ahead of the Georgia Senate runoffs, Justice Democrats and Sunrise teamed up once again in December to argue that Biden and Democrats should turn the Jan. 5 Senate contests into a referendum on the inclusion of $1,200 checks in a COVID-19 relief bill. Around the same time, Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) mounted a public push for a second round of $1,200 payments ― Americans received $1,200 checks from the CARES Act in March ― along with an additional $500 for every child. Their pressure campaign, backed by the Congressional Progressive Caucus, helped ensure the addition of a $600 stimulus in the bill that Congress passed shortly before Christmas.

Aware of these environmental trends, officials warned about the potential of mudslides on local government websites and social media, as well as in news outlets and community emails.
President Donald Trump said Monday in the Oval Office that a lot of very exciting things are happening rapidly concerning the coronavirus. He said a vaccine could be ready in a matter of months. That was immediately contradicted by Dr. Antony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who said it could be a year and a half before the U.S. has a usable vaccine.
Their conversations emphasized the need to find ways to dial down tensions in the region.

The pandemic should remind us that physical reality is real ― I've been trying to make this point about carbon for years, that chemistry and physics don't negotiate. The microbe makes the same point for biology. And as a corollary, fast action in the face of a crisis helps: South Korea had its first case the same day as the U.S. ― and one of those countries then acted swiftly to bend the curve and one didn't. The same, obviously, goes for global warming.
If your partner is sleeping like a baby and not helping out at night, there's bound to be some resentment, said Laurel Steinberg, a psychotherapist in New York City. If a mom is breastfeeding, the feeding may be left entirely up to her at first, but her partner should pick up the slack in other ways (rocking the baby to sleep, for instance, or diaper duty). And if she decides to incorporate pumping into her routine, her partner should step up and do some bottle feeding.
Before the new tax law, homeowners could deduct interest paid on a home equity loan or line, or credit of up to $100,000, regardless of how the funds were used. For example, if a homeowner used a home equity loan to pay off credit card debt, they'd receive a tax break on the interest paid.
Hiding the real you is very painful, and I know many people can understand that. I decided to embrace it and shave my head. I began walking around without a wrap or turban on my head. And then, I felt it was time to really share my story with the world. I know I'm not the only one struggling in life, and it's good to know from time to time that you are not alone.
She knew what it could be, at least. I think that's what she's deliberately doing. The way that she fights certainly implies she was not looking for that to happen. She really wasn't. But I think she's become so cavalier with everything; she's so furious that her risk-taking has gone much further. She's taking risks that she never should have, which is why she never went down this road in the beginning.

Australians arriving from China, Iran, South Korea and Italy are allowed to enter but will be told to self-isolate for 14 days.
Justice Democrats, the climate-focused Sunrise Movement and their allied think tank, Data for Progress, and media firm, New Deal Strategies, have also sought to counter claims that Democrats' disappointing performance in November's congressional races is due to left-wing activists' adoption of unpopular slogans like defund the police. Instead, they argued in a joint memo that Democrats failed to adequately articulate the ways they planned to materially improve voters' lives, noting, for example, that two losing Democratic Senate candidates failed to use the words jobs or economy in any digital ads.
While there have been a handful of instances where police officers prevented or mitigated school shootings, there is no comprehensive research suggesting that school police officers deter school shootings overall.
In a way, dating emotionally unavailable women was a form of self-punishment. Reinforcing my lifelong pattern that my sacred gifts of affection and capacity for closeness that are essential parts of myself are somehow flawed and shameful. [3.

After day school, I attend Las Positas College, where I am working on my associate degrees in chemistry and math. Did you know that Sir Isaac Newton and Stephen Hawking were Lucasian Professors of mathematics at Cambridge University? I had to go through interviews and assessments to prove to the administration that I had both the scholastic aptitude and the executive functions to attend college. Now the administration and professors treat me like any other student. I follow the same rules, and the classes cannot be modified for me.
I had friends. Good friends. But boys were not in the picture. I mean, what 14-year-old boy wants to have a bald girlfriend? I thought to myself that if they just looked twice, they wouldn't look away. That motto is something I still hold close to my heart.

An emergency responder asked how far along the mother was in her pregnancy. The nurse, still sounding stunned, said that nobody would know.
The downside is that the contribution limits for IRAs are much lower than for 401(k)s. For 2019, you can contribute a total of $6,000 across all your IRA accounts ($7,000 if you're age 50 or older) or your taxable income for the year, whichever is smaller. You're allowed to begin making penalty-free withdrawals when you turn 59½. Once you reach 70½, you can no longer contribute and must start making required minimum distributions instead.

On my second visit, I clean the living room. I have not seen her house this messy before. I pick up a wadded cardigan laying against the wall. Bloodstains cover the beige cotton. I ask about it and she says it is from the day of her fall. Tears blur my vision as I take it to the laundry room and spray it with cleanser. I imagine her panic as she bleeds, hurting and unable to stand. An hour after she fell, the mail carrier heard her yelling and called 911. The bloodstains wash out, but Mom's fear of falling, of being alone, doesn't fade.
They argue that the dam is unnecessary — electricity could be generated through less environmentally destructive means, such as solar, wind or geothermal infrastructure — and violates their treaty rights, said Willson. Treaty 8 was signed in 1899 and contains promises that the state will protect their way of life. In the meantime, construction on the dam is allowed to continue, although it won't be completed until 2024.

Forty-seven percent of survey respondents were more likely to vote for a candidate who supports a Green New Deal, while only 18 percent vowed to back someone who opposed the policy. Another 22 percent said support for a Green New Deal had no impact on their vote, and 13 percent were not sure.
In this heralded novel with shades of the FX series The Americans, Emily Bird slowly comes to realise that her scientist parents are likely connected to a global pandemic — and possibly worse — that puts Washington, D.C., under quarantine. Like all Black girls facing the crises of everyday life, she also changes her hair by way of a home relaxer and ends up with a TWA (teeny weeny afro). She's pretty cerebral but also kind of a rebellious introvert, so she pops melatonin to help with her anxiety-induced insomnia and breaks up with her obnoxious boyfriend so she can flirt with two mysterious classmates and get to the bottom of a US government conspiracy.
We have developed and applied one of these methods to about ten faults located in the Fucino area, just south of the Amatrice region. There, the Avezzano earthquake killed 30,000 people in 1915.
Clean house and rebuild from the wilderness. Loyalty has become the qualification, and it's allowed insane and unqualified people to rise to the top, said a former RNC official, also on condition of anonymity. Until that's fixed, I'm not sure the GOP deserves to be in power.
Those who resist change are reminiscent of the ex-Confederates who, in the years following the Civil War, preferred to dream of a South that never was and never could be rather than accept one that was within the reach of all, if they would join together and make it so, historian John Hope Franklin wrote in the foreword for Democracy Betrayed in 1998. But many whites in the post-Civil War South saw change — any change — as unsettling and dangerous, and they wanted no part of it.
Views about who's to blame for the shutdown remain sharply divided along partisan lines. Another woman surveyed also said her family members are going unpaid. She described herself as very concerned about the shutdown and held the president and both parties in Congress at least somewhat responsible. But as a Republican, she also backed Trump's desire to hold out for a border wall and believed that he and his congressional allies were working to bring the shutdown to an end.

It got complicated. Psychological. I'm back on track, but having gone through that experience makes me even more in tune to—and saddened by—society's collective tendency to shame themselves and others over things like stomach rolls, under eye circles, hair loss, and saggy necks.

McCarthy earlier warned on MSNBC that if the administration doesn't change its tune about what's really going on, it's going to go from a scandal to a cover-up.
A 48-year-old man has been arrested after the terror attack which saw a van plough into people outside an Islamic place of worship in North London. The incident took place as people left the Muslim Welfare House on Seven Sisters Road in Finsbury Park, after midnight prayers during Ramadan. Khan's warning about funding follows similar pleas from Jeremy Corbyn and senior police officers in the last week of the general election campaign, when the Manchester terror attack sparked calls for an end to police cuts. Some 20,000 officers have been axed in the past seven years. Khan revealed that the police were so stretched that they were having to cancel leave and bring officers back from holiday to staff the city.

With the pandemic growing, resource needs have also grown, Russell Vought, the acting OMB director, wrote in a letter to lawmakers, CNN reported. The unprecedented mobilization the Administration has achieved has forced agencies to incur unanticipated costs.

But walking back your anger when you're having a heated conversation with someone ― a spouse, a friend, a co-worker, some very unfortunate person at a call center ― is a lot more difficult.
The detrimental effects of asymmetric shocks can be mitigated by transferring funds from prosperous to declining member states. When the dollar union of the US threatened to fall apart during the Great Depression, federal government enacted federal income transfers from prosperous states to aid ailing ones. The federal budget also increased rapidly and, in practice, income transfers became permanent. The no bailout policy of crisis-hit states had already been enacted earlier.
Right now, all of those things are absent from the decisions that we see being made at Queen's Park by Doug Ford and his friends.
When Sanders introduced his bill last year, the list of 16 Democratic co-sponsors included several prospective presidential contenders ― among them, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who last week launched her exploratory committee for a White House bid. That announcement came one day after Sen. Kamala Harris of California, another likely presidential candidate, reaffirmed her support for Medicare for All in a New York Times Op-Ed. And, of course, Sanders himself is widely expected to run again.
Normal activities aren't always normal anymore. Taking William to a restaurant requires my husband and I to request nutritional facts at the counter, and they aren't always available. Some websites are pretty good to use for carb counts. If all else fails, I resort to a thick pocket manual or go into my mental Rolodex after years of remembering carb counts for common foods.

They also said they'll balance their time between the U.K. and North America, although they didn't specify whether that would be in Meghan's native U.S. or in Canada, where they just spent a six-week vacation.
That ordering is not what a lot of people would expect, especially when it comes to the top three. The Dakotas, in particular, have some of the highest COVID-19 death rates in the country, even though they didn't face major outbreaks until relatively late, by which time the American health care system had learned a great deal about how to prevent and treat the disease.
Church sexual abuse broke into the open in 2002, when it was discovered that U.S. bishops moved abusers from parish to parish instead of defrocking them. Similar scandals were later discovered around the world and tens of millions of dollars have been paid in compensation.
We're most familiar with our faces as we see them in the mirror and thus come to prefer that mirror image, according to the mere exposure theory, which states that repeatedly encountering something makes us like it more.

Real climate solutions must be built around justice.
Like many great artists, they all contained a superhuman force of endurance. That feeling of 'dammed if you do and dammed if you don't' drove them to hone their craft. Suzanne Farrell, founder of the Suzanne Farrell Ballet at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., says it best, I set as my goal to be the best dancer I could be. Not the most famous, or the highest paid dancer, just the best I could be. Out of this discipline came great freedom and calm.

Before Friday, you were more likely to glimpse a unicorn than a black leading lady kicking ass and taking names on screen. But with the release of Babak Najafi's Proud Mary, Henson is seeking to change that.
His current Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency would become the new Uxbridge and Hillingdon seat, taking in Labour-voting wards formerly in Ealing North (Northolt Mandeville and Northolt West End), plus the transfer out of two strongly Conservative wards (Cavendish and Manor). Duncan Smith's Chingford and Wood Green would also fall to Labour, largely because of the addition of a heavily Labour-dominated ward from neighbouring Walthamstow.
I don't get any attention from my partner.
Unfortunately, you never know how strong any branch will be until it is tested in the most violent of storms. Some branches appear thick and sturdy while they may actually be hollow or rotten to the core. If you step out on the branch for support because of its sturdy appearance, you might be disappointed and shocked when that branch does not support you but breaks and hurts you instead.
CORONAVIRUS - Le nouveau coronavirus, qui a contaminé plus de 110.000 personnes dans le monde depuis fin décembre, peut officiellement être qualifié de pandémie, a annoncé l'Organisation mondiale de la santé (OMS) ce mercredi 11 mars.
―Trump, Democrats and Republicans all draw lackluster marks for their handling of the government shutdown, according to a CBS/YouGov survey out Friday. Forty-seven percent say that Trump is most to blame, 30 percent that Democrats are, 3 percent that Republicans are, and 20 percent that all share the blame equally. Two-thirds of Americans don't think Trump should declare a national emergency to pay for a wall if one isn't funded by Congress.
Some members of the public, as well as various artists, encouraged musicians to refuse requests to perform at the show as a way to condemn the NFL's treatment of Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback and activist.
The legislative push builds on high-profile efforts from other top City Hall officials. In December, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer announced a significant next step in divesting the city's $200 billion pension funds from the oil and gas sector as he issued a request for a proposal to analyze the city's fossil fuel risks.
Notably, he has called for candidates to be aggressive in advocating for clean energy and has put his money toward a number of causes to fight climate change.
WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell abruptly eased his restrictive proposed rules for President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, backing off the condensed two-day schedule to add a third for opening arguments after protests from senators, including Republicans.
Il ne veut pas estimer le nombre de morts possibles. Le taux de mortalité, jusqu'à présent, flotte aux alentours de 3%, mais ces taux ont tendance à monter et descendre: monter au début quand les plus vulnérables meurent, baisser ensuite, puis remonter quand d'autres décèdent. Là encore, les prochaines semaines révèleront le véritable danger de 2019-nCoV.
Champagne suggested travellers examine the online advisories posted by Global Affairs Canada before leaving for their vacations, but noted the federal government can't predict whether the coronavirus will spread further.

The opinion piece, which was published in The Guardian, argues that Trudeau's record is disturbing in a different way from Trump or Putin's because he pretends to care — but fails to act on it.
A few days before the election, Warnock was campaigning in the small city of Valdosta and had a question for people inside dozens of cars assembled to hear his socially distanced speech.

These differences represent a tiny portion of each twin's genetic code, but they could influence why one twin is taller or why one twin is at greater risk for certain cancers.
For years, I've used my media megaphone to protect kids in sports after my daughter was injured in a cheerleading accident. My attention turned to football when I began studying brain damage in professional players as part of my work as a legal consultant for Girardi Keese (the same law firm portrayed in the film Erin Brockovich).
Nassar is already serving 60 years in prison on child pornography charges and faces a minimum of an additional 25 years on the sexual misconduct charges.
O'Rourke's embrace of a Green New Deal is likely to face skepticism among progressives advocating the policy. He won early endorsements from environmental groups when he challenged Cruz, a climate change denier and fossil fuel ideologue. But O'Rourke, who declined donations from corporate political action committees during his Senate campaign, generated controversy last month over fossil fuel donations he received.

It could be used before sex to make the body get ready quicker since it promotes muscle relaxation, blood flow and arousal, Urman said.
It is hard to say no to others - especially when we think they are rooting for us and have our best interest at heart. How do you react when friends and family give their unsolicited advice that is totally not in alignment with your forever plans in business or your personal life. Ever felt like someone was holding you back and that someone was or is you? Now what ... it certainly will only make matter worse and your decision even harder when you follow the crowd or copy your next big industry leader. Why not try being authentically yourself and stop listening to everyone else's advice and strategies and make up your own mindful conclusions and place them into immediate action. I encourage you to step into your power and take massive action for powerful results! I can't think of a better way to serve your audience or soon to be followers and fans than staying true to yourself and being transparent. Don't allow your haters or those that don't support your vision to get you off your path. It's so easy to respond to every little dog that barks but I want to help you ignore your critics and keep moving and let nothing and no one to stand in your way of being the leader you need to be.
Our body does so using two primary mechanisms, she explained: by changing our breathing rate ― making it faster to release more carbon dioxide, which is acidic when dissolved in the blood, or slower to maintain CO2 levels ― or by releasing bicarbonate from the kidneys if our pH dips or excreting it in the case of excessive alkalinity. Diets will also have no tangible impact on our pH levels for the same reasons.
By the afternoon, the Interior Department wrapped up an auction to sell oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico, offering up some 78 million offshore acres ― an area roughly the size of New Mexico. It proved to be a bust, bringing in approximately $93 million for just shy of 400,000 acres, the smallest total for an offshore auction since 2016.
Now 80 percent of all calories consumed by Americans come from refined, processed, GMO-laden foods filled with sugar, salt, trans-fats and artificial ingredients.
This year, I have chosen eight values that seem most relevant to this time, with a call to meditate on each and to engage in a practice that will bring them into our hearts and minds
In December 2019, the House, with Lewis presiding, passed a voting rights bill to restore the pre-clearance protections of the Voting Rights Act. Current Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has declined to move the amendment toward a Senate vote. Lewis died in July at 80.
Our boy is the sweetest; he's so smart, loves to cuddle and watch Doc McStuffins, is fanatical about all music (especially Adele), has such an impressive ability to dance on beat, is so lovable and only wants to play outside and ride scooters with his sister. He completes our family.
First, she spent time meditating. She took time to calm her thoughts and restore her energy after months of expending herself on the campaign trail. Leaders who are pulled a hundred different directions by advisers, supplicants and commentators need time to think deeply and fill the well. They seldom get the time. They should insist on it.
The attack ads, the portrayal of Rev. Warnock using historically racist tropes in the ads is insulting, said Gwen Mills, the secretary-treasurer of the labor union Unite Here, which is contributing to a major field organizing program in the state. But it's also invigorating in the sense that people aren't going to stand for this. We've heard it a lot.
A Maryland bill introduced last week would ensure women in the state's jails and prisons receive pads and tampons at no cost. While it does not specify whether that amount would be limited per inmate, it mandates that the facilities provide a sufficient supply.
The partial government shutdown has now gone on for 22 days, making it the longest such closure in U.S. history.
COVID-19 - Alors que le nouveau coronavirus a entraîné la mort de 19 personnes en France et que les cas confirmés continuent de grimper, des mesures de plus en plus contraignantes sont prises face à l'épidémie. Dimanche 8 mars, le gouvernement a annoncé l'interdiction des rassemblements de plus de 1000 personnes. Pendant ce temps l'Italie, bien plus touchée par le coronavirus Sars-Cov2 , a mis en quarantaine le nord du pays où habitent environ 15 millions de personnes.
He then rattled off a list of campaign pledges that planted him squarely within the rising progressive side of the Democratic Party. He reaffirmed his rejection of corporate PAC money and support for Medicare for all, called for bail reform and promised that his first executive action would be to rejoin the Paris climate accord.
There are a lot of practical reasons to organize your ingredients in this way. The first, as Robertson says, is so that once you start cooking, you don't have to stop. It streamlines the whole process to be able to seamlessly toss things in in ready sequence. Timing is everything in the kitchen, so being neat and prepared is very important, Robertson said.
The scientific community has made it very clear in telling us that climate change is real and is causing devastating harm to our country and the entire planet, Sanders said. They have told us in no uncertain terms that if we do not transform our energy system away from fossil fuel, our nation and our planet and the planet we will be leaving our kids and grandchildren may well become unhealthy and even uninhabitable in the not-so-distant future.
When humans started shedding their nomadic ways and cultivating crops, populations boomed — and life expectancy took a nosedive.
I know you don't know any of this but I feel your eyes. They burn.
This theory has been peddled by far-right media personalities, including Newsmax host Greg Kelly, who insisted that the individuals vandalizing the seat of the U.S. government were not the Trump crowd that I know.

The Trans Mountain project faces continued opposition, including court challenges by the Tsleil-Waututh Nation, Squamish Nation and Coldwater Indian Band. There was a three-day hearing in December about whether the federal government's second round of consultations with these Indigenous groups was sufficient. The court ruled in 2018 that the first round fell short.
In the grand scheme of human longevity, the contribution of modern medicine is minor, said Jan Vijg, a genetics professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. In fact, it's barely moved the needle.
Intelligence agencies have been warning on this since January, a U.S. official told the Post of the intelligence reporting, which was sent to Trump administration officials as well as members of Congress. Donald Trump may not have been expecting this, but a lot of other people in the government were — they just couldn't get him to do anything about it.
I am opposed to rioting, and the people responsible need to be held accountable.
As we prepare to go to Cuba next week, I can't help but wonder what has happened to the airline industry and to us in the almost 50 years since we backpacked all over Europe for eight weeks. Back then, we threw a few changes of clothes and a handful of toiletries into our bags and were off. Now, for an eight-day trip, we have been packing and making lists for over two weeks.
A winter pentathlon was one of the demonstration sports at the 1948 Winter Olympics. Like biathlon, it featured cross-country skiing and shooting, but it also added downhill skiing, fencing and horseback riding. Simple enough, right?
At the top of the list of things that concern dietitians and nutritionists are juice cleanses, which earned a unanimous clamor of indignation from our consulted professionals.
En cas de voyage à l'étranger, le gouvernement recommande de bien vérifier la page dédiée, pays par pays, à retrouver ici.
Over the course of my life I can see how what I was taught in Christian schooling has impacted me, and the riots on Jan. 6 played into it. That whole belief system revolves around the idea that you want the rest of the world to think like you, said Garman, who is now a social worker. It's a 'the ends justify the means' type of thing.
Alas, this assessment appears to be born more of resignation than resolve.
Another series of strong earthquakes has struck central Italy, with schools and the metro evacuated in Rome. At least four earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 5 have followed in a few hours, with their epicentres near the town of Amatrice.

Now at 31, I've examined my upbringing through the harsh lens of depression, anxiety and imposter syndrome.
This does not equate to less is more, rather, it captures the feeling of choosing only the things that spark joy for you, Kondo said. That feeling of sparking joy is central to Kondo's trademark KonMari tidying method, and Spark Joy is even the title of one of her books.
At the same time, Democrats were continuing to hammer both Loeffler and Perdue for their stock-trading scandals, with Ossoff dubbing them the Bonnie and Clyde of political corruption. The message worked, particularly when paired with spotlighting the GOP's stance on coronavirus relief.
And in November, The Weekly Standard published an audio recording of King referring to immigrants as dirt on multiple occasions. The report prompted 140 organizations to sign a letter to then-House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) to censure King for his anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant, racist language.

I will be 69 in a week. I have been programming since 1967. That's 48 years that cover COBOL to jQuery. I have forgotten more programming languages than most programmers will ever encounter. I work now as a contractor because I am so over working as an employee that even if I were half my age, I would never again accept a traditional job.
In Lindsey Ullman and Charles Frantz's stylish two-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn's Bushwick neighborhood, about 20 hardcore Sanders fans gathered to watch the livestream over pizza, beer and LaCroix. Following the recommendations of the livestream organizers, they subsequently discussed strategies for improving on Sanders' impressive but ultimately failed 2016 performance.
HuffPost Italy reports (in Italian) that the average age of the deceased is around 80.
On August 24, the first strong earthquake broke the central segment of the fault. This energetic, single-segment rupture is likely to have then provoked the breakage of the other two segments further north.

Pelosi has indicated this will be her final stint as speaker. She made a deal at the start of the last Congress that she would only serve two more terms as speaker, and she seemed to confirm that the same deal was still in play right after the election this year.
Actress Constance Wu called out the fetishization of Asian women at the Women's March last weekend, and once again the internet lit up with defensive men saying that we should actually be flattered that they have a preference for Asian women.
Documentaries can be powerful sources for generating change and action for survivors, who band together to create a movement to enact justice, Dr. Pulido said.
For more than a century, Black Americans have documented and warned us of similar moments where racial terror and white supremacy were the status quo. Several instances — often left out of history books and school curricula — illustrate this narrative. They show a desire to undermine the ideals of our democracy, and demonstrate the hypocrisy in how police respond to Black protest and white lawlessness.
He has so many potential conflicts that he carries around a list of former clients and is barred from participating in decisions affecting them, The Washington Post reported in November.
Progressive congressional leaders have also noted that a change in House rules alone would not clear the path for deficit-increasing legislation to become law. Since pay-go is also written into the legal code, Congress would have to enact another law overturning it ― or otherwise exempting a particular bill from it.
The whole scene looks both otherworldly and so very American. Welcome to Influencers In The Wild: White Supremacist Treason Edition.
HuffPost did a call-out to our readers to find out a few of the unexpected problems consumers have faced after cord-cutting. The majority of the responses expressed satisfaction in their decision, thanks to money saved, monopolistic cable providers avoided and the huge library of content offered by streaming services.
The politician is good at managing the bosses above them and terrible at managing the people who report directly to them. They are good at public relations for your team, but they lack the will or the skill to be a good team leader.

This time, the letters in the sign were altered by hanging tarps over the original two O's ― similar to the way the sign was changed back on Jan. 1, 1976, when a Cal State Northridge student draped curtains over the letters to herald the state's newly relaxed marijuana laws.
Mayor John Tory said he's requested that all public health information related to coronavirus be translated into languages other than English or French to ensure the city's diverse population can stay informed.
His nomination to serve as Pruitt's No. 2 faced little opposition. Democrats largely overlooked him during the initial confirmation hearing in November 2017. He couched blatant climate change denial in smooth legalese. He appeared moderate next to Kathleen Hartnett White, the right-wing ideologue nominated to serve as the head of the Council on Environmental Quality, whose humiliating performance captured Democrats' attention at the confirmation hearing she shared with Wheeler.
Ramjee was married to pharmacist Pravin Ramjee, a South African of Indian descent.

6. You are appreciated for both your efforts and your results. It's not just what you do, but how you do it, and if you have a winning job you are appreciated for not only the results but the methods by which you accomplish your job as well.
A report in CNBC explains how Ocasio-Cortez's idea is in line with America's economic history. While the top tax rate stood above 90 percent throughout the 1950s, deductions and tax avoidance led to taxes on the rich being not that much higher, according to a 2017 article by the Tax Foundation.
On the way back to the car, I stopped to photograph the post office. As dusk placed it's hand on the small of daylight's back, I noticed a sun-bleached sign on the front of the building that read, End of the trail. No kidding.
Q. What do you think your wife would say to other women about your success?
Some cities, including Baton Rouge and Chicago, will not be hosting marches this year for a lack of resources, after footing the bills for organizing for the midterms last November. Harlene Ellin, communications lead of Women's March Chicago, said its chapter's decision not to march was made irrespective of the controversies surrounding Women's March Inc., with which it is not affiliated. Women's March Chicago pushed up its march to October, for a March to the Polls event ahead of the midterm election. It has no plans for a march in January.
The wine hitched a ride to the space station in November 2019 aboard a Northrop Grumman supply ship. The 320 Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon vine snippets, called canes in the grape-growing business, were launched by SpaceX last March.
Giffords was just a week into her third term when a 22-year-old man opened fire at a constituent meet-and-greet, shooting the rising Democratic star in the head before turning the gun on attendees. Six people were killed, including a 9-year-old girl, a federal judge and a staffer for Giffords. Thirteen other people, including Giffords, were injured by gunfire. She retired from Congress in 2012 and, along with her husband, former NASA astronaut Mark Kelly, later formed a national gun violence prevention group that now carries her name.
Thus far though, congressional Democrats have shown the most interest in removing the federal income tax deduction for state and local taxes, which mainly affects upper-middle-class homeowners in blue states. Biden has already promised not to raise taxes on households earning less than $400,000, and wants to restore the corporate tax rate to 28%, not its pre-Trump level of 35%.
A potential dilemma facing the new Democratic leadership of the Senate will be the future of the filibuster, a Senate procedural rule that requires 60 votes to pass significant legislation. The use of the filibuster has been weakened over time ― it no longer comes into play for Cabinet appointments and judicial appointments ― but many Democrats would like to shelve it completely. Others, though, have hesitated to embrace that view.
A House Democratic aide who shared the plans said the measure will be part of a procedural vote when the chamber reconvenes Tuesday night to consider the resolution calling on Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment declaring the president unfit to serve.
I met a man for a drink who said he lived in a somewhat dicey part of town and didn't have a car because he was doing research for a book. I met a man who told me to my face that he went to a different law school (a better one) than the one listed on his website. Once, during a coffee date, I complained about a recent online correspondent of mine who had been lying about his age by twenty years. (Yep, you read that right: twenty.)

Without a change at the top, we may see more events unfold like those we saw on January 6th, the union chairman Gus Papathanasiou said in a statement. We cannot leave our officers and the Capitol Hill community they protect, to the mercy of further attacks amid a vacuum of leadership.
Do not think for one minute that Republican leaders are sincere about substantively addressing racism in their own ranks. Speaking out against King's comments is the exception, not the rule. The one example of action Republicans will hide behind to justify their silence on everything else. After all, if Mitch McConnell is sincere about there being no place in the Republican Party, the Congress or the country for an ideology of racial supremacy of any kind how could he possibly still be supporting and protecting the biggest racist of them all – Donald Trump.

Still, Ellin fielded questions from members about anti-Semitism in the women's march. For me to answer the question, Are you anti-Semitic? when I'm Jewish, it's like: Are you kidding? No, we are not anti-Semitic. It was painful.

1. Is there debt on the balance sheet? If the answer is yes, the value of your business depends on how much. As an every day example, if your house could be sold for $300,000 today but you have a mortgage (debt) of $200,000, your equity interest is only worth $100,000. The same is true for the business.
While China has called for transparency in managing the crisis, after cover-up of the 2002/2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome spread, officials in Wuhan have come in for criticism over their handling of the current outbreak.
We have allowed pornography to continuously promote that narrative that a woman is a hole for a man to enjoy when and how he feels like it, the British-born actress writes, arguing that the mentality leads to women finding sex dissatisfying.
She said she's motivated by a desire to fundamentally change the party, which she thinks has become all about winning elections and trying to buy people's votes.
Contrary to the high hopes that Obama's presidency would bring the country together, Americans were bitterly divided leading up to the election in 2016. The Democratic Party had become increasingly concerned with identity politics, which is the idea that a person's race, sex, and sexual orientation form the most important parts of their humanity and that politics should reflect that belief. Republicans, meanwhile, believed that their politicians had been too compromising with the increasingly radical left and that they needed a political outsider who would not back down or compromise with the Democrats. ... The Republican Party nominated real estate mogul and reality television star Donald Trump from New York, whose determination and bombastic mannerisms gave Republicans the fighter they wanted. As a businessman, Trump stated that he would 'take the brand of the United States and make it great again.' However, many conservatives were wary of Trump because of his occasional vulgar speech, his past immoral behavior, and his public support of homosexual marriage; but some were persuaded by Trump's choice for his running mate — Indiana's conservative governor Mike Pence.
The solution for this issue has to be practical — if one parent has to get up early to go to the office, perhaps he or she should be the one to get up on the weekends, she said. If both partners have to get up early to go to work, they could alternate nights.
Michael Arceneaux's new book, I Don't Want to Die Poor, was always going to be relevant ― even before the coronavirus became a pandemic that would forever change the way we look at this nation's failing health care system, disproportionate poverty and crippling burden of student loan debt. But since the world completely turned on its head, forcing us into an indefinite lockdown and causing more than 16 million Americans so far to file for unemployment benefits, Arceneaux's sharp introspection on that helluva drug called capitalism, the lengths we will go to attain (or pretend to be part of) the middle class, and the financial ruin that can leave behind feels eerily clairvoyant.
Holidays are supposed to be a time for family, a time of joy and a time for reflection. Sadly, they are often a time when people are disappointed, hurt and angry -- prompting January visits to a divorce lawyer.
It all starts and ends with Aaron Rodgers ― the likely league MVP, and for good reason. His 40 touchdown passes are the most in pro football, and during Green Bay's last six games ― all wins ― the 33-year-old signal caller has amassed 18 touchdowns and zero interceptions. However, it'd be wrong to simply dismiss the Pack as a one-dimensional, aerial attacking team.
But this is a moment of hope for Muslim women movements as well as other movements. When I was at Shaheen Bagh, I heard a speaker say that we did not come out on the streets when the teen talaq thing happened, we did not come out on the streets when the Babri Masjid judgment happened, but we could stand back no longer. And the assumption seems to be that this time it is because of the Constitution and because the Constitution is so sacred. My reading would be that this is a particular moment in India in which Muslims simply cannot stay quiet because their very existence and subjectivity is at stake in the CAA. I heard one woman say that I'm doing this for our children's future. I don't even think they are thinking of this as a great feminist thing. It's about the children, the sons and the daughters. I think they are thinking that if they don't speak out as Muslims now then they will never speak out.

But over the past few months, Biden has repeatedly claimed that he was against the war from the beginning.
Historic wildfires in California, buttressed by back-to-back United Nations and federal reports on the extent of human-caused global warming, generated an unusual amount of attention on the climate crisis. Then Democratic leaders made clear that climate change would be, at best, a midlevel priority after retaking the House of Representatives, with Nancy Pelosi, not yet the next House speaker, making the restoration of a decade-old select committee on global warming the cornerstone of the party's strategy. In response, the Sunrise Movement staged sit-in protests in Pelosi's office demanding Democrats instead champion a Green New Deal.
Trudeau's government has been called out by Indigenous groups for withholding information from them during consultations about the pipeline. A legal challenge from First Nations against the pipeline was later dismissed in the Federal Court of Appeal.
Eventually, everything I did was about my hair. How could I get it to stop falling out? How much fall-out was there today? Was it less than yesterday? Showering was a make-or-break experience, as I counted the hairs going down the drain. It was day after day of dashed hopes.
The share of the public who thought it was the right decision to cancel large events like rallies and conferences rose from a 61% majority in a poll taken last Tuesday through Thursday to an even-more commanding 72% in the newest poll, taken just days later, Friday through Sunday. And the share who said they'd been personally affected by the virus, while still low, rose from 12% to 22%. (Other polls that asked Americans about specific changes to their behavior, like stocking up on food or cancelling plans, found higher numbers affected.)
We talked about the color scheme, which brings me to the wig Cassie wears in the final sequence. Part of why that wig is so striking is because it's seen on a famous person at the big climax of a galvanizing movie. But it also continues the color story you're telling. We see those pinks and blues within the wig. So did the color scheme come from the wig, or did the wig come from the color scheme?
Winter days get darker quicker, which can make it harder for drivers to see and avoid runners. Monica Lam-Feist, an American Council on Exercise-certified personal trainer and fitness expert for the supplement company AlgaeCal, said winter runners should invest in reflective gear.
L'OMS salue les mesures très fortes de la Chine
Dr. John Abraham, a professor of thermal sciences writing in The Guardian, compared last year's ocean heat increase to electricity use in China. The annual electrical generation in China would be 600 times smaller than the heat increase in the ocean, he noted.
Researchers determined that open-ocean oxygen-minimum zones have expanded since 1950 by an area roughy equivalent to the size of the European Union. The volume of ocean water completely devoid of oxygen has more than quadrupled in that time, the study found. The number of hypoxic, or oxygen depleted, zones along coasts has increased up to 10 times, from less than 50 to 500.
Todman should have been the star of the play for his darting run, but one of his coaches overreacted to a bit of chippiness on Nelson's part. Notice how Todman doesn't care about the late hit at all. He pops up and gets on with the game.
(California voted to legalize recreational marijuana during November's election. Recreational use is legal now, but portions of the law regarding taxation and licensing aren't set to go into effect until Jan. 1, 2018.)
But miles change you. It's not the physical distance of ultra marathons under my feet that did it -- it wasn't the strength in my legs, the endurance of my lungs that can carry me for runs that last hours, no, it was that I finally caught my balloon, the only one I think we should never release -- belief in myself. The longer I run, the more I realized: I belong.

She broke my nose and basically ended up being mildly inconvenienced. There's been a massive shift in people questioning police authority. On another occasion, a guy hit his wife on the platform at Preston rail station. He starts saying 'you're not arresting me' and squares up to me. We got him on the ground but then a crowed formed around us of people saying 'get off him, what's he done wrong?' If you arrest someone these days near a crowd, you think how long is it going to be until they grab me? We were the first police force to start carrying spit guards around. I was on a train when football fans were chanting nasty things and we intervened. One fan then clearly made a sound like he was going to spit at me, so the spit guard went on. Spitting at us has definitely got worse. Mick Johnson, 48, Police Constable, Hartlepool
There has never been a time like the present to really rethink the idea of what it means to be happy in our lives. Sood has a different take on the idea of what the future is going to feel like given the recent changes on a geo-political and socio-economic level.
Trump is refusing to concede, and pressure is mounting on Vice President Mike Pence to ensure victory while presiding in what is typically a ceremonial role over the congressional session. Trump is whipping up crowds for a rally in Washington.
For example, if you're repeatedly late for work and want to make sure you get to the office on time, set a goal of getting up at 7 am. However, you also have to set the goal of going to bed before 3 am. Looking at what maintains the behavior is critical. It's par for the course in terms of therapeutic strategies to identify the precursors of a certain behavior that need to be addressed. You have to look at what leads up to the things you want to change.
Myth #6: Once you've been vaccinated, you can no longer spread the virus.
The governor called on the federal government to encourage states to collaborate, as each state will reach its peak in cases at different times and will require the same resources. He called New York the canary in the coal mine.
To be sure, even a closely divided Democratic Senate wouldn't give Biden everything he wants. Senate rules still require 60 votes to advance most major legislation; for now, there aren't enough Democrats willing to change that requirement. So, regardless of Georgia's results, Biden will have to win over Republicans in a Senate where a bipartisan group of more centrist senators stands to see their stock rise.
There's no denying that women are doing even more of it, as a new study from Oxfam, Unpaid and Underpaid Care Work and the Global Inequality Crisis, makes very clear. Not only is the act of care — for kids, for elderly and sick people and those with disabilities — an essential part of a community, it's also work the organization estimates is worth $10.8 trillion each year.

2016 found me in auto-recovery mode after leaving behind 2015 which was a momentous year of change and first-hand experiences - including dealing with newly involved political players in my homeland Greece, spearheading change in a public space that is known to be challenging and rather inflexible (Greece and the EU), and negotiating on the side of the Greek Government vis-à-vis the country's lenders. In so many ways, this was a tough and taxing experience.
[W]e believe that the United States' institutions are strong enough to survive this insurrection, they wrote, but we still have to get through the next couple of weeks. There still exists the possibility of further civil unrest, calls for Trump's removal from office, and a chance that the inauguration could be less than peaceful.

It is so easy at the beginning to not listen to your critics and those that negative critique your passion(s). If we listened to what every hater said and took it to heart we most definitely wouldn't succeed. We must have tough skin and pray to God for strength and to build a shell around yourself and your business until you are strength filled and have a solid foundation built in faith. Build your life around what makes you happy because if you always strive to please others only they will be happy and you will be in misery. Also, be secure about what you truly desire and don't deviate from your wishes and the empire you deserve to obtain - one smart proactive decision at a time.

Not getting what you need will leave you feeling empty, unfulfilled and eventually angry. Over time, this anger will turn into resentment.
Sure, there have been some silver linings to the pandemic, like more time with my family, more time to read, more time to write, and more time to indulge my love of cooking and baking. I admit I don't miss the stress of Sundays when I haven't finished lesson planning for the week and I still have a stack of research papers to grade.
But zero cost-sharing could also encourage people to get care they don't need, which could mean unnecessary (and potentially harmful) tests and treatments, all while driving up costs throughout the system. Purely from a budgetary standpoint, the federal government would have to spend a lot more money if it's assuming responsibility for every single dollar on every single medical bill for every single American.
We see this everyday with social media for instance, and how one tweet can send half the nation into disarray. This is just phase one of what is to come in terms of how social media can disrupt other people's lives. But Sood is very optimistic about the future and how if we cultivate empathy and compassion, we can bring into focus the fact that happiness need not be just being positive all the time or a smiley face, but about embracing the full range of human emotions and experience.

Americans have already begun to receive the approved $600 payments — for many a critical boost of cash to cover essential bills. But poverty experts have pointed out that $600, while helpful, won't be enough to support the millions who have been unemployed or suffered cuts to their income since the pandemic took hold in March.

Are you doubled over in bed with period cramps, unemployed and depressed? Has your borrowed Netflix password stopped working? Perhaps you just hit menopause and feel old and unloveable? No problem! An Asian woman of any age can always count on some Asian fetish dude at the bottom of the Tinder barrel to see past all your misgivings and look straight to your black hair and brown eyes with a false perception of who you are. Besides, it saves him all the trouble of having to import a mail-order bride from Asia! Yes, you have to endure the fact that he literally thinks the last Asian woman he dated has reincarnated into your body... but hey... free dinner!
As recently as this time last year, anti-Trump protests were held in the Capitol during the impeachment, Limbaugh insisted. All of the sudden protesting Congress is being called the end of the world. ... The worst crime against democracy in our nation's history. And yet, all kinds of anti-presidential protests were held in the Capitol during the impeachment and nobody was concerned about it in terms of the damage being done to our government institutions.

Maybe accepting that truth is the first step toward dismantling narratives about patriotism, whose dissent is tolerated and the appropriate ways to protest. White terror helped establish this democracy; Black Americans have tirelessly fought for racial equality and freedom since its inception. Any narrative to the contrary is just watering down the truth of our country's legacy.

That way, the government would know when a family on the brink of impoverishment suddenly became eligible for assistance, or conversely, when state benefits offered to a poor family might have improved their financial security to the point they were no longer eligible for state support.
But hopefully, more people will start telling their stories. Because to get through this pandemic, we need to hear them.
Given the failed federal response to COVID-19 so far, that can only mean improvement. On public health, the record is one of unmitigated disaster. Where South Korea, Taiwan, New Zealand, Singapore and other places swiftly implemented effective measures to avert both mass death and economic calamity, the United States has been an uncoordinated and morally callous disgrace.

The mystery hit me when I was at home one day overanalyzing my face in the mirror and deciding that I looked good enough for a selfie. I probably took about 25 photos and I hated almost every single one. All of a sudden, my nose seemed to be 10 times more crooked than normal, and it was all I could focus on. But I still looked fine in the mirror, which left me wondering why my face didn't quite translate into my phone.

When celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Beyonce, two women who have made their careers on their own takes on sexual empowerment, are lambasted for these very same displays post motherhood, what does this mean for the rest of us? Too sexy, I'm a bad mom. Not sexy enough, I'm somehow failing as a woman (that is, if your lens is the media). More than just mixed signals, it's identity cannibalism. And I don't know about you...but I was already having a hard enough time adjusting to my new identity of mama. It felt oppressive to now also worry about my yummy mummy status.

The policy stormed into mainstream political debate over the past two months after activists staged sit-ins in Pelosi's office and Ocasio-Cortez proposed a resolution to establish a select committee charged with drafting a Green New Deal. Eighty-two percent of Americans said they had heard nothing at all about a Green New Deal, yet 81 percent of registered voters said they supported the policies outlined under early proposals, according to a survey released last month by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and George Mason University.
I wish I had a solution, but I truly think that the more we start sharing these stories and listening to and making space for more marginalized groups within the community, the more change we can begin to create.
Instead of providing better, cheaper health care to all Americans ― a vow Trump made repeatedly in his campaign, sometimes using it to distinguish himself from rival GOP candidates ― repeal would have meant millions of poor and middle-class Americans losing their coverage. Some younger and healthier people would have ended up saving money, but only because older, sicker people would have ended up spending more ― or going without insurance altogether.
These typically include protective measures such as wearing gloves, washing your hands, not touching your face and disinfecting all surfaces of the machines you use.
Hohne offers the example of finding your purse in the freezer (which, if you ask us, is pretty strange).

With total control of Congress this year, however, Democrats will likely renew their push for $2,000 stimulus checks in the coming months, alongside a host of other provisions they had to concede in negotiations with Republicans, like a further extension of unemployment benefits. They will need every member of the Democratic caucus in the Senate on board as well as at least nine Republican senators to join them to overcome the chamber's 60-vote threshold and make it happen quickly.
With this amazing change in Georgia, I can't help but think of my good friend John Lewis. I know he's smiling down at us right now.
You asked whether belief in the virgin birth is essential. Essential to whom? You were told that if something is truly integral to a body of thought you cannot remove it without destabilizing the whole thing. That is a truism, but it does not help sort what is integral from what is not. Moreover, the truism pertains only to thought. Religious life is not mainly about thought, but about wholeness and well-being -- not in the unknowable future, but now. It is said that a man once asked, Teacher, how can I inherit eternal life. And the Teacher replied, What is written in the law? What do you read there? (Luke 10: 24-25) The Teacher turned first to learn from the man. Who are you? What do you hold to be essential? What a beautiful beginning.

This is the United States today: President Donald Trump, who has espoused racist rhetoric since he first announced his candidacy in 2015, lost his reelection after historic turnout and voter mobilization efforts.

U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged people to stick to government advice on social distancing and stay two meters away from others. At a daily news briefing, the prime minister warned the public that fresh air does not offer protection from the disease as he hinted that the U.K. could move to an enforced lockdown.

For decades, this is what psychologists thought, too: that the key stages in identity formation for gay men all led up to coming out, that once we were finally comfortable with ourselves, we could begin building a life within a community of people who'd gone through the same thing. But over the last 10 years, what researchers have discovered is that the struggle to fit in only grows more intense. A study published in 2015 found that rates of anxiety and depression were higher in men who had recently come out than in men who were still closeted. It's like you emerge from the closet expecting to be this butterfly and the gay community just slaps the idealism out of you, Adam says. When he first started coming out, he says, I went to West Hollywood because I thought that's where my people were. But it was really horrifying. It's made by gay adults, and it's not welcoming for gay kids. You go from your mom's house to a gay club where a lot of people are on drugs and it's like, this is my community? It's like the fucking jungle. I came out when I was 17, and I didn't see a place for myself in the gay scene, says Paul, a software developer. I wanted to fall in love like I saw straight people do in movies. But I just felt like a piece of meat.
I have had this disease since I was 6 years old. No one knows why this happens. Autoimmunity is still a mystery to doctors, but we do know there are triggers, like traumatic events, stress, compromised gut health, allergies, mold, etc. I was so young when it started, I mostly remember my mom being upset and counting the hairs on my pillow every morning.
We need to have the same level of rigor and accountability that is used to report a company's finances for measuring the other impacts that companies have on society. For instance, we can debate what's the right social cost of carbon, but we shouldn't have to debate whether societies deserve to know the amount of emissions companies are having. This is a core impact companies are having on the world, so we have some right to know who is responsible, who is accountable for those emissions.
Although Chicago won't be hosting one of over 200 marches taking place on Saturday, Ellin says the chapter will march again in the future. We will have a big march in 2020, she said. Because 2020 is going to be the biggest election of our lifetime.
Know the difference between a mentor and a sponsor. While mentors serve as a huge inspiration and support system for your career, it's a sponsor who will take direct action that translates into tangible career results. A sponsor is an influencer who shows up and gives you the technical advice and corporate pull you need to get ahead in your company. How do you know when you've found the one? As Jeff Weiner, CEO of LinkedIn, puts it, Like all valuable relationships in our lives, you know it's a right fit when you meet them.But, what if you don't see eye-to-eye with a mentor? There's still a lesson to be learned. Even if you wind up fundamentally disagreeing with their advice or point of view, it's usually enough to get your own thinking moving again, Neill says, and that will bring you all the fresh perspective and ideas you need to move forward!
A topic I was missing in most of the workshops [at the WRF], is corruption. I believe this is a significant issue for Costa Rica and Latin America. There cannot be sustainability if we do not change the way we are doing business.
Clinton told CNN that despite advances on paper such as paid parental leave and child care in some countries, misogyny persists online and through unconscious biases that hold women to a double standard.
But others have begun listening to us. One year ago today, my organization named former NFL player Larry Mallory as program director for our flag until 14 campaign. Mallory told the media, helping CTE moms and promoting flag until 14 is not only the right thing to do but the most effective approach in protecting both kids and the future of football.
5. My parents divorced, but they both eventually found The One.
You do need to adhere to their guidelines and successfully complete the program according to their requirements in order to qualify for loan repayment assistance, he said. But it can be a great way to give back while making a dent in your student debt.

Two days later, Ross told the House Ways and Means Committee, The Department of Justice, as you know, initiated the request for inclusion of the citizenship question.
It's a nice idea; it's just entirely fictional.
I was already really good friends with one of the girls from Finland, so we did the family training camp together last season and have kept in touch, Randall said. I've always been friendly with the other two, but now they make a point to come over and talk, and a couple of times, we've had our kids together. So it's definitely enhanced the camaraderie.
If Instagram suddenly disappeared and I wasn't so caught up with getting the perfect shots, angles and video clips, I could live in the moment. To be honest, I haven't felt what it's like to do that in a very long time. Even when I think I am, I catch myself wondering how much time I have to grab my phone before whatever amazing thing I'm experiencing is over.
President Donald Trump isn't just incompetent, unhinged and incapable of uttering a truthful or coherent thought about just about anything, he's like a stoner pizza shop manager who forgot to unlock the front door and open the place for business, Seth Meyers said Monday on Late Night With Seth Meyers.
I'm exhausted. Why am I on diaper duty most nights?
As we all celebrate the New Year we typically take the time to reflect on the past year and look forward to what the next 12 months holds. With the 'pop, clink, cheers' of New Year's Eve firmly behind us and the Champaign buzz a hazy memory, comes the obligatory and often much dreaded resolutions making. This is where we face the reality of our lives and resolve to do some form of self-improvement, which statistically 88% will fail to keep.

Trump's defenders, though, argue that as sitting president, he can project big, bold, strong leadership that voters will like, even if he is not as detail-oriented as previous presidents. You need some of that unconventional leadership, said Jason Miller, a top official in Trump's 2016 campaign and an outside adviser now. If President Trump can continue leading us through this crisis, voters are going to reward him and he's going to be reelected.
Everyone thinks you have to wear a black suit to a funeral. Well, you may not have a black suit if you're a man, but you could wear [a dark suit], Diane Gottsman, etiquette expert and owner of The Protocol School of Texas, told HuffPost, adding, If you're a woman, you don't have to wear black, but wear something that's not going to make you stand out and make you look as if you're celebrating.
Sanders' hold on the progressive mantle may have seemed like it would be a given. But in September, when the Working Families Party, a network of progressive groups with a presence in over 14 states, endorsed Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), it looked like an activist exodus was underway.
That's exactly what's happening. The country's immigration courts are largely closed. Those who miss their court dates because of the shutdown are getting sent to the back of the line, according to The New York Times ― which can mean delays of up to four years. As of last week, nearly 43,000 hearings had been canceled, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse project at Syracuse University ― with an additional 20,000 or so cancellations expected for every week the shutdown drags on.
MILWAUKEE, Wis./CHICAGO (Reuters) - A major winter storm barreled into Chicago and Milwaukee early on Friday, dumping heavy snow and dropping temperatures well below freezing as it forced schools to close and threatened to leave travel at a stand still across the Midwest.
Climate change has made weather events more destructive, with fiercer, more violent storms and prolonged droughts that transformed swaths of the west into tinderboxes, driving up the losses. But part of the problem is that more valuable properties are located on the coasts or near forests. NOAA officials said the analysis did not account for differences between those two factors.

Georgia's Senate races ended in runoffs after no candidate topped 50% of the vote in multicandidate races held in November. Signifying what was at stake, the Georgia Senate campaigns shattered spending records as the two most expensive races in U.S. history ― combined, more than $830 million was spent on them. Overall, 9 out of the 10 most expensive Senate races in the nation's history took place this election cycle.
Happy #DatingSunday. Wishing you much love and joy in cyberspace, or wherever you may roam.
Show me a parent that has it all figured out and I will show you a parent that is living a fairy tale. We are not perfect, we were just chosen. My mom shakes her head at me all the time because I caused her so much heartache growing up but I did turn out to be an awesome person. Not to mention, she loves the fact that I am getting a taste of my own medicine as a parent. No applause for her (haha)!!!!!!
Inside cops-only message boards and other pro-law enforcement media groups online, police officers are grappling with how a group that usually proclaims Blue Lives Matter could turn its wrath on them. Instead of facing the uncomfortable implications of the siege, many are pushing the debunked conspiracy theory that the chaos was orchestrated by anti-fascist activists who disguised themselves in a scheme to make the president and his base look bad.
The Democrats' mode of alliance is to appeal to the entire class of employees by endorsing state programs of mass economic, social and cultural support. For example through subsidized higher education, unemployment insurance, Social Security increases and so on. The Democrats' plan is to pay such programs' costs by means of taxes imposed partly on employers and partly on employees.
Other individuals have been sure they'll join those who have died before them. A man I recently met commented on how crowded it must be up there if everyone is in bodily form. He concluded, waving his hands gently in the air, we must all be just wisps of things so we can all fit.
My first run didn't exactly go well. I slipped on a patch of ice at the entrance of a tunnel, fell on my bum and got totally soaked. When I returned home, the skin on my thighs was burning and prickling, and the end of my nose felt strange.
Jamil suggests those conversations sometimes need to happen during sex, and encouraged women to act in honour of your needs (that is, she mentions, as long as one feels safe).
You won't believe this when I tell you, but I felt relief when we finally heard that she was in jail. Just to know where she was was, that she wasn't dead, was all that mattered in that moment, she said. Then, it hits you. Our lives have changed forever.
If you are willing to walk away from a life that will ultimately see you soar, then your 'why' wasn't strong enough to begin with.
The 2020 election is over, said a statement Sunday from a bipartisan group of 10 senators, including Republicans Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Mitt Romney of Utah.
When you're focused on trying to know steps 1 through 50, you get way ahead of yourself and this keeps you from making any progress at all, said Sumayya Essack, a mindset and life coach in Boston. Big goals like changing careers and starting businesses don't have paint-by-numbers formulas, so you can't actually know all the steps.
You'll never know what finishing could inspire you to do next.
Christians have always benefited from the cautions implicit in the gospels' teaching of the Resurrection as more like a beloved voice than a face. Put plainly, the stories say that faith is not about things seen, that seeing is not believing. Early on, people urgently needed this message, so of course the churches learned fast which sorts of vessels could hold the holy fire for faith from generation to generation. Only stories have that quality. No doctrine, no essay like this, can carry the flame.
Trump's former Homeland Security adviser Tom Bossert said that a ban on European travelers makes little sense now that the illness is already being passed within U.S. communities.
Joe Biden, who was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the time, voted for the war ― along with 28 other Democratic senators and all but one Republican.
LONDON (AP) — Lewis Hamilton is now a Sir as well as a seven-time Formula One champion.
Between planning shots and pointlessly scrolling the feed, I was spending approximately five hours a day on Instagram. That is 35 hours a week, 150 hours a month, 1,825 hours a year. Instagram quickly became my biggest commitment, yet provided me with the least rewards. My account hardly grew, even though I was putting a full-time job's worth of effort into it.
More than a hundred years later, things haven't changed all that much. Money influences the outcome of elections, access to politicians, and the content of legislation. And the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010) opened the floodgates of corporate and union spending in elections and paved the way for the emergence of Super PACS.
Last week, the TSA Council president for the American Federation of Government Employees said that agency workers had been suffering extreme financial hardship during the shutdown and that some employees had already walked off the job.
For one, Trump toyed with supporting the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals immigration program. He also suggested he could be flexible on what the physical wall structure would be ― allowing for steel slats instead of a concrete barrier. Both ideas are concessions Democrats could potentially get behind, if they trusted Trump.
The Energy Jolt Without the Crash
Although this doesn't erase the pain I felt, she said, this process has been therapeutic for me and allowed me to let go of the anger I have had.
People were losing trust in food, says Yuriko Ito, the executive director of Seikatsu Club, sitting in the headquarters in Tokyo's busy Shinjuku district. The scandals jolted people because they affected foods that were previously considered healthy, she adds. That's how people realized that they could not just trust these claims. They have to think for themselves in order to protect themselves and their families.
You basically want to allow the family to set the tone for that sort of thing, Swann added.

But Fleischer stood by his account to HuffPost on Tuesday, going back and checking his notes from the time ― and providing more detail from the meeting.
I think the moment will not only not be forgotten, but this moment will become a memory that galvanises, a memory that gives hope, a memory that shows you can leave certain domestic structures behind. These are women challenging the state, and it's an authoritarian state right now. Even if they don't get what they want, this will not be a failure. Even if nothing outstanding or iconoclastic comes out of it, the stories around Shaheen Bagh will be important as a mobilising force for whatever happens in the future. These women will be remembered for being the first people to take to the streets against the CAA. That's really a story of courage.
In the best of times, women do twice as much unpaid care in Canada as men do, Sarosi said. This is really growing exponentially now, with the closures of schools and daycares, and caring for the elderly and sick.
That's exactly what keeps Porchon-Lynch invested in the practice and hitting the mat: The overall sense of mental, physical and emotional wellness that comes from even just yogic breathing can do wonders, she said.
Doctors can't cure many chronic diseases. But they can keep people dying longer.
The address comes as the British government said it was willing to take more action if needed to stop coronavirus from spreading amid reports that Britons were ignoring calls for social distancing. A further 54 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in the U.K., bringing the total number of confirmed deaths in the country to 335, it was announced today.

We must understand how this happened to make sure it never occurs again, Raisman tweeted. ... The system has to change so that athletes are safe. Enablers need to be held accountable.
Sparks: The soups we deliver to our folks are of the quality of The Underground Kitchen. There's nothing different than what we'd serve at one of our events. The quality of ingredients is the same organic, beautiful ingredients. We had to scale back a little bit because we found out a lot soups don't fit everybody's tastes. We got a little more basic with it. But we would not do this unless we could do it under the same pretenses we do The Underground Kitchen. Quite frankly, [our cost to make it] may be a little bit more for the quality that we do, but it's not much more than what a food pantry might put out — and it's not filled with chemicals.
ASSOCIATED PRESS A photo shows the smoky haze that obscured the Space Needle and downtown Seattle in August 2018.
Inslee faces some critics on climate change. In February, 13 young people in Washington, ages seven to 17, sued the state, alleging Inslee and the agencies under his control violated the constitutional rights of a generation by failing to curb greenhouse gas emissions. One plaintiff ― Jamie Margolin, a 17-year-old activist in Seattle who founded the youth climate group Zero Hour ― railed against Inslee in a series of tweets last week accusing the governor of fighting tooth & nail against the lawsuit, which a state judge tossed in August.
After easily winning a third term in November, Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.) spearheaded a revolt against likely House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), arguing that the California lawmaker's ascent would jeopardize this hard-fought majority that we finally got of moderate women in suburban districts like hers.

Ubud Food Festival has a responsibility to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and to ensure the community stays healthy and safe, festival organisers said in a statement to HuffPost Australia.
While cover letters and resumes are still necessary, recruiters tend to take an extra step in checking out applicants' profiles. Why? What you post on your social media accounts greatly reflects your thoughts and attitudes. Thus, job seekers are advised to think before they create any post on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter. If necessary, they should share and discuss issues within the field they're applying.
Under the garb of maintaining law and order, Chief Minister Ajay Bisht, who calls himself Yogi Adityanath, has unleashed a brutal crackdown to crush any dissent against the discriminatory citizenship law. The UP Police has arrested thousands of people, beaten women and children, shot at non-protestors, and tortured children. Now, the government is sending notices to people suspected of damaging public property to pay damages or face seizure of their properties.
SAN ANTONIO ― Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro officially announced a run for the White House on Saturday, becoming one of the first fully committed candidates in what is expected to become a crowded contest for the 2020 Democratic nomination.

However, strange things started on Tuesday when the Spike TV Twitter account posted this tweet.
He applied, but the Air Force Board for Corrections of Military Records rejected his request, claiming that his personal records were likely destroyed in a 1973 fire. Yet, Spires' luck changed when he was contacted by a group of lawyers from Yale who said they wanted to take on his case. His legal team soon found Spires' service number, which proved he had served per NBC News.
Another thing that helps is healthy exercise, such as running around the local park, noted McDermott. That might be more difficult with your teens, but organizing family activities outside can be done.

Running in winter takes a little more preparation than simply lacing up your sneakers and heading outside. You'll need to think carefully about the preparation and execution. Follow these tips from fitness experts to become a successful winter runner:
She was initially scheduled to be executed on Dec. 8, but her two lead attorneys — Harwell and Kelley Henry — both got sick with COVID-19 following visits with Montgomery in prison. A district court delayed her execution and gave her lawyers more time to finish her clemency petition.
Now, I must admit my private shame at having almost passed over My Brilliant Friend. Discouraged by the cover and the title, which to me read more chick lit and less literary magnum opus, I didn't pick up this novel until the fourth and final installment in the series had been published. I finally took heed of the rave reviews and found myself instantly dazzled by Ferrante's heartbreakingly honest narrative. This book isn't flashy or presumptuous; it doesn't need to be. The simple beauty of the story, of the unbreakable bond between two young girls joined by circumstance, tenacity, and the turbulence of adolescence, speaks for itself.
Si la gestion de l'épidémie de 2002-2003 (774 morts dans le monde dont 349 en Chine continentale et 299 à Hong Kong) avait valu des critiques de l'Organisation mondiale de la santé (OMS), c'est qu'à l'époque, les autorités chinoises avaient tardé à donner l'alerte et tenté de camoufler l'ampleur de la situation.
The Pfizer study found that the vaccine appeared to work against 15 additional possible virus mutations, but E484K wasn't among those tested. Dormitzer said it is next on the list.
Between planning my next shot, picking the outfit I'd wear, getting ready, doing my makeup, staging, taking and editing dozens and dozens of photos, writing the perfect caption, researching hashtags to use, planning the best time to post, and then responding to the comments I received, it literally took me hours to create a single Instagram post.
These companies also seem to be pivoting to more original content rather than maintaining huge libraries of quality shows and movies by other creators. So you might have to subscribe to quite a few streaming companies to get an extensive library.
The vague statements, to many, appeared to grant legitimacy to the climate change denial her father's employers deliberately drummed up to obscure a scientific reality their own researchers understood would upend the oil industry's business model.
However most recently, Sood has been thinking a lot about how we can find true and lasting happiness in these uncertain times. Interestingly, he's doing it by boldly reimagining the pursuit of happiness for a better future. He just gave his first TED talk on the subject and currently he is writing his first book ever titled Exponential Happiness, which comes out in 2017.
Aidan Harper of the London-based 4 Day Week campaign, which advocates for shorter working hours, says younger couples keen to split childcare and paid work more equitably are also driving the change. Younger men want to spend time with their kids; more women want to have a career. It's about redistributing full-time work between the genders and redistributing unpaid labor within the home.
In the corner, there sat a beautiful wooden upright piano; an underutilized instrument, bathed in silence, dreaming of once again being touched. One sympathizes. Now, it was a stand for a flat screen television. Samsung. I'll bet he did. It was taco night, I assume. There were what one might identify as taco fixins on a long table in the center of the room. No one was hovering around it the way my ilk would've, so I suppose it could've been an art installation.
She is Muslim. She is a woman with a mind.
The current closure had only marginal impact on the general public at first, when many people were on vacation for the holidays and government offices were closed anyway. But as the shutdown drags on with no obvious end in sight, Americans are growing more aware and more annoyed by the disruption. More than four in 10 Americans now consider the partial shutdown a very serious problem, according to a HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted Jan. 4 to 7.

Johnson declared on Britain's This Morning TV program on Tuesday that one coronavirus theory is that people should take it on the chin and allow the disease to move through the population. But, he added, I think we need to strike a balance.
He called the PCs' justification for cancelling the pilot — that it would discourage people from working — moronic.
I've been a police officer for 10 years and it's definitely got worse. It used to be that people just wouldn't touch you, but now they don't have any second thoughts about doing it. [One day last May] I heard a radio call from Lancashire Police saying they needed a breathyliser for a driver in Lancaster. It was 15 minutes from the end of my shift but I had one so I offered to help. They'd seen someone driving the wrong way round the one-way system and he looked drunk. This driver blows into the breathyliser and he goes over the limit. But as we were trying to get him out of the vehicle, his wife got out. She punched me in the face. I was in a state of shock, thinking 'what's just happened? ', then she punched me again. I sprayed her [with pepper spray] but she punched me again. And even as I tried to use my baton to defend myself, she punched me again. I only realised fully what she'd done when I saw the blood dripping from my nose as I tried to restrain her. She was in her late-40s, early-50s, quite short and sounded middle class. But she was drunk as well. She was prosecuted but was given a curfew order from 9pm to 7am for 30 days, told to pay £85 court costs and to compensate me with £100. For her, that £185 was not much more than a good night out.
Isabel Wilkerson writes about this phenomenon with terrifying force in her 2020 book, Caste. She spoke to many researchers about the motivations of white Trump voters.

I read it and started thinking, 'Who on Earth are we going to endorse? No one else is going to have this kind of plan,' Alex Beauchamp, Food & Water Action's Brooklyn-based regional director, said by phone. This plan is the best I've seen from virtually any candidate for any office. It seemed obvious.

The Utah-based religion of 16-million members worldwide has tried in the last decade to create a more welcoming environment for LGBTQ members, while adhering to its doctrinal opposition of gay marriage. The faith, widely known as the Mormon church, teaches that while being gay is not a sin, engaging in same-sex relationships is against God's commandments.
It may provide a false sense of protection and perhaps lead to not incorporating the measures that have been shown to be effective, Harry said. Face masks are recommended for people who have respiratory infection to prevent droplets from spreading from them.
The Trump administration plan to distribute vaccines is falling behind—far behind, Biden said. If it continues to move as it is now, it's going to take years, not months, to vaccinate the American people.
The degree of temperature and habitat change that has happened is likely unprecedented due to how quickly these changes are happening now with the rapid warming of the earth, she told HuffPost in an email. We don't know how resilient sea turtle species are when faced with such rapid changes in climate, habitat availability, and developmental pressure.
Autopsy reports show that the government's execution protocol, a lethal injection of pentobarbital, may torture as it kills — even in healthy individuals. When used in executions, the drug often causes a condition called pulmonary edema, where fluid enters the lungs while the person is still conscious, creating a painful sensation similar to suffocating or drowning.

Kansas cut taxes drastically in 2012, counting on economic growth to make up the difference. But despite vast budget cuts, the state's revenue never caught up, creating a roughly $300 million budget hole and prompting a backlash among residents and lawmakers.
The Baltimore case is one of the most closely watched attempts by a city or state to force companies that spent decades funding misinformation on climate science that internal documents show their own researchers understood to pay for the destruction unchecked warming caused.

Parents want to hear that they're doing a good job, especially from other parents. Again, there is this massive push to always be perceived as this great parent but lets think about it, some of the great men and women we know were not the best kid growing up. Let children be children!!! Let's not rob them of their childhood by wanting them to be mini statutes. They are humans just like us (in case you needed a reminder).
This pandemic ripped gaping holes in the system. Marc Perrone, UFCW president
And so, last August, my husband and I got married in beautiful Mammoth Lakes –- a destination wedding in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California that reflected our love of the great outdoors. To properly honor our Chinese heritage and to make the travel worthwhile for our guests, I insisted that we do the traditional Chinese tea ceremony and a 10-course dinner banquet the day before our actual wedding. We rented a rustic, raw space, hired the best Chinese restaurant we could find in the area to cater and planned for an evening of dance and musical performances.
Likewise, the Trump administration shuffled judges to the border in an attempt to rush through the cases of Central American families that have shown up in larger numbers in recent years, often requesting asylum ― effectively putting cases guaranteed to be lengthy at the front of the jam-packed docket. But the judges didn't share then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions' enthusiasm for disposing of asylum cases quickly and skeptically. And the backlog in their home jurisdictions grew, too.
After President Donald Trump insisted at the last minute that a relief bill provide $2,000 checks, House Democrats immediately passed an amendment increasing the stimulus payment by $1,400 that then-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) blocked in the Senate. The issue would end up becoming a critical political cudgel for Warnock and Ossoff, the victorious Georgia Senate Democrats, to wield against their Republican opponents.
The governors of the four states have been working together to curb the spread of the virus across the region by implementing uniform policies to encourage residents to stay home.
Associated Press writers Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey, Bassem Mroue in Beirut and Robert Burns and Matthew Lee in Washington contributed to this report.
And if it happens as predicted, its brightness will increase by 10,000-fold, making it one of the brightest objects in the night sky and easily visible with the naked eye, according to a Calvin College news release.
While some commended Lovato for leveraging her huge social media platform and fan following for political activism, others expressed some hesitancy over whether a new song was the most effective way to call attention to the moment.
Yet there is something decidedly unique about this story, something that defies universalizing. Lila and Elena forged their friendship in poverty, entrenched in want and fueled by dreams of overcoming the turf wars and violence that defined their childhood. They grew up in a world full of words that killed, and their friendship was a buoy that kept them afloat among the wreckage. But when Lila becomes engaged at fifteen, Elena's identity, constructed in the image of her friend, is shattered: I was no longer able to trace a coherent design in the division of our fates. The concreteness of [the wedding] date made concrete the crossroads that would separate our lives. The last pages of this novel left me gasping for air, struck by the warped beauty and terrible injustice of growing apart -- and desperate for the next book in the series.
We're doing the right thing, Zinke said. But it's a narrative that's very difficult to get across.
Le mot pandémie désigne une épidémie qui se répand à l'échelle mondiale. Cette situation suppose que toute la population mondiale (est) susceptible d'être exposée à une infection et qu'une part d'entre elle (peut) potentiellement tomber malade, avait expliqué fin février le Dr Michael Ryan, directeur du programme pour les urgences de l'OMS.
As my colleague, Larry Swedroe, noted, active management is the triumph of hype, hope and marketing over wisdom and experience.

She also suggested people should do what they can to ease the burden on the health care system in the meantime by staying home if they're sick, washing their hands and getting flu shots.
The first people have begun arriving at an emergency field hospital set up in Madrid to help local hospitals overwhelmed with coronavirus patients. The field hospital — in the IFEMA conference centre — can take over 100 patients with moderate virus complications. Approximately 1,000 beds will be prepared in the next 48 hours and capacity is estimated at 5,500 patients.
Steyer has never held office but is one of the Democratic Party's biggest donors and fundraisers. He gave heavily to Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign and contributed more than $87 million to Democratic candidates during that election cycle. He was also a major donor to both of former President Barack Obama's presidential campaigns and was reportedly floated for various roles in the administration.
Then-Senator Biden was not interviewed for this book, and we don't infrequently disagree with Ari Fleischer, the aide said. In fact, Biden fought for legislation that would have forced Bush to first attempt to get U.N. approval for any military action and in its absence certify to Congress that there was no alternative course of action.
Spending time under Belichick will be seen as an overwhelming positive, for the most part. McDaniels also brings a proven offensive background, which should appeal to a 35-year-old Manning. (McDaniels is just 39 himself.) Heck, he might even consider keeping Ben McAdoo around as Manning's offensive coordinator—that pairing has found great success together.

In an example of the concerns that spurred the change, one agent assigned to Trump was allowed to take a leave to become a White House political aide and became enmeshed in a particularly contentious, controversial incident marking his presidency. Anthony Ornato, who worked as White House deputy chief of staff earlier this year, helped arrange the photo opportunity in June when Trump posed with a Bible across Lafayette Square in Washington as peaceful protesters were attacked by federal officers. The protests had been sparked by the police killing of George Floyd days earlier in Minneapolis.
The National Social Registry, the documents make clear, will not be restricted to sucking up data on below-poverty-line families who rely on state support, but every single Indian citizen.
By late January, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney held the post in name only as rumors swirled of his impending, post-impeachment departure. He was on the initial coronavirus task force, which was plagued with infighting. At the same time, the White House Office of Management and Budget was clashing with Azar's HHS over money to combat the virus.
But Rice has long wooed Republicans. In the four years leading up to 2013, she accepted donations from Donald Trump totaling $53,000. Her father, a contractor who became the building commissioner of New York's Archdiocese, registered as a Republican after moving to once deep-red Nassau County. Because New York's primaries are closed to nonpartisans, he registered as a Democrat only when his daughter ran in a primary for district attorney, according to a New York Times profile from March 2014.
Today for us is a day of grief ... but also a day of action, said Pelosi. We say enough is enough by finally bringing common-sense bipartisan background check legislation to the floor of the House.

Why is this important? Because the census is how representation in our government is determined. The demographics in this country are changing, and this terrifies the virtually all-white club that is today's Republican Party. Its only chance at staying in power is to rig the way power is distributed. What happens with the census could be one of the most important and immediate fallouts of the Trump presidency.
Now is not the time to blame anyone, Shih said. We shouldn't say, it's your fault.
The trigger for the violence lay 1,400 km away in Ayodhya, where then UP Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav had ordered the police to fire on the karsevaks who had gathered near the Babri Masjid. A year later, the 16th century mosque would be demolished by the karsevaks, and 27 years later, the Supreme Court of India ruled in favour of building a temple at the site.
Under the Criminal Code, child pornography is any visual representation of a person under the age of 18 engaged or depicted to be engaged in a sexual activity.
Castro rose to national prominence in 2012 when the then-mayor was selected to give the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention. He joined the Obama administration as the head of HUD two years later, giving him a national profile and feeding speculation that he might become the running mate of his party's 2016 presidential nominee. (Hillary Clinton ultimately chose Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia instead.)
Chris came up with the idea of leveraging online Crowdfunding models to solve Detroit's blight. When he first described it, no one got it. Everyone kept saying that it sounds like Kickstarter or GoFundMe, Blauvelt remembers, when he entered a statewide social entrepreneur competition in 2013. But I saw a whole new way to use Crowdfunding to flip grant-giving on its head
Education time is a big factor in why people take years longer than they need to in order to succeed. My students all had a good base, but it was only when we started working together that they really started to make big gains in life. It taught me that a mentor is one of the best tools you can have.
Take deep breaths, Jack yells, as his kids start to panic.
The senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta defeated Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.), giving Georgia a Democratic Senate seat for the first time in over a decade. With the win, Warnock also became the first Black senator to represent the state and only the 11th Black senator ever elected. Ossoff also made history, becoming the youngest senator in 40 years and the first Jewish senator elected to a Southern state since the 1880s.
Russell Buhr is an assistant professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles and an intensive care doctor at two UCLA hospitals. For him, a strong support system has become essential to getting through these difficult times. His husband of four years, Will Murtaugh, also works in the medical field but in a different capacity. He oversees clinical trials of new coronavirus treatments and has previously worked on infectious disease research for HIV and tuberculosis.
For me there was no judgment if we differed; that's just the way it is and always has been. This time, however, there was extreme self-righteousness. It went way beyond the norm. Consequently, I held my feelings much closer than I had in the past because, if I didn't believe the way other side did, in their minds there was obviously something wrong with me. This is a political twist that I've never experienced. Say what you will about the candidate, but don't personally disparage me because of my own beliefs. For the first time in my life, I was lumped into an inflammatory category that said nothing about the real me. It was very discouraging and, inside, I railed against it.
Around 800,000 federal workers missed their first paychecks on Friday, although Congress passed a bill last week to grant back pay to those workers and the president has signaled that he will sign it.

Earlier this month NBC Washington's News4 I-Team conducted an investigation into understaffing in federal prisons. The investigation, which was based on an in-depth analysis of congressional records and FOIA requests, found that while the Bureau of Prisons has increased staffing levels since 2005, that most federal prisons are operating at 10 percent below the recommended staffing levels. This understaffing, says union spokesperson Sommer Roy, results in federal prison guards being vulnerable to inmate assaults both in the mornings and in the evenings.
Droughts, heat waves, wildfires and heavy winter rains are all related, according to climate scientists ― they're part of a climate change pattern observed along the West Coast.
The tortuous ties between the Irish in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland; the relationship with contacts and targets in England; the terror network extending across the seas; and the connection between former comrades at arms, make for a good read and a painful reminder of similar sectarian troubles or incidents that rocked Lebanon during its 1975-90 civil war.
Market research found that children ages five to sixteen spend six and a half hours in front of a screen everyday! If you take into consideration the fact that they sleep for at least eight hours if not more, that means there's less than ten hours left in the day. When you factor in school and activities, there's hardly anytime left to have a simple conversation. Is it too late to unplug our kids or have we lost them to technology forever? I guess it depends what side of the screen you're on.

We are always together, she insisted. I know you by now.
Ahead of confederation, the area now covered by Saskatchewan and Alberta was proposed by the then-Northwest Territories premier as a possible large province called Buffalo.
Mystery Brand is not much different from those projects, except for the fact that we make the whole process of buying and receiving items from a Mystery Box fast and transparent in real time, said Perk. He added: Sometimes, shipping may take up to a couple of weeks since we mostly use the [online marketplace] StockX platform for purchasing and delivering prizes.
It's for this reason he would urge customers to still pick up orders or dine-in where social distancing measures are used, taking into account one-metre distances and appropriate hand sanitisation.
Bandy is very similar to ice hockey, but it involves a larger rink, a larger net, more players and a small ball rather than a puck. Bandy is more popular outside the U.S. and was a demonstration sport at the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo, Norway.
Dick Pound, a longtime IOC member, told USA Today the summer games will be pushed back, likely to 2021. An official announcement is expected sometime in the next four weeks, as the committee is still hammering out details on how a postponement will work.
On Tuesday, she later tweeted, The American people did not organize the biggest midterm election in ~100 years so their new leaders could sit back as the nation waits in crisis. Our class was elected for a very specific reason: to lead differently, propose bold ideas, and create positive change for all people.
In Michigan, Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, Jan. 8 called for an increase in the state's personal exemption to offset the potential $1.5 billion in increased taxes that Michigan taxpayers would have to pay without action. That proposal opened the door to more comprehensive tax change proposals by both Republicans and Democrats.
Hasen maintains that debates over campaign finance limits should not turn on whether or not they will reduce corruption. Access, he acknowledges, may be a legitimate expectation of donors to a candidate's campaign - and evidence of outright bribery is scarce. A better approach would cite political equality as an interest in its own right. Since the Supreme Court called for one man, one vote in Reynolds v. Sims (1964) and struck down the poll tax in Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections (1966), Hasen points out, it has recognized that voting rules should give equal political power to all citizens. The Court has not yet held that each voter has a constitutional right to equal influence (through the electoral process) in having his or her preferred policies enacted into law, but Hasen believes it could and should do so to limit the likelihood that disparities in resources will be turned into disparities in political influence.
I think we rest too much on the data that 90% of start-ups fail, so we figure chances are we are going to fail, so why make the massive effort to know what we're doing from the outset? As entrepreneurs, we measure success regarding the number of start-ups we've founded, and how we continue to make money from those failures, and not the number of successful ones and the number of lives we've impacted in those efforts.
It's not surprising there are more fathers than mothers on Team USA. Having a baby can take a serious toll on a woman's body. Randall missed a season of racing during her pregnancy.
On 13 October, 2015, the Ministry of Rural Development proposed a social registry system to ensure greater benefits from SECC data to the Parliament Standing Committee on rural development, according to a November 2015 file noting reviewed by HuffPost India.
Republicans countered with their own massive ground game, with the National Republican Senatorial Committee hiring 1,000 field organizers. While Republican turnout in the runoff also was high, it lagged behind Democrats in some crucial conservative areas. But GOP operatives said Trump's refusal to accept the election results limited their ability to portray the race as an essential check on Democratic control of Washington.
The adviser, Robert Becker, served as a deputy national field director and oversaw Sanders' campaign efforts in Iowa, Michigan, California and New York.
Listening to music was something we only did at home or in the car - until the Walkman. Imagined by Sony co-founder Masaru Ibuka and designed by engineer Nobutoshi Kihara, Walkman ushered in the age of personal and portable music listening, to let us listen while we walk, while we work, while we commute and while we exercise. All personal cassette players that followed were referred to as a Walkman, regardless of manufacturer, much to Sony's chagrin, but the idea of portable audio changed how we find, buy and enjoy our music.
The only time we truly fail is when we call tools down on our life and dreams, and revert back to what's easy instead of what's worth it.
I had passed countless amounts of homeless people all day but for some reason I was so drawn to this woman, she wrote. I told my friends to please wait for just a moment and I tried to quickly get back across the street to talk with this mystery woman.
The average person can expect to live 71.4 years, says the World Health Organization based on 2016 data. In the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put life expectancy at 78.6 years in 2017, down from 78.7 in 2016. The WHO estimate of American life expectancy is a bit lower — 78.5 years — and both government data and a global health study from the University of Washington show that number is on the decline.

Therefore, what can you do to create an incentive that is aberrational (different from the norm) and also positive? The task in its own right may be challenging or difficult. Incentives might be treating yourself to a concert or setting aside time to participate in an activity or hobby you particularly enjoy.
Trump said Thursday that he exempted the U.K. from the travel ban because he believes conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson is doing a good job battling coronavirus. But several health experts disagree with Trump's assessment.
As DeRegotis put it in an interview with the Village Voice, a lot of people who are critics are fans.
When all we are doing is protecting rights, titles, freedoms, water, air, land, something that is so vital to all human beings, and to have armed personnel come at you, have our people and our supporters arrested … that is not supposed to happen in a democratic country.
High-conflict people aren't reasonable. They only see their side of things. They have intense emotional reactions to minor situations. They lack healthy conflict resolution skills. Trying to talk sense into someone like this is like going to the hardware store repeatedly looking for milk — and then getting upset that there's no milk to be found. You will feel much more grounded once you stop expecting a crazy person to act sane.
In order to change the tide, there needs to be balance, as with anything in life. While my kids are allowed to use technology on a daily basis, I usually limit their usage to 15 minute intervals. Once the time is up they have to go and do something else that doesn't involve a screen. Most of the time they agree, other times I'm mean. I can live with that title if the result is that my kids go out and play or use their imagination instead of gluing their eyes to a screen.
HHS wanted to send a special coronavirus funding request to Congress but the White House budget office resisted for weeks, insisting that HHS should instead repurpose $250 million of its existing budget to bolster the national stockpile by buying protective equipment. HHS, however, claimed that without congressional authorization it could not buy the needed quantities of masks, gowns and ventilators to rapidly bolster the national stockpile
Inner balance on the other hand, once actually established, is unshakable.
Here's what to know about the new strain identified in South Africa:
5. Your time is your own. Technology is on your side today and often times it's just as easy to do your job from somewhere other than at your desk. A winning job allows you some flexibility where, when and how you get your job done. If this is important to you, set a clear line of expectations with your employer so that you have flexibility on your side.
It's possible that the prospect of well-worn faces duking it out in the extended, wrenching cable-news kayfabe that is a U.S. presidential election campaign merely induces fatigue in would-be voters. It's also possible, though, that the desire for someone entirely new represents a desire for new and more nimble tactics or a way to cut through the greasy film of grim spectacle extruding from the White House at all times.
But the downside is that this rebel boss often changes plans at the last minute, creating tension on their teams. What makes them toxic is everyone will get together in a team and make a decision, and the lone wolf later on will be like, 'No, I'm going to [do] this.'
These white terrorists see themselves as the ultimate victims; their insurrection reframed in the delusional QAnon collective imagination as a righteous revolution. They are committed to the delusion. Even as reports circulated that five people — four Trump superfans and a Capitol police officer — had died as a result of the mayhem, people were insisting in my Instagram DMs and comments that no one got hurt, and that antifa was the real problem and that we were all overreacting because this was the first time white people act[ed] out.
Yes, it is safe to use [a shared laundry machine] right now because the virus is killed by washing your clothes over 80 degrees Fahrenheit, from what we currently understand, she said. The more challenging issue is going to be the social distancing and contact with potentially contaminated surfaces and people in the laundromat. Not the laundry itself.
I'm really excited to create something that reflects the reality of mama sex...and while it is sometimes a nice ego boost to be jokingly called a MILF, I'd also like something other than porn to define me sexually. Maybe you'd like the same?
Revelations that Tarantino is a piece of shit (not new) doesn't suddenly require you to tell the world how much you have always hated his films (which suck incidentally). — Richard Whittall (@RWhittall) February 3, 2018
I am thrilled about joining the Judiciary Committee because I have centered and see an urgent need for democracy reforms in this country. We talk a lot as progressives about big structural changes ― Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, housing as a human right and policies that would reflect that. But none of that stuff is possible unless we root the corrosive influence of money out of our politics. And also, draw congressional districts in a way that will cause members of Congress to be responsive to the American people.
When Americans say they are ready for someone new in 2020, perhaps what they need, what they want, is someone capable of inspiring a new and necessary fire in their bellies. Perhaps there is someone capable of surveying the sagging, leech-coated mass of government as it is and imagining what it could be instead. And not the small, petty and ineffectual rage of racism, whose cynical uses improve not a single life, but the bigger and more powerful rage that can carry a polity from sorrow to something better, something entirely new.
As part of the CES 50th anniversary commemoration, in my role as newly-minted historian for the Consumer Technology Association (CTA, the industry and lobbying group who produce CES), I've helped collect around three dozen historically significant gadgets for display, from 8-track, compact cassette and record players that Beatles' fans played Sgt. Pepper on, through the first cell phones, the first VHS VCR, the first GPS portable, the first DVR - well, a whole host of first gadgets.
He really struggled with the time change and he was up six or seven times a night, Randall recalled. I was starting to race, and it just wasn't working.
If the plans of Modi's bureaucrats and advisors are realised, this system will automatically track when a citizen moves between cities, changes jobs, buys new property, when a member of a family is born, dies or gets married and moves to their spouse's home. The interoperability of modern database systems means there is no technical limit to the extent of data that can be collected and indexed by this master database of databases. In a meeting on October 4, 2019, for instance, a special secretary of the NITI Aayog even proposed geo-tagging every single home and integrating it with Bhuvan, a web-based geo-spatial portal developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).
I feel angry that Trump terrorists can storm the Capitol without storm troopers, rubber bullets or getting shot and very few arrests, unlike the treatment of peaceful BLM protesters this summer.
Ossoff and Warnock shattered fundraising records ― pulling in more than $100 million each in the past two months ― and significantly outraised their GOP opponents. Yet eight days before the election, the campaign managers for the Ossoff and Warnock campaigns wrote a joint memo sounding the alarm about the need for more funds. While Democrats were largely relying on individual donations and small-dollar contributions, they were being outspent by GOP outside groups.
Steyer's decision not to run in 2020 only slightly shrinks the pool of Democrats who are likely to attempt to unseat Trump. Elizabeth Warren has already declared her candidacy, while former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are all rumored to be announcing runs, too.
I've likely been guilty of the same over the years before I knew better. I'm sure I unknowingly glared at the parent struggling to control their kid in the grocery store, or the airport or in the park.

I do believe we need to see a change in Iran if we are going to see peace in the Middle East, he said.
The legislation would require the city to carry out a study on the feasibility of replacing existing in-city gas-fired plants with renewables that use battery storage, according to a draft HuffPost obtained. By Dec. 30, 2019, the city would have to lay out a plan to swap those gas-fired generating stations for new wind or solar units paired with batteries.

In the height of romance, you may put your beloved on a pedestal, a being who can do no wrong. None of us is perfect. One groom recently vowed that although his bride was not perfect, they had their differences, but he loved her imperfections.

According to Grace Dickman, a licensed clinical social worker, psychotherapist and founder of Illinois-based practice Real Therapy, in addition to the act of prepping and the visual of readiness creating calm, mise en place provides the opportunity to practice 'informal,' or everyday, mindfulness. That falls right in line with Del Lima's assertion that mise en place is also a principle of discipline and organization. All these are crucial coping skills for all types of anxiety.
If you're feeling stuck, building a professional support system is one of the best things you can do to help pull yourself out of it. So, how do you go about finding one?
I just don't care if my overhauled posting strategy gets me fewer likes and I can't keep up with those other Instagrammers. I've finally realized what matters is where I am, who I'm with, and what I can see or learn while we're there together. I don't know what's ahead of me ― where I'll be six weeks or six months from now ― but I'm sure my soul will be happier spending more time on traveling and living than Instagramming.
On Inauguration Day, speaking from the steps of the Capitol building, Trump reaffirmed those allegiances and priorities: We are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington D.C., and giving it back to you, the people.
I was so shocked to hear that E! doesn't believe in paying their female co-host the same as their male co-host, Messing said. I miss Catt Sadler. So we stand with her. And that's something that can change tomorrow. We want people to start having this conversation that women are just as valuable as men.
But the attacks on people of color, both abroad and home, look less and less like an effort to protect his supporters and more and more like a smokescreen for policies that will leave them ― along with most poor and middle-class Americans ― worse off than they were before. In a presidency that already has a reputation for dishonesty and graft, what Trump policies are doing to America's workers may be the biggest con of all.
Church members Joey Pierson and Luke Larsen held hands as they chanted and sang along Friday at the rally. The young couple that identify as gay are still in high school, but came out to support fellow gay Latter-day Saints who attend BYU.
But although the tax bill may not drag Republicans down, it appears unlikely to prove much of an asset in the midterms either — which still leaves the GOP in distinctly bad shape.
The results from the Los Angeles and Boston teams follow the Philadelphia 76ers' news earlier Thursday that three of its players tested positive for COVID-19. Several NBA teams have tested their players since the league announced it was suspending the 2019-2020 season.
the fucking jungle. N No one ever told Adam not to act effeminate. But he, like me, like most of us, learned it somehow. I never worried about my family being homophobic, he says. I used to do this thing where I would wrap a blanket around myself like a dress and dance around in the backyard. My parents thought it was cute, so they took a video and showed it to my grandparents. When they all watched the tape, I hid behind the couch because I was so ashamed. I must have been six or seven. By the time he got to high school, Adam had learned to manage his mannerisms so well that no one suspected him of being gay. But still, he says, I couldn't trust anyone because I had this thing I was holding. I had to operate in the world as a lone agent. He came out at 16, then graduated, then moved to San Francisco and started working in HIV prevention. But the feeling of distance from other people didn't go away. So he treated it, he says, with lots and lots of sex. It's our most accessible resource in the gay community. You convince yourself that if you're having sex with someone, you're having an intimate moment. That ended up being a crutch. He worked long hours. He would come home exhausted, smoke a little weed, pour a glass of red wine, then start scanning the hookup apps for someone to invite over.
Biden has already indicated his displeasure. In a speech last week, before his election victory was certified by Congress, the president-elect said he intends to speed up vaccinations by having the federal government take a stronger role to make sure that vaccines are not only available, but that shots are going into the arms of more Americans.
And so, there are still those who seem to feel that Step in the Name of Love means more than the humanity of both a famed singer like Aaliyah and the formerly nameless and faceless R. Kelly victims who have risked so much to participate in this series.
The sport's American governing body cited the disruptions the virus has caused and the stress it has added to athletes' lives — echoing a similar letter sent by USA Swimming.

Create opportunity through cold networking. Networking is a way of life, and it's crucial for you to make time for it. Learning and growing from conversations with new people in worlds outside of your own is one of the best ways to catalyze your career. While most people network with their immediate family and friends, this should only be a starting point.It's usually the people who are out there -- not the people you know -- who can change the course of your career. These are the people in the hiring roles for your dream job, or the people who are running in circles that can change your life. You don't have to sacrifice your authenticity for it, either. The more you network, the more opportunity you're creating to love the people you meet and pursue connections that are authentic.Side note: The worst time network is when you need something, so start now.

When college student Trevor Hill stood up at a CNN town hall in 2017 and asked House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) if her party might move further left to mark a starker break with right-wing economics, her answer was clear: I thank you for your question but I have to say we're capitalist. And that's just the way it is.

It's not just influencers and celebrities with Facetuned figures that Retherford sees on her feed now. It's women her size, but also smaller and larger women.

From a professional standpoint, you do consider all the variables and you think about how other people would be affected by it, Alan told Rolling Stone. I realized that this could have a great, positive impact on many people who may be country music fans and may feel like they don't fit in. But they see a guy like me on TV who is country and gay, and they recognize that there's a place for you here, and that country music is a warm, welcoming space.

Raisman seems to be referring to USA Gymnastics' most recent statement in which the organization responds to top-tier gymnast Maggie Nichols' new allegations that Nassar sexually abused her while treating a back injury. In the statement, USA Gymnastics denied that the organization covered up Nassar's abuse, and applauded Nichols for coming forward. But it says Nichols and a second athlete did not provide reasonable suspicion that sexual abuse had occurred.

But it was a very reassuring finding that at least this mutation, which was one of the ones people are most concerned about, does not seem to be a problem for the vaccine, said Pfizer chief scientific officer Dr. Philip Dormitzer.
The day after the alleged assault, Randall-Gay told police that she felt scared and uncomfortable following the second appointment.
I started sharing my experiences, not to find answers, but to find momentary peace of mind. It was scary at first -- but I am of the belief that one person's story may change someone else's and give a struggling individual or family member the strength to persevere through hard times.
You also can't zoom in to your face in the mirror the same way you can in a digital photo. (Magnifying mirrors are pretty good at putting your self-perceived imperfections on full display, but they're not quite the same.)

I am also obsessed with books. A good book makes me forget to finish my meals and get ready on time for school. This causes my parents to yell a lot. Wait, isn't reading supposed to be a good thing? A few of my favorite books from 2018 were: Neil deGrasse Tyson's Astrophysics for People in a Hurry, George Orwell's 1984 and the Game of Thrones series. I tried reading Carl Sagan's Cosmos, but the writing was dry and boring. But I also like reading books that many of my friends are reading, such as Captain Underpants, the Harry Potter series (I read all eight books in the eight weeks of summer break after first grade), The Percy Jackson series and Diary of a Wimpy Kid.

Most surveys report a margin of error that represents some but not all potential survey errors. YouGov's reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling. If these assumptions are wrong, the model-based margin of error may also be inaccurate. Click here for a more detailed explanation of the model-based margin of error.

Companies that deal in the unhealthiest of foods are targeting television advertising at black and Hispanic youths, according to a new study, even after many of those corporations pledged their commitment to promoting healthier eating.
The idea has gotten pushback in Congress, however. Some Republicans who railed against executive overreach during President Barack Obama's administration now fear that a future Democratic president could similarly declare a national emergency and fund projects without congressional approval.

I I used to get so excited when the meth was all gone. This is my friend Jeremy. When you have it, he says, you have to keep using it. When it's gone, it's like, 'Oh good, I can go back to my life now.' I would stay up all weekend and go to these sex parties and then feel like shit until Wednesday. About two years ago I switched to cocaine because I could work the next day. Jeremy is telling me this from a hospital bed, six stories above Seattle. He won't tell me the exact circumstances of the overdose, only that a stranger called an ambulance and he woke up here. Jeremy is not the friend I was expecting to have this conversation with. Until a few weeks ago, I had no idea he used anything heavier than martinis. He is trim, intelligent, gluten-free, the kind of guy who wears a work shirt no matter what day of the week it is. The first time we met, three years ago, he asked me if I knew a good place to do CrossFit. Today, when I ask him how the hospital's been so far, the first thing he says is that there's no Wi-Fi, he's way behind on work emails. The drugs were a combination of boredom and loneliness, he says. I used to come home from work exhausted on a Friday night and it's like, 'Now what?'

Still, to some, a lawmaker from a top oil-producing state like Texas nodding to a Green New Deal signals a major shift in the national debate, said Robert Kopp, a climate scientist at Rutgers University who is tracking how the policy is being discussed.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say as many as 214 million people could become infected with the novel coronavirus if we don't change our behaviour; more than one million could die during a pandemic that could last anywhere from a few months to a year.
The Sunrise Movement is working with electoral groups such as Justice Democrats and Climate Hawks Vote to identify progressive primary challengers to moderate incumbents who oppose a Green New Deal. Early polling already shows the group could make a difference. Democratic voters in New York's 4th Congressional District, a densely populated swath of suburban Long Island, said they would support a primary challenger to popular Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.) if she voted against a Green New Deal, according to survey data released last week.
AAP's loss at the time was largely attributed to public anger at Kejriwal, who, for the first two years after coming to power, was seen locked in squabbles with the Narendra Modi government, which controls the Delhi Police, and the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, who represents the Centre in Delhi. For the first half of his term, Kejriwal demanded full statehood for Delhi, and accused the Modi government for interfering with appointments of bureaucrats, targeting his ministers with baseless allegations, and not letting his government function.

One major factor is that photos generally show us the reverse of what we see in the mirror. When you take a photo of yourself using some (but not all) apps or the front-facing camera on an iPhone, the resulting image captures your face as others see it. The same is true for non-phone cameras.

Last night I was watching a documentary about the epidemic of heroin use in America, especially among white teenagers in New England. It was very depressing. I've never used heroin and I don't want to sound judgmental, but as I watched these young white teenagers inject themselves all I could think was how when you're an addict, your focus is on getting high, which makes it impossible for you to help anybody else in a meaningful way.

Fairly or not, employers are developing certain stereotypes of millennials that are reinforced by the media. But you can actually use this to your advantage. Go out of your way to demonstrate that you are willing to work your way up, stay late, and won't expect a promotion after six weeks. You can do this by discussing your values or, even better, a time when you really worked to reach a goal. - John Rood, Next Step Test Preparation

Still, like many urban population centers across the country, Atlanta has suffered for years from poor air quality, from ground-level ozone, particulate matter and smog.

Scott Stringer, an early front-runner for New York City mayor, pledged to completely phase out fossil fuels, drive private utility companies out of the nation's largest metropolis, and electrify everything in a near total embrace of climate activists' demands ahead of this year's election.
As Sanders builds momentum for another bid, several reports circulated last week detailing damaging stories from several women who supported Sanders in 2016. The women described a hyper-masculine atmosphere on the campaign trail where female staffers were belittled and sexualized, with attempts to correct the situation ignored.
The 50-seat Senate majority may not be enough to fulfill Democratic policy dreams, but it will allow President-elect Joe Biden to quickly fill his Cabinet and push through judges. It also gives hope for liberal action on coronavirus relief, health care, climate change and other key issues.

Because this boss is bad at lobbying on your team's behalf, your team might lose out on valuable funding ― and team members might not get promotions or raises they deserve, since there's usually more than one person who has a say in who gets these career rewards, Hogan said.

The new regulations came a day after the Federal Aviation Administration announced that it would be taking a zero-tolerance policy toward unruly passengers, handing out punishments including fines of up to $35,000 and possible imprisonment without issuing any warnings.
The approved coronavirus vaccines use messenger RNA, or mRNA. This technology teaches the body's cells to make a harmless piece of the spike protein found on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. That triggers an immune response that produces antibodies, protecting against COVID-19 infection.
That probably wouldn't be a major dilemma, Pollock said.
The problem with that argument is that if you go back and look at when Adam Smith was writing [in the latter half of the 18th century], nearly all economic activity globally was happening in small, local farms and workshops with the exception of a few large trading companies. When it happens at the local level, there is a lot of local accountability. So if you own a local small business and you hire workers, those are your neighbors you are hiring. If you fire workers, those are your neighbors you are firing. If you pollute a river, it's your stream; if you are donating money, it's your community that's benefiting.
The amount of information out there is dizzying. It's hard to keep track of what's known, what's a myth and what guidance we should follow. That's why we've rounded up five of the most important new things we learned about COVID-19 in December:

Or maybe for you, you struggle to appreciate your partner's wonderful qualities, including their kindness, dedication to the family, and the deep emotional support your partner offers you when you go through a tough time, and instead focus on their flaws. Maybe that they are sensitive, kind of awkward at social events and not as clean around the house as you'd like.
The impasse has meant that roughly a quarter of federal government functions are no longer funded, with agencies including the Department of Homeland Security, the Interior Department and the Internal Revenue Service largely shut down. Approximately 380,000 federal employees have been furloughed and are out of work, while another 420,000 are still working as essential personnel but are not being paid.
7. That I would feel alone. I'm sure that most pregnancies contain some sort of loneliness, but being pregnant after loss left me in a strange place. I didn't feel like I could happily join the other expectant mothers. For weeks, I watched several pregnancy announcements appear on my social media feed, yet I felt terrified to share my own. 'Un-telling' people that I was pregnant was one of the worst experiences of my life and I didn't want to subject myself to that again.
Sanders maintains that he is still considering whether he is the best person to defeat President Donald Trump.
But Democrats in the state Legislature, including Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr., say some of the money should be kept in reserve to cover the costs of CHIP, the federal health insurance program for low-income children, or Medicaid.

Giving up booze probably means giving up a lot more, like your daily habits ― [going to the] bar after work every night ― and your friends. You might have a lot of friends who you only drink with, she said. But it is important to give those up ... sometimes it can be even harder to say no to the friend who keeps asking you to join her at the bar or the Tinder date who wants to take you to happy hour.
NEW YORK (AP) — A posthumous sexual misconduct scandal involving the man who founded, in his own name, Ravi Zacharias International Ministries has placed the global Christian organization in a wrenching predicament. It faces calls from within its own ranks to change its name, pay reparations to any victims and oust some top leaders, including Zacharias family members.

Become clearer on the value you provide. Abraham Lincoln's quote about preparation applies in this situation as well: Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. Every hour spent increasing the clarity on the value you provide pays dividends in your marketing, sales, and execution. Ramp up the urgency. Urgency is created by impending crisis or compelling opportunity. Never waste a legitimate crisis, but don't create a bogus one. Most businesses can ramp up the urgency by enlisting support, reinforcing action, and ensuring accountability for behavior and performance that supports a compelling vision. Enlist others to support a cause, and they will follow. Make flawless execution the norm. Process and structure create habits, and as Aristotle taught excellence is a habit. Are your key processes optimized to provide customer value AND organizational profitability? Now is the time to review and update key processes starting with those that add value to customers. Look for something to improve, and then look for something else. Remove one barrier to excellence in the next thirty days. Follow that up with removing a barrier every thirty days for the next three months. Make the results visible to everyone. You may need to start a longer-term improvement during this period, but your goal should be demonstrating urgency for continual improvement and change. Value your employees so they will value your customers. Discuss positive contributions in every staff meeting. Make sincere, performance-focused recognition a priority.

In the run-up to the 2003 invasion, Biden tried to figure out a compromise that would narrow the scope of the war authority that Bush wanted ― while still authorizing force. It was, in many ways, a classic Biden role of trying to forge a deal between two sides. But Biden also fought against alternatives from his more liberal colleagues that would have restricted Bush even further.
Michael Perry, who is the art director of this movie and a genius and the man who did It Follows and the Sweet Valley High TV show, when I first was talking to him about it, I was just like, It's going to be super-ultra-feminine. It needs to be almost sickly sweet and very strict. It needs to be very formal because of this thing about Cassie that's quite formal and reserved. With Mike, what we said was, What if Cassie was cool-blue, but in every scene there's a pop of red? And as we move forward in the movie, it gets redder and redder and redder until we get to the climactic moments where they're red, red, red — red shoes, red house, red room. And I think all of that stuff is just so fun.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who sponsored what some saw as an early version of the Green New Deal in 2012, backs the policy and is planning to introduce legislation on it this year. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) was among the first in the Senate to endorse Ocasio-Cortez's select committee push. Long shot Richard Ojeda, a populist Democrat from West Virginia's coal country who was the first to announce a bid for president, shortly after losing a House race in November, gave the Green New Deal his full-throated support.
The indignity of spending several days' pay on adequate menstrual products, evidently, fell on deaf ears. After Salman began listing those numbers, the committee chair, state Rep. Jay Lawrence (R), interrupted her, asking her to keep [her] conversation to the bill itself, Phoenix public radio station KJZZ reported.
Two and a half decades later, the way journalists regard Kelly's conduct has shifted dramatically. Today, his marriage to Aaliyah (which was later reportedly annulled) is accurately understood to be abuse. Moreover, most journalists failed to probe a revered public figure in the 1990s and early aughts, and it's now rightly viewed as professional malpractice.
You may be pleasantly surprised at how your relationship with your money changes once you're working toward something that seems more attainable, she said.

The prime minister has said and numerous of his colleagues have said that they are seeking to build a stronger country. To do that, Manitoba is the bridge, Pallister said Monday after a 30-minute meeting with Trudeau, who is in Winnipeg for a federal cabinet retreat.
At the end of my freshman year, I had lost any feeling I had for golf.
Support for having Trudeau acknowledge Alberta as a distinct culture is likely vastly different than rewriting the constitution to give Alberta more seats in Parliament.
YouTube's community guidelines claim the Google-owned company is constantly working to keep YouTube free of spam, scams, and other deceptive practices that attempt to take advantage of the YouTube community. But the video giant declined to answer why it allows monetized videos promoting a shady gambling website on channels geared to kids and teens.

I think many destinations become repeat destinations because travelers develop an emotional attachment to these spots through amazing experiences they've had there ― often with family and friends, Nancy Schretter, managing editor of the Family Travel Network, told HuffPost. As the bond grows deeper, vacationers simply can't imagine not coming back.
Most people, when they make their New Year's resolutions, are likely to keep it to themselves. Some people will share their goal with a friend or family member. There's a strong social psychology that when we set goals in the presence of other people, there's a greater probability of following through on them rather than just making the resolutions to ourselves.
Sharif said at a news conference that a forensics lab had processed over 1,000 DNA samples linking Imran to a string of child slayings before making the arrest.
It should not have more than 100 young women publicly baring their souls about their sexual assault by Larry Nassar to finally get USAG to act, Manly said. It's important to note that 54 USAG Coaches have been credibly accused of sexually molesting little girls and boys in the last 20 years. Child molestation is a cancer in USAG and those responsible need to be completely ousted from the organization so there is nothing left of their influence.

Absolutely not. Just keep track of them. Moving them over into an individual retirement account (IRA) is going to cost you money. The way that fees work, the more money someone is managing, the lower the fees. It's like any bulk purchase.
In New York City, an electrified crowd — estimated at more than 120,000 people — stretched for some 20 blocks. Among those carrying signs was 30-year-old Nikki Vargas, an immigrant from Colombia. She told HuffPost she is horrified by the blatant xenophobia, the blatant racism, the gender biases of this president.

LET published just one post on Sicknick, the Capitol police officer who died from injuries sustained during the riot, but makes no mention of the events leading up to his death or Trump's incitement of his supporters. It refers to the mob responsible for Sicknick's death only as radicals.
Lorde's speech eloquently addresses how anger can be used to fight back against racism, how anger is a means of survival. While her speech is drawn from a profoundly personal experience of marginalization, the notion of anger as a survival tactic ― as a source of power that can be harnessed for good purpose and to great ends ― is a useful guiding principle for those who desperately seek progress in their lives and in the world around them.
Investment choices should be based on more than just your age and the number of working years you have until retirement. Many corporate 401(k)s offer you a variety of investment options based on your risk tolerance. The thinking behind most of them is that the closer you are to retirement, the more conservative your risk-taking should be. A good adviser won't just lump you into a plan based on your age, but will also consider your other non-401(k) holdings. Balance is everything.
But the issue that will be uppermost on lawmakers' minds this legislative year is how to deal with tax and budget changes.
Going through a high-conflict divorce is like living with a chronic illness. There are periods of relative calm, followed by stretches of gut-twisting agony. Flare-ups consume you and peaceful moments make you wonder when the next bomb will be tossed.

Notably, Pelosi did not face any attrition from left-wing members of her caucus. The expanded Squad of six progressives ― Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), Jamaal Bowman (N.Y.), Rashida Tlaib (Mich.), Ilhan Omar (Minn.), Cori Bush (Mo.) and Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) ― all voted for Pelosi.
The American health care system is bad. It's too expensive, it's horribly inefficient, and too many people don't have access to care. If BezosBuffettDimonCare can help, that would be a welcome miracle. The Wall Street Journal tellingly compares this initiative to Bezos' funding private space flight and Elon Musk's hyperloop project.

There's no guarantee the study will result in a workable proposal. But the impact could be huge. Of the 24 power plants in New York City, 21 burn gas, contributing to the roughly 30 percent of the city's greenhouse gas emissions that come from the utility sector, according to city data. The other three burn petroleum, an even dirtier fuel, and would likely be affected by any policy aimed at drastically shrinking fossil fuel's share of the city's electricity production.

Treble said it's entirely possible the couple will choose to spend time in Canada, the only Commonwealth country in North America, and one Meghan has expressed her appreciation for many times.
A top rate of 70 percent was active up until 1981, when President Ronald Reagan took office. The most affluent 1 percent were paying an average rate of 30.5 percent. By 1989, when Reagan left office, the top rate was reduced to 28 percent — but average tax rates for the most affluent had only slightly dropped to 27.9 percent.
Brad Lander, the progressive city councilman from Brooklyn running to succeed Stringer as comptroller, released the first major climate proposal in the race, laying out a detailed plan to complete the city's fossil fuel divestment, expand public financing for clean infrastructure and create a new auditing department to hold city agencies and companies accountable to climate goals. In western Queens, city council hopeful Tiffany Cabán made implementing a Green New Deal one of her three top priorities, while southeast Queens candidate Moumita Ahmed listed climate justice as the third plank of her platform.
The government does not claim he actually murdered the women. The convicted shooter in the case, Willis Mark Haynes, received a life sentence for the women's deaths. Higgs was prosecuted on the theory that he ordered Haynes to shoot the victims and was the ultimate mastermind behind the crime.

California Governor Projects Over Half The State, 25 Million People, Could Get Coronavirus — 3/19/20, 6:58 pm ET In a letter to President Donald Trump, California Gov. Gavin Newsom requested a U.S. Navy hospital ship be brought into port in Los Angeles to help decompress our current healthcare delivery system. Newsom noted that in some parts of the state, the rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases is doubling every four days. We project that roughly 56% of our population — 25.5 million people — will be infected with the virus over an eight week period, the Democratic governor wrote. The governor's spokesperson later clarified that this projection did not include mitigation efforts, which the state is already taking, such as establishing strict shelter-in-place policies in several major counties, including across the San Francisco Bay Area. California is among the states with the highest numbers of reported COVID-19 cases. Nearly 700 Californians have been confirmed to have the disease and more than a dozen have died, as of Thursday. — Sarah Ruiz-Grossman

No matter how hard we want to, there's one thing we can never do and that's change the past. We can weep, beat our fists against the wall, or eat bags of cookies to assuage the guilt, but it won't make the slightest bit of difference and won't make us feel any better. The past is gone, over, no more.
St. Lambertus Cathedral, a double-spired church known locally as the Immerather Dom, was destroyed by a wrecking crew despite protests from Greenpeace activists. It's the latest stage in the demolition of the entire village of Immerath ― and a sign of Germany's continued dependance on fossil fuels.

Just like we do not recommend that women avoid getting pregnant each year during flu season, we are not recommending that women do not get pregnant due to the coronavirus disease, she continued. Women who are pregnant or trying to get pregnant should take precautions to avoid getting sick, like staying away from others who are known to be ill and washing their hands frequently.
Humans--also mammals--have access to food supplies through the cold winter months so we don't need to sleep through the dark, cold, maybe dangerous winter. But to combat the possibility of Seasonal Affective Disorder, many of us still like the idea of winter hibernation--the tricky part is keeping it healthy.
Walking away gives you time to calm down and collect your thoughts before responding, Mayo told HuffPost. This also aids in decreasing anger and or de-escalating the situation. A timeout allows time for you to reflect on the actual trigger that manifested the anger, which helps with identifying the trigger to prevent it from reoccurring.

The leaders of two major police unions are also facing investigations or calls to resign after expressing statements of support for the riot.
The added risk the grocery and meatpacking workers are taking on prompted the union to push for hazard pay early on. As Perrone put it, the union didn't have a pandemic clause in our contracts.

The only way to cure a case of 'comparisonitis', is through self-love and the celebration of others.
A key reason for the activist left's emphasis on economic recovery funding is its experience with the first two years of the Obama administration. Progressives blame deficit hawks in the Obama White House for blocking economist Christina Romer from presenting Obama with an option for a stimulus package that exceeded $1 trillion ― a figure closer to the size of the hole in the economy than the roughly $800 billion bill Obama ultimately settled on.
When black people come to the defense of these men, here's what they are really saying: Black lives matter, but only certain ones, only convenient ones. Men like Kelly are worth defending, but not the black women and girls in our communities who fall prey to these men. Men like Kevin Hart deserve a second chance for their homophobia, even after doubling down and initially refusing to apologize for this homophobia, and this second chance should come at the expense of gay black people, particularly the femme gay black men and boys who Hart targeted in his tweets.
Destinations can attract you to the point that you're perusing real estate posters and wondering about how much that apartment you stayed in might rent for, said Hartshorne, adding that he visits Eagles Mere, Pennsylvania, and Edgartown, Massachusetts, year after year.
For many people, alcohol has woven itself into the fiber of their lives. Before a night out on the town, a few drinks will be a catalyst for a good time; after a particularly stressful day at work, a cold beer or glass of wine is often the go-to method of relaxation.
Without that support, there's no way I'd be able to do it, said Randall. She's particularly grateful they haven't had to put him in daycare because she needs to keep that toddlers' stew of germs out of the house to stay healthy.
What I have come to know is a profound isolation and loneliness that so many individuals experience at the end of life. That isolation is often compounded by the fear felt by those of us who are well.
Security is so tight around the door leading to the Senate Chamber that when a friend who had clearance to be in that part of the building held up her phone to take a photo of herself and her infant son with their senator, Capitol Police immediately approached her and told her that she would have to leave if she did not put her phone away.

You have to hand it to your date: He or she picked the restaurant, effusively recommended things on the menu and knew exactly what bar you should head to after dinner. It might be nice to have someone plan everything out for you for a change, but narcissists call the shots for a very particular reason, Malkin said: Open-ended plans might end with them not getting their way ― something they don't respond well to.

In other honors, veteran comic actress Sheila Hancock was made a dame, the female equivalent of a knight, in recognition of her six-decade career. Acclaimed makeup artist Pat McGrath, dubbed the most influential makeup artist in the world by Vogue, also received a damehood.
I'll say this: A lot of Black people, well everyone, are probably going to be harassed because they don't care. A lot of these lenders are not that kind. So if you ain't got it, don't break your neck trying to get it. Obviously, if your loans [are going into default], you want to work something out with them, but don't kill yourself.
The fairly steady rise in OHC [ocean heat content] shows that the planet is clearly warming, the report stated, adding that rising sea levels and temperatures should be concerning, given the abundant evidence of effects on storms, hurricanes and the hydrological cycle, including extreme precipitation events.
Certain vacation spots and destinations have such a wide range of activities that they can keep all ages and interests happy. This can make them a popular repeat travel destination ― particularly for multigenerational families, families with kids ranging from little ones to teens, or groups of friends, Schretter said. Destinations like this are often constantly adding new attractions and restaurants as well. This broad range of activities and experiences also allows vacationers to enjoy 'old favorites' but also try something new on their next visit. That way, no one gets bored.

On the theory, Redditor YeremyV told The Huffington Post, I don't consider it to be much of a stretch, considering that Fiona's father (the king) turned out to be the Frog Prince. It just seemed like Donkey was never really from a story, and it's interesting to think that maybe he is after all.

The policy isn't just about comfort and dignity; it's also about health, Nebraska Sen. Patty Pansing Brooks (D), who helped push through the policy change, told The Omaha World-Herald.
A sense of complacency in an organization can be seen and felt. Customer comments and requests are discounted or even ignored. Decisions seem to take forever. There is a prevailing attitude that says, why do something today that can be put off until tomorrow? A culture that alienates rather than connects: A vibrant culture fosters a strong connection to the organization's vision and values. It is the intangible that gives your operation an edge. Organizations suffering from a toxic culture rarely become marketplace heroes.
McGowan, an actress and activist who has accused Harvey Weinstein of raping her, criticized the awards show in an impassioned Twitter exchange with Asia Argento, another alleged Weinstein victim.
Republican challengers unseated two of those Democrats, and the remaining one, Sen. Joe Manchin (W.Va.), is expected to support Wheeler again.
If there is ever a question about whether any people should be protected from lynching, we have a problem. If there is a question about whether LGBTQ people are made in the image of the God we claim, we have a problem. Christians must recognize, particularly in the political realm, when we're failing to hold truly Christlike belief and behavior.
It went on to ask, So how many big ideas emerge from spills, crashes, failed experiments and blind stabs? Thousands of inventors reported that their idea evolved when they were working on an unrelated project -- and often when they weren't even trying to invent anything. This is why we need to know far more about the habits that transform a mistake into a breakthrough.

He cut funding for advertising for HealthCare.gov and for the groups that assist people with enrollment. He cut off a key set of payments to insurers, prompting some to raise rates and others to abandon markets altogether.

The right answer here is simple. Staffing levels need to increase, so too does guard training. This training should not simply be about protecting themselves, but also about deescalating situations. Again, personal experience has it that prison guards that are rude, cruel, or just plain old disrespectful are the ones who tend to have authority problems in the housing units and other areas of the prison. For example, an associate warden at FCI Petersburg was recently assaulted in the cafeteria after insulting an inmate. Following her insulting the inmate she was punched and had to beat off her attacker with an umbrella. Would a more effective weapon have subdued the attacker faster or more efficiently? Yes. But had the associate warden acted in a responsible and professional manner in the first place the attack itself would have been avoided entirely.

According to a poll taken around the time the Affordable Care Act was passed, 35 percent of Americans expected the legislation to hurt them personally. The tax plan faces similarly inauspicious numbers — 32 percent expect it to make things worse for them according to a recent HuffPost/YouGov poll, while 37 percent say the same in CNN's survey. According to two other polls, from Quinnipiac University and Monmouth University, between 44 and 50 percent of respondents expect their own taxes to rise.

Having established I wasn't a townie, the bartender proceeded to give me a third grade book report on Randsburg. I learned that their chief export is the same as their average annual rainfall: no dice. I also learned that Randsburg was originally a mining town in the 1800's. Gold, silver, and something used for making batteries. I don't know if the mines are still operating, but in the same way you might not ask a waiter if he's been on any great auditions lately, I took one look around at the burnt out houses that dotted the village and decided not to ask, How's business?
This week, a study that looked at outcomes for more than 5,000 women in 13 hospitals in Nigeria and Uganda found the average rate of dilation in women in spontaneous labor — and who ultimately delivered without complications — was slower than 1 centimeter an hour until they were 5 centimeters dilated. That was true whether it was their first labor or fifth.
Returning to the Maastricht Treaty and to the no bail-out rule would mean that persistent differences in living standards and market based debt restructurings would be enacted. ESM and the European Financial Stability Facility would be wound down after their current programs would end. ECB support (QE and OMT) programs would stop. This would lead to the default of Greece and its likely exit from the euro. In the long-run, asymmetric shocks and persistent income differences would be likely to force several additional countries to leave the euro.

I do my best to be supportive by giving him a chance to talk about his day if he's up to it, or just give him a bit of alone time and space to decompress if he needs it. Decision fatigue has been common as a result of caring for a lot of very unstable patients. So, simple things like doing household chores, planning dinner and ensuring there is a glass of wine in his hand when he gets home go a long way.

The concept that you need to take certain supplements to 'detox' your body is a total myth, McCoy stressed. Rather than detoxifying your bodies, these teas include ingredients that act as laxatives and diuretics, which expel water weight and solid waste. Many experience side effects such as diarrhea and abdominal cramping.
These liberals, who have sometimes been critical of Biden, are encouraging the president-elect to take advantage of what is likely to be a narrow window to enact legislation with little Republican obstruction.
Twitter's original stance on a double standard was proving to have real world disastrous consequences and they put a stop to it, Lazar told HuffPost, stressing that a normal account would never have gotten away with Trump's brazen speech, adding that Twitter's decision was better late than never.
More than 2 million people had already voted early a week out from the runoff, pointing to the intense interest and attention on the race. By contrast, in the last Senate runoff in Georgia, which was after the 2008 election, just 2.1 million voters turned out in total.
I hated my life. I hated myself. I hated going home because I knew I'd have to wake up and go to school. Guys in my class would take pictures of me and write faggot under the photo and send it to people. After school, the team would yell, steal my things or push me to the ground. Even the kids and parents in my youth group would tell me I wasn't welcome.
You've seen in recent days a very effective move by the Congressional Progressive Caucus, led by Pramila Jayapal, to obtain transformative amendments to PAYGO ― exemptions to COVID-19 and climate change-related legislation that will really liberate Congress to do the real work of the American people and enact the big structural changes that the American people understand we need to get us out of this once-in-a-century pandemic and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression
Their personal psychological view of themselves today has to be better than what it was before, he said. Because everybody has started to understand that these workers and the role that they perform in society has real value, that it is essential. Are they going to feel the same way coming out of this? It would be hard for me to say they're going to feel replaceable still.
Men will defend their fetish for Asian women as an innocent preference. I just like what I like is really code for I have sexualized my racism and bought into the stereotype of Asian women. The objectification of Asian women as exotic lotus blossoms isn't just confined to modern media depictions of Asian women saying me so horny to U.S. military men. It links to a longer, more problematic Western subjugation of Asian women that dates all the way back to the Silk Road.

Fourteen First Nations and Metis communities signed participation agreements with the company on the mine, and the project was awaiting approval from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government, which had been expected by the end of the month.
On Tuesday, the Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in the city of Baltimore's lawsuit against Shell, BP and several other oil companies demanding damages for the effects of climate change. And it's unclear whether Barrett, the newest justice on the high court's bench, will recuse herself from the case.

But there is one respect in which Trump's tenure in office has been rather ordinary: his administration's year-long effort to push familiar Republican initiatives that shift money and power towards corporations and the rich, and away from everybody else.
He also criticized Trump's tax cuts for the wealthy. During the 2019 federal election, Singh campaigned on tax hikes targeting Canada's richest people, and promised funding to low-income groups.
At her second appointment, Randall-Gay was alone. She said he massaged her back and crotch for about 20 minutes and then moved on to massage her breasts for 10 to 15 minutes. Asked whether she felt pain, Randall-Gay told him no, even though she did.

1. That I would have mixed emotions. Most of the time pregnancy is greeted with an enthusiastic, Congratulations! Of course I was excited to be pregnant but these comments carried a lot of baggage with them.
I don't think we can win in 2022 and beyond if we look the same as we did in 2018, Graham told HuffPost. I've got a decade of experience in local government, developing public policy … but in an environment where people aren't part of a political party. People with different ideas actually have to get along.
RZIM's Form 990 for 2015 reported that nearly all its revenue came from contributions and grants, which totaled $24.6 million. Zacharias' wife, Margaret, is listed as vice chairman of ministry; their eldest daughter, Sarah Davis, as executive director; and their younger daughter, Naomi Zacharias, as vice president for a grant-making division called Wellspring International.

He also believes that if Markle makes a speech, it will definitely have an effect on future weddings and receptions (much like the former Kate Middleton's gorgeous Alexander McQueen wedding dress provided gown inspiration for years to come).
Trump claimed that we're all on the same path in terms of wanting to get government open, before announcing that he has convened a group slated to meet over the weekend to determine what we're going to do about the border.
Which is why Mr. Wilner rightly concludes the mission not only lacks an understanding of basic economics or past precedent, but also in the high fixed-cost nature of railroads. It disregards that there is ample competition - both within the rail sector and among other modes of transportation - and that imposing new regulations, as forced access supporters misleadingly advocate in the name of a free market, is in fact oxymoronic.

Surely they can find an accomplished lawyer in this country that hasn't made millions going to bat for the fossil fuel industry, said Jesse Bragg, the media director at the Boston-based anti-corruption group Corporate Accountability. Experience in the energy industry is not a prerequisite for solicitor general, and there are plenty of people who have extensive careers that don't include defending oil companies.
No matter how creative you get, dogs (and you!) will get bored of staying indoors for days on end. And if all the El Nino predictions run true, we've got several weeks of storms headed our way. Another technique is to get your dog in the car for a stimulating drive and a run to the pet store. I do this with Minjay any time there's rain (i.e. about five times total since moving to the Los Angeles area over three years ago. I think we're going to be doing a lot more this winter. Thank you, Petco!) There, they can walk around freely, sniff goodies to their heart's delight, hopefully interact with other dogs, and get some treats from friendly pet store staff. If you get bored of the pet store, find other pet-friendly places you can head to, like shopping malls or bookstores, for a change of scene. I'm grateful to live in Santa Monica where most shops are dog-friendly. Make sure to support these establishments and let them know you appreciate them letting you and your dog spend time there together. Now I have one more excuse to head to the bookstore several times a week, with Minjay.

I got rid of old text messages, pictures and their clothing I still had. You don't hang on to old Band-Aids. Throw that in the trash! she said. You have to get rid of everything associated with them. It's best to get rid of their number. Or if you can't quite let go, at least change the title of their name in your phone.
As Nolan Feeney explained in a 2014 Atlantic article, seeing ourselves in reverse can be a little weird, partly because our faces aren't perfectly symmetrical. Certain features or distinctive marks don't line up in photos the same way they do in the mirror, and that can throw us off. To return to my anecdote, I rarely notice the slant in my nose when I look in the mirror, but in photos, the slant goes the opposite direction, so it's always the first thing I see.
In a significant shift, deputy leader Tom Watson told Corbyn in July that he would not stand in his way on party reform, although allies warned the leadership to focus on taking on the Tories than 'faction fighting'. Katy Clark, who is now Corbyn's political secretary, will lead the wide-ranging structural review. A senior source at grassroots group Momentum told HuffPost UK: The review is a very promising first step towards a Labour Party that is election ready and fit for the 21st century. I'm sure the 500,000 members who showed such energy, enthusiasm and dedication during the last election will welcome having more of a say, and we're glad that every wing of the party is recognising the huge contribution they make. But Richard Angell, director of Progress, Labour's centrist pressure group, said: Today, Labour's new establishment bounced the NEC in private session into a series of reforms that amount to a factional power grab and more roles for members in London and the south-east. It is a missed opportunity to not give members in every corner of the country a voice by regionalising the NEC. In a bizarre turn of events Corbyn's political secretary will be leading a review into party structures rather than working out how to beat the Tories and run the country. It is a warped set of priorities when a general election could take place at any point.

Those divides aren't necessarily set in stone. Over the course of the last week ― during which Trump announced a decision to cancel campaign rallies ― the share of Republicans who supported canceling large events rose from 55% to 70%. Although other metrics showed less change, Trump's change of tone Monday might help to reduce his supporters' skepticism about the scale of the problem.
My first thought was, 'It's about time, Spires told the Hartford Courant. I can lift my head again.
Sylvester Turner, the mayor of Houston, linked the closure on Sunday directly to the shutdown and urged travelers to venture to the airport at least two hours early to make it through screenings.
You can imagine that there might be something like the 'Cornhusker Kickback' ― or the 'Coal Miner's Kickback' in this instance, for Joe Manchin, said Shahid. (The Cornhusker Kickback was the nickname for a short-lived backroom deal that then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) cut with then-Sen. Ben Nelson (D-Neb.) in 2009 to secure Nelson's support for the Affordable Care Act.)
There's a commitment to fight against all new fossil fuel infrastructure, including references to revoking existing city permits, Beauchamp said. We've been pretty disappointed with the city's response to this so far. That's been a thing that the current administration says is a nonstarter.
Sparks: My [partner] and I moved from New York [in 2009]. I was in fashion for many years — I was with Louis Vuitton. When we moved to Richmond, we didn't know anybody here. We did like every good New Yorker does and started throwing dinner parties. That's how The Underground Kitchen started. In the eight, nine, 10 years since it's been developed, it's always celebrated chefs of color and women who don't get to play in the big restaurants.
That's what American music is all about. And generations from now, I hope it's the story that the White House will continue to tell, he added.

Fifteen team members were to arrive in Wuhan on Thursday, but two tested positive for coronavirus antibodies before leaving Singapore and were being retested there, WHO said in a statement on Twitter.
When it came to Black Lives Matter protests, no show of power and might was too much. Law enforcement did not hesitate to use force or make arrests. Most notably, the National Guard tear-gassed a mostly Black, completely peaceful gathering in Lafayette Park across from the White House for the sole purpose of allowing Trump to take a photo of himself in front of a church holding a Bible backward.
HuffPost confirmed that YouTube's algorithm has promoted Mystery Brand videos, giving them traction and potentially increasing ad revenue for both Google and the content creators. As the hosts of Marco and Alvin explained in a recent post, mystery box content helped them go viral and earn money: We were nothing before Mystery Brand. We were at 1,700 subscribers before we actually did our first Mystery Brand video, they said. Through Mystery Brand's name we have been able to grow ... and actually start doing YouTube for a living. They now have nearly 70,000 subscribers, and recently apologized for pushing a scam.

But the network probably didn't expect Debra Messing to call them on the carpet (pardon the pun) for not paying female hosts the same as their male counterparts.
Forgiveness is not just for those who have trespassed against us. We must also be willing to extend an olive branch to ourselves for our own trespasses. Let 2016 be the year that you walk in total freedom from guilt, shame and blame. Stop reliving your mistakes. Stop replaying those memories. You cannot change the past. But you can live with it and learn from it. Forgive yourself. Let it go. Move on and make it part of your life story. God has forgiven you. He loves you. End of Story. Psalm 103 tells us that God is merciful, gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy. Learn to love yourself enough to forgive and make it a daily occurrence in 2016.
Complex Men like Kelly are worth defending, but not the black women and girls in our communities who fall prey to these men.

There's no question that on major fronts, the federal government is pushing hard now to get up to speed. But in large measure the supplies will arrive on the down slope of the pandemic, putting the U.S. in a better position should the same virus strike again while landing too late for this outbreak's lethal curve.
So let's explore these tools. I asked some of the tools in the marketplace to provide information about their solutions. I also asked them if they felt their tools solved the compliance and accessibility issues? Without fail, each of these firms told me their tools allow their clients to create more accessible client experiences but they are not a shortcut to compliance. Instead, can these tools can help a website become more accessible while the organization builds accessibility into their core processes.
In 2001, Chicago Sun-Times journalist Jim DeRogatis anonymously received a tape that appeared to show Kelly having sex with an underage woman and turned the tape over to police. The year prior, he'd received an anonymous fax tipping him to the fact that the sex-crimes unit of the Chicago police had been investigating Kelly for two years.

In a message on social media, Hamilton says he's shown zero symptoms but has been isolating himself from other people ever since March 13, when the Australian Grand Prix was called off. Hamilton said that I did speak to my doctor and double checked if I needed to take a test but, the truth is there is a limited amount of tests available and there are people who need it more than I do.
Biden is more likely to take Steinbaum up on a more modest suggestion: that he use the Congressional Review Act, a law enabling passage of some regulatory changes with a simple majority, to rapidly undo the Trump administration's evisceration of Obama-era rules protecting workers and the environment.
But there is a significant downside to being an old programmer. The world is changing rapidly, and the pace is increasing. 15 years ago, I dove into C+ and became excellent at it. About four years ago, I jumped into jQuery and learned how to hook jQuery and C# together to make super fast user interfaces. I got laid off about three years ago, so I turned my back on C# and dove into WordPress. Now it's Drupal. And the pattern is that learning the new stuff is becoming increasingly difficult. I am still trying to get a WordPress plugin working that uses Local Storage and Web Workers. Debugging this complexity wears out my brain.
Trump's rally will cap a frantic and financially costly final weekend of campaigning for both parties. President-elect Joe Biden is set to campaign in Atlanta hours before Trump, while Vice President-elect Kamala Harris traveled to Georgia on Sunday afternoon. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz campaigned for Republicans in Atlanta's suburbs, and the cast of HBO's The Wire did the same for Democrats. Republicans continue to hold an advantage in a television and digital advertising war that has topped $100 million, while Democrats have continued to fund far larger field operations than the party ran during the general election.

Nor should we reflexively vilify people who loved the work of people like Louis C.K. and Tarantino. We all have problematic faves; the hardest and most vital part of changing a toxic culture is holding those faves to the same standards as artists we dislike.

All four chains indicated they are taking extra precautionary measures. These include increasing the number of times cafes are cleaned each day, restricting business-related air travel until the end of March, recommending that areas people touch frequently such as kiosks are cleaned more often, and purchasing extra essential cleaning materials that may be needed in the coming months.
And then the other thing was, it felt like [if it has a positive ending] then it is the same as every other movie. You're cheating because you want what we all want, which is for things to be OK. But they're not OK at the end of the movie, and they're not OK still. You don't want to leave that film and think, Oh, great, cool. What are we having for dinner? Because even if people find it hard to swallow or difficult to stomach or they just don't agree with it or they don't like it, I understand that. But the reason we got such a stellar cast and people like Nancy Steiner, who's our costume designer, who did Twin Peaks and The Virgin Suicides, is because those people came on board because they believed in it. They just completely understood it. I felt in my bones it was right, and so did the other people, but that's not to say that there weren't other people who passed on it because they didn't like that.
This was just a decision that I just felt like I wanted Colin to step back and breathe, Tomsula said at the time. Look at things through a different lens. Keep preparing, keep doing his thing, keep working, but just step back and take a look at things.

Faisant partie de la famille des coronavirus (comme le Sras), le virus 2019-nCoV provoque des symptômes grippaux chez les personnes contaminées, pouvant aller jusqu'à des syndromes respiratoires sévères. Il a provoqué la mort d'au moins 81 personnes et infecté plus de 2700 autres en Chine depuis son apparition fin décembre, avant de se répandre jusqu'en Europe et aux Etats-Unis.
If implemented, these changes will render the Supreme Court judgment meaningless and even dilute the original Aadhaar rules: one of the key safeguards in the current rules states that the information received from a person in an Aadhaar-enabled transaction can only be used for the specific purpose for which their Aadhaar information was sought. This information cannot be shared further.
Peacock echoed that caveat. On their own, each of the components easily fit into a well-balanced and nutrient-dense diet. However, when they all come together into a single meal, it can be a sugar overload. Looking at a couple of popular chains that sell açai bowls, they can have upward of 70 grams of sugar! With such a significant amount, it's frustrating seeing them touted as a super healthy breakfast or snack.
At the time, hospitals in the LA area were ill-prepared for the flood of COVID-19 cases on the horizon. Securing an appointment to get tested for the virus was an uphill challenge. When Haliti looked online for anecdotal first-person stories to see if her symptoms matched up, she didn't find much.

Meanwhile in Albany, the new Democratic majorities in both houses of the New York Legislature are preparing to push the Climate and Community Protection Act, a bill that would mandate 100 percent renewable energy across the state by 2050. The CCPA has repeatedly passed in the state Assembly since it was first introduced in 2016, but the previous Republican majority in the state Senate refused to hold a vote on it. Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), who now says he wants to shift the state to 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2040, declined to champion the legislation last year.
Just weeks ago, the world watched as Raisman stood in a room in front of cameras. Her clothes were on, but she was stripped down. She looked her abuser in the eye. This group of women you so heartlessly abused over such a long period of time, are now a force, and you are nothing, she said, in her own words. Millions heard her.
Lead Brexiteers Boris Johnson and Iain Duncan Smith are set to lose their Commons seats at the next election thanks to the impact of the Corbyn surge on Westminster boundary changes, a new study suggests. The review of all Parliamentary seats in the wake of the 2017 election projects that the Foreign Secretary will be ousted by Labour in the new constituency of Hillingdon and Uxbridge. Former Work and Pensions Secretary Duncan Smith is also on course to be defeated by Corbyn's party in the newly created Chingford and Woodford Green seat, according to elections analyst Martin Baxter of the Electoral Calculus website. But there is better news overall for the Tories as the boundary review would edge them closer to a majority government. One estimate suggests they would fall three seats short, compared to eight seats short now. Another points to the actually squeaking a majority.

Arana: Success is whatever you think you are at that time in your life. When I was a waiter, making $30 a day, I was the best waiter at that restaurant and I felt successful. Then, when I wanted more, I decided to go to another restaurant that was more expensive so I could become more successful. And I became one of the top waiters there. Success isn't necessary just monetary. It's a feeling.

The IMF suggests three explanations for the decline in trade regimes: the slowdown in global economic growth; the halt in trade and investment liberalisation agreements (which started long before the freezing of the Trans Pacific Partnership or the Trans Atlantic Trade and Partnership agreements); and the maturity of international production chains that would have exhausted their advantages.
As I was waiting for my husband to return with an update on the fate of the car and the rest of our holiday I felt predictably nervous because of the guilt (what if I had damaged the car?), nervous because of the unknown (what are we going to do now?), and nervous because of all the dependencies (do we need to cancel and change all our plans?)

Haar's hunch is that this model suits industries with predictable workflow and some administrative slack in the system. If you have a workplace where the workers are run ragged, and the default is you can't get through your work even in five days, I doubt this would be very effective, he says.
They think of when they had Black Lives Matter over the summer, peacefully protesting, and were tear-gassed. People are literally storming the Capitol and nothing is happening to them, Althimer told HuffPost. One of my students said, 'If 20 of us had done that, we all would have been dead.' I said, 'No, 20 of you wouldn't have even gotten that close.'
In the daytime, I attend fourth grade at a specialized gifted school called Helios in Sunnyvale. Even though I am new to the school this year, I finally feel that I have teachers and friends who understand me and don't try to change me. We sit on rocking chairs to help with our fidgetiness, and we can even go for a quick run or do jumping jacks during class if that helps us think better. They encourage us to be autonomous and accountable learners while working in groups. We don't get homework, and the subjects are taught to fit the way our brains work. We learn mostly by researching and completing complex projects, and the subjects are integrated so that we understand real-life connections between math, science, economics and humanities. The best part is that I have not been sent to the principal's office even once this semester! I even got elected to the Student Council, and my friends are so proud of me and brag to everyone that I attend college.

No. Well, I don't know, because Focus Features came on board really early, before we even started shooting. But certainly other producers definitely wanted to change the ending, absolutely. And there were some actors who found it too difficult. And that's fine. But I found the people who wanted a nice, happy ending tended to be, well, they were often men, actually. And they wanted to make it the film I was deliberately setting up to subvert, the thing I just absolutely didn't want to make. If it had been up to me, the ending would have been much, much, much darker. The original end I had was even more lacerating.
Republicans are also losing the battle for public opinion amid the partial shutdown, which is now the longest in history. Fifty-three percent of Americans surveyed said Trump and the GOP are at fault for the shutdown, while only 29 percent said Democrats are to blame, according to a Washington Post/ABC poll released Sunday.
So far, despite the claim of Trump's campaign manager that the shutdown has boosted the president's numbers, there's little publicly available data to suggest that the shutdown has been politically helpful to anyone. At best, surveys show Trump's numbers remaining more or less stagnant. Several poll aggregators, meanwhile, have found Trump's disapproval rating rising modestly in the new year, albeit remaining well within the narrow range of approval ratings seen in his presidency thus far.
Knowing that this would be visible in this shoot, and that this shoot wouldn't be airbrushed at all, was so scary, but I always think: Imagine how incredible it would've been for my younger self to come across this image, and how maybe that could've helped him not hate his body or want to change it. And that's what got me through it.

Indeed they do. Unforgettable bosses change us for the better. They see more in us than we see in ourselves, and they help us learn to see it too. They dream big and show us all the great things we can accomplish.
So individuals who have already rolled up their sleeves need to take all the usual precautions in the meantime.
To get a picture of what water planners can expect in the coming decades, the team focused on the headwaters feeding 10 major reservoirs designed to capture snowmelt from the Sierra each year. Using averages from 1985 to 2005 as a baseline, they applied nine different climate models. They assumed global greenhouse gas emissions would continue rising at present rates—that is, a business as usual scenario with no effective global deal to cut greenhouse emissions and no major technological breakthroughs.

Life in Flow is a way of thinking about how to make people's lives easier while also bringing in meaningful connective friction. Within this concept are three strands: Relationships, Behaviours, and Brain-friendly creative. We applied this way of working to a sampling campaign for belVita last year that reached 1 in 8 UK households. To grow penetration, we needed to deliver unique reach of 2.4m samples, so we needed to identify new key opportunity areas outside of large city centres which have been historically targeted. Using socio-economic and Census based data modelling, we identified locations with the greatest clustering of belVita audience types, but lower sales penetration. This allowed us to target audiences with the best sales uplift potential, along with a high propensity to buy.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had also announced that, as part of the House GOP plan for a next round of economic stimulus, he wanted to delay on tax day. McConnell's bill also included provisions to allow individuals making payments to postpone them even further, until October 15th.
You probably have an image of gifted kids as weird bookworms with no social skills. But I think of myself as any other normal, happy kid. I collect Pokémon cards and know all the dance moves in Fortnite. I have a lot of friends, and we make naughty jokes and play basketball and games. I don't always get A's on tests; my family does not believe that grades are that important. I sneak in video games when my parents aren't looking. And I get grounded for breaking rules. Actually, I am grounded right now from using the iPad. My parents lecture me all the time that I am failing something called a marshmallow test. But I think my parents are failing the patience test. Let's just say I am glad to be too old for timeouts.
Oh, and he's angry, too. But that's not where this track began. It started with a simple beat that Clark came up with while working on music in Los Angeles.

The left and Biden are probably united in the sense that bold economic relief, both on humanitarian grounds and political grounds, is going to be key for the success of the administration, a senior aide to a progressive member of Congress, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the matter, told HuffPost.
Congress badly misjudged the nature and scope of the coronavirus crisis with the CARES Act, and then took six months to assemble a fiscal Band-Aid for its mistakes.
Republican turnout was not 'suppressed,' the union wrote. To the contrary, low-propensity Republicans turned out at a higher rate than low-propensity Democrats. There just weren't enough Republicans to win.

The level of processing is high and the list of ingredients is long. A lot of additives are required to enhance the meat-like qualities of alternatives like those made by Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods (because plants can't naturally bleed, per se) and although they may not be overtly harmful, they're not helpful to the nutritional profile, either. In fact, Beyond and Impossible burgers have comparable saturated fat levels to beef: Beyond has 6 grams, Impossible 8 grams and beef 7.6 grams. Meanwhile, studies have shown a link between eating more processed foods and a higher risk of mortality for middle-aged folks, as well as higher risks for obesity and high cholesterol.
The brutal heat wave that gripped much of Australia over the weekend took a heavy toll on wildlife, with hundreds of bats in a colony in Sydney's southwest dropping dead. The report landed as a tropical storm gathers and is forecast to make landfall at cyclone strength in West Australia on Saturday.
Know them when there are words. Know them when there are no longer words. Know when we have an agenda and desperately want to fix an unfixable situation.
From today, people in the U.K. must stay at home, with few exceptions. Tens of thousands of non-essential shops are to close. Other premises being shuttered are libraries, playgrounds, outdoor gyms and places of worship. Hotels and campsites will now join pubs, cafes and restaurants in being closed to slow the disease's spread.
President Trump: We will be invoking the Defense Production Act.
Being in health care for most of my life, I've always done this anyway, as I am exposed to more infectious diseases than most people, she said. So I agree it's good practice ― maybe not necessarily stripping down in the garage, but at least getting in the habit of putting on other clothes and shoes once getting home.
And so, my wedding meant so much more to me than just a chance to celebrate the love my husband and I had nurtured over the years. It was my ticket out of the mental prison of expectations that my family had laid the foundations for, and that I had continued to build around myself – a chance to show my parents that I understood them and a way for me to make peace with myself.
Same-sex romantic behavior cannot lead to eternal marriage and is therefore not compatible with the principles included in the honor code, wrote Paul V. Johnson, commissioner of the church education system.
The best way is to try to find someone who gives advice in your best interest. That's called the fiduciary standard. When you meet with a financial planner or someone who is giving financial advice, you're going to have to ask about that. There doesn't seem to be any way around that.

Trump's comparatively low deportation numbers are no coincidence: They are a direct result of the administration's chaotic attempts to overhaul the immigration system. Each ill-planned and legally dubious move the Trump administration makes to change the enforcement system clogs up some part of the federal bureaucracy and makes it harder for the administration to achieve its stated goals.
Wuhan said it would ban non-essential vehicles from its downtown starting Sunday, further paralysing a city that has been on virtual lockdown since Thursday, with nearly all flights canceled and checkpoints blocking the main roads leading out of town.

Fighting with a child to give him insulin injections is hard, but finding delicate ways of explaining mortality to a preteen is devastating. Even as a 32-year-old who has experienced a decade of health issues, I haven't fully mastered this concept.
There is a talking donkey in author William Steig's childrens book Shrek!, meaning that the character isn't a complete anomaly in the story. The movies are inspired by the book and not a word-for-word retelling, so the characters are very different. Still, Donkey doesn't necessarily have to be from Pleasure Island.

How can I change the world if I cannot even change myself? How can I change the way I am? I always meditate on these two questions when starting a venture or supporting a cause and then pursue my task . In order to have real outward impact in other people's lives, you have to have inner transformation. That's what I believe separates the exponential leaders from the rest of the pack, Sood said.
A new year has a very special effect: it makes us feel like we have the chance to start over, to do things better this time, to make amends, even to right all the wrongs in the world.

Since Gabby's shooting, nearly 250,000 lives have been lost to gun violence, and over 800,000 Americans have been the victim of gun violence, all the time while Congress stood by and did nothing, he said. But today is a new day. Today, we have a new speaker, and today we have a new majority. And today, we're going to take decisive action.
Then came fourth grade, and the first heartbreak of my young life. I was enamored of Evan, the heartthrob of our elementary school class. When I finally garnered the courage to alert him to my true feelings -- which, in typical nine-year old fashion, I communicated secondhand through a friend -- I was astonished to learn that he had a crush on Alice. Though we remained close through adolescence, my friendship with Alice was thereafter tainted by the petty jealousies and self-doubts that plagued me as I grew from an awkward and gangly child into a self-assured woman in my own right.
The iconic Hollywood sign looks a little different in 2017.
The aim of the Republicans is to identify and appeal directly to segments of the majority that feel aggrieved or threatened by certain social trends. In the U.S., this has meant appealing to, for example, white people facing the decline of white supremacist and racist practices; men seeing their dominance lessen over women at work and at home; and religious people facing the rise of secularism or disinterest in religion.
Lose the hours spent on pointless meetings, plowing through email or (be honest) gossiping, and most people probably work in the strict sense less than they think. Almost half those in the Workforce Institute study reckoned that, if left uninterrupted, they could complete their job in less than five hours a day.
Since then, the last three decades have had top rates below 40 percent. Many have tried to change that. Sen. Bernie Sanders proposed a 54.2 percent rate for income above $10 million in his 2016 presidential campaign proposal and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton proposed 43.6 percent for earnings above $5 million.
What's more, I've gotten to the point where I'm nauseated by how fake everything I see on social media is. The very same people who claim they want to be more authentic are the same people who are posting (supposedly) candid photos that, in reality, feature shots that have been aggressively staged and took hours, if not days, to perfect. Some influencers have even gone so far as to book sessions at apartments designed specifically to serve as a stylish backdrop for their (absolutely not) carefree, nonchalant photos. Nothing about that is authentic.

Scenes of empty shelves and huge queues outside of supermarkets have dominated coverage of COVID-19 across the U.K., with restrictions placed on certain items like toilet paper. Be responsible when you shop and think of others. Buying more than you need means others may be left without and it is making life harder for frontline workers, said George Eustice, secretary of state for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs at a press conference from Downing Street on Saturday.
We underestimate the importance of physical attraction in long-term relationships. In the beginning, couples make commitments to grooming, wearing clothes that make them feel desirable and feeling good about themselves. When you start to feel like roommates, you might need to change out of your sweats and comfy clothes and get ready for an intimate night together. Take a long bath or shower, put on something that makes you feel good about yourself, and put energy into feeling sensual. Even if you are staying in for the night, put something on that makes you feel open for sex and connection, like your favorite lingerie or use a new massage oil or perfume. ― Shannon Chavez, psychologist and sex therapist

In the case of the Capitol rioters, the tacky display and subsequent documentation seems to have been the point. They even made Civil War merch emblazoned with the date, Jan. 6, 2021. They did not worry about being harmed, even as they committed a litany of obvious crimes: breaking into a federal building, threatening violence against elected officials, destroying federal property, attacking police officers and stealing mail. They viewed the Capitol police officers not as adversaries in their treasonous mission, but as friendly helpers. When rioters couldn't find Sen. Chuck Schumer's office, they asked a Capitol police officer, who tried to direct them there.
I think there's a lot of mistakes you can make with your money, and I think we all make some of them -- all of them -- at different times. And that was sort of the goal of the book: to lay out what the right way to do this to get the best outcome would be.

Other prominent former officials also criticized the ongoing attack on election results. In a brief op-ed in The Washington Post, the 10 living former defense secretaries ― half of them having served Republican presidents ― called on Pentagon officials to carry out the transition to the new administration fully, cooperatively and transparently. They also asserted that efforts to involve the U.S. armed forces in resolving election disputes would take us into dangerous, unlawful and unconstitutional territory.
The most embarrassing symptom of mine is the sudden shooting pains causing me to automatically change expressions and stop whatever I'm doing, whether I'm at work or with family.

There's something about coming back to a place you know you'll love, said Schretter. If certain vacationers had a great time at a destination, they want to return because they're confident they'll have a good time. They've discovered certain activities, restaurants and experiences they'll enjoy there. If the place continues to make them happy, they're likely to return again and again. There's also comfort, safety and less risk in familiar places, she added.

This intense fear of people concerns me. Whereas before COVID-19, I could go out with friends and keep my fear of germs under control, I honestly don't know if I'll still be able to once the social distancing guidelines have been relaxed. I don't want to fear other humans, whether they're strangers in the grocery store or people I know and love, but simply wishing the fear away isn't possible. My heart hurts to see other people as the enemy right along with the virus, but I can't seem to stop the thoughts from coming.

After a streak that lasted more than two centuries, the transfer of power in the United States has not been peaceful this time around. Until Thursday afternoon, Trump failed to concede. He didn't say he'd participate in an orderly transition of power until around 4 a.m. Thursday, hours after his supporters stormed the Capitol. He's maintained to his millions of his followers that the incoming administration is illegitimate, raising the prospect of more civil unrest in the future.

The tax cut is Trump's only major legislative accomplishment, but it wasn't supposed to be. He and his congressional partners spent more of the year focusing on health care, as they tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The effort fell short, in no small part because GOP repeal proposals looked nothing like what Trump had promised.
Drive-through sites that he promised would expedite testing were plagued with shortages and delays, such that many people with symptoms and a doctor's order were turned away.
A surge in national coverage of Warren finally turned into a polling spike as the summer came to a close.

A team of researchers analyzed rates of coral bleaching around the tropics over the past four decades, events that most often occur when seawater becomes too warm for coral to remain healthy. Scientists discovered that in the 1980s, severe coral bleaching events occurred only about once every 25 to 30 years. But, in the six years after 2010, the rate between bleachings plummeted, and mass events now occur about once every six years.

But it's not just multi-screening that hinders us. Research shows that we are often more adept at analogue tasks versus their digital counterparts. A study from Princeton University showed that we process information better when writing over typing notes, as the exercise is slower allowing students to digest and better remember the content. Another study from the University of Stavanger in Norway suggests that the recall of a story's plot after using an e-reader such as a Kindle is poorer than with traditional books. The researchers suggest that the haptic and tactile feedback of a Kindle does not provide the same support for mental reconstruction of a story as a print pocket book does. In other words, the frictionless experience of a Kindle is less memorable than the weighty and physical experience of a book.
One of my good Twitter friends, Shola Abidoye, has asked me to write a post on these islands. The idea is simple but surprisingly powerful. Happiness islands are the times when we are happiest, cut off by warm, gently lapping seas, from the worries and woes of the rest of our lives. They can happen in life now, or for sustained periods in different parts of our life - maybe you were happiest in college, or living with a friend or friends, or doing a particular job. But you can swim to your happiness island at any time if you do the right thing.

Labour MP Neil Coyle told HuffPost UK: Today's discussions have all been about navel-gazing around a party conference that risks being turned into a celebration of losing the election. The Government is at its weakest after seven years of damage to the country, and my inbox is full of resident's worries about police and crime. And some people are just determined to foster division with infighting instead. Where we are in government, in London and in Manchester, it looks like our Mayors are not even going to be speaking at conference. Yet Laura Pidcock, MP for North West Durham, tweeted her support for the changes.
You heard next that the story of the virgin birth teaches -- claims -- that the power behind all things is a person who can be known and loved. Paul emphatically accepted this claim also, yet he decided to come knowing nothing . . . except Jesus Christ and him crucified. (1 Cor. 2.2) Well, as for that old-time religion -- if it was good enough for Paul, it's good enough. Yes, Nick, there is a virgin birth story worth telling -- but its worth is measured not by assertions of what happened long ago, rather by signs of what happens in the telling now. The story tells of the unstoppable movement of God Holy Spirit to give a new song and help humans bear love to life as their high and holiest offering in the grace of God. Anyone can sing that song, give that birth.
Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) announced Wednesday that he has tested positive for COVID-19. The Republican congressman said he had developed symptoms of illness, including a high fever and headache, on Saturday. On Wednesday, he got notice he had tested positive for coronavirus. Though he has been self-quarantined for several days, he was on the floor of the House voting on Friday, where he presumably came in contact with other lawmakers.

At a ceremony led by House Democrats, Giffords helped introduce a bill that would require federal background checks for nearly all firearm transactions, including private sales. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, were among the co-sponsors on hand to dedicate the bill, H.R. 8, in honor of Giffords and other victims of the 2011 mass shooting in Tucson, Arizona.

Stafford, who has been fighting with DMV for months, decided to pay $2,987.14 in taxes on his car with 298,745 pennies. The facility's automated coin-counting machine couldn't handle the load, and employees were forced to count the 1,548 pounds of change by hand. Stafford said that he arrived at the DMV at 9 a.m. Wednesday and staff was not done counting the pennies until early Thursday morning, the BBC reports.
Veganuary has been positive for Land and Glover, as well. I think we've become much more conscious consumers. They've discovered being vegan goes beyond Oreos. We've experimented more with cooking, says Land. But we're not even part way through the 500 recipes on Veganuary.com.

The Economic Survey, tabled in the Parliament on Friday, projected India's economic growth at 6-6.5% in the forthcoming financial year (2020-21) starting April 1. The government estimated GDP will grow 5% this fiscal year (2019-20), which ends on March 31. That would be the slowest growth since the global financial crisis of 2008-09.
I tell my younger friends that no matter how I go, I wanted it reported that I drowned in moonlight, strangled by my own bra.
So I would dial out to get some meth delivered and check the Internet to see if there were any parties happening. It was either that or watch a movie by myself. Jeremy is not my only gay friend who's struggling. There's Malcolm, who barely leaves the house except for work because his anxiety is so bad. There's Jared, whose depression and body dysmorphia have steadily shrunk his social life down to me, the gym and Internet hookups. And there was Christian, the second guy I ever kissed, who killed himself at 32, two weeks after his boyfriend broke up with him. Christian went to a party store, rented a helium tank, started inhaling it, then texted his ex and told him to come over, to make sure he'd find the body. For years I've noticed the divergence between my straight friends and my gay friends. While one half of my social circle has disappeared into relationships, kids and suburbs, the other has struggled through isolation and anxiety, hard drugs and risky sex. None of this fits the narrative I have been told, the one I have told myself. Like me, Jeremy did not grow up bullied by his peers or rejected by his family. He can't remember ever being called a faggot. He was raised in a West Coast suburb by a lesbian mom. She came out to me when I was 12, he says. And told me two sentences later that she knew I was gay. I barely knew at that point.
More than 100 women have read victim impact statements during Nassar's sentencing. Many called out USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University for disregarding or failing to report warnings about Nassar's abuse.

According to Lieberman, hunter-gatherers rarely developed heart disease. Now it is the No. 1 cause of death in the U.S. We didn't need cardiologists in the Paleolithic, he said.
When COVID hit, we had just finished a big corporate event in Boston, at a super-spreader [event], where we caught COVID. The whole world started falling apart. In two weeks we lost millions of dollars worth of contracts [one in Turks and Caicos] and had to put everything on hold, including a TV production deal.
I was addicted to Instagram and got a hit of dopamine when I received a new notification. After so many wasted months, I finally knew I had to do something. I was done putting my time and energy into ― and risking my mental health for ― something as trivial as a feed full of photos.
Suri is mesmerizing. He covered 1. the presidency of George Washington, 2. the Civil War, 3. American Progressive reforms of domestic and foreign policy the early 20th century, 4.the Great Depression/ WW II/ the early Cold War, and 5. 9/11 and the subsequent War on Terror. All were powerful turning points in American history.

McGuire says she hopes her story will remind people of the power of kindness.
Kelly's off-season spent tweaking the roster—adding QB Sam Bradford, RB DeMarco Murray, LB Kiko Alonso and others; subtracting RB LeSean McCoy—came up empty. Bradford actually played better than he'll be given credit for, but the offense never fully clicked and the defense was a mess. Only the NFC East's mediocrity kept Philadelphia in the mix despite a 4–7 start.
Doug Ford is not the centre of my motivation. I try not to say his name too much … To me, he just represents an ideology that I don't think represents the best interests of Ontarians, Coteau told HuffPost.

Jayapal and Pocan demanded that CPC members receive proportional representation ― 40 percent of the seats ― on five influential committees in which they were previously underrepresented, in exchange for endorsing California Rep. Nancy Pelosi's speakership.
However, scholars who study religion in America say that many of the ideas present in the publishers' textbooks overlap with rhetoric heard from the rioters last week. Christian nationalists argue that the United States was founded as a Christian nation and has a special covenant with God, meaning that its citizens must implement a particular vision for this country or they will fall out of favor with God. The textbooks parrot these ideas, said Andrew Whitehead, associate professor of sociology and director of the Association of Religion Data Archives at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis.

Innovation and state government are two words that rarely go together, but the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) took a big risk and partnered with Patronicity, and it paid off beyond expectations. Katharine Czarnecki, who pioneered the partnership at MEDC, is thrilled, I was hoping for a 50-percent success rate, the fact that we have 97 percent is crazy.

The 2020 election offered another forceful debunking of the myth of the impoverished Trump voter. The majority of Americans making less than $50,000 a year voted for Democrat Joe Biden, according to exit poll data from December. Those earning more than $100,000 leaned toward Trump.
I was dating regularly, if you could call it that. Mostly I was sabotaging every chance at a relationship I could find. I was nostalgic for a time when you could meet someone in a bookstore, in line for a concert, at the grocery store reaching for the same apple. Texting with strangers through dating apps was fun and flirty, but until our knees brushed under the table I couldn't decide how I felt.
So far, the content of the college classes has not really been a challenge since I process information easily. I don't study much at all. I feel that my professors and classmates respect my abilities. But I have other types of challenges as a college student. Because of the asynchronous development, I do not have good time-management skills or strong note-taking skills, and sometimes I have trouble reading my own handwriting! My parents help me by typing out study notes from my textbooks, even though they might not understand the content.
Lisa Montgomery, 52, the only woman on federal death row, is scheduled to be executed on Tuesday. Her lawyers say that she should be spared the death penalty, citing her severe mental illness and history of extreme childhood trauma that contributed to the breakdown in her mental health.

Owing to its large heat capacity, the ocean accumulates the warming derived from human activities; indeed, more than 90 percent of Earth's residual heat related to global warming is absorbed by the ocean, according to the researchers. As such, the global ocean heat content record robustly represents the signature of global warming.

In his Rose Garden press conference alone, Trump lied multiple times ― about his past support for a concrete wall, about who is paying for the wall (surprise: it's U.S. taxpayers!), and about the status of a U.S-Mexico trade deal that hasn't passed Congress.
Under Trump, the state department has reduced the red tape in terms of increasing the relevance of DCS track. The gains of that were witnessed in the year after Trump took office when Americans hit their highest peak at 55.66 billion dollars because of these actions. It is a priority for the Trump administration to sell more and India emerges as a natural partner. India, after Saudi Arabia, is the largest importer for arms. Why wouldn't they want to tap into this rising economy that is increasingly going to have enough economic heft to spend as much on its defence?
West Moberly maintains it was not properly consulted, and only met with a Canadian minister once for half an hour, said Willson. BC Hydro says we have agreements in place, but they were made after the dam was already approved, and jammed down the throats (of the participating First Nations).
A single visit by scientists is unlikely to confirm the virus's origins; pinning down an outbreak's animal reservoir is typically an exhaustive endeavor that takes years of research including taking animal samples, genetic analysis and epidemiological studies.
Treder-Wolff said this type of thinking is harmful because it eliminates that essential learning phase of a new role or skill when we must be free to flail and flounder as we figure it out. Recognizing this thought as toxic is an important step, as is replacing it with new, healthy thoughts ― try: Everything worth doing requires the freedom to flail and flounder, Everything I put a good effort into will result in learning to do something better and better or Everything I put a good effort into changes my brain.
Taxpayers who do itemize can still deduct qualifying charitable donations. The deduction is limited to 60 percent of adjusted gross income for cash gifts ― up from 50 percent in previous years. Any amount in excess of that can be carried forward up to five years.

It is arbitrary and inequitable to punish Mr. Higgs more severely than the actual killer, Higgs' lawyers argued in a clemency petition to Trump, urging the outgoing president to commute their client's sentence to life without the possibility of parole. Mr. Higgs has adjusted exceptionally well to life in prison and has long been a model prisoner. His demonstrated record of positive adjustment makes him particularly well-suited to peacefully live out the remainder of his life in custody.
Some senior officers who previously protected Biden when he was vice president will be called back to the White House to again be part of the contingent assigned to him, according to the Post.

Numerous officers who were dispatched to defend the Capitol were also caught on camera shaking rioters' hands, posing with them for selfies and passively allowing them to bypass police barriers and launch their assault, which was inspired by Trump's relentless, evidence-free claims that the election was stolen from him through mass voter fraud. The cops' seemingly friendly demeanor harshly contrasts the brutal force with which American police descended upon racial justice protesters nationwide following the killing of George Floyd.
Democrats in prosecuting the case against the president point in particular to a General Accountability Office report that found the White House violated federal law by stalling money to Ukraine that had been approved by Congress.

As an American poet, she had no more than a dozen poems published during her lifetime. But her raw talent and her genius lived on. In Dickinson's case, it had nothing to do with how famous she would become - far from it. She never lived to see it. Vincent van Gogh, a failed and starved artist, died impoverished. Franz Schubert, an Austrian composer, saw but one concert of his own.

Travis Hornsby, founder of Student Loan Planner, suggests creating a refinancing ladder to maximize your savings. The way you do this is start with a payment you can afford pretty easily, say, a 10- or 15-year loan. Pay extra when you have extra, and you'll cut down the amount that you owe rapidly, Hornsby explained. After a couple of years, you can refinance again to a seven-year loan, often with the same payment but with a lower interest rate. Finally, you could refinance one more time to a five-year loan before you finish paying off the entire amount.

He acknowledged the pay boosts are pretty modest relative to the hazards ― I know it's not double time ― and the union would consider going back for more. But despite all the public sympathy for essential workers and the militancy among some of them, they are also losing some of their leverage due to the pandemic.
We'll end up where we are supposed to be, at the right time -- no shortcuts, no manipulation of routes, and no matter how many detours we are taking.

Academics at some of the UK's top universities pushing pro-Assad propaganda have been accused by parts of the Syrian community of peddling conspiracy theories and whitewashing war crimes. The Working Group on Syria, Propaganda and Media (WG) has been set up by a number of left-wing professors to examine the role of both media and propaganda and provide reliable, informed and timely analysis for journalists, publics and policymakers. Although in its infancy, the group's published material as well as public posts by its members have already drawn accusations of circulating Islamophobic tropes and wilfully ignoring the depravity of the regime. LATEST: Pro-Assad Academics Blame Criticism On Conspiracy Two of the academics in particular, Professor Tim Hayward of Edinburgh University and Professor Piers Robinson of the University of Sheffield, promote the work of a fringe group of bloggers and activists who have been accused of spreading false information about the Syrian civil war, which is now in its eighth year. As part of an ongoing series on propaganda and disinformation in the Syria conflict, HuffPost UK has analysed some of the material published by the academics, including an open letter to the Guardian newspaper. The survey reveals a number of problematic areas and false claims, and illuminates the murky world of online pro-regime activism the academics are promoting.
Unfortunately, for years, Forever 21's policy was that store purchases were only eligible for exchange or store credit toward your next purchase.

Three Members Of The Philadelphia 76ers Test Positive For COVID-19 ― 3/19/20, 6:49 p.m. ET Three members of the Philadelphia 76ers have tested positive for COVID-19. The Philadelphia 76ers, in consultation with medical experts and the NBA, received the recommendation that certain individuals from the organization, including players, coaches and specific basketball operations support staff, be tested for COVID-19. The tests were secured and processed privately, the Sixers said in a statement Thursday afternoon. Three individuals have received positive test results for COVID-19. All other test results are currently negative. The individuals, whom the Sixers declined to name, are in isolation and will be monitored by medical professionals, according to the team. The tests came after Detroit Pistons player Christian Woods tested positive for the disease. The Pistons played against the Sixers on March 11. Several NBA teams have tested their players since the league announced it was suspending the 2019-2020 season. All of this testing of players comes as diagnostic kits across the U.S. have otherwise been in short supply, with many people unable to get tested despite showing symptoms. ― Sanjana Karanth
Despite Trump's claims of voter fraud, state officials have insisted the elections ran smoothly and there was no evidence of fraud or other problems that would change the outcome. The states have certified their results as fair and valid. Of the more than 50 lawsuits the president and his allies have filed challenging election results, nearly all have been dismissed or dropped. He's also lost twice at the U.S. Supreme Court.

Christian textbooks used in thousands of schools around the country teach that President Barack Obama helped spur destructive Black Lives Matter protests, that the Democrats' choice of 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton reflected their focus on identity politics, and that President Donald Trump is the fighter Republicans want, a HuffPost analysis has found.
About half of Americans say GOP members of Congress who sought to contest the results of the presidential election bear at least some responsibility for inciting Trump's backers to storm the Capitol, although just 30% say they bear a great deal of responsibility. Three in 10 say they think those members should be either charged with sedition (15%) or removed from Congress (16%), 19% say they should face some other form of consequence, and a third that they should not face any official consequences.

After members of BOP's execution team fell ill with COVID-19, the government failed to conduct thorough contact tracing in an effort to keep the identities of those involved in the killings secret.
From March to June, like hundreds of thousands of teachers like me, I taught virtually to finish out the school year with my seventh and eighth graders. While not ideal, I made it work. Luckily, I had started using Google Classroom in January 2020 for my two English classes; adding my four literature classes was not that much of a stretch. Redoing my lesson plans and units that for 13 years worked so well in the classroom was a bit more of a challenge.
We were delivering to the projects and to the most expensive neighborhoods in town. I've lived here over 20 years and I'd never engaged with the people here like I did then. Micheal and I talked and I said, This has to be a part of what we do going forward. We can't stop doing this now. When we can we'll still do the for-profit, but we have to keep feeding this community. In this time where everyone was going for comfort food, which isn't always the healthiest thing, it was emotionally comforting. There were a lot of people who we worked with who went to food pantries. But because of the stress on those food pantries, especially early in the pandemic, and some people work two, three jobs, by the time you're in between shifts you don't have time to throw a meal together out of what you got in your food box. We found that from the soup and bread we delivered, it filled them up and they were good to go.
There are likely medical explanations why a large number of men are dying. But many of the reasons why they take the disease less seriously are behavioural — and a good number of those reasons are dangerous, according to Diana Sarosi, director of policy and campaigns for Oxfam Canada.

That's where companies often fall down, argues impact investor Michael O'Leary, who together with Warren Valdmanis co-authored the book Accountable: The Rise of Citizen Capitalism. The book argues that wooly definitions of corporate social responsibility and the voluntary nature of much corporate climate reporting have allowed companies to escape scrutiny and give the impression of acting responsibly, while in reality doing very little.
It might sound strange, but I think I believe in marriage even more because my parents got divorced. Right now, I remember a decade of my parents living as loving partners. If they hadn't ended it when they did, those good years would be overshadowed by several more decades of animosity and misery for everyone. I imagine the model of a bad marriage would have soured my ideas about the topic far more than the experience of my parents' responsible separation. When bad marriages end and good marriages are left, the overall perception of the institution improves. ― Tara Eisenhard, author of The D-Word, Divorce Through a Child's Eyes
The desire to hole up inside your home and never go out again is real, and it's intense. Running out of food starts to seem like a better option than exposing yourself to people who might be infected with the coronavirus.

The stimulations were done 180 times each.
It disturbs me that the right won't admit what happened was wrong, one person commented. Antifa showed up on busses dressed like maga, they caused the drama, another argued.

At least, in the last months of 2016 the G20 leaders' communique recognised the impact excess capacity has had on the global economy and there's now a chance of focusing on this problem.

Before trying the more challenging variations, make sure your form is spot on with basic planks (most people butcher planks without even realizing it).
Tragedies change the course of our life. They bring into the light our faults and weaknesses which would otherwise remain undetected. Like Shakespeare said in Julius Caesar in the words of Brutus, We are underlings. Everything good or bad that comes into our life is because of who we are. We attract not what we want but who we are and if we are to attract better people and circumstances, we must build those qualities in ourselves. We must become one with our ideal dreams and desires. Creator of the universe has made us in such a way that we must move on in our life or perish. All the experiences in our life good and bad come to teach us things that we must learn at the moment, apply the information and get on with what we must do. Each of us are here to perform the work of the creator. Finding your dreams and reaching your destination.
Today, the mightiest city on our planet takes on its most powerful industry — its richest, most powerful and most irresponsible industry, said Bill McKibben, the co-founder of 350.org. Science and economics and morality are on the side of this city, and so it will eventually win.

Being in that room was electrifying. It was the right person, giving the right speech, at the right time, King said. She wanted that moment to be more than women wearing black dresses of solidarity. She really did want to speak to young girls around the country. She really did want to say, 'enough already,' and I think she delivered on all of that in a very eloquent way.
The corporate tax rate is an effective tax on the people who own profitable corporations, which is to say, rich people, he said. We should raise [the tax rates] because rich people should have less wealth and power.

While attending press conferences in restricted areas in the Capitol as part of my advocacy work, I have had to provide my name in advance to be cleared to attend. I am required to go through security and provide ID to enter. Even then, I am required to have an escort until I reach my destination.

If I leave the immediate area of that room to use the bathroom or try to calm an anxious child, I will be stopped within seconds to ask where I am going.

My social life has changed in several ways since my son's diagnosis. I cannot call just any babysitter in order to attend social gatherings. My husband and I have to diligently go through our very limited list of friends and family members who aren't terrified of giving my son his insulin medication despite us holding their hands through the process. William's diagnosis means that I don't allow him to go to sleepovers unless the parent is adequately trained to attend to my son's needs.

You don't need to be a professional makeup artist to benefit from depotting, according to Shteysel. I don't know a woman out there who wouldn't love a little extra space on her counters or time in the morning. Depotting your makeup and getting it out of those clunky compacts also allows you to see all the products and shades that you have. I always say, the best thing about makeup you can see, is that you'll actually use it, she says.

A. Apply Even When They're Not Hiring
Last year, Democrats passed voting reforms in the state assembly, only to see them die in the Republican-controlled state senate. But when Democrats took control of the upper chamber in November, giving them control of both chambers of the legislature and the governor's mansion, they pledged to pass voting reform. Rich Azzopardi, a spokesman for Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), told HuffPost Friday the governor intends to sign the bills into law.
Road Scholar provides lists suggesting what we need to bring. We are told to pack these all toiletries and medications, along with a change of clothing, in our carry-on bags in case our luggage is lost. But here's my question: How do we cram all of this stuff into the airline allotment of one quart-sized baggie each for all liquids, gels, aerosols, creams, and pastes? And while we are at it, which of the things I need to sustain me fits into these categories?

According to Stafford, the employees at the DMV did not cause a fuss.
This guaranteed a large round of unnecessary layoffs for teachers, firefighters and other public servants. But it also encouraged disastrous pandemic policies. In order to boost tax revenue to balance state budgets, governors encouraged reckless reopening strategies, hoping to get money to local businesses that would make their way to state coffers. The results for state budgets were disappointing, but more importantly, they encouraged the spread of a deadly virus.
And overall, it reflects an understanding of just how far-reaching the impact of COVID-19 can be. It does not simply target the lungs; it can impact virtually all organs in the body.

I think one of the things that isn't being talked about is the potential benefit to fetuses and babies, said Linda Eckert, an obstetrician-gynecologist and infectious disease expert with UW Medicine in Washington. There's antibodies that we anticipate will cross through the cord blood, to the baby, and offer some protection. And also that it should pass through breast milk and offer protection.

Internationally, the new Bond film, No Time To Die, was pushed from April to November while Disney's Onward has underperformed at the box-office, while how much of it is due to the Coronavirus is anybody's guess. Theatres in the US are still open though there's complete shutdown in China, South Korea and Italy, some of the major markets for Hollywood films. Paramount has also pushed the release of A Quiet Place 2.

This week, Senator Mitt Romney (R-Utah) called on King to step aside and for Congress to make it very clear he has no place there. This was eight years after King ignorantly proclaimed that former President Barack Obama had a default mechanism in him that breaks down the side of race – on the side that favors the black person. Mind you, in 2012, Romney told an Iowa crowd that King needs to be your congressman again. I want him as my partner in Washington!
Congress have been loathe to interfere in the state-run election systems, a longstanding protocol. States choose their own election officials and draft their election laws. During the coronavirus pandemic many states adapted by allowing mail voting to ease health risks of voting in person. Those changes and others are now being challenged by Trump and his allies.

I believe the future of happiness rests on a whole new paradigm that embraces happiness from the inside out. This new paradigm will help us shift from a place of an individual's pursuit of happiness to one where it is a shared and collective pursuit, Sood explained. Building moral courage and effective altruism as a global society will be critical given how technology is becoming such an integral part of our lives - and in many cases - our sense of personal identity which affects our happiness, Sood added.

Au début du mois de janvier, et alors que le bruit d'une première tentative de l'Élysée de débrancher Cédric Villani se répandait dans la presse, l'entourage du candidat dissident ironisait auprès du HuffPost sur cette tentative désespérée du camp Griveaux pour faire renoncer le mathématicien. Une manière de souligner que l'onction présidentielle n'était pas vraiment un sujet chez les villanistes.

Under federal law, only licensed gun dealers must submit background checks to the FBI before a sale to ensure that the buyer is legally allowed to possess a firearm. H.R. 8 would extend that requirement to include transactions between individuals, thereby closing a loophole that has allowed many firearm sales at gun shows or facilitated online to take place without oversight. The new bill would exempt exchanges between family members and allow guns to be temporarily transferred for hunting.

Ocasio-Cortez joined the protests, adding the political star power needed to grab headlines in a competitive, fast-moving news cycle. The 29-year-old socialist darling from New York also proposed a resolution to establish a select committee on a Green New Deal in the House, providing a counteroffer to Pelosi's panel.
The province's auditor general found in 2018 that when Del Duca was transportation minister, he pressured Metrolinx to inappropriately recommend GO stations be built in Kirby and Lawrence East, even though the costs of building those stations outweighed the benefits.

Judging yourself for your emotions is like judging yourself for your body temperature. It's not in your control, said Tina Gilbertson, a Denver-based psychotherapist and the author of Constructive Wallowing: How to Beat Bad Feelings by Letting Yourself Have Them. It's common to believe we can choose our emotions, but if you think about it, that's nonsense. If we could choose our feelings, why wouldn't everyone be happy all the time?

Just as increasing anger can correspond to an increasingly loud voice, so can the opposite, Smith said. Try responding to your loud voice by gradually lowering it. This is an effective strategy to emotionally talk yourself back down.
Today, Medicaid is an entitlement program, like Medicare and Social Security, meaning that spending automatically rises to cover the costs incurred for medical care. The federal government finances more than half of Medicaid expenses, with states picking up the remaining share, which eases the fiscal burden on states, especially when the economy is poor. But states that adopt the Healthy Adult Opportunity program would give up that open-ended guarantee of federal funding.
In other words, you'll put yourself a better position to engage more of the core.

Continuing to wish that our actions or words had been different means we're really not here in the present, we're living in what-could-have-been or what-might-have-been or if-only.

But during remarks in the White House Rose Garden, Trump boasted that the meeting was productive.
Some bosses will throw their people under the bus without a second thought; great bosses pull their people from the bus's path before they're in danger. They coach, and they move obstacles out of the way, even if their people put those obstacles there in the first place. Sometimes, they clean up messes their people never even knew they made. And, if they can't stop the bus, they'll jump out in front of it and take the hit themselves.
Trump told Americans March 13 that a division of Google's parent company was coming out with a website that would let people determine online if they should get a test and, if so, swing by a nearby place to get one.

When writing the story of your life don't allow anyone else to hold the pen ... an easy to understand concept but hard to follow rule. Wouldn't you agree ... especially since so many people on a daily basis influence our decision making processes and what we do with our lives. Tale for example, the people you work with - they dress and speak a certain way and you also over time will begin to speak and dress like them. You will also probably begin engaging in activities outside of work together and eventually you become like the people you hang around most - it's call The Law of Attraction. That is why I am suggesting that we honestly make our own goals and stick to them - no matter what anyone else says and does to try and get us off track. I also recommend doing whatever it takes to make your dreams a reality and don't allow critics to dampen your light. And lastly, tell your story in a honest, humble and vulnerable way so others can know your struggles and how you overcame them to change your life like I did when I grew through pain to teach others never to give up on themselves and instill belief where it used to be nonexistent. How are you going to take control of yourself and live your journey and no one else's.

I felt overwhelmed for most part of the year and to be honest pretty miserable at times.

Such changes have happened before. Six-day weeks were routine in the U.S. and Europe until the beginning of the 20th century. Famously, Henry Ford increased productivity in 1914 by cutting down to an eight-hour day while doubling wages. Change spread thanks to pressure from the organized labor movement but also the Great Depression, when employers sought to spread scarce work around.

The pandemic revealed severe flaws in our political, economic and health system that tolerated elevated risks to front-line essential workers and extremely high financial losses to small businesses owned by people of color. The pandemic widened the racial economic gap between haves and have-nots. Government pandemic stimulus and relief dollars followed a predictable pattern of money following money, money following power, and money following whites.
For me, there are only seven common themes, and they relate to particular friends and activities. Walking and talking aloud, thinking about a particular issue, with a friend, accompanied by my dog. Playing social tennis. Alone, reading and thinking in the sun. Playing games such as Perudo, the Peruvian lie dice game, preferably outdoors at a café or in the sun. Having a picnic with friends in the sun, surrounded by natural beauty. Writing a book. And - gambling, not online, with friends, at a racetrack. What's the common denominator? The one thing common to all of these, with one exception, is that they are outdoors; and five of the seven are with friends, whom I can easily identify.

That's not political sloganeering, it's a hard fact on the mind of every single member of the government.
One afternoon, I go to the grocery store. Another family member offers to stay with Mom but is only available for an hour. My one hour away over the four days at her house. I need this break from seeing my mother struggling. My head pounds and my shoulders ache. I remind myself to breathe as the physical therapist told my mother. Afterward, I fetch my mother's checkbook to enter the purchases I made. The jagged lines forming words and numbers are unfamiliar. My mother's cursive handwriting, each word one smooth curved line, filled the letters she sent when I first left home. When did she lose the ability to write beautifully?

The defense faltered late in those defeats ... and at just about every key moment throughout the 2015 season. New York allowed 299 yards passing and 420 total yards per game, worst in the league in both categories. How much of that was on Coughlin? He deserved blame, of course, but most coaches would have been hard-pressed to generate much from the group Reese put together.
Usually, criminals want to avoid detection when committing a crime. But the violent mob that descended on the Capitol on Wednesday, leaving destruction, terror, and four of their own dead in its wake, didn't bother with Criminality 101. They waved Trump 2020 flags and wore sweatshirts emblazoned with phrases like Civil War, Camp Auschwitz and Fuck Your Feelings. They gave out their names and didn't bother with masks — not even during a raging pandemic. One Maryland man even wore his work ID badge to the insurrection. (He has since been terminated by his employer.)

Bernhardt played a key behind-the-scenes role in many regulatory rollbacks during Zinke's tenure, as Mother Jones highlighted in an October profile. Those efforts include a plan to dismantle Obama-era protections for the greater sage grouse, a move that would open up millions of acres of the declining game bird's habitat to energy and mineral development. Bernhardt is also leading a charge to revise the Endangered Species Act, one of America's bedrock conservation laws. The proposed changes would make it easier to remove recovered species from the protected list and would change how federal agencies go about designating habitat as critical to the long-term survival of species.

This may be a new role, but the mission is the same: deliver quality, in-depth journalism and engaging storytelling, she said. CBS News has an incredible legacy to build on. The public's interest today for news and information is intense, and CBS News is uniquely positioned to expand its reach.
Be careful, be vigilant, but you don't have to change your life at the moment, he said.
That is not to say the sticker should ever have been distributed.
Also, consider building in goals that can have immediate and positive results. For example, if you want to improve the quality of relationships in your life, it can start with simply showing more interest in others and taking the initiative to reach out and engage more deeply in conversations. When people respond to your actions, there's an immediate and positive outcome.
Frederick's defenders say the progressive victories under his belt should outweigh his work for Shell. He won decisions in favor of Tyson Foods workers after the meatpacking giant didn't pay them their proper wages, and against tobacco companies advertising light cigarettes as safer.

We ask that you honor your pledge to support climate liability lawsuits by selecting a Solicitor General who has demonstrated their commitment to fighting for people, not polluters, read the letter, a copy of which HuffPost obtained. That means removing David Frederick, a corporate attorney who has represented Royal Dutch Shell against climate liability lawsuits, from your consideration.
Well, now you know. In the past three and a half years, I have battled this most recent round as a successful burlesque star, and it has been devastating. To see my hair in the sink, in the drain, in the trash, in the comb was crippling. I would cry and cry, and then I would have to put on makeup and do a show. The conflict was debilitating.
The difference between the masters of relationships and the disasters is the master's focus on what they have, while the disasters focus on what is missing in their partner and overlook the good enough qualities that are there. The disasters take the qualities in their partner and themselves for granted.

It would behoove the woman to evaluate what type of oil base the CBD was in prior to using it, Gaither said.
I was too young when my parents divorced to get the concept of marriage before it was gone. My ideas about marriage, therefore, came from watching my grandparents. Their lives together seemed effortless and comfortable like a locomotive on a schedule that always made it on time. My parents' lives seemed laborious in comparison with a never-ending track change.

Obviously the past three years have not been what any of us expect, and as head coach, I accept the responsibility for those seasons, Coughlin said in a statement Monday.
At a Dec. 11 briefing on the Environmental Protection Agency's proposal to gut an Obama-era clean water rule, acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler credited Trump's leadership for a 2.7 percent reduction in CO2 emissions from 2016 and 2017.
But Newhouse said it makes little sense to worry about how things might shake out in a 2024 Republican presidential field before Trump has even left office.

Les médias d'État eux-mêmes reconnaissent qu'à l'ère des réseaux sociaux les agences gouvernementales ne peuvent cacher l'information même si elles le souhaitaient. Pour Zhong Nanshan, scientifique de renom membre de la Commission nationale de la santé, qui avait aidé à évaluer l'ampleur de l'épidémie de Sras, le pays tout entier a accru sa vigilance, a rapporté lundi la télévision d'État.

So much of that, and more, is contained in H.R. 1, [the For the People Act], which is a great piece of legislation. It doesn't contain everything I would have in there. Election Day, for example, should be a national holiday. But it would be transformative to enact that incredible piece of legislation.
She went on to specifically praise the work of scientists, medical professionals, and emergency and public sector workers, but said that everybody would need to pull together in the coming days, weeks and months.
Thune's remarks as the GOP whip in charge of rounding up votes show that Republican leadership is not putting its muscle behind Trump's demands, but allowing senators to choose their course. He noted the gravity of questioning the election outcome.
Whether you're examining selfies or photos taken by others, there's always something a bit off about your appearance in pictures.
We can sit here and rattle off men for days, and whatever age they are, they get roles like this, Henson told HuffPost ahead of the film's release. And all of my friends in the industry look amazing. Tiptop shape. They work out. And so why don't we see more of us in roles like this?
The question was on the tip of my tongue as I watched the very talented stars awkwardly rattle off jokes side-by-side Sunday evening. Maybe it was their lack of chemistry. Former Emmys host Samberg is a natural funnyman, kicked into gear by live TV king Lorne Michaels. Oh's humor is a little drier, sharper; a bit of Cristina Yang bled through her carefully timed delivery. Separately, their demeanors are fantastic. Forced together, one host always seemed to be chasing the other's lead.
At least, that last bit is what a 2016 British Journal of Medicine study found. But you can't write medical error on a death certificate, so no one's quite clear on how many die that way.
We've put billions of dollars at risk to green up the environment and we deserve respect for that, Pallister said.
Yes, we can. I hope people look around right now and see how much different this is for everyone, how it's hitting us and why. We don't have a safety net and people are dying lonely deaths because of the policies and systems we have in place. We have to do better than this. But it's also time for people who voted for Trump to look around. That man was an ego booster for them because his rhetoric essentially told them there is nothing better than being white. Now, he's letting them die.
Now American allies, including Canada, have a role to play in filling the diplomatic void opened by Trump, Heyman said.
While some celebrities have shared about their illness, many people, famous or not, who contract the coronavirus don't take that kind of team outlook. They keep their diagnosis under wraps, particularly on social media. And there are understandable reasons for choosing silence.

ERIC BARADAT/AFP via Getty Images Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos has pledged to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement 10 years early. But some remain skeptical of the online giant, which doesn't participate in a leading climate disclosure initiative and still provides services to oil and gas companies.
To get a better sense of Americans' reactions, we also asked survey respondents to describe their feelings about what happened in their own words. A sizable share of Republicans, regardless of their stated opinion about the storming of the Capitol, volunteered the evidence-free claim that the rioting was committed by Trump's opponents, not his supporters. Here's a small sample of their responses, in some cases lightly edited for grammar or brevity.
Another major benefit? You can also withdraw your principal at any time without penalty if you need to, so it's one of the more flexible types of accounts for retirement and general investing, Alden said. Keep in mind this applies to principal only and not investment earnings.
Head coach Mike McCarthy has preached offensive balance, but for much of the season, he simply couldn't find a shred of it. During Green Bay's four-game losing streak ― three of which were at the hands of non-playoff teams ― Rodgers averaged over 43 pass attempts per game and twice led the Packers in rushing, which is never a good sign. In fact, only twice all year have the Packers recorded a 100-yard rusher.

Trump became just the fourth president in a century to fail to win reelection, and his refusal to concede and continued lies that Democrats stole it from him have put off the sort of analysis that the party undertook after losing to incumbent Barack Obama in 2012. Suddenly losing the Senate as well could heighten the party's sense of urgency.

The turnaround was heralded by a crucial December thrashing of NFC West champ Seattle, when the Seahawks mustered a measly 10 points and confused Russell Wilson to the tune of a career-worst five interceptions. Then, with the division on the line at Detroit in Week 17, Capers ― despite losing three cornerbacks in the game to injury ― coerced Lions MVP candidate Matthew Stafford into several third down errant throws and a crucial pick.
Before I started college, my parents used to let me try anything I wanted as long as I showed interest and commitment. But now my parents worry that I might get overwhelmed, and they encourage me to slow down. For my first college course, they forced me to enroll in baby math (aka algebra I) because they wanted me to develop soft skills and get used to being in a college setting. It was so boring that I spent a lot of time playing video games during class. Then I convinced my parents to let me take an assessment test so that I could take harder classes. My college assessment test showed that I was ready for calculus – that's four levels above baby math! I think my parents are starting to believe that I actually do know what I'm doing.

In October, the Trump administration confirmed that it intended to rewrite Obama's rewrite of overtime rules, which would have extended overtime pay to more than 12 million workers. The Trump administration intends to scale that back, although not completely. And just last week, the Trump administration announced it was putting the brakes on new regulations for payday lenders, designed to stop them from exploiting low-wage workers by loading them up with unpayable debts.
Food marketing continues to get more buzzy and sophisticated; unfounded claims on social media go viral; and influencers earn more sway on the general populace than health professionals have.

He and his supporters are fighting the culture at large in an attempt to keep the political system from acknowledging the humanity of LGBTQ people. Those Christians essentially use their bigotry as a rock to live under, not recognizing that no matter how many times they refuse to acknowledge the existence, dignity and rights of LGBTQ people, they do exist. They don't need Christians' affirmation to suddenly make them real.

Marc Perrone, the UFCW's president, told HuffPost that the union is working hard to keep up with its members' concerns, as well as those of nonunion workers now highly interested in organizing. For many in the latter category, the pressure of recent weeks has stripped away any sense that they are paid fairly and protected adequately on the job.
Back in December, the network told HuffPost it compensates employees fairly and appropriately based on their roles, regardless of gender.
But other threads on Thee Rant tried to disconnect Trump supporters from the chaos and promoted the debunked allegation that antifa activists had posed in MAGA attire to carry out an elaborate plot against the president.
In October, she took a direct shot at Trump in her ballad Commander in Chief, which was inspired by the president's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic and disavowal of the Black Lives Matter movement ahead of the election.
Finally, the words from Thessalonians 1 5:23, kept sound and blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. have a very specific meaning, which in broad terms refers to the work we must do to become aware of our full human potential.

Even some Republicans are hopeful. Michael Steel, once a top adviser to Republican House Speaker John Boehner, a chief Obama foil along with McConnell, blamed Obama's Capitol Hill troubles on his personal approach to his fellow politicians. Conversely, Steel said, President-elect Biden is a legislator by avocation, by training, by instinct, by experience in a way that former President Obama was not.

The House and Senate approved a bill to pay all federal employees who have been missing paychecks, including those who were furloughed. But Trump still has to sign the bill. If he does, the workers would not receive any pay until the government reopens and payroll is processed.
At least in state elections, the results suggest, credible local leaders focused on local issues can prevail over the BJP's tried-and-tested tactic of religious polarisation.

A great boss is a port in a storm. They don't get rattled, even when everything is going haywire. Under immense pressure, they act like Eugene Kranz, flight director for the Apollo 13 mission. In the moments after the explosion, when death looked certain and panic seemed like the only option, Kranz kept his cool, saying, Okay, now, let's everybody keep cool. Let's solve the problem, but let's not make it any worse by guessing. In those initial moments, he had no idea how they were going to get the astronauts home, but, as he later explained, you do not pass uncertainty down to your team members. People who've worked for an unforgettable boss often look back later and marvel at their coolness under pressure. That's why, 45 years after Apollo 13, people are still talking about Eugene Kranz and his leadership during that crisis.
In statements posted to Twitter, the three Olympians shared how grateful they are to the other survivors who spoke out against Nassar.
Finally, another craze that's been alarming dietitians is going heavier than needed on protein. With keto, paleo and now the carnivore diets flourishing in a world growing more distrustful of carbs, protein has been crowned the new nutritional king. However, not all protein is created equal, which is why the FDA requires the Protein Digestibility-Corrected Amino Acid Score to be used when declaring protein claims on packaged foods, Peacock said. This can be an easy step for manufacturers to miss, making their claims misleading.

The Titans simply were not competitive, on either side of the ball—a reality that revealed itself even more clearly when they could not gain traction in a downtrodden AFC South race.

Australia confirmed its first four cases in two different cities on Saturday, and the country's chief health official said he expected more cases as Australia is a popular destination for Chinese tourists.
Purpose is the most distilled form of strategy. Once you can figure out what purpose your company is meant to serve, that should dictate the products you choose to sell, the processes you choose to create those products, with what supply chains, who you hire, the culture you choose to build, all of which should be rooted in purpose.

Other things that should be avoided include anything too glittery, like sequins or flashy metallic fabrics, or heavy cologne or perfume, as it can be quite distracting. In terms of footwear, Gottsman suggested choosing a shoe that can easily take you from a funeral home or place of worship to a burial site, where you might be walking in grass or gravel. And definitely no sneakers.

During their acceptance speeches, neither producer Graham King nor star Rami Malek directly acknowledged the significance of Mercury's identity. And in a post-show press conference, cast and crew continued to sidestep questions about the film's original director, Bryan Singer, who has a long history of inappropriate behavior, including allegations of verbal harassment and sexual abuse.
The announcement came hours after Disney Parks announced it planned to shut down Disneyland in Anaheim, California, beginning Saturday and continuing throughout the month.
Indeed, no woman should fear being harassed (or worse) for the way she presents herself. But in the world of the swimsuit issue, the answer to a very real problem ― that women, no matter how they present themselves, do have to worry about being harassed, belittled, overlooked and assaulted ― is to photograph scantily clad, mostly white, almost exclusively thin women and sell those images to hordes of straight men. The 2016 nod to body positivity was to put plus-size model Ashley Graham on one of three covers. The 2017 nod to sex positivity was a sexy photo of model Nina Agdal, wearing bikini bottoms and a very cropped tank top which read A woman doesn't have to be modest to be respected. The 2018 nod to an international reckoning is to give a woman the camera and her subjects four to 10 phrases.
Now, there is a need to formalise and institutionalise this relationship in formal agreements. A trade agreement is certainly a part of that. But what is baffling is that the trade deficit between India and the US has been narrowing in the past three years. Despite that, tensions have increased.
This is a picture of me and my family when I was 9. My parents still claim that they had no idea I was gay. They're sweet. Jeremy and I are 34. In our lifetime, the gay community has made more progress on legal and social acceptance than any other demographic group in history. As recently as my own adolescence, gay marriage was a distant aspiration, something newspapers still put in scare quotes. Now, it's been enshrined in law by the Supreme Court. Public support for gay marriage has climbed from 27 percent in 1996 to 61 percent in 2016. In pop culture, we've gone from Cruising to Queer Eye to Moonlight. Gay characters these days are so commonplace they're even allowed to have flaws. Still, even as we celebrate the scale and speed of this change, the rates of depression, loneliness and substance abuse in the gay community remain stuck in the same place they've been for decades. Gay people are now, depending on the study, between 2 and 10 times more likely than straight people to take their own lives. We're twice as likely to have a major depressive episode. And just like the last epidemic we lived through, the trauma appears to be concentrated among men. In a survey of gay men who recently arrived in New York City, three-quarters suffered from anxiety or depression, abused drugs or alcohol or were having risky sex—or some combination of the three.

That $8 billion can give overwhelmed state and local authorities the ability to hire extra staff, both for planning and for administering the shots. It would have been great to get the funding months ago, when public health experts and officials were begging for it, warning of precisely the sorts of problems plaguing the U.S. effort now. But the money will still help a lot ― especially because the pace needs to pick up a lot more.
You observed that the earliest of the writings of the New Testament, including the letters of the apostle Paul, say nothing about Jesus' birth, virgin or not. You wondered whether the birth narratives might have developed long after the Crucifixion-Resurrection experience. A lot of biblical scholarship supports your surmise. Yet the answer you got only warned that if part of the ancient Christian story were deemed a legend, the very fabric of the Christian message would come undone. Says who? No evidence was supplied.
Words have power and can do damage. I own mine and I am sorry. I respect Fox's decision to recast this role for 'The Hate U Give' as it is an important story, and it would not be appropriate for me to be involved considering the actions of my past, Lawley told Variety in a statement. I understand the impact and I have grown and learned since then. From now on I plan to use my voice for positive change.

Trump's executions, which began this past summer and are scheduled to culminate on Jan. 15, have coincided with a pandemic that has reached directly into the prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, where federal death row is located. At one point in December, the prison had at least 410 incarcerated people infected with COVID-19, more than any other Bureau of Prisons facility in the country.
Here's how it works. The model builds on the Crowdfunding concept of engaging donors online. Local community members identify a problem they see, such as a vacant lot, crumbling buildings or a poorly lit street. Citizens create a budget and project page, then send their plan of action to Patronicity for approval. And here's the twist: Patronicity partners with the State of Michigan who matches every dollar raised in the community.
Meanwhile, Trump was publicly downplaying the virus' threat, tweeting in late February: Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA... Stock Market starting to look very good to me! As of Friday, more than 200 people have died of COVID-19 in the U.S., with the rapidly increasing number of cases surpassing 15,000 across all 50 states.
The orders from Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) and Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) stress that staying at home is a stricter form of social distancing, and that if people need to go out, they must stay at least six feet away from others and not gather in groups. The orders also say residents should not go out to work unless their job is considered an essential service.
Health officials have stressed that while human-to-human transmission of the virus does take place, it's most likely in cases involving close, prolonged contact with someone who is already infected.

From there, my hair grew back. It was long, black and gorgeous! I had fun crimping it and braiding it and spraying the hell out of it so I could get the perfect bangs. You know the ones I'm talking about. But then, in 7th grade, it all happened again. This time, I was VERY self aware. I went through my formative years with just a few patches of hair and missing brows and lashes. To say it was hard is an understatement.
An unclear picture of how you provide value to your ideal customer leads to lack of clarity in vision and strategy. The result is a business that resembles the World War II pilot flying over the South Pacific who radioed, We're lost, but we're making great time. Undisciplined execution : Customers reward consistent excellence not occasional brilliance. The businesses experiencing this challenge may need to optimize their processes, increase consistency with their existing process, or both.
A highly skilled narcissist may casually mention the high-end gym that they belong to or that they only fly first-class, but it is done with such subtle sophistication that their target may not even register it as a red flag, she said. The less-skilled narcissist will openly and obnoxiously discuss their Ivy League degree, or the square footage of their new apartment.

We now spend 10 hours a day looking at a screen. That's nearly half of our lives spent living in a virtual world. The iPhone was released just 10 years ago. Our existence has been radically transformed in a relatively short space of time. While it is hard to remember life before computers, research shows that we aren't as effective on screens as we might think. We tested the effects of multi-screening on brand recall and found that when dealing with more than one device at a time, the mental strain decreases our attention and emotional response and eventually leads to cognitive collapse – which means people are looking, but they haven't the mental energy to take more in (all too familiar a feeling in the connected lives we lead.)

Meanwhile, Sanders is undergoing scrutiny for complaints that senior figures in his 2016 campaign did not appropriately deal with sexual harassment among campaign staff. Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that some former staffers wanted an opportunity to confront Sanders about the lack of attentiveness to harassment issues, as well as alleged gender pay disparities among the staff. On Thursday, Politico also revealed that Robert Becker, a former top Sanders field staffer, was accused of forcibly kissing a subordinate.
The rioters on Wednesday seemed to operate by the same philosophy.
Scientists suspect the virus that has killed more than 1.9 million people since late 2019 jumped to humans from bats or other animals, most likely in China's southwest. The ruling Communist Party, stung by complaints it allowed the disease to spread, says the virus came from abroad, possibly on imported seafood, but international scientists reject that.

Unified control of the government is extremely rare in American politics and the next nine months could be the last time they have unified control for another 10 years, said Waleed Shahid, a spokesperson for Justice Democrats, a left-wing group that has hired a political director to advance its agenda on Capitol Hill. Delivering results is much more important than bipartisan branding or anything like that.

While pointing out that there cannot be one voice that speaks for a community as diverse as Indian Muslims, and there is no one Muslim woman's voice in India, she said that future voices will no longer be the monopoly of religious men and politicians, who, more often than not, are picked by their political masters to do their bidding.
King, however, said Graham may have misinterpreted the question as would she be a good president? ― not whether she would run.
There is no European-wide polling data on a political union, but it appears that the support for the EU is diminishing in its core. In a recent survey, 40 percent of Finns wanted to leave the EU. Also, only 53 percent of Dutch are against a new referendum on the EU, which means that 47 percent are either for it or do not know their stand. For permanent income transfers, you would need to change the Maastricht Treaty and ratify it in each member country or to negotiate several bilateral agreements. There is only a very small likelihood that these would go through, for example, in Finland and in the Netherlands.

At this point, to get a severe allergic reaction to this vaccine would be less than a 1-in-a-million chance, Yancey said. And compare that to a virus that if you get it, you have a 1 in 30 chance of dying and probably a 1 in 10 chance of lingering side effects for many months.
As Japan grapples with issues such as climate change and an aging population, however, the co-op expects to face big challenges.

A group of seven House Republicans said Sunday they would not back members of their party seeking to challenge Congress' certification process of the electoral college votes on Wednesday, undercutting an unprecedented effort by some GOP lawmakers to deny President-elect Joe Biden's victory in November.
But advocates say the things Stringer could do unilaterally as mayor are some of the most promising pledges in his proposal. Ramping up enforcement of laws against lead paint in low-income housing, creating new regulations on indoor air pollution, and implementing a new fast-track process for green permitting all fall under the mayoral purview, and could dramatically improve life for New Yorkers suffering the worst exposure to toxic pollution.
As a millennial mother I've come of age feeling as if I was constantly striving toward obtaining the total package of existence---professional success and personal satisfaction. I always considered the prosperity of my sexuality and desire an interwoven assumption of adulthood. And I couldn't imagine a world where I didn't make it a priority. Before motherhood, I could only intellectually understand how and why my relationship with sex would change.

Maybe your belief that Tarantino sucked spoke in a small, niggling voice, something you pushed down because you felt embarrassed that you couldn't appreciate the auteur's work. Or maybe it was louder. Maybe you even got into arguments with your film school classmates or your boyfriend about it.
In the past, if a taxpayer's job required certain purchases in order for an employee to perform their job and the employer was unable or unwilling to reimburse the employee, those expenses were tax deductible. For example, employees could deduct mileage driven for work purposes (not commuting), uniforms, tools, union dues and more as long as they met the 2 percent rule for miscellaneous deductions.

An example of this was the reversal of yet another Obama-era rule that, for the first time, exposed banks and credit card companies to class action lawsuits by consumers who believed they were victims of fraud. The Trump administration and its allies claimed this was an effort to help consumers, because class action lawsuits merely enrich trial lawyers. But, as consumer advocates point out, fear of class action suits and their potentially big awards are precisely what it takes to keep large financial institutions in line.
German chancellor Angela Merkel has strived to be a leader on the world stage in tackling climate change. But Germany is still heavily dependent on burning coal for power. Some critics fear that phasing out coal too quickly would disrupt the country's economy and lead to major job losses.

I can't think of a single, valid reason to use a broker and many compelling reasons why you should avoid them. The most striking one is they don't have to place your interest above their own. They can -- and often do -- sell you investment products that generate the highest fees for themselves and their firm, when less expensive options are available, with higher expected returns. They don't even have to disclose this conflict of interest. You can find more information about this low standard of care brokers are legally obligated to provide here.

For instance, you might refinance a 10-year student loan to a term of seven years. It would result in higher monthly payments, but you'd pay the loan off faster and save money on interest. And if you can refinance to a lower interest rate as well, more of your money will go toward paying down the balance as fast as possible.

It sometimes seems as though being an artist gives the rest of the world a license to be insulting, if unintentionally. Can you really make a living from this? Is that a cat? Could you do that in yellow? Wouldn't it look better flipped on its side? Artists who sell directly to the public regularly face those and other questions and comments that seemingly denigrate their professionalism and their art. What's more, the same questions get asked repeatedly by different people at exhibitions and fairs, which could turn sensitive souls sarcastic and mocking, hardly a good way to engender sales.
In fact, that photogenic deep purple base that you think is all superfruit is really just a puree of other fruits, thickeners and sometimes dairy alternatives for added creaminess, with just enough powdered berry or sometimes juice concentrate to give it that dramatic hue. It's not often that it's even frozen pure açai berry, which carries an even higher cost for an exotic fruit that already requires a lot of preparation and processing for shipment.

5. Compartmentalize. Don't think about everything you have to do. Instead, focus on one thing at a time. It's much harder to feel overwhelmed this way.
Similarly, the question Can you really make a living from this? may not be 'How can anyone make a living selling this crap?' but, 'What's it like to be a professional artist?' said Gary Stretan, an artist in Spencer, Ohio. Or, the question may be more specific, leading many artists to state that they wouldn't be there if they didn't make money at it and that, otherwise, they are doing well in their careers. Perhaps, it is a vicarious longing to be artists themselves or just nosiness that leads visitors to ask about an artist's livelihood. Money questions - how artworks are priced and why one work is more expensive than another - may also be specific to the objects on display or a glimpse into the artistic process.
Once you've pinpointed what's really motivating your anger, you'll gain insight into your needs that haven't been met: Maybe you snapped at a co-worker for asking a simple question, not because you think they're incompetent, but because you're generally feeling overwhelmed with your own work.

If elected, much of what he proposed, including new spending and the establishment of public utilities, would require Stringer to marshal allies in the City Council, Albany and Washington to enact new legislation. And the executive job in a city with an economy bigger than that of most countries offers a powerful bully pulpit.

We all share the desire to try to keep fares as low as possible, he told BBC Breakfast. My job is to run the network as efficiently as possible. Meanwhile, the Department for Transport said it was investing in the biggest modernisation of our railways since the Victorian times, providing faster and better trains. This includes the first trains running though London on the Crossrail project, an entirely new Thameslink rail service and continuing work on the transformative Great North Rail Project, a spokesperson said. We keep fare prices under constant review and the price rises for this year are capped in line with inflation, with 97p out of every £1 paid going back into the railway. Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group which represents train operators, said: On average, fares will rise by less than inflation this year. For every pound paid in fares, 97p goes directly back to operating and improving services and, with more people travelling, that means more money for investment by the private and public partnership railway to build the better network Britain needs.

Most recently, in Iowa this month, Biden told voters that as soon as Bush went ahead with 'shock and awe,' and right after that ― and from the very moment he did that, right after that ― I opposed what he was doing, and spoke to him.
There are so many other kinds of sexual misconduct, the Trainwreck actress said. We've all — every woman I know, every woman in this room — we've all had these experiences. And in this current climate, it brings these things up and you go, 'God, none of that was OK.' 
Minutes after Nassar was sentenced to serve 40 to 175 years in prison on counts of criminal sexual conduct, the USOC published a letter to his victims, which included Team USA gymnasts Simone Biles, Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas and McKayla Maroney. Nassar pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting young girls under the guise of medical treatment.

I have spent most of my career working with individuals who are facing life-threatening illnesses that will lead to their death. Some would say I work with the dying. The end stage of life may last days, weeks, months or even several years. Each person is an individual. Each is living until they are not.
I recently read The New York Times article, How to Cultivate the Art of Serendipity. It noted that, A surprising number of the conveniences of modern life were invented when someone stumbled upon a discovery or capitalized on an accident . . . many blockbuster drugs of the 20th century emerged because a lab worker picked up on the wrong information.
One time, as Elsa, I was in line at Starbucks and a man came up behind me and said Do you wanna build a snowman? into my ear. He also tried (emphasis on the tried) to fix my zipper that was apparently coming down. Worth noting: This man was a police officer. Yikes.
No more copays, no more coinsurance, no more deductibles ― yes, that's right, out-of-pocket spending would basically disappear under the existing Medicare for All proposals. The only exception would be a provision in the Sanders bill that would allow some token cost-sharing to encourage use of generic drugs.
I survived a divorce in 2015 with a two-year-old and a four-year-old underfoot and an emotional minefield to wade through.
FOOD & DRINK is looking for diverse voices from all corners of the food world who can write from unique and resonant perspectives on what to eat, how to cook it, what we need to know about ingredients and nutrition, how food connects and divides us, what we can learn from the people behind the food industry and more. Topics include:
The consequences of the partial government shutdown are mounting ― for national parks, airports, food inspections, emergency preparations and a host of other services. Some 800,000 federal workers missed their first paycheck on Friday, prompting fears among many of taking on debt to pay for food, medication, rent and loans.
Democratic lawmakers recognized the inadequacy of their efforts back in the spring. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) began referring to phases of the legislative response ― CARES was Phase Three (Congress, it turns out, had actually passed two previous phases of relief so negligible as to have already been forgotten). When the next bill merely topped-up an almost instantly exhausted small business relief program, lawmakers changed Phase Four to Phase Three-and-a-Half. And when no further relief came from Washington for several more months, Pelosi stopped talking about phases.
3. Fight On: Whether you realize it or not, you are a fighter and you were born to win. You are an overcomer and more than a conqueror. But being victorious is not going to be easy. You will need to fight. So ready yourselves for battle, now. Put your war clothes on and refuse to waive the white flag. Fight for your marriage, fight for your children, fight for that business, fight for everything that is valuable to you and keep fighting until the battle is won. But choose your battles wisely. Ask God for wisdom. Some battles you will win without saying a word. Allow God to fight for you. Do your part by praying, believing and standing on the word of God. Be still and trust that He is working behind the scenes on your behalf. It is through faith and patience, that you will receive the promises of God.

She has also secured the tacit backing of the Russian government: in May of last year Russia presented a document detailing allegations that the White Helmets were terrorists. This document consisted entirely of a presentation Beeley had given at a talk in London earlier in the year.
When our father died of a heart attack, Mom soldiered on and enjoyed a full life until the pandemic. She played cards and dominos, attended minor league baseball games. During the pandemic, she still gathered with a few friends to play dominos and cooked full meals daily, from scratch, until she fell. For me, losing Dad was like jumping from a dock into cold water, a sudden immersion into grief. Seeing Mom's lack of progress and setbacks is like walking into the cold water, feet and toes numb by the time the water is waist-deep.
Nassar, 54, pleaded guilty to 10 counts of first-degree sexual misconduct in November and is awaiting sentencing. He was sentenced to 60 years in prison in December for possessing child pornography.
In its September forecast, the World Trade Organization (WTO) warned that it was worried world trade would only grow by 1.7% (in volume) in 2016. This is its lowest growth since 2009, the year of the global financial crisis, when international trade started retreating.

This story has been updated with a statement from the American Petroleum Institute.
I was always so obsessed with and obtained pristine credit to the point where it would impact my physical and emotional health. So sometimes you just gotta take a hit and deal with it later. Now isn't the time to be obsessed with that stuff. The layoffs ― this economy is screwed. If you don't have it, you don't have it. If they keep calling, that's why you have the block feature on your phone.
Especially if you've just moved to a new city, it's so easy to let the dating apps become your social life. It's harder to look for social situations where you might have to make more of an effort. I have moments when I want to feel desired and so I get on Grindr, Paul says. I upload a shirtless picture and I start getting these messages telling me I'm hot. It feels good in the moment, but nothing ever comes of it, and those messages stop coming after a few days. It feels like I'm scratching an itch, but it's scabies. It's just going to spread. The worst thing about the apps, though, and why they're relevant to the health disparity between gay and straight men, is not just that we use them a lot. It is that they are almost perfectly designed to underline our negative beliefs about ourselves. In interviews that Elder, the post-traumatic stress researcher, conducted with gay men in 2015, he found that 90 percent said they wanted a partner who was tall, young, white, muscular and masculine. For the vast majority of us who barely meet one of those criteria, much less all five, the hookup apps merely provide an efficient way to feel ugly. Paul says he's electrified waiting for rejection as soon as he opens them. John, the former consultant, is 27, 6-foot-1 and has a six-pack you can see through his wool sweater.
If you were among the many who have been anxiously awaiting the new year, how do you plan to make 2017 different? Or, perhaps 2016 was great and 2017 will be even better? But what steps have you put in place to make that happen? When the clock struck midnight, there was do over button or magic pill. It was just the start of another year. It has no influence or impact on any of the situations in your life from the previous day. In fact, if not careful, we can repeat the year we had before if we don't have a plan to act or react differently.
TSA agents have been among the federal employees forced to work without pay during the government shutdown, which became the longest in American history this weekend. Many of the TSA's workers have called in sick rather than go to work, although the agency said the effectiveness of its security screenings would not be compromised during the shutdown.
A 74% majority of Americans say they disapprove of the actions of the rioters who stormed into the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, with 18% approving. A 93% majority of Democrats disapprove, as do 56% of Republicans. Just 14% of the public, including 27% of Republicans, say they felt that the Trump supporters storming the Capitol represented people like them.
It's common to feel desperate, so take advantage of your low and do something drastic to make a change in your life. If we get too comfortable or complacent, life becomes stagnant. Be curious about where your life could lead if you pursued your idea. Often times, hitting rock bottom is a sign to do something differently and have to courage to do it. Your desire must outweigh excuses and if you're in the position of rock bottom, than your excuses are less. Daniel often likes to think If the WHY is strong enough, the HOW becomes easy.
There's already polling on potential Democratic candidates. Elizabeth Warren announced the formation of an exploratory committee for the presidency in a fiery, graph-laden video. A sour if somewhat half-hearted factional dispute has already begun between those who have pledged their allegiance to Beto O'Rourke and those who are ready to tender fealty to Bernie Sanders. Joe Biden keeps making irascible, avuncular statements about his own credentials, which he deems impeccable.

The work seems to have come at a steep cost already. The union is still gathering data on infections and deaths among its membership, but Perrone said that around 30 people appear to have died since the pandemic began. In some cases, he cautioned, a COVID-19 diagnosis has not been confirmed yet.
If a few students at a good school managed somehow to get their loans forgiven, taxpayers, not the school, would be on the hook for the money. Recoupment is in the Department's discretion.

By 1987, Zirinsky was promoted to senior producer on CBS Evening News with Dan Rather and went on to serve in a series of production and reporting roles in the following years, covering China's Tiananmen Square uprising, the 1989 U.S. invasion of Panama, and Operation Desert Storm, among other major stories.
As far as Costa Rica's particular challenges are concerned, Quiros reckons they're rather typical for a nation in transition.

For the third day in a row, marijuana is legally available for both purchase and consumption in California, for purely recreational purposes, to any adult age 21 or older. Also, for the third day in a row: the sky did not fall, the sun still rose in the east, and people are not rioting in the streets. Astonishingly, it turned out to be only an acorn that beaned Chicken Little, and none of the dire hellscapes predicted ― for almost a century ― by the government, the Puritans, and the likes of Nancy Reagan has yet come to pass. It's just another day, in fact, little different from all the tens of thousands of days when marijuana was prohibited.
Following two petitions that urged food delivery services to slash commissions, DoorDash has cut commissions on pick-up orders and cut delivery fees, while UberEats and Menulog announced stimulus packages on Wednesday.
But a catastrophic epidemic is unlikely to dissuade Republicans who have been clamoring to substantially curtail Medicaid. The GOP's failed Obamacare replacement bill in 2017 included a similar block grants proposal and the party has been trying to impose one since the 1980s, when President Ronald Reagan backed a version of the policy.

And Sanders benefited from an organized labor movement in Nevada that, as in much of the rest of the country, is fiercely divided when it comes to Sanders' signature policy of Medicare for All. The state's largest local teachers union, the Clark County Education Association, endorsed Sanders in part because the union has struggled to protect its health care benefits and is less wary of a transition to a single government plan. Nevada's SEIU Local 1107, which unlike CCEA did not endorse in the race, also condemned the Culinary Union's critical treatment of Medicare for All, arguing that pitting union health care plans against Medicare for All created a false choice.

There is a long tradition in English of using plural pronouns (such as 'they,' 'their,' or 'them') for a singular character, rather than ascribing gender in a seemingly indeterminate fashion, the site notes. The habit of always using 'he,' 'him,' or 'his' began to be strongly advocated for after 18th century grammarians decided that indefinite pronouns should be singular.

You asked whether the Resurrection must be taken literally. In no uncertain terms, you were told it must. Yet the dialogue did not really probe what you called the Easter stories' fuzzy account of Jesus' bodily presence. In fact, all but one of the Resurrection stories include the detail that the evidence of witness by sight was weak or faulty or irrelevant. This gospel chorus comes on forte. In each story, what brings witnesses to new life in Christ is hearing their Lord. Not seeing. Even years after the Crucifixion-Resurrection, the apostle Paul's experience of meeting the Christ first blinds him. Only then does he hear himself addressed. Paul would one day write, Faith comes through what is heard. (Romans 10: 17)

Following the public outrage that followed these allegations last week, the police released a video, denying all the accusations levelled against it in Jafar's case.
Our country's founding document ― the first time we put on paper what our country and our government should be ― spells this out in no uncertain terms. Governments simply cannot legitimately attempt to take away from anyone the right to live your life, the right to be free, and the right to pursue happiness in any way you choose which does not harm others. Period. Any government which attempts to take away such rights is, by definition, tyrannical and illegitimate, because these rights are guaranteed to all at birth and you can never be separated from them for any reason. If further proof is needed, please look up the dictionary definition of unalienable. In fact, it wouldn't surprise me in the least to see bumperstickers begin to appear which warn politicians I smoke marijuana ― and I vote. The People have spoken, by the direct democracy of a ballot initiative, and it is now impossible to ignore their will.

As such, I don't think I deserve any credit or props. I'm just a Black woman, a Chicago native and a mother doing what I'd want anyone to do if they had the opportunity: standing up for Black girls and for all survivors. Being an R.

The result is that you could be at risk of transmission when you're dining out. As HuffPost reporter Emily Peck noted in a recent piece on this topic, this isn't a coronavirus problem; it's a policy problem.
How Aggressively Should Government Control Prices?
If the pandemic does any good at all, it will be to stimulate public demand for a food system that addresses these problems and puts health and public welfare first. Let's hope the new administration takes on this challenge and gets busy creating a food system that ends food insecurity, prevents diet-related chronic disease, protects against COVID-19, and while we are at it, produces less waste and environmental damage.
Is there an idea that you've always wanted to pursue or an adventure to embark on?
I can't overstate as an operative how hard it is to scale up a field program of this size in such a condensed time period, Roberts said.
There is a straight line from the violence that took down the Reconstruction era movement to the invasion of the Capitol last week, Darity said.
With Biden set to be inaugurated Jan. 20, Trump is intensifying efforts to prevent the traditional transfer of power, ripping the party apart.
The reality is that a valuation is typically performed because someone else will tell you that you need to have a valuation performed. It's usually in order for you to complete some other task -- the 'real objective' if you will. Here are just some of the reasons that might trigger the need for a business valuation:
Alberta's Minister of Culture Leela Aheer denounced the image on Twitter, calling it, completely deplorable, unacceptable and degrading. This is not what our province stands for. Whoever is responsible should be ashamed and apologize immediately. I stand with Albertans against this horrendous image.
That is not the way we should be moving that product, he said, noting that much of the U.S. Midwest has a similar problem. We're cramping our rail capacity — capacity that we need if we're going to be producing and exporting other goods that should be on rail.
Varma, who married a Hindu man in 1993, was born into a Shia Muslim family from Lucknow, a mostly peaceful city where she spent her formative years. Lucknow remained calm even as the demolition of the Babri Masjid on 6 December, 1992, triggered the worst communal riots since the Partition in 1947.

Just because something is labeled organic, natural or gluten-free doesn't make it the healthier choice by default. All-natural doesn't legally mean anything; food manufacturers and purveyors can slap those words on anything and call it a good day in marketing. This term is not regulated by the FDA, which means there are no repercussions to calling food made with artificial ingredients, chemical sweeteners, preservatives, or anything else, natural.
Granted, it's all by doing very normal things like signing autographs for fans, celebrating Christmas with the royal family and showing some occasional PDA with the prince. But now, the former actress wants to change the way the royal family does weddings.

Advocates, meanwhile, upped the ante. Groups such as New York Communities for Change and the local chapters of Democratic Socialists of America and the Green New Deal-crusading Sunrise Movement started demanding the government replace Consolidated Edison and National Grid, the investor-owned utilities that currently deliver the city's electricity and heating gas, with government-run alternatives. And activists stepped up fights against new gas pipelines into the city, including one currently under construction in North Brooklyn.

But for individual health? Not so much.

The death toll in Italy has leapt by 627 to 4,032, an increase of 18.4% — by far the largest daily rise in absolute terms since coronavirus emerged a month ago. On Thursday, Italy overtook China as the country to register the most deaths from the highly contagious virus. Until Friday, Italy had never recorded more than 475 deaths in a single day, while China, where the contagion has slowed sharply, has never reported more than 150. However, HuffPost Italy reports (in Italian) that of those originally infected nationwide, 5,129 had fully recovered on Friday compared to 4,440 the day before.
Unsurprisingly, he found work-life balance improved, with surveys of 120 workers before and after the trial identifying more time spent with families, playing sports and studying.

Oh sees the role as really to be there to support all the nominees and those who take that platform to say whatever they want, she said. I don't really think that [getting political] is for the hosts necessarily. You make it an open and safe place for whoever wants to use that platform to speak.
A possible focus for investigators is the Wuhan Institute of Virology in the city where the outbreak first emerged. One of China's top virus research labs, it built an archive of genetic information about bat coronaviruses after the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.
One piece of advice I've been repeating on a regular basis to people who are concerned is, 'What are you doing right now to manage your risk from regular flu?' said Don Schaffner, extension specialist in food science and distinguished professor at Rutgers University. Many of the current recommendations for avoiding transmission of COVID-19 are similar.
The Congress came out against the sudden abrogation of J&K's special status, which some legal experts say was unconstitutional.
That's one I get a lot... Give me a rough idea -- back of the envelope.
In the coming weeks, Trump is expected to renominate his court picks who weren't confirmed in the last Congress and who he thinks can still get confirmed. There's a handful of particularly egregious nominees to watch out for: District court nominee Thomas Farr is the architect of North Carolina's voter suppression law. District court nominee Matthew Kacsmaryk questioned the legality of state bans on conversion therapy for LGBTQ kids. Circuit court nominee Eric Miller is fiercely opposed by Native American groups over his record of challenging tribal sovereignty and federal recognition of tribal existence.
Also Tuesday, the House Democratic managers overseeing the impeachment case asked Cipollone, the president's lead lawyer at the trial, to disclose any first-hand knowledge he has of the charges against Trump. They said evidence gathered so far indicates that Cipollone is a material witness to the allegations at hand.

The SECC's decade-long mutation, from a foundational census to ostensibly efficiently deliver benefits to the poor into an mass-surveillance system, reveals how the Indian government is rapidly building surveillance infrastructure under the guise of poverty alleviation and how organisations like the World Bank are happy to offer advice to developing countries building intrusive systems that may not pass muster in places like Europe.

The trade deficit between India and the US is less than a tenth of the trade deficit that the US has with China. And still, tensions have increased. It gives you a sense that American apprehensions on this matter, on trade with India, go beyond mere consideration on trade imbalances. It's about duties. From an American point of view, it's about gaining fair access into the Indian market.

We need more data to confirm this is the case, but there's enough evidence to suggest the strain infects people more efficiently, according to Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security and an infectious disease expert. It doesn't appear to be any deadlier or more severe than the previous strains.
But now that community spread is occurring across the country, it's incredibly easy to catch the coronavirus, even if you're trying to be as safe and hygienic as possible.
Youth group leaders didn't talk to me, and I never told my parents what was going on because I was completely mortified. My family life was good, but the thought of telling my mom and dad that I was being bullied made me feel horrible. I was totally alone in this struggle, and I had no idea what to do. I wanted them to know as little as possible of my situation because I was so embarrassed.

The pushback highlights the legal challenges in prosecuting Shell, a globe-spanning corporate empire valued at nearly $140 billion, for planetary harm on a scale that few, if any, lawmakers could have imagined when writing the environmental statutes currently on the books. Two of the biggest cases against rival Exxon Mobil, for example, take a narrower approach, arguing that the company violated state laws in New York and Massachusetts by not disclosing relevant information to investors and making deceptive advertising claims about the safety of burning fossil fuels.

In retrospect, support for the Affordable Care Act when it was newly enacted looks downright robust. When President Barack Obama's health care law passed in March 2010, it faced similar levels of opposition, but considerably higher levels of favor: On average, about 42 percent of Americans supported it. Yet even those comparatively rosy numbers were enough to leave Democrats ducking furious constituents and, according to some research, helped doom the party to a historic midterm election defeat later that year.

I'm currently married, and I was married once before this. When I married my first wife, it completely changed the dynamic of our relationship, to the point where the act of getting married seemed to make it clear we weren't right for each other. When I got married for the second time, it definitely felt more like the ideal progression of our relationship. We became stronger as a couple as a result. - Chris, married five years
The trouble began when I realized just how many travel influencers there were and that each was constantly posting incredible shots that racked up thousands of likes.

As we become more attuned to and aware of the need for on-going monitoring of the well-being of the relationship by taking the temperature of the balance continuum, we begin to make more frequent but also more subtle and minimally invasive micro-corrections to the system, rather than the larger and more invasive macro-adjustments that are required when the system has become destabilized.
A few years ago, I started hearing about tools that could produce an accessibility overlay on a website to ensure access for all. I was skeptical and worried that some technologists and corporations might use these tools as a shortcut and not build accessibility into the DNA of their products, sites, tools, and services. My fears were actually realized in a few cases when a few corporations adopted tools that claimed they would make their website accessible and then later learned the websites were not accessible despite the tool.

The Green New Deal is a unifying political message that gets back to the basics of creating an economy that works for all people and protects the planet as a result. In fact, a recent poll by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and George Mason University showed that a staggering 93 percent of Democrats and 64 percent of Republicans agree with the basic components of the Green New Deal (our own poll data from earlier this year echoed those findings, showing the American public's overwhelming preference for renewables over fossil fuels). The only other thing that gets such a high level of bipartisan agreement is that Democrats and Republicans can't agree on basic facts.

In a full political union, there would be concentration of economic policy decision making and it would require major structural changes in the Eurozone and its member countries. Tax and social policies would be unified, labor unions would be dismantled or unified as a European-wide system, a European debt relief system and banking union would be set up. These would ensure the flexibility of wages, prices and labor agreements and guarantee convergence of competitiveness and living standards. This could work, in theory. But, the likelihood of getting all the member states to agree that their wages, debt and living conditions would be negotiated at the European level is extremely small.

A survey of 300 likely Democratic primary voters in New York's 4th Congressional District described a Green New Deal as a plan to invest trillions of dollars into the development and distribution of green energy, creating millions of new high-wage jobs while preventing catastrophic climate change. The survey then told participants that Rice does not currently support a Green New Deal, and asked, How does this information impact your vote in the 2020 Democratic primary for Congress?

I wish now that I had sat with her and asked her what she meant. Spoken to her directly. What would have happened if I had asked how I could be helpful? What would have happened if I had told her I didn't know what to say? What would have happened if I had just listened?
U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned the public to avoid visiting their mothers as the country celebrates Mothering Sunday.

Giving Big Tax Breaks For The Wealthy
On a frigid evening last weekend, an Indiana woman gave her own winter clothes and shoes to a homeless person she saw on the street. In the end, however, the woman says she's the one who ended up receiving the greater gift -- in the form of two wet and worn boots.
In theory, a dynamic database that helpfully points out everyone who needs government assistance sounds like a great idea. But the only way to do so in practice is by continuously monitoring the economic and social lives of every citizen — something that experts with the best intentions did not realise at the time. Over three years, every additional suggestion has only made the Social Registry more and more intrusive.
As plant-based becomes an even more popular term, margarine ― or something like it, as margarine is allowed to have small amounts of dairy ― has been making a comeback. Mass-market brands like Country Crock and Land O'Lakes have joined the fray with their versions of vegan butter in addition to those made by burgeoning brands such as Miyoko's and Forager Project and alternative mainstays like Earth Balance and its sister brand Smart Balance. But is it butter, when the very definition of butter means it must legally be made with a minimum of 80% milkfat, as defined by the Butter Act of 1886? The answer is a firm no on that count, making plant-based butter not necessarily a health halo, but a marketing lie for sure.
This year, following the BJP's huge victory in the parliamentary election, even as the Modi government revoked Jammu and Kashmir's special constitutional status and the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Hindu parties in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title dispute case, the party lost Maharashtra and Jharkhand and failed to get a majority in Haryana.

That doesn't have to become the argument to give it up and say all is lost and it's back to point zero. It's okay, go back to what was working before, re-commit yourself to your goal. That all-or-nothing mindset is often the Achilles' heel of making a resolution or setting a goal.
A Nexsey video that's been circulating via Viral Thread (credit: Glamzilla) features women who happily stick this tape to the back of their neck. This particular video is laced with phrases such as:

I said yes to the fear of being on this stage tonight because I wanted to be here to look out into this audience and witness this moment of change, co-host Sandra Oh said at the end of her opening monologue with Andy Samberg. I'm not fooling myself. Next year could be different. It probably will be. But right now, this moment is real. Trust me, it is real. Because I see you, and I see you. All of these faces of change. And now, so will everyone else.
On the most romantic day of your lives, remember your love is as much the light, in both of you, as it is the flame that brings you together. Your light never goes out.
As The Atlantic noted, the new warehouse case is the realization of a major threat to Amazon's operations. Millions of people across the nation are cloistered inside their homes, many of them relying on the company to provide basic goods. Amazon is already struggling to meet demand, and some employees feel they're being unfairly endangered by working in warehouses filled with other workers.
Both Republicans and Democrats also said they believe the move would likely be challenged in court, blocking construction of a wall the administration has said is needed immediately to address an urgent crisis on the border.
No matter how the shipper arguments are chopped, cubed, diced, minced, sliced, shredded or otherwise presented, the substitution of government fiat for market-based solutions will adversely affect traffic flows, swell the number of time-consuming and costly interline and yard switches of freight cars, reduce network reliability, and cause an overall reduction in service quality. Any immediate price reduction will be transient, at best.
Here is what you need to know as the COVID-19 crisis continues.

Q. What is your measure of success and did you achieve it?
They have had to make these and many more such political alliances because they are simply too vulnerable to go it alone. Their alliances' goals always included making sure that the capitalist system itself survived, partly by preventing the majority from voting for tax and regulation policies that would undo the inequalities and instabilities of capitalism.
It's also sparked a wave of critiques from Albertans and other people across Canada, arguing that the alienated Westerners don't represent their views and legitimize dangerous separatist sentiments.

This life is not new to millions of mixed-culture Asians growing up across the globe. A quick scouring of Subtle Asian Traits, a popular Facebook group for relatable posts on Asian culture, yields tons of stories related to Asian parenting. Many of us have carried this burden with us well into adulthood: We must make our parents proud, we must provide for our families, and most importantly, we cannot fail because they sacrificed so much.

Sandra: eFunk is based on the long distance interior design I've been doing for friends and family for years. We've created a detailed measuring guide which has clients send us all the measurements of the space and anything staying, detailed pictures, paint colors, as much information as they can gather and email. Then, we have a comprehensive questionnaire that walks them through what they want to change, why, how they want to use the space, and, always my favorite question, how they want to feel in the space. I gather inspiration images to clarify style preferences since one person's transitional may be another's contemporary.

It's important to note the struggles that have plagued Alberta separatists for decades, including an unsavoury connection to alt-right and white nationalist movements in the province. Parties have struggled to gain footholds campaigning on these alienation-inspired ideas
It's not uncommon at a Sandpit for groups to work until the wee hours of the morning leading up to the final presentations on the last day. The groups at the Zapopan Sandpit put in the extra late-night thinking needed. But the pressure was on. Unlike typical Sandpits, where the mentor team morphs into decision makers at the end of the session, this Sandpit brought in outside evaluators for a final presentation. The groups had to make the case for the proposals to a panel of judges who had little context for how the projects had developed in just a few days.
On Monday, Stefanski said he didn't want to get into any hypotheticals regarding Ward or any of the other infected players. Now, he'll only be able to work virtually this week to prepare Cleveland for its first playoff game since Jan. 5, 2003 — a 36-33 loss at Pittsburgh.

I believe that beauty is truth. Beauty is not makeup or hair or clothes. Those are skills. Beauty is real, vulnerable and honest. I am not saying that this is easy. I will never say that. It is hard, and you should respect the process. What I will say is that the risks are worth the reward.
Countries all over the world have joined the accessibility and digital divide efforts to ensure inclusive education, employment, transportation and ICT for everyone. Each country is trying to solve these issues in ways that best support their citizens and culture. One way is by trying to understand the impact and solutions to the problem. Many countries feel that legislation, policies, and training can help everyone get on the same page. A great example is the United Nations Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). To date over 160 countries have signed the CRPD.

It's true that there are some things that I am weirdly good at. The doctors call it asynchronous learning. That means I can learn academic subjects at an accelerated speed and even out of sequence. For example, I learned linear algebra concepts before I ever took a formal algebra class. My parents like to say that I literally Khan Academy'ed my way into college. But there are other areas where my brain is still catching up, like handwriting, spelling and taking notes. I am using spellcheck a lot for this essay! Also, I am just OK on piano, and I don't learn foreign languages easily. I am trying to challenge myself by learning Bengali from my family and Mandarin from my very patient tutor Ms. Vienna. Please wish me luck!
I felt completely alone and devastated. I hated myself for being gay, and wanted to just be normal more than anything. I tried so hard to convince other people, and myself, that I wasn't gay, that it was just a rumor. Nobody believed me. They just kept laughing.
If you live in a multiple-story home, get your dog running up and down the stairs, as suggested by Nicole Pajer on Cesarsway.com. Throw toys and treats across the staircase, in a vertical game of fetch. If you live in an apartment building, like I do, try using treats hidden in the palm of your hand to lead your dog up and down a few stories on a leash.
The downside is there is a cap on how much you can earn in order to be eligible for a Roth IRA. The income limit for single filers in 2019 is $122,000–$137,000, depending on the contribution amount. Roth IRA contribution limits are the same as traditional IRAs. And despite the benefits, there are a few other reasons why you might want to think twice about contributing to a Roth IRA.

Pourquoi n'y a-t-il pas de traitement contre ce coronavirus ? Depuis le mois de janvier, les scientifiques dans le monde entier sont lancés dans une course contre la montre: la recherche d'un traitement antiviral efficace contre le nouveau coronavirus. Mais attention aux faux traitements qui circulent sur les réseaux sociaux. Plusieurs médicaments déjà connus, comme le remdisivir et la chloroquine, ont été testés en urgence. Si certains semblent avoir des effets, l'OMS rappelle qu'à ce jour, aucun médicament spécifique n'est recommandé pour prévenir ou traiter l'infection par le nouveau coronavirus. Dans le cas de la chloroquine, l'AP-HP a lancé une procédure auprès des professionnels de santé dont les résultats sont attendus dans 70 jours. Des essais cliniques ont été lancés afin de vérifier l'efficacité d'un traitement, avec un encadrement scientifique rigoureux. Ces derniers se développent autour de plusieurs axes: inhibiteurs d'enzymes, antirétroviraux, anticorps monoclonaux... Chaque type de médicament recherché s'attaque à un aspect du virus comme expliqué dans la vidéo ci-dessous. De nombreuses molécules sont actuellement testées. Une efficacité même partielle, pourrait changer la donne dans les hôpitaux et la lutte contre la maladie. C'est le cas des cardioprotecteurs. Ces traitements, s'ils sont approuvés, permettraient de protéger les fonctions cardiaques du patient et d'aider son corps à se battre contre la maladie. Certaines études prendront encore des mois avant de donner des résultats. Pour en savoir plus sur les traitements en cours de test, cliquez ici.

Inslee fought over the past year to pass Initiative 1631, a ballot measure that would have put a $15 per metric ton fee on carbon dioxide emissions and directed the money toward expanding public transit, energy-efficiency retrofits for big buildings and new wind- and solar-powered plants. The proposal, dubbed by some a state-level Green New Deal, failed after the oil industry spent a record $31 million pressuring Evergreen State voters to reject the measure. It was Inslee's third attempt at putting a price on carbon in his state.

Sex is undoubtedly going to be different post-baby, with each of you experiencing highs and lows in sexual desire. Fatigue, stress, a lack of time or your baby's sleeping habits might get in the way of sex, or there may be physical impediments, such as vaginal bleeding or pain from breastfeeding.
He said they looked like they could be shoplifters, she said of the man's assessment of her sons and nephews.
Today the world faces a different kind of global threat, similarly metastasizing after years of failing to confront it. Keeping the planet from warming beyond recognition requires an unprecedented economic effort to halt climate-changing emissions. But even the most optimistic scientific projections call for not only stopping the output of carbon dioxide but also removing the vast concentrations of the gas already in the atmosphere, where it will continue to trap heat for more than a century to come.

The 22-year-old may have already triggered that provision with her revelations in October.

The effort not only met the match, $25,000, but also reached far beyond at $31,700. The state match made the project possible with a total of $56,700 in funds raised. Schramm recognized the force of innovation, I don't know where we would be if we had not held our campaign with Patronicity.
Pire pour le parti macroniste, les dissidences et les candidatures contestées se sont multipliées à l'échelle nationale, augurant des municipales particulièrement compliquées pour LREM.

For Yavilah McCoy, the founder of Ayecha, a nonprofit organization for Jewish women of color, the march's commitment to intersectionality is productive for policy change and the reason why she's organizing 100 Jewish women of color and allies to join marchers in D.C. on Saturday.

Our bodies function optimally at a pH of 7.4, and is generally self-maintaining in this range, McCoy continued. Symptoms such as excessive vomiting or diarrhea or conditions like uncontrolled diabetes may result in disruptions, but since there are serious consequences to changes in our pH, our bodies are quick to detect minor changes and jump into action.
Some of the efforts were innovative. Ossoff's team hired 2,000 mostly young, mostly Black community organizers to reach out to their personal social networks and encourage people to vote.

The sheer size of the U.S. population helps explain why the Trump administration delegated not just actual vaccine delivery but also most of the planning for it to the states, which have then leaned heavily on local health departments. But that, in turn, helps explain why vaccine rollout has fallen so short of the initial goals.
The team is awaiting further testing results and will communicate them as appropriate, the Celtics said.
The Democratic Party has to put a candidate forward who will make it the primary commitment to get this stuff done, Inslee said. It can't be put in just one of the baskets of many issues.
The pandemic killed the momentum, understandably. But it's becoming clear that COVID-19 is not a separate problem, but an interconnected one. The same drivers of the novel coronavirus, and other emerging infectious diseases, are also the drivers of biodiversity loss. These include the wildlife trade that allowed COVID-19 to jump to humans, as well as land-use change and climate change that bring people and wild animals into close contact.

This is a delicate balance, and it's worth noting that in the academic and scientific domain, the participants do cooperate, but they also compete aggressively. The group of participants at the Zapopan Sandpit--perhaps because so many came from the world of social entrepreneurship and economic development--walked the talk when it came to being inclusive. They bonded in their groups and wanted to stay there, resisting even when the mentors--a team of subject guides whose role was to give the group advice--suggested that the groups split up or take their projects in a different direction.
For those not yet ready for a dramatic change, there's still scope for chipping away at the workweek. Maroney cites Kronos's unlimited vacation scheme, allowing staff members to take as much leave as they like as long as they agree with managers how they'll manage their workload. She says annual leave rose only by 2.5 days because staff opted to shave off small, regular slivers of time rather than take extra vacations.
The researchers used radio collars to track nine female polar bears near the Beaufort Sea. Using collected blood samples, scientists found that five of the bears lost body mass due to malnutrition. Four of the bears lost 10 percent body weight in just a 10-day period.
Speech Sounds by Octavia Butler (1983)
On Thursday, Democrats will officially take over the House, and their first order of business ― after they've elected their speaker ― will be passing legislation extending funding to all the shuttered agencies, pressuring Senate Republicans and President Donald Trump to let go of the border wall fight and end the shutdown.
The CPC has eschewed emulating the far-right House Freedom Caucus, whose smaller but more ideologically coherent membership has allowed it to operate as a bloc capable of exercising veto power over any legislation GOP leaders introduce. The caucus instead welcomes all members, including some who belong to the business-friendly New Democrat Coalition, while permitting smaller groups to take stands of their choosing.
Trump lost Georgia by 11,779 votes on Nov. 3. The state's two Republican senators were both also on the ballot. David Perdue sought his second six-year term. Kelly Loeffler — who was appointed to replace former GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson in 2016 — wanted to win the final two years of that term. Neither won outright in November, and both now face runoffs against Democratic challengers.
Forever 21 has long been synonymous with fast fashion. Its affordable, trendy clothing is easily snatched up by the armload, making it ripe for impulse buying.

In 2013, Micheal Sparks founded The Underground Kitchen, a Richmond, Virginia-based exclusive inclusive dinner party series that traveled to 40 U.S. cities. In 2018, his friend Kate Houck joined as partner and COO. But when the pandemic hit, Sparks and Houck put the for-profit business on pause and in April formed the nonprofit branch The Underground Kitchen Community First, which provides healthy soups and bread, school lunches and family meals to the community in need.

Hu Yinghai, deputy director-general of the Civil Affairs Department in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, appealed for masks and protective suits.
On top of all this, the Trump administration's hostility toward migrants and hyper-polarization of the immigration issue has made Democratic-led jurisdictions far more likely to embrace sanctuary policies limiting cooperation with ICE than they were under Obama. The consequence of Trump's lack of diplomacy is that ICE now has far less leeway to make arrests at local jails than it once did, reducing the agency's efficiency.
This is the age of technology and the world has changed a lot since I was born. My father (Robert Newsom) was a technologist for AT&T before most people had even heard of computers. He managed a computer that was the size of two city blocks in Jacksonville, Florida. From time to time, my brother and sisters and I would go to work with him. He worked evenings and we would walk around the rows and rows of flashing lights and small black and white displays of text.
The decision has the support of the MLB, which has urged the team to decrease its use of the logo in recent years. Notably, the logo won't be going away entirely. The ban extends only to on-field displays, meaning Chief Wahoo will still be a fixture on merchandise that's available throughout northern Ohio.

The senators wrote that further attempts to cast doubt on the election are contrary to the clearly expressed will of the American people and only serve to undermine Americans' confidence in the already determined election results.
I don't know how many times I was told to get lost, and that I was going to hell. I couldn't have gone to my coach because telling him would have made my situation worse. He likely would have gone to those team members and maybe punish them, but ultimately make them resent me more. If they knew I told our coach, they would have harassed me even more, possibly even at school and not just practice. Out of fear, I just didn't tell anyone.

The document also states that soon thereafter, a psychiatrist deemed Spires homosexual and he was given an undesirable discharge in 1948.
If we have learned anything from 2020, it's that our response to this crisis must be transformative. The idea of returning to normal often emerges in discussions of resilience. But we know a normal that is extractive of BIPOC communities and the planet is unacceptable. 2020 has shown that we need to think more holistically about what resilience should look like, and that issues of climate, housing, health, and economic justice are all intertwined.
People really responded to that message. At the same time they would still ask, What should we do? What should we do? People wanted a bit more of an explanation, so that's why we decided to write the book. People don't always want to be told what to do, after all, they also want to be told why they should do it.
Hearings involving immigrants currently in detention will continue as planned, as they are typically conducted through video conference.
Too often when a car cuts someone off, they end up in a line that isn't moving, their luggage gets lost, their flight is delayed, or they end up receiving an item that comes broken or destroyed, their first negative impulse is to say that this always happens to them.

On March 5, 2018, the Prime Minister Modi signed off on a proposal to update the SECC. The specifics and safeguards of the SECC were yet to be ironed out, but one thing was clear — it was now a question of when the registry would be built, rather than if it would be built at all.

But it's hard for all kids, I think, right now.
Weinberg is far less certain about the country's long-term prospects. There are millions of people who believe Trump when he says the election was stolen from him. A new administration won't change their minds.
How it works: The SEP in SEP-IRA stands for simplified employee pension. Contributions to this type of retirement plan are made by the employer on the employee's behalf. The good news is that any employer with one or more employees can create a SEP plan. So if you're self-employed ― for instance, you own a small business or are a freelancer ― you are both the employer and employee. Contributions are also tax-deductible for the business, and the money isn't taxed until it's withdrawn in retirement.

When that happens, it's important to identify incentives. The achievement of the goal itself is certainly an incentive, otherwise you wouldn't be doing it, but many of the goals we set for ourselves are taxing. The goals are breaking into habits that are gratifying, so if you want to lose weight, you're not going to lose any by eating more hot fudge sundaes. You're going to eat fewer hot fudge sundaes.

And again, this is why I'm so interested in female rage and how it manifests itself, because I think it's so much more interesting than what we're expecting. If you're a woman, for me, I had to think, OK, what am I capable of physically? Not much. I don't go to the gym. And it was important that, for the end of the movie, when it comes to that, when the idea of violence is flirted with, it ends like it ends. Because there's a reason that we don't go out and do these things, because the chances of us surviving are just so slim. For me, it was like, What could I do?

This is not to say Montgomery is better than otherwordly talents like Ezekiel Elliott or Le'Veon Bell. But his stellar play has undeniably provided the Packers with a dynamic threat lined up behind Rodgers. Better still, he has morphed into a terrific complement to the play-making Jordy Nelson (league-leading 14 touchdown catches) and Davante Adams (12 TDs) on the perimeter.
Not talking about our experiences with COVID-19 is a way to avoid loneliness, even if it's more helpful to talk about it, Owens added.

There was a failure of leadership at the top of the Capitol Police. He hasn't even called us since this happened, she said, referring to Sund.
The National Guard expects to send 20,000 members in for Inauguration Day. There is a new 7-foot fence surrounding the Capitol, one that officials say cannot be scaled. And there's a massive perimeter around the White House extending all the way up to K Street and down to Constitution Avenue.

THIS IS WHY I POST AS MUCH AS I DO, she wrote in another tweet. THIS IS WHY I CARE. THIS CANNOT HAPPEN ANY FUCKING MORE. I'm angry, embarrassed and ashamed.
It's often said that health care is ripe for disruption, which is true. If Bezos can transform retail, Buffett can transform rich people into richer people, and Dimon can transform hundreds of thousands of family homes into a multibillion-dollar federal fraud settlement, surely they can transform the health care system. That makes perfect sense?
I wouldn't even think about reading the magazines in the waiting room at the doctor's office, and I use my own pen to fill out their forms. When going out to eat, I wash my hands in the restroom immediately after reading the menu and placing my order.
BONUS: Blood Quantum, a film by Jeff Barnaby
Lawley was set to star as the boyfriend of Amandla Stenberg's character in the adaptation of the beloved and critically acclaimed young-adult novel written by Angela Thomas. The Hate U Give centers around the story of a 16-year-old girl who feels torn between the worlds of her poor and mostly black neighborhood, and the suburban prep school she attends. She later witnesses the murder of her childhood friend at the hands of a police officer.

January 1, 2016 marks the three year anniversary of the day I began making a micro grant, every single day of the year, to social changemakers around the globe. Since then, a community of givers, myself included, have joined with the Pollination Project to make 1317 grants in 60 countries. In the past few weeks, we've made grants to small social change initiatives all over the world. From Ajman Thrower's Oakland-based social change marketing firm that employs and uplifts low income youth of color; to a rooftop garden in Green Bay Wisconsin that supports youth in foster care; these community leaders are finding ways to create resilience in their own backyards.
In September of last year, King met in Austria with members of a political party founded by a former Nazi SS officer and declared that western civilization is on the decline because minorities are supposedly replacing white Europeans.
How it works: An individual retirement account, or IRA, is a type of tax-advantaged retirement savings account. It's similar to a 401(k) except you don't have to open one through your employer. It's common for people to change employers frequently, and the great thing about an IRA is that it's employer-independent, said Lyn Alden, the founder of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy. You can keep the same account open and keep contributing to it year after year, regardless of who you work for.

Singh made his alignment clear during the half-hour interview, by clearing up misconceptions of Canadian liberalism and calling out Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
Previously, Landry also investigated how musicians' brains process sensory illusions. Together with their previous findings, the results suggest that musicians are better at integrating input from various senses, the study's authors noted. More studies are needed, however, to determine whether and how musical training might slow the natural cognitive decline that occurs as we age. Playing a musical instrument has an effect on abilities beyond music, Landry concluded. We're only now starting to better understand the benefits of musical training and they seem to range beyond simply playing music.
In the budget, Sitharaman is expected to announce a host of economy-reviving measures. Income tax cuts, higher spending on infrastructure and incentives for real estate are likely, according to Reuters.

The Undertaker enters the Royal Rumble, a big title change in the main event and more in this WWE Raw , Jan. 9, 2017 review...
Spring gave way to summer and fall, and now winter is upon us. I should have been counting down the days until every teacher's favorite time: the long school break between Christmas and New Year's. I should have been stocking up on library books to read over break and rushing to get essays graded so I could relax over the holidays.
Tiny House Warriors, a group opposed to the pipeline construction, reported the pair were telling workers they weren't allowed in the area without Secwepemc consent. They were mistreated by the RCMP during and following their arrests, alleged Tiny House Warriors.

OK, so what did Bezos, Buffett and Dimon actually announce? Let's turn to the first paragraph of the press release their companies disseminated.
It's not the only strain being closely watched. In December, health officials identified another variant of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in South Africa (official name 501Y.V2). Like the UK strain, it appears to be more contagious but does not necessarily appear to make people sicker.
After this year, when it's become clear that the scariest sentences are more like we've run out of ventilators or the hillside behind your house is on fire, those words seem particularly contemptible and archaic.
It's currently unclear whether getting vaccinated protects a person from spreading the coronavirus to others. That is something that is usually determined in vaccine research trials, but it hasn't been sorted out because of the sprint to create COVID-19 vaccines. And researchers aren't yet sure whether the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines protect against asymptomatic infection.
She was one of several hundred people who protested Friday afternoon outside church headquarters in Salt Lake City to cap off a week of fury and heartbreak for LGBTQ students and their straight allies. They sang hymns and chanted have no fear, God loves queers as they held rainbow flags. They held signs that read Love one another, Jesus loves everyone and Bigotry wrapped in prayer is still bigotry.
This means anyone can sell supplements and make whatever claims they want to sell products, she said. That doesn't make them true or effective, and certainly doesn't make it safe.

ACOG says that women should absolutely have access to all of the information that's available to them on vaccine safety in pregnancy (again, at this point, not much) and that they should be encouraged to talk to their health care providers about their options — but that having a conversation with a doctor or midwife beforehand is not a must.
The article about the study is fascinating, filled with breakdowns on how it is that women worldwide find themselves in these impossible situations. It reminded me of a piece from a couple of weeks ago, I'm a Mom Who Nearly Died Of Sepsis Because I Didn't 'Have Time To Be Sick,' and how often some women put their own needs and yes, hopes and dreams, aside to make sure everyone around them is cared for.

All this came two years after Trump dismantled the pandemic response team that his predecessor Barack Obama had created within the White House. Trump justified that move three weeks ago as a desire to save money — Some of the people we cut, they haven't been used for many, many years — and falsely claimed he could hire them all back quickly if needed.

Thorgy Thor, who I agreed with maybe once in season eight, speaks sense in her confessional: Wake up, bitch! You had to make a decision. Nobody envied you, but you made it. Move forward. Because that's the game. All Stars is not Drag Race. The difference in the format exists for a reason. The best of the best should be capable of making hard choices to get ahead. Ben is great at Drag Race, but as evidenced by her mealy-mouthed monologue when she had to eliminate Morgan, she may not be great at certain elements of All Stars.
I took a backseat to standing up for my cousins or my sister, because everyone else around me assured me that, that was the way things are supposed to be, Diaz says in the video, which has over 5 million views on Facebook. It took me some time, but, I know it's not the way. Being a man is about challenging the script that was handed down to us. And I especially, don't want you, mi hija, to grow up in a world where you will be told, 'Boys will be Boys!'

Heavy rain in Southern California has triggered mudslides and debris flow in parts of the state scarred by recent wildfires, leaving people trapped in homes and cars as highways were shut down in the dark early Tuesday morning.
But as someone who lost 70 pounds many years ago, I know what it's like to be influenced by society's standards and all the marketing hoopla that goes along with it. I eventually took my weight loss too far. I was propelled by the excitement of my success and my newfound energy. That, coupled with my lack of nutrition knowledge, and admittedly, the satisfaction of extending a big old, what do you think now? to childhood meanies and rude strangers past and present put me in a pretty unhealthy spot. The more I lost, I suppose I felt the more I gained in the way of undoing the hurtful comments I'd been dealt. I was shedding their bullying ways right along with my waistline, and it was addicting, oddly satisfying.

Tatem, president of the East Valley NAACP in metropolitan Phoenix, argued that a second Sanders campaign would have greater success in reaching the middle-aged and older voters of color who proved so elusive for Sanders in 2016.

Being an extrovert has helped me make a lot of friends in college ― they even ask me to tutor them. Whenever I start a new class, other students give me curious looks, and I can see some people secretly taking photos and videos of me. I hear them whispering, He's so cute! or He's so smart! but I try to break the ice by introducing myself so they can see that it's OK to talk to me and be my friend. I also send my professors an email before the first day of class so that they are not confused when I walk in.

We're becoming more aware of the problems in more cities, in rapidly developing societies, he said.

Determined to up my game, I retooled everything from my travel schedules to my daily routines to my shot strategies in hopes of nabbing more likes and followers. I started to think about the destinations in terms of how Instagram-able they were, instead of how interested I was in visiting them. Once I was actually exploring a new place, I would spend more time filming Instagram Stories and taking shots for my feed than I would taking in the city or the moment.

Yet Frederick is arguing in court that states and cities don't have the legal authority to sue oil companies for climate damages. One environmental attorney compared the argument to stating that murder isn't illegal.
The next big challenge will come when supply ramps up, in late winter or early spring, and vaccines become available to a much larger swath of the public. At that point, the upper limit on vaccines will depend less on the amount of vaccine available and more on the ability to deliver it. The current plan is to use existing providers ― not just pharmacies, but also clinics, independent medical practices, and sometimes schools and employers ― and to supplement them with government-managed mass vaccination centers.
The Buffalo Declaration, however, is targeted at Justin Trudeau's federal government rather than the provincial one. In fact, it is quite sympathetic to Jason Kenney's UCP government in Alberta and how it's handled separatist sentiment.
We have Netflix, Amazon, Vudu and the T1 from Xfinity (with their best package) plus internet and sports packages. We would definitely cut cable as there is enough with Netflix, Amazon and Vudu ...

In 1900, journalist and anti-lynching crusader Ida B. Wells wrote of the mass lynching that took place in New Orleans that July, during which a white mob ran a relentless four-day campaign of racial terror against Black residents. The incident, as Wells described it, began with the inexcusable and unprovoked assault upon two colored men by police officers of New Orleans. Robert Charles, one of the Black men who was arrested, was attacked by one of the officers; he shot and killed the cop, and evaded arrest. White residents, long fueled by mob mentality as a course of retaliation, were given legal sanction to kill Charles. Reports say at least seven were killed as whites scoured the city preying on Black residents.

Changing that narrative may prove difficult. In a survey conducted by Republican pollsters for a pro-Trump organization, only half of the voters in GOP-held congressional districts support the plan, even after being introduced to key features of the bill and hearing the messages on both sides of the tax reform debate. Even among Americans who'll see their taxes fall, there's no guarantee that they'll notice — or that they'll look more fondly on the Republicans' effort.
In 2004, Montgomery, then 36, drove from her home in Kansas to Missouri to meet up with Bobbie Jo Stinnett, 23, who was eight months pregnant. Then she did the unthinkable. Montgomery strangled Stinnett and cut open her abdomen, removing the fetus. She then transported the baby home, telling her husband she'd given birth at a clinic.

• Ideal hire: Gase. General manager Ruston Webster has been fired, so the Titans are going to have to get moving here if they want in on Chicago's offensive coordinator before he finds a gig elsewhere. But Gase would fit the bill of a coach who would work for Mariota, which is a must right now. He also steps outside the retread bubble Tennessee visited when hiring Whisenhunt, who was making his second stop as a head coach.

The new study out this week is not the first to argue against traditional labor curves — nor does it specifically tackle the question of how they might contribute to the growing C-section rate — but it adds to the growing body of literature pushing back against that standard worldwide. It is the first to show women in Africa, like women elsewhere, take more time to labor than previously thought, Oladapo told HuffPost.
I have reached the two-year mark of my divorce now, and I can see that something happens to you when spend time alone and do things you never thought you could do, when you carry the impossible. I take out the trash. I sleep alone. I pay the bills. I've attended real estate closings alone. Weddings alone. Parent conferences alone. Soccer games alone with my chair for one. And at first it is all terrifying and depressing, but then you break through that initial moment, and it liberates you from everything that tied you before. I'm doing hard things, but I'm okay. What you want in a partner is a list that begins to change with the first passing seasons of your time by yourself, and the bar creeps a little higher each time.
I also designed and hand-made most of our decorations to save money: a 4-foot diameter double happiness sign, 1,000 paper cranes strung up in garlands to honor my Japanese relatives, hand-cut menus and table numbers printed at Office Depot, meticulously wrapped floral arrangements and so much more.
VOICES IN FOOD is a series of as-told-to interviews with influencers in the food space, amplifying voices from marginalized communities who have a deep understanding of how food not only reflects social issues, but also how food can change our lives.

They are who they are, all the time. They don't lie to cover up their mistakes, and they don't make false promises. Their people don't have to exert energy trying to figure out their motives or predicting what they're going to do next. Equally as important, they don't hide things they have the freedom to disclose. Instead of hoarding information and being secretive to boost their own power, they share information and knowledge generously.
The Women's March agenda isn't controversial among progressive women, but the issue of inclusiveness, or intersectionality, is. Sarsour is an activist for Palestine whose strong opposition to Israel makes some Jewish participants uncomfortable. In February, Tamika Mallory, a co-president of Women's March, Inc., attended the Nation of Islam's annual Saviour's Day event and was singled out in the audience by Farrakhan, whose speech also included the anti-Semitic and homophobic tropes he often deploys. When reports of the event surfaced, there were calls for Mallory to step down from her leadership role.
I hear talk shows and see articles shared online where people talk about marriage tips and what to do when you are struggling in a partnership. I'm realizing that people think marriage is hard these days because you aren't always happy. Because you feel tired and you work too much and the kids are always demanding something and the other person can't make all that go away. Is that hard? Really? Because now that I've seen what the hard part actually is -- the grieving and the accepting and the letting go -- burnt dinner on the stove or noisy children or a cluttered bathroom counter don't seem like a cause for unhappiness. Whatever happy means anyway; it's always a moving target when you depend on the other person to provide it.
More expensive options, like an N95 mask, can provide protection, as they contour to your nose and face, and can filter up to 95 percent of particulate matter from the air. Men with facial hair, such as Avol, are often out of luck, though, as beards and mustaches prevent an airtight seal.
Earlier in the day, Boris Johnson had tried to love-bomb Remain voters with a promise of a liberal Brexit. However he also warned another referendum would only deepen the divisions in society. I think last summer, during the general election, I think there was some force in that argument, Cable concedes. It's one of the reasons we didn't get any traction. The most recent YouGov poll put the LibDems on 8% of the national vote. It won a 7.4% share at the election. The first real test for the party since the general election will be May's local elections London where the Conservatives fear a wipeout at the hands of Jeremy Corbyn's Labour. We don't think it's going to be an easy election because we are defending a lot of seats, Cable says. In some of the inner-city areas where we are up against Corbynistas we don't underestimate the problems. But he says the party is hoping for substantial gains in his home borough of Richmond as well as neighbouring Kingston.
Lawmakers vowed to investigate the stunning breach of security, which occurred as they prepared to certify President-elect Joe Biden's Electoral College victory over Trump.
Still, it's impossible to disregard the fact that an almost entirely white and male set of tastemakers (not to mention creators and investors) elevated certain male artists to the level of demigods, so above criticism that one's dislike signaled one's own inferior taste rather than the artists' failings. Most critics with major platforms have long been white men; the lack of diversity in the ranks has not only stunted the breadth of conversation, but fostered the false sense that white men's concerns are the most pressing, their opinions the most objective, and their viewpoints the most conducive to great art. Even when women or people of color dissented, their voices did little or nothing to alter the perceived consensus.
Forty-nine percent of suburban voters in the district supported a Green New Deal candidate, compared to just 31 percent of urban voters. By contrast, 14 percent of suburban voters said they'd support an anti-Green New Deal primary candidate, while 43 percent of urban voters said they'd do the same.

He said employers would have struggled to obtain masks, but he believes many did not want their workers to wear them anyway because they could have been off-putting to shoppers. In the early days of the pandemic, Perrone said, employers pointed to the CDC guidance to say masks were unnecessary.

The third reason for the brake on trade is the decline in the growth of global value chains, which is the idea that the process of production consists of many stages and occurs across borders. But this phenomenon, which developed at a very high rate after China's accession to the WTO in 2001 as the country emerged as a global supplier, has now reached cruising pace.

There are certain hot spots like New York, and the federal government has to work on those spots, but at the same time, at a certain point, we have to get open, and we have to get moving, Trump said. He added that we can do two things at one time before again bringing up flu deaths and motor vehicle fatalities.
Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.) applauded the Army's decision in a statement on his website, saying: This is major progress, not just for the Sikh American community but for our nation's military.

It's important to be aware of and prepare for the circumstances that might sabotage your intentions, increase your vulnerability, and prevent you from making progress. We sometimes hit a fork in the road where the probability of following through on a New Year's resolution becomes so low, so we stop and ask ourselves why we are even bothering to do it.

He added that, in any event, he is glad Trump is in charge. Considering we're in uncharted territory, given the choice between having him or some of the other options, I'd rather have him. ... I don't think necessarily that anyone would have handled it differently.
The Trump administration has weakened workforce safety standards, gutted pollution rules, promoted junk health insurance, and rolled back rules on everything from drilling in the Arctic to protections for transgender persons in homeless shelters. On the campaign trail, President-elect Joe Biden promised to reverse at least 100 Trump-era rules.
The original Gerber baby was Ann Turner Cook, who recently celebrated her 91st birthday. A black-and-white sketch of her face from 1927 became Gerber's iconic logo. Over the past 90 years, the company has received countless photos from parents who see their own babies in the famous sketch.
The most talented employees seek to improve everything they touch. If you take away their ability to change and improve things because you're only comfortable with the status quo, this makes them hate their jobs. Caging up this innate desire to create not only limits them, it limits you.

1) The Funding Of The White Helmets Two of the five paragraphs of the open letter detail the funding sources of the White Helmets, information which is available publicly online. It's claimed that because they are funded through the UK Government's £1bn Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF) they have a potential dual use as... ...first, as a means of supporting and lending credibility to opposition structures within Syria; second, as an apparently impartial organisation that can corroborate UK accusations against the Russian state. According to the CSSF's 2016/17 annual report, the UK Government has also funded a range of other projects, including negotiating a deal between the FARC rebels and the Colombian government; helping to reduce cattle-raiding in South Sudan; and rehabilitating 20 Soviet-era irrigation projects in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. When it was noted that these are all detailed in the same 2016/17 report the WG links to, they did not raise issue with any of these other projects despite being from the same funding source. There has been controversy regarding the CSSF, as details of some of the projects it funds are secret and even senior MPs are not told what they are. But the White Helmets, along with the projects listed above, are among those that are public and highlighted by the UK Government. Ibrahim Olabi, founder of the Syrian Legal Development Programme which trains the White Helmets in international law, explained that this is how some of the biggest international NGOs are funded.

Life-saving medical equipment was not stockpiled. Travel largely continued unabated. Vital public health data from China was not provided or was deemed untrustworthy. A White House riven by rivalries and turnover was slow to act. Urgent warnings were ignored by a president consumed by his impeachment trial and intent on protecting a robust economy that he viewed as central to his reelection chances.
A windfall from the new federal tax law gives many states the flexibility to comprehensively rewrite their own tax codes, something not seen for decades.
Trump now stands with no equal, the only president to be charged twice with a high crime or misdemeanor, a new coda for a term defined by a deepening of the nation's divides, his failures during the worst pandemic in a century and his refusal to accept defeat at the ballot box.
In Sweden, which has had civil unions since 1995 and full marriage since 2009, men married to men have triple the suicide rate of men married to women. All of these unbearable statistics lead to the same conclusion: It is still dangerously alienating to go through life as a man attracted to other men. The good news, though, is that epidemiologists and social scientists are closer than ever to understanding all the reasons why.
The utter lack of information didn't stop people from going a little loony. The stock market tumbled. Business news outlets went all-out, pushing the story to users' phones so everyone would know right away.

The races remain toss-ups after a record 3 million people cast their ballots during the state's early voting period, which ended last week with Black voters increasing their share of the electorate compared with the general election's early vote period. Republicans are now banking on a massive turnout on Election Day to win the two races, and are sending President Donald Trump to the state's heavily conservative northwest corner on Monday night in hopes of creating a voter surge of their own.

We have a very active flu season, more active than most. It's looking like it's heading to 50,000 or more deaths ― deaths, not cases. Fifty-thousand deaths ― which is, that's a lot, he said. And you look at automobile accidents, which are far greater than any numbers we're talking about. That doesn't mean we're going to tell everybody no more driving of cars. So we have to do things to get our country open.
She said she's been sober ever since, and urged her fans to read Whitaker's book, even if you can't see yourself doing [it] or just plain don't want to, because it's still an incredible read.

During what has been a tremendously stressful year, many of us have retreated to our kitchens, finding sanctuary in moving, in doing and in the satisfaction of producing tangible results. After all, #quarantinebaking isn't a thing just because it yields pops of pleasure in the form of taste ― it has mental health benefits, too.
I wish we could rewind to the days when Atari was considered ground-breaking technology and the thought of having a cell phone seemed like something only the Jetsons could achieve. But, the reality is many kids are obsessed with their various devices to the point they don't know how to have a conversation or use their imagination.
Yet instead of I tested positive posts, our social media feeds send us scenes of people flouting stay-at-home guidelines and taking tropical vacation pics. These envy-inducing posts sharply contrast with the somber headlines that warn us about the uptick in cases.
In many other capitalist countries, it was not possible to limit political parties to two. In France, Germany and beyond, while there are center-left and center-right parties similar to the Democratic and Republican parties in the U.S., there are also politically significant parties further to the right and left. In France, for example, the National Front is a powerful rightist party led by Marine Le Pen, while the La France Insoumise (France unsubdued) is a powerful leftist formation led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon.
I also love different 'puzzle toys' to keep my dog distracted. They are interactive toys that you can stuff with your pets favorite treat, says Dr. Kwong. This is a tool a lot of us have to use anyway when we leave our pooches home for several hours while at work. They become even more crucial when morning and evening walks are hampered due to the weather. They are a great distraction and keep them mentally stimulated. But giving them too many treats, and fewer walks, could lead to weight gain. Better yet, Dr. Kwong says, Portion out a part of their daily kibble and make them work for it!

For the first march in 2017, the shock of Trump's election and the fear that that carried was great enough to hold that coalition together, but it would be kind of miraculous if that had held over time, said Nancy Whittier, a sociology professor at Smith College. The Women's March has to figure out: Is it a broad anti-Trump mobilization? Is it around intersectional feminism and not necessarily Trump? Is it around specific issues like sexual violence? The march has kind of been all of those things so far.
Mindful that farmers could be hurt by stricter radiation standards, the co-op set up a fund in 2013 to provide compensation to farmers whose produce had been rejected. The money, which was raised in a donations drive, helps pay for measures to reduce radiation pollution on the affected properties.

As for the congresswoman's comments on unemployment, she discussed her understanding of how it's calculated in July 2018 after the press and many members of the GOP ripped her words apart. It's unclear as to why Goodwin is bringing up the remarks again, half a year later.
The much further in question seems to be demanding things that would require a rewriting of the constitution, such as shifting resource projects to be under the control of the provinces and rewriting equalization payments.

Thus, the differences in competitiveness are large. For survival in its present form and size the Eurozone needs a similar income transfer system, that is, a full political union as in the US.

The fight for $2,000 checks has been a tumultuous one for the past several months. Not long ago it was a rallying cry pushed by some of the most progressive members of Congress, like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). But in the last month, President Donald Trump has vocalized his support for the effort, putting Republicans — who have been reluctant to spend more on COVID-19 relief — in a difficult political position.

I feel like I'm going to die, she says several times as she gasps for air. She had recovered from COVID-19 three weeks prior to her fall. The doctor hedges when asked if this is from the virus, but he is clear that she could be re-infected if exposed in a nursing home. Nationally, deaths of residents and staff at long-term care facilities made up nearly 40% of the country's COVID-19 death toll as of mid-November. At the same time, 29% of these facilities are experiencing staffing shortages.

• Ideal hire: Jackson. Money won't be an issue for owner Stephen Ross, so that's why names like Payton and Saban are on the list, regardless of their current interest levels. In Jackson, though, the Dolphins would get a coach who could bring out the best (whatever that may be) in Ryan Tannehill and the offense—that ought to be a focus during this search. Jackson also should be able to draw some lessons from his brief prior head coaching gig, with the Raiders in 2011 (he went 8-8).

Shawn Nolan, one of Higgs' attorneys, said that it was unjust for Higgs to receive the death penalty when Haynes was able to live out his days in prison. He added that the government's theory was supported almost entirely by an unreliable eyewitness — the third man there that night, Gloria — who received a deal in exchange for his cooperation.

This long-term training of the sense in the context of producing exactly what is desired musically leads to a strengthening of sensory neural pathways, Landry told The Huffington Post. Additionally, using the senses in synchronicity for long periods of time ― musicians practice for years ― enhances how they work together. All this would lead to the faster multisensory reaction time.

When I toed the line for my double marathon at midnight July 2014 I was with about 40 other ultra runners-- I was filled with doubt. Even though I trained for almost a year for my 52.4 mile race and I had already completed a 50 mile race in May of 2014, I was as ready as I could be, and yet that's not what I told myself.

The first step in the KonMari method is taking all of the clothes you own and making one big pile to sort through. Only by creating one big pile are you able to see how much clothing you actually have. You will also be shocked by the amount of clothing you actually have, Kondo explains in Episode 2. From Wendy's towering mountain of clothing to Mario's collection of 150 sneakers, Tidying Up highlights the staggering amount of clothing most Americans own.
The warning comes as the government urged 1.5 million people categorized as vulnerable to not leave their homes and to self-isolate for three months in a bid to halt the spread of coronavirus.
I started forcing myself to have a lot more fun. I tried new things — going out and just doing more stuff, Zendaya wrote.
In recent years, the United States has seen a rise in mass consumption and urbanization, leading to a 'more is better' mindset, Kondo told HuffPost via email. However, I believe that a shift toward mindfulness is occurring. We are beginning to give more attention to each item we own and determine the few things that truly matter. I think people's interest in the KonMari Method coincides with these cultural changes in American society.

After a few weeks, they started grabbing my clubs out of the locker room and throwing them, scattering them all over the ground, down a hill, into bushes. I bought a padlock and started locking my clubs into the locker just so no one could get to them, but they still managed to grab something from my bag, because there were five of them against me. My golf balls were thrown into ponds, sometimes my hat or sunglasses; anything they could do to harass me, they did.
But passion and urgent messaging only go so far, and the Sunrise Movement faces considerable challenges. Labor unions, a necessary constituency for a policy that essentially amounts to an industrial plan, are skeptical of proposals to end fossil fuel use, a source of lucrative contract jobs. The Sunrise Movement's meteoric ascent was fueled by aggressive protests against potential Green New Deal champions, which risked burning allies, according to E&E News. In a competition with immigration, health care and taxes, climate change remains an underdog issue with relatively few vocal champions on the national level despite its ubiquitous threat.
In other places, teachers in public schools that don't rely on Christian textbooks are struggling to explain to their students the dynamics that allowed such violence to occur.

I certainly don't see any of these suddenly outspoken Republicans denouncing the Trump administration's directive to include a citizenship question in the 2020 Census for the first time in 70 years at the behest of the disgraced Steve Bannon. A change that will result in the undercounting of immigrants and minorities.
We had an event here at McLean in which several teams were put together and their goal was to see which team collectively lost the most weight. There was a buzz for several months and people were all excited about it, and some people did better in that exercise than they had ever done before with a New Year's resolution or the equivalent of setting a goal. So there's something about the social context that helps to increase the probability.
Dr. Pulido told HuffPost that calling public attention to child sexual abuse and the grooming techniques that perpetrators use is critically important, because the act of seeing one survivor come forward can prompt others to speak out. She pointed to the televised court case of former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar, during which a series of victim impact statements led hundreds more of his survivors to come forward.

The morning after the Georgia runoffs, Trump's Labor Department announced a new federal rule regarding the use of independent contractors by companies like Uber and Doordash. The new industry-friendly regulation would make it difficult for workers to prove through lawsuits that they are actually employees entitled to basic labor protections. It's slated to go into effect in March. Democrats could undo it through the CRA if they choose to, though not without provoking a fight from the gig companies and other businesses that use contractors.
Do the difficult things while they are easy and do the great things while they are small. A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step. - Lao Tzu
Krugman's conclusion: Ocasio-Cortez definitely knows more economics than almost everyone in the GOP caucus.
By far the clearest example of this is the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, which the Republican Congress passed and Trump signed in December. The legislation showers the vast majority of its benefits on businesses, investors and the wealthy ― by permanently reducing taxes for corporations, the owners of pass-through businesses, and holders of large estates. And although it also lowers some taxes for lower- and middle-income households, those cuts are smaller and temporary.
And yet, after a year of largely only leaving our houses for necessities or going on walks, the act has gotten pretty old.
But then they usually lose that enthusiasm at the notion that they might need to spend a few bucks to get the answer.
Every perceived failure is merely a chance to learn and begin again with more focus and certainty.
Meg Wiehe, deputy director of the Washington-based Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning group, urged states to proceed cautiously, especially if they are looking at big, permanent, rate cuts. That's because the federal rate changes and other modifications are temporary, and could disrupt states again when they expire in 2025.

Remember what the physical therapist said to do. Inhale through the nose, out through the mouth, I say in a mumble. I repeat those words, or Smell the flowers, blow out the candle, when she gasps for breath. Standing, walking and sitting all result in a struggle to breathe. We have asked if the shortness of breath is from COVID-19 or complications from her injuries. There is no clear answer.
Now everybody knows who Bernie Sanders is and about his program for free college, health care for all and actually dealing with police violence, he said. I encourage people to take a look at our racial justice platform in 2016. I'm hoping that we have a campaign so we can really talk about [that].

Just to be clear, King's rhetoric cannot be attributed to the rise of Trumpism, it goes back to well before Donald Trump's entry into the 2016 presidential campaign. In August of 2013, King absurdly claimed that for every child of an illegal immigrant who is valedictorian, there's another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds, and they've got calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.
I believe it was Bob Marley who said, You never know how strong you are until being strong is your only choice.
I was blessed with a lot of confidence, so even though there have been so many times that I have been labeled as fat or ugly, I never really felt that way, she tells the mag. I was content saying, 'Oh, I'm big-boned,' or whatever my excuses were. My whole body transformation kind of just happened. I didn't even set out to change my body at first. I really needed an emotional release and the physical results of working out came as a side effect of relieving the stress.

When the youth-led climate action group Sunrise Movement endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for president on Thursday, it boosted Sanders' efforts to cast himself as the Democrat with the strongest commitment to fighting climate change.
5. Forgive Daily: We have all been hurt and betrayed at one time or another. In fact, as long as we are on this earth, there will always be an opportunity and need to forgive. Extending forgiveness is not easy, but it is necessary. It is a difficult and sometimes painful process. However, you must find room in your heart to forgive. No, that person does not deserve your forgiveness. Yes, they were wrong. But how much more do we deserve to be forgiven by our heavenly Father? Let us not forget that we are not perfect. We all have fallen short in the eyes of God. By refusing to forgive, we are unintentionally agreeing to keep ourselves enslaved to the past.
RZIM spokesperson Ruth Malhotra told The Associated Press that the organization's senior leaders, including CEO Sarah Davis — who is Zacharias' eldest daughter — and President Michael Ramsden, were declining to grant interviews until after the law firm's investigation concludes.

8. That I would learn that there is no right or wrong way to feel. My feelings are often complicated and sometimes conflicting. I'll feel overwhelming happiness which then turns to sadness. I'll experience great joy only to be greeted with intense fear. Sometimes these feelings change within in the matter of seconds or happen within the same moment. Instead of trying to understand my conflicted feelings, I've learned to accept them. You don't have to feel one way or another.

This type of trafficking is unique, because it's so publicly observable, said Myles. There's a misconception that these places are harmless, and so they fall lower and lower on the priority list of all the things law enforcement has to deal with.
There's lots of polling showing that our brand remains resilient and strong. That's all positive and encouraging. But in those 26 months [before the next general election], we're going to have to be able to find well over 100 candidates who are not currently incumbents, we're going to have to raise millions of dollars, and we're going to have to find a way to put together a platform of ideas that are compelling for the people, he said.

7. You rarely touch each other inside or outside of the bedroom.
It's not for lack of effort. At the end, the film raises the ominous possibility that this sordid history is about to repeat itself. An article in Bloomberg notes that Goldman Sachs, together with other banks, is selling a new investment it calls a bespoke tranche opportunity. The article explains that these investments are essentially a CDO backed by single-name credit-default swaps, customized based on investors' wishes. The pools of derivatives are cut into varying slices of risk that are sold to investors such as hedge funds.
Also, drug manufacturers were able to basically drop everything else they were working on and put all of their scientists on this one task around the clock, Yancey added.
I call on Senator-elect Warnock to make voting rights and democracy a top priority as he enters his term in the U.S. Senate, her statement read. As long as voter suppression efforts continue, our people risk being silenced. It's time to make our most basic American right permanent: the right to vote, and the right to choose our elected officials.
Five years in the making, the proposed National Social Registry has thus far been described by the Indian press as a routine exercise to update the 2011 Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) to prevent the misuse of pro-poor government schemes by ensuring that benefits and entitlements reach the right people. The fact that the Ministry of Rural Development is responsible for the SECC has helped further this impression that the SECC update is an innocuous bureaucratic task.
SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — After Brigham Young University two weeks ago dropped a section from its strict code of conduct that had prohibited all expressions of homosexual behavior, bisexual music major Caroline McKenzie felt newfound hope that she could stop hiding and be herself.

I feel the Sunrise Movement and their proposed Green New Deal is a genuinely exciting new development, Ed Maibach, a climate communications researcher at George Mason University, said by email. If the folks in the Sunrise Movement get out there and sell their idea to Americans before their opponents attempt to shoot it down, 2019 may prove to be an unexpectedly auspicious moment for climate solutions in America.
Parrow said he wants younger gay athletes to not give up on their dreams.
De l'aveu des proches du président de la République, cette imperméabilité à la pression est vécue comme une gifle. On se doutait qu'il ne renoncerait pas à être candidat, mais on ne s'attendait pas à une telle déclaration, à fleur de peau, une sorte de gigantesque bras d'honneur fait au président, souligne au Monde un visiteur du Château.
As the virus reaches more countries, Hajdu said, travellers should recognize there could be a risk if they leave Canada.
For me, this pressure has always manifested in the form of a singular, overarching goal throughout different junctures of my life. As a youth, I was expected to graduate at the top of my high school class and get into an Ivy League university. In my 20s, I had to land a well-paying job and establish a solid career. And now, in my 30s, I needed to find a life partner they approved of and get married. Done, done and done.

The Pyeongchang Games are her first Olympics since becoming a parent, and already the experience feels quite different, Randall said.
The union has also been disappointed by the relative quiet from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Perrone said he would like to see the agency ramping up safety enforcement in grocery stores and plants but sees little evidence that is happening.
Much like Prohibition (of alcohol) before it, though, this is becoming increasingly nothing more than a scofflaw, to varying degrees. It is now easier to keep track of the states which have not legalized at least medicinal marijuana, since there are fewer of them than those that have (21 versus 29 that have legalized some form of medical use). This strikes to the very core of the federal law against marijuana which states that marijuana (or sometimes marihuana, reflecting the increasingly ancient nature of these federal laws) has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States. When almost six out of ten states have medicinal marijuana laws on the books, that statement is now nothing short of patently and laughably absurd.

Usually, when you define your happiness and achievement islands, you realize something simple and wonderful. The causes of high happiness and achievement are less mysterious than you may have thought. Either the normal conditions for your happiness or achievement are met; or they are not. It may not always be easy to engineer the conditions, but the route is straightforward. For maximum happiness you may need to move city or country. You may need to stop spending a lot of time with people you don't really like and spend it with the few people who inspire you. You may need to change your boss, your job, or even your career. But once you have made the decision to do what is necessary to achieve great things or become much happier, you have reached a critical turning-point in your life. You may go and live on your islands forever.

Especially when you're making a movie like this in a very short amount of time on a very low budget, you need to firstly cast people who you know are brilliant, and I think every actor in this is brilliant. And I think often comedy actors don't get an opportunity to show that so much. But I certainly, in my experience, think that comedy actors are willing to go places and have a lack of inhibition that's really amazing. So I didn't mean for it to be meta, I suppose, but the quicker you can put people in a headspace, the better.

When you have a rescuer, they pride themselves on being there to support you, so you really don't have any space not only to make mistakes, but you also have a limited amount of growth, Brown said. Because part of rescuing, or being helpful, is a control mechanism for them.
Trump's other actions have undermined enforcement, too. Within a week of taking office, he signed a sweeping executive order that, among other things, did away with Obama-era prosecutorial discretion guidelines that had directed ICE to focus its arrests on people with serious criminal records, recent border-crossers or people with previous deportations on their records. The message, which Trump's first acting director of ICE, Thomas Homan, repeated often, was clear: No one would be exempt from enforcement of federal law.

We've increased the amount of security both in the airports and in the sky, seen and unseen, and we're going to be taking some additional measures in the coming days as we look to the week ahead.
The news clip, a brief entry in Neil Rubin's Names & Faces column, epitomizes the way many mainstream media publications in the 1990s and early aughts addressed the then-rumored marriage between R. Kelly and Aaliyah. Rubin doesn't express particular concern about the alleged union of a grown man and a girl under the age of legal consent; despite being a journalist, he doesn't attempt to confirm or deny the persistent speculation.
In Nebraska, the Department of Correctional Services bypassed the legislative process when it announced last month that all generic tampons and pads will be provided for free and that it will only charge inmates for name-brand supplies. The decision came after the Nebraska ACLU chapter raised concerns last October about incarcerated women's access to such products in the state.

It would not make me feel comfortable being a black young man in the South, in a mostly white neighborhood, with my teachers being armed, said Koerber, who has started an organization to promote mental health education in schools.
James Weldon Johnson, the president of the NAACP, wrote to President Calvin Coolidge in 1925, warning that Black voters planned to vote against candidates supported by the Ku Klux Klan. The NAACP and its leaders were demanding that the Republican Party denounce the racist organization, to no avail. (Trump infamously refused to condemn the KKK on television in 2016.)
Views are again highly partisan, with 87% of Democrats and just 21% of Republicans saying the president did not do enough to condemn the events of Wednesday. Nearly three-quarters of Democrats, compared to 12% of Republicans, say Trump encourages violence from his supporters.
Rollins told Fox News' Lou Dobbs on Friday: If you're going to put her out front with her mouth ... the little girl who wants pre-Reagan economics of 70 percent taxes, the Democratic women are basically going to be damaged.
Manitoba occupies an important and valued geographic position in the country. It's fair to describe Manitoba as being in the heart of the country and co-operating with the premier is really valuable to us.
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) released a strongly-worded statement declaring, there is no place in the Republican Party, the Congress or the country for an ideology of racial supremacy of any kind…Rep. King's statements are unwelcome and unworthy of his elected position. I wonder, does Leader McConnell's sentiments extend to Republican Mississippi Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, who in November said of a supporter, If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be on the front row?

While there certainly are a number of people whom it could be pointed to, none, so far as I'm concerned, deserve the same level of scrutiny as the previous subject, Lazar said. Time may change that.
Zinke, a former Montana congressman and Navy SEAL, faced nearly 20 federal investigations. Several are ongoing, and one has been referred by Interior's internal watchdog to the Justice Department for possible criminal violations.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is urging Republicans not to try to overturn the election, but not everyone is heeding him. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri vows to join House Republicans in objecting to the state tallies. On the other side of the party's split, GOP Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska warns such challenges are a dangerous ploy threatening the nation's civic norms.
We're not complaining, though. We actually really love cozy sweaters ― if you ask us, the chunkier the knit the better ― and it seems the fashionable folks on Instagram do too. We've been seeing tons of our favorite style stars on the photo-sharing app rocking the style, and we also saw plenty of chunky knits on the fall 2018 runways at the likes of Vivienne Tam, Fendi and Isabel Marant. (Can you tell we're a little obsessed?)
In part, that is because there are still a lot of questions about how long natural immunity lasts, as well as how robust it is. But the evidence shows the vaccines are very good at prompting a significant immune response.

Jafar told her sister that a woman constable had ripped out her hair and clawed her face. That was after male constables had beaten her with batons on her back and kicked her in the stomach.
Had [the abuse] occurred in 2018 everybody would know, and there likely would have been some handheld device that captured it, Neal said. It's really not until the videotape emerges that we start to get a different type of narrative attached to R. Kelly.
• What went wrong: Kelly wanted, and was given, almost complete control over the franchise's personnel decisions ahead of this season. The power grab negated any work Kelly had done as coach over the 2013 and '14 campaigns.
It is my responsibility as a senator to raise their concerns, Hawley wrote late Saturday.
Indeed, shippers with first-hand or studied knowledge of history understand painfully the flight of investment capital and rail service deterioration in the pre-1980 Staggers Act era when regulators substituted their decisions for arms-length negotiations between those buying and selling rail transportation.
Donkey may also have memories of being human. The Redditor points out how a scene of Donkey remembering wedgies and swirlies gets weird:
I won't go so far as to call them old friends - tight bunch as they are, the gang of wild turkeys that occasionally wander up into the streets of my Brookline neighborhood don't seem much interested in fellowship beyond their own kind. But at least they don't startle me quite as much as the first time we crossed paths.

In other words, there should not be additional roadblocks for pregnant women who want to get vaccinated.
Being in the same bed at the same time as your partner increases the likelihood of having sexual contact. If you find yourself avoiding going to bed until after your partner is asleep, you may be consciously (or subconsciously) decreasing the odds of having sex. You need to ask yourself some tough questions: Why don't I want to be awake in the same bed at the same time as my partner? Are there aspects of my sex life that are disappointing or anxiety-provoking? Avoiding may feel easier than hurting your partner's feelings, but an honest conversation (first with yourself and then with your partner) may keep you from ending up in a sexless marriage. ― Resnick Anderson

I think the job of a journalist is to tell the whole truth, if they know something, if you have real facts and real sources, Powell said. Part of the challenge with R. Kelly for many years[...] is that there were all kinds of enablers around him, and it appeared that many people who made allegations or knew things were paid off. On top of that fame, celebrity, is a very destructive thing. People turn their heads and ignore things because of their addiction to the famous, to celebrities.

A good job is hard to come by. A great job is even harder to find, but when you do, you feel like a part of the fabric that makes up the organization. When you have a winning job your purpose becomes a lot more clear, and you have far more responsibility than punching a clock, following a set of procedures and collecting a paycheck.
He is 6'2 with clear blue eyes and an uncommon steadiness and more strength and integrity than anyone I've ever met. I was there in June when a hospice nurse told us it would likely be less than a week or so until the end, and after the nurse left, I could hear him sobbing in the room where she was laying as I waited downstairs. Never once pushing her to abide by his own plans and always holding steady in the hard work of compassion.
It is connected to GSP because GSP is a preferential trade arrangement only for the developing countries. Now, when Indian negotiators go back to the table and say that we want GSP back, the Americans will say that you are classified as a developed country from now on. That is the American way of negotiating that has increasingly come to the fore under Robert Lighthizer (United States Trade Representative). This is classic American conservatism on trade.
They are sending the message: don't mess with us; we are not afraid of anything you can do to us, said Malley, who previously served on Obama's National Security Council.
Et quand bien même, il suffit de peu pour créer une rupture de stock, comme on a pu le voir en Australie où les supermarchés ont été obligés de rationner le papier toilette.

The effort in the Senate was being led by Sens. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Hawley defended his actions in a lengthy email to colleagues, explaining that his Missouri constituents have been loud and clear with their belief that Biden's defeat of Trump was unfair.
That popularity is reflected in the growing number of likely presidential contenders endorsing a Green New Deal with varying degrees of couched language.
It's totally normal to feel anxious in the face of a possible pandemic. However, the No. 1 thing most experts stress right now is there is no need to panic.
The conversations on social media have been powerful and incredibly important, said Kristen Houser, spokesperson for RALIANCE, an organization dedicated to ending sexual violence in one generation. Specifically for naming the role racism plays in making the victimization of black women and girls invisible or unworthy of the kind of attention that sexual abuse has received when the victims are mostly white.
I wasn't an Economics major, or as my professor would say, The Art of Making People Buy Stuff They Don't Need major. I studied education and later race in graduate school. And I'd like to think my business and where I am fixated on making change occur in those two realms. Had I not worked in education for nearly twenty years, I wouldn't have been able to see where those points are, and probably would not have been as effective in doing so. So I believe there is something to experience. But earning degrees in those areas has allowed me to think more broadly, much further than what my experience--while lengthy, it is still limited to me--would have told me.
If your mother is elderly or vulnerable, then I am afraid all the statistics show that she is much more likely to die from coronavirus, or COVID-19. We cannot disguise or sugarcoat the threat, he said.
The point is that stereotypes are just that. Sometimes they are correct. Many times they aren't. You don't want to be stereotyped by your generation, right? Then don't do so with others.
In Alberta, the Liberals are facing the decision to approve or reject a $20.6-billion oilsands mine near Fort McMurray. A government report found that Alberta's oilsands are releasing an average of one-third more carbon dioxide per oil barrel than they report.

Starting a new project. Whether it's initiating a remodeling project, cleaning and organizing the house, or taking up a new hobby, staying inside during cold days can be productive. Many fun and exciting projects can be born during winter hibernations.

The New York Times notes there are about 5,400 inmates in the city's jails, many who are housed at Rikers. Visits to inmates in all city jails were suspended on March 18 due to concerns about the outbreak, although the DOC said phone calls were now free of charge.
And I think the experience that we've seen is that unless we are going to be aggressive about climate change, unless we're going to have a real plan for education and the economy of the future, young people will vote elsewhere.

New Year's Day is on a weekend this year. It's the perfect time to reflect about the past year and come up with a list of goals for 2016.

A spokesperson for the National Rifle Association quickly denounced the proposal, calling it an effort to score political points and arguing that so-called universal background checks will never be universal because criminals do not comply with the law.

The idea of what I call the non-latte factor, is to recognize that if you are going to cut back, it's your big expenses you need to look at, not your small expenses. I say that knowing that it is rather hard to do. But I say it because I think we get into this cycle where we constantly blame ourselves, and I don't think that is very good for anybody. I don't think it gets us anywhere, or it really addresses our problem.

Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.), Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) and Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) voted present.
The convening of the joint session to count the Electoral College votes has faced objections before. In 2017, several House Democrats challenged Trump's win but Biden, who presided at the time as the vice president, swiftly dismissed them to assert Trump's victory. Rarely have the protests approached this level of intensity.

The perception that pocketbook issues motivated Trump voters likely comes from the fact that Americans with less education did tend to vote for him in 2016 and 2020, she said. But their motivating factor wasn't about, say, the rising cost of health insurance. Lower education also correlates with what she calls group animosity, fear of the other.

On the Sunday morning of our wedding, I finally found the right words to express what I felt. I realized I wanted to tell them that I had been watching them, observing quietly and learning from the way their relationship grew through the years. Under a canopy of lush red florals, I told the story of my parents' whirlwind romance: How they met during a typhoon, married after three months of dating and moved to a new country together. I shared that they were not college-educated but had forged fulfilling careers for themselves in Dallas, where my father runs the city's leading Chinese newspaper and my mother found her calling as a professional bridal seamstress.
In a statement posted online on Dec. 23, Thompson and her husband thanked RZIM employees who questioned the organization's handling of the case.

Looking at the goal to make sure it's achievable is important. If you say for the next 365 days I'm not going to do something and on the third day of January you do it, you'll be inclined to quit. You want to try to develop a trend, not an all-or-nothing situation. If you relapse, it's important to recognize it and then commit yourself to the habits that worked. A lot of people will stop and say I was really good at this for six months and I've lost 15 pounds, and then I noticed during the seventh month that I lightened up a bit and I put back on three pounds.

The magazine largely treated feminist critiques of the issue with similar mockery and disdain. In that same 1989 piece, SI reporter Frank Deford argued that today ... some zealots paint anything sensual with the broad brush of sexism, before using a purported increase in breast augmentation surgeries to prove that if the swimsuit issue became a relic or disappeared altogether, it would only be because women had parroted its aesthetic.

The movement took root locally, too. In 2019, City Council lawmakers enacted a package of measures requiring landlords to slash climate pollution from the city's biggest buildings, making it easier to build solar panels and small turbines on rooftops, and establishing a new loan program for renewable energy. Months later, New York state passed one of the ambitious climate laws in the country, mandating a carbon-neutral economy in less than 30 years.
We've always told ourselves that oatmeal cookies are practically a health food, with all those oats and that dried fruit. Truth is, though, they're often loaded with white sugar. This healthier twist on the classic recipe includes a dash of molasses, plus one-third cup each of maple syrup and maple sugar, which is prepared from the sap of the sugar maple tree and pours like granulated sugar. And just to change things up, it uses dried plums (aka prunes) instead of raisins.

Australia's Foreign Minister Marise Payne has advised elderly people strongly rethink any cruise travel.
This is the biggest issue in American politics today, Steyer said. We have a lawless president in the White House who is eroding our democracy and it is only going to get worse. Donald Trump's removal from power ultimately decides whether or not we can tackle every other challenge we face in America — and whether or not we continue to live in a democracy of, for, and by the people.

When you get the vaccine, because you're just making the immune response to the part of the spike protein — which is the target for preventing infection — your immune response is entirely focused on responding to just that key part of the virus. So you get this really, really strong, really focused response against the right part, Iovine said. That's why people who have had COVID infection should still benefit from the vaccine.
The notion that none of the woman's caregivers knew she was pregnant has drawn skepticism. But medical experts say it's possible she displayed no outward signs that workers would have noticed, especially by those who don't work with pregnant patients.
So, Oscars producers licking their wounds after Kevin Hart stepped down from the job, listen up: Hire no one. You don't need a host. You only need presenters. Funny ones, yes.

So what do you do to increase your happiness? As the late, great Peter Drucker used to say, to ask the question is to answer it. You spend more time on the things that make you happy. When I am about to die, I shall remember these happy times and feel I have had a good life: and I will not be wishing I spent more time in the office or doing things I never really enjoyed.
So what are these top three states doing right? There's no single answer and, as with the international data, it's possible some state reporting is incomplete or slow, making it hard to draw definitive conclusions. But a common factor seems to be their approach to nursing homes. Most states in the U.S. are relying heavily on CVS and Walgreens, which are the official partners of the Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed. But because CVS and Walgreens don't always have a presence in rural areas, those three states are relying more heavily on other providers to reach nursing homes.

In 2011, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's United Progressive Alliance government embarked on India's first caste-based census since 1931. The 2011 SECC, as its name makes clear, was a census, not a survey: this meant the government sought to collect data on the caste, incomes and set social parameters of every single Indian citizen.

The president certainly didn't invent racism.

Though Tarantino defended his on-set behavior in a lengthy interview with Deadline's Mike Fleming Jr., and both Thurman and Kruger went on to praise his direction on Instagram, the public reckoning with his oeuvre had already begun; plenty of naysayers jumped on the opportunity to admit that they'd always hated his movies.
But I miss the kids. I miss my colleagues. I miss the pieces of literature I used to teach, and I miss getting eighth graders ready for writing papers in high school. I miss the time between the bells when, every 40 minutes, I did a soft reboot and started over with a fresh group of faces. I missed the hard reboot and total reset every summer when I prepared for the new school year and new literature units.
Our suggestion was to create one common register of all eligible families for all the subsidies and welfare schemes using the SECC, which can be constantly updated, so that there is convergence of the schemes, Himanshu told HuffPost India in an interview. But the government never got back to us.
Vegan Oreos are nice, but are they worth creating a whole vegan kickstart program and website? Once the giddiness of their idea wore off, the York-based couple weren't sure, either. When they debuted Veganuary in 2013, Land prayed a hundred people would pledge. Glover was pushing for a thousand. After 3,000 people pledged, they realized, the world was ready for a vegan month, says Land. We ploughed the rest of our savings into building a much bigger and better website.

Still, it's possible that President Donald Trump's goal was never realistic, given the challenges of launching such a massive program in a country with such a notoriously underfunded public sector. The pace is picking up now and, in a few parts of the country, states are well on their way to vaccinating the highest priority groups.

The Trump administration has repeatedly pointed to declines in U.S. carbon emissions to justify its fossil fuel-focused energy dominance agenda. But a new analysis has delivered a blow to that defense, concluding that the nation's greenhouse gas emissions rose sharply in 2018.
It could not be clearer that there are different rules for domestic terrorists who are white and Black Lives Matter activists and their allies. Even the regular rules that apply to ordinary activists and advocates like me were swept aside.

The results are stunning: more than 30 large earthquakes, of magnitudes 6 to 6.7, broke the Fucino faults over the past 15,000 of years. Each large earthquake identified by the method was actually not a single event, but a cascade of several strong earthquakes that followed along a fault, probably over a few years or decades, to break it entirely. These cascades recall the one we are seeing today.
I got a commitment from President Bush he was not going to go to war in Iraq, said Biden. He looked me in the eye in the Oval Office; he said he needed the vote (authorizing the war) to be able to get inspectors into Iraq to determine whether or not (Iraqi dictator) Saddam Hussein was engaged in dealing with a nuclear program.

Hasen understands that getting any changes in campaign financing through Congress and the courts won't be easy. His own proposals will almost certainly not command majorities in the House of Representatives or the Senate - and if they did wouldn't pass muster with the Supreme Court. And with good reason. Hasen deems a constitutional amendment on campaign finances a non-starter, especially when a solid majority of state legislatures are controlled by Republicans. An amendment, moreover, could well do more harm than good. The original language recently crafted by Senate Democrats, for example, seemed to give local, state, and federal legislatures far too much latitude to suppress political speech. A draft put forward by the group Move to Amend, Hasen indicates, did not include a press exemption, raising serious questions about whether a state could stop the New York Times or Fox News from covering an election. The simplistic amendment proposed from former Justice John Paul Stevens allows reasonable limits on campaign contributions but does not define reasonable.

She's charming and delightful in many ways, he said of Ocasio-Cortez. She got an economics degree from Boston University and she clearly doesn't understand how the unemployment rate works. She said that it's low because so many people have two jobs. Now, how do you get an economics degree from a major college and not understand that that's not how the unemployment rate works? How is that possible?
Professor Gita Ramjee is a towering HIV prevention research leader whose work continues to contribute immensely to the global response to curb the HIV/AIDS epidemic, Gray had said after the Indian-origin scientist received the award.
Many saw this coming. The rioters had been planning in plain sight. But perhaps Black Americans were the least surprised by the day's events. The precedent had been set, time and again. We don't have to look back that far for reminders: Whether in 1900, or 1925, or 1939, or 1965, or 2020, white terror has been deeply embedded in American culture, especially in the face of Black progress and the quest for freedom and equality.
You're going to have a nice brisk immune response, Yancey said. So yes, your arm is going to hurt. Yes, you're probably going to run some fevers and feel achey for a few days. That is a good thing. That means you're getting a good immune uptake and you're going to get that high level of protection.

As president, Trump has frequently showcased his golf resorts in Scotland and Ireland, which have struggled financially. He took an entourage to Doonbeg after a state visit with Queen Elizabeth II last year. Vice President Mike Pence went three hours out of his way to stay at Trump's resort in Doonbeg last year, even though he had traveled to Ireland to meet with the nation's prime minister in Dublin. The U.S. Air Force spent nearly $200,000 at Trump's Turnberry resort for lodging during refueling stops at a small airport near the resort.

For instance, in the U.S. the largest retailer of organic food is Walmart. As people started to consume organic food and demand organic food, companies competed to provide it, and Walmart is the biggest one out there. In many ways, it's empowering to recognize that ultimately the economy reflects our decisions and our choices, and that can be small choices like what milk you buy or major choices of where you choose to work and how we choose to save and invest. That's the power we have as consumers, investors and as voters.
Wheeler has faced his own controversies. As HuffPost reported in October, the agency chief repeatedly engaged with incendiary, partisan content on his personal Facebook and Twitter accounts over the past five years. The online activity included liking a racist image of former President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama on Facebook and retweeting an infamous Pizzagate conspiracy theorist. At least two Democratic senators called on him to resign.
Prior to his diagnosis, we mostly knew about Type 2 diabetes. It's not uncommon to hear about family members with Type 2 diabetes, especially in communities of color, and it's the one featured in most commercials and information for the public. If you don't believe me, entertain yourself by looking at the lack of information about Type 1 on the American Diabetes Association's website.

We are moving forward, but we are not moving forward in a detrimental impact to our economy as what the Paris climate accord would have called for, Wheeler said. We are reducing our CO2 emissions faster than most other developed countries. We have our own plan. We're moving forward. We're addressing the issue.
My oldest daughter is a miniature version of me -- she feels to the extreme and will often tell me she's scared when faced with new situations -- trying to avoid whatever it is that is new or a challenge. I used to tell her: Don't be scared -- be brave! But the longer I run, the more I have come to realize: fear, doubt, worry -- are all emotions that come with being human. And while I no longer dwell in those feelings or resist them, I accept them. I let them come--and then I release them.
OTTAWA — President Donald Trump's decision to order the killing of a top Iranian general has elevated his disregard of Canada and other American allies to a new level, says Barack Obama's former envoy to Ottawa.
I am not always welcome at a party. I can feel it. I forget that I am not supposed to talk about these things in an ordinary way. The person typically heads for the bar and rarely returns to continue the conversation.
To date, the same Oversight Republicans who were so willing to attack Obama have been silent about Trump, silent about Bannon's intervention, and silent about Ross' false testimony before Congress. Committee Democrats have diligently pursued the issue and made multiple requests for hearings and subpoenas. Oversight Republicans ignored them and did nothing. That's all about to change.
Over the past year, we encouraged dialogue with the Indian's organization about the Club's use of the Chief Wahoo logo. During our constructive conversations, [team owner] Paul Dolan made clear that there are fans who have a longstanding attachment to the logo and its place in the history of the team, Manfred continued. Nonetheless, the club ultimately agreed with my position that the logo is no longer appropriate for on-field use … and I appreciate Mr. Dona's acknowledgement that removing it from the on-field uniform by the start of the 2019 season is the right course.

Political circumstances are different now. Democrats hold the House majority and, as Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office confirmed to The Washington Post on Thursday, at least two committees will hold hearings on Medicare for All this year. Exactly what those hearings will entail isn't clear ― Democratic leaders aren't saying ― but one focus will be a bill that Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) plans to introduce in the next few weeks.

We strive to provide a welcoming environment and to show respect for all customers. We did not live up to our values in this situation, the statement read. We recognize these steps alone won't change the broader systemic and cultural biases that plague our society, but we believe that together they demonstrate the seriousness with which we take these issues and our desire to be a part of the solution.
In the most painful way, pandemics show us what we need to fix in our world. The stress they cause reveals all those parts that most need repair. With COVID, we have seen how festering economic, health and social disparities can blow up in our face. These injustices are the fissures through which pandemics, climate change and other threats to our health course through. At the same time, we can now see that the very actions we need to address the climate crisis, namely lesser reliance on fossil fuels and preventing deforestation, can forestall the next pandemic and promote a healthier, more just and sustainable world.
I... right now.. this is me.. I'm over it, he said. I'm done, he added. I did it. I'm over it. There is no more that I can do.
Proponents of the new policy tout the flexibility it provides states to remake their health care programs for low-income people, but the reality is that flexibility would translate into states cutting enrollment, cutting benefits or both.
Romney's in isolation? Gee, that's too bad, Trump replied. He said his response was not sarcastic.

However, internal documents made public revealed that Ross was taking steps to add the citizenship question long before the Justice Department's December 2017 request.

What I've realized this year — and what I knew in my heart that I've had to practice much more literally — is that what people think of this movie is none of my business and completely their right, Fennell told me. There was a version of this movie that could have been made that would have been a lot less likely to have think pieces, and that would have, I hope, been good, too. But that's not what we wanted to make at all.

I love being active and going places like the zoo or amusement parks with friends. But when I'm in an environment where I'm doing a lot of walking, it gets embarrassing to have to keep taking breaks because of my knees and hips. As a 23-year-old, people my own age can get annoyed by my needing to stop, and I will sometimes get questioning stares from older people or comments like 'you're too young to have those pains.' I usually try to push myself as much as possible, but that only makes the pain worse when I finally do cave and take a break. – Shelby C.

The Luxurious (And Insanely Easy) Spoonable Treat
There was a few things. I think, firstly, I really wanted the whole film to feel part of Cassie's life and Cassie's journey. She's learned to subvert her femininity and her prettiness and her blondness to effectively hide and mislead — like lots of addicts do, actually. I very much think of her as an addict. And so she's just learned the tricks to keep things functioning on the surface, to stop people from asking too many questions. For me, if she's fluffy and pink and welcoming but she's boiling with this terrible rage, then I think it was important that the film itself reflected that, that it felt just as inviting as her and just as misleading as she is.

The findings mirror larger global trends. Natural disasters cost insurance companies a record $135 billion in 2017, according to figures released last week by Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurer. Counting uninsured losses, that figure climbed to $330 billion. The only costlier year was 2011, when the Tohoku earthquake in Japan contributed to a total of $354 billion. Disasters in the U.S. made up 50 percent of this year's losses, the German company said, compared to 32 percent on average years.

First, what's normal kid stuff for you as a parent won't be the same for another parent. With that being said, most parents correct their children because they are either doing something wrong (like hitting someone, being mean, etc.) or they've picked the wrong time and place to do that normal kid stuff. Doesn't it seem as though kids have the most energy and things to say at the most awkward time? And then once that happens, we spend so much time correcting them that we end up having to leave the place where we're at or resort to staying and having a stressful time. Kids!!!!

These segments are separated with specific zones - which fault specialists call inter-segments. Their mechanical properties differ from those of the segments. Yet the mechanical properties of the inter-segments are modified as the number of earthquakes on the overall fault increases over time.
I think the community as a whole perpetuates a sense that desirability itself only comes with a six-pack and chiseled good looks, we see this on every dating app where men will openly and unapologetically write Muscular, fit men ONLY or no fats, disguising their fat-phobia and racism as just their preference. And it's so ironic because we're a community that's built on the notion of inclusion and acceptance, but sometimes it feels like belonging comes with a requirement of being white and having a six-pack. And I think one of the worst things about the LGBTQ community is that these problematic attitudes are so normalized, and even though so many of us publicly talk about how harmful these attitudes are, they still persist.

Trump, who continues to lie about the so-called fraud that he said cost him reelection, has also floated the idea that he will run for president again in 2024. Possibly to that end, he created a leadership committee on Nov. 9 and began raising money for it through one of the joint fundraising committees his campaign created with the RNC.
@SuspendThePres was created by Andrew Lazar in May as an experiment to see if Twitter's algorithms would flag Trump's tweets as inappropriate if they came from the account of a regular citizen, rather than from the account of the U.S. president.
Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who resigned Jan. 2 under a cloud of ethics scandals, told the National Petroleum Council last month that the administration's regulatory philosophy is to partner with the fossil fuel sector, which he said was at the leading edge of technology. The U.S. has lead the charge in cutting emissions of CO2 and methane, a potent greenhouse gas, he added.
It feels like a brand-new day. For the first time in six years, Democrats will operate a majority in the United States Senate ― and that will be very good for the American people, Schumer said in a statement on Wednesday after Warnock and Ossoff both declared victory.
And the Plan was without substance.
Also, any assessment of U.S. performance has to take into account how other countries are doing. It turns out the U.S. is faring pretty well, relatively speaking. In fact, shots are getting into arms faster than in most of Western Europe, at least according to the available data.
And as I negotiated these topics on a personal and professional level, saw the enthusiasm in which the topic was met over mama coffees, drinks and dinners, I knew the black hole had to be filled with our stories. Our stories --- sad, funny, touching and sometimes fantastically gross --- that are at the core of the circle of life. The stories that bind us, and remind us how perfectly normal all of it is in this adventure of grown up womanhood.
If you're concerned about whether your clothes will come out of a shared laundry machine safely, Dr. Georgine Nanos said not to worry.
It gives me no pleasure to tell you what most of you already know, and that is that President Trump lies all of the time, Sanders said, his voice rising. In his remarks tonight and in recent weeks regarding immigration and the wall, he continues to lie.
Turkey insists its military actions are aimed at Kurdish fighters in Syria — the Syrian Kurdish Peoples Protection Units, or YPG — whom it regards as terrorists, and not against the Kurdish people. That has been Ankara longtime position and Turkey rejected any role for Kurdish fighters in restoring peace to the war-torn region.
The irony is that if we don't implement aggressive community interventions and mitigate the spread of the virus already in the United States, we will end up infecting or reinfecting Europe. #coronavirus — Thomas P. Bossert (@TomBossert) March 12, 2020
She taught my brother and me that if you want to make a change in your life, in your community, you don't wait, you work, Julián Castro said of his mother in the video. So I'm taking a lesson from my mother — if we want to see a change in this country, we don't wait. We work. We make our future happen.

So it just hit me that it's been a month — to the day — since we last spoke on the phone. Man, it's a completely different world. How are you doing?
3. That the seemingly easy things would be so hard. I'll probably never forget buying my first pair of maternity jeans. I went to Target because I couldn't handle walking into a maternity store. I frantically searched through the jeans, praying that no one would approach me.
There's a tremor in the force. Innovation is about to democratize philanthropy.
1. The new live services have buffering issues.
The palace's statement makes it clear that the move won't happen right away, Harris said.
But the biggest point to draw from this past year is that solidarity actually matters. We've lived, since President Ronald Reagan, in an era of anti-solidarity: Government is the problem; market forces solve all problems. Reagan's big laugh line was always, The nine scariest words in the English language are 'I'm from the government and I'm here to help.'
These are the underpinnings of the Income and Market Approaches to valuation.

Have you ever wondered why your face looks just a little different in photos than it does reflected in the mirror?
Changing yourself and how you treat and react to your partner will directly impact how your partner treats and reacts to you!
For me, if you did grow up poor or working class and even middle class, you probably graduated with a college degree and have sizable debt and there are still white people without degrees that will make more money than you. So no matter how far you go, the rug can be pulled out from under you in a second. That's what we're seeing right now.
We need #MedicareForAll. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) February 25, 2020
In the last two decades, 13 percent of the state has burned. In 2018 alone, more than 7,500 fires scorched a total 1.67 million acres, killing dozens of people and causing billions of dollars in damage. Records set in 2017 fell just one year later.
I'm strongly positioned to be able to do all of those things and prepare us for what I call 'the fight of our lives.'
However, while Nanos agreed about washing clothes in hot water, she warned against boiling them in high temperatures.
It may have escaped our attention that we are now free to read any of these books. Previously it would have been necessary to be a devotee of a particular faith before we could have access to its sacred texts. Not only that, only a few hundred years ago not many people could read, but also, only the religious leaders were allowed to read these sacred texts to their followers according to certain guidelines.
My goal this year is to use new materials. 2015 was the year of marble for me and I am challenging myself to dive into new materials. Looking towards materials like bronze and plaster for the upcoming year.
But a Medicare for All system, like any complex policy enterprise, would entail difficult trade-offs. At some point advocates need to figure out how they want to handle those, how they'll overcome the inevitable political resistance to what they decide and which parts of their vision matter to them most.
Exactly. As a Steelers assistant coach, Munchak had no reason for putting his hands on a Bengals player in such a purposefully harmful, disrespectful way. And, as a Steelers assistant coach, he should have reacted with poise, especially because each team was warned in the pre-game warmups to avoid nonsense, per Bleacher Report's Mike Freeman. Before a December matchup between the two teams, a scrap occurred at midfield on the eve of the kickoff.
And second, for young people especially, it's just so important to get some money saved in retirement accounts. The benefits of compound interests in there is just extraordinary. Letting that go, or even foregoing that for even 10 years can really cost a lot of money.
The Biden team has said that its goal is 100 million vaccine doses within the first 100 days. That's not as audacious a goal as it seems, even though press reports suggest that members of the transition are worried about reaching it. The figure works out to a million a day, which isn't that far from where the vaccination effort is now. To reach herd immunity by summer, the pace probably needs to be twice as fast ― at least.
I feel like the ship is coming around right as it needs to. Knowing this is my last Olympics, I really want to leave everything out on the trail and leave with no regrets.
The world, after all, doesn't have to be like this, and our lives don't have to be so cramped and so fearful. All but the very richest of us know that one bad biopsy could shatter any hope of financial security we have. This year we have been ravaged as a country by fire and flood, and such events are set only to escalate, jeopardizing a future for our children and theirs. 113 million Americans have a loved one who is incarcerated; every day, 118 of us die of a drug overdose; every day, the CEO of Goldman Sachs makes $65,000; over 30,000 of us die of gun violence annually; and while we live, most of us are treading water so hard we don't have time to draw breath.
But does that mean people are inclined to let the Republicans off easy? The Post/ABC survey, which instead ties Trump and the congressional GOP together, finds them mutually shouldering the blame. And in the HuffPost/YouGov poll, GOP legislators' overall marks on the shutdown are actually worse than either Trump's or their Democratic counterparts'.
The fatigue. When it strikes, I have to sit down immediately, regardless of where I am. – Lisa T.
We're bringing the fight against climate change straight to the fossil fuel companies that knew about its effects and intentionally misled the public to protect their profits, de Blasio said in a statement ahead of Wednesday's press conference. As climate change continues to worsen, it's up to the fossil fuel companies whose greed put us in this position to shoulder the cost of making New York safer and more resilient.
I would recommend that you wash clothes in detergents that contain a bleach compound, Rohde told HuffPost. Viruses do not do well at all in this type of harsh environment.
So I whispered to my sister, my parents, my best friend: Does this seem right? Does this seem real? Do I seem happy?
My heart is broken. It makes me to sad to believe how naive I was to think this couldn't possibly happen, and yet it did. Here we are.

But not everyone is so confident. At least one prominent economist believes that this latest civil unrest will play a role in convincing investors to put their money elsewhere. If you could invest anywhere in the world, why would you want to invest in the U.S. when there are safer environments? asked Carl Weinberg, chief economist and founder of the research group High Frequency Economics.
Everybody has kids ― we should have a day school [at the 'Grey's' set]. It's anybody who's here longer than two years is pregnant probably the third year — that's how it's working out. It's amazing. Come here and you'll have children.
Thunberg fired back on Twitter, They are starting to get more and more desperate… This shows that we're winning. Canadian politicians spoke out against the sticker, including unanimously passing a motion in the House of Commons to condemn it.
Trevor Noah's team on Friday released its own spoof version of the Black Mirror movie Bandersnatch, the choose-your-own-adventure movie that was released on Netflix late December.
This season certainly could have turned out in different fashion for the Giants, glaring roster flaws and all. Eight of their 10 losses came by a touchdown or less, including an OT setback against the Jets that all but ended the Giants' playoff hopes. Close losses to Dallas and Atlanta at the season's onset came with the help of some clock mismanagement, an issue that thrust Coughlin even more firmly onto the hot seat.
An AP investigation found the government imposed controls on research into the outbreak and bars scientists from speaking to reporters.
The men followed in Higgs' van and picked them up. Higgs drove the van into the Patuxent wildlife refuge, a federal property within the jurisdiction of the United States Park Police. At some point, the van stopped. The women got out. It was there that Haynes shot them.
Still, the idea churned inside of me. I spent the summer taking care of myself by keeping this secret just for me. I needed something to hold onto and cuddle, and not ask for permission from other people. I needed time to think it through, and enjoy it. I needed privacy, which is something I had never learned to exercise before, never in my whole life. I gave myself permission to lie, and skirt the truth and obfuscate. I gave myself a chance to grow by making a choice that was only about me and what I needed and did not owe anything to anyone else. I didn't even tell Stace, who was the other half of the equation.
Kimberly Archie is the founder of the National Cheer Safety Foundation and a leading expert on the prevention of child athlete maltreatment. Her legal work has been used to settle more than 50 sports injury lawsuits since 2008.
New parents balance it all and then some: ever-changing sleeping and eating schedules, doctor's appointments, running errands with a fussy baby. It's exhausting, mostly thankless work, and it can drive you up the wall if your partner isn't helping.
There are now more than 201,000 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus across the world, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. At least 8,000 people have died from COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, and over 82,000 have recovered from it, the university reported.

While some First Nation communities have reached agreements in support of the energy projects, proper approval of these projects doesn't come down to a vote where a simple majority wins, said RAVEN director Ana Simeon. RAVEN is a charity that helps Indigenous communities enforce their rights and titles to traditional territory.
When he got back from the shop, (without the car), he gave me and the kids a big hug and repeated how lucky we are for having each other and for this happening at his mom's garage instead of on the road somewhere. He had repeated this at the rental car place that afternoon as the kids and I set out to continue our journey without him, and repeated it on the phone late at night as we were trying to figure it out if he will be able to spend New Year's Eve with us or not.
On the other hand, recurring false awakenings, which Lundquist says tend to be pretty rare, tend to reflect something else. [This] seems to relate to a situation that somebody doesn't want to face, Hohne says, describing this subcategory of false awakening as a double wakeup call. In one sense, you're waking up twice — once in your dream and again in real, waking life — but Hohne's term also refers to the realization you'll inevitably reach after reflecting on the content of your dream.
My son was cleared of health ailments at birth, so I never expected that a simple blood test for summer camp would change the course of his entire life: He was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. I spent that Fourth of July in a Brooklyn hospital's children's ward, listening to my son beg nurses not to do another finger stick or give him insulin injections four to six times a day.
For a start, health care represents 18 percent of the U.S. economy. A lot of people think that's too much. You know who doesn't? The people who run and profit off the health care system.
When that limited series won in its category, executive producer Brad Simpson paid homage to the series' subject, slain fashion designer Gianni Versace. Simpson said Versace had been an openly gay man during a time of intense fear and hate, warned that those forces of hate are still with us, and called on artists to fight back by representing those not represented and by providing a space for people for new voices to tell stories that haven't been told.
Since my mind was focused on only seeing what was wrong with me, what is missing, and not appreciate what is there, it became impossible for me to rejoice in the delight of love my partner gave me.
She and Glover want to make Veganuary a delicious experience for everyone, to change public attitudes about veganism, to make it more mainstream, and make the transition to vegan as easy and enjoyable as possible, to get people to try vegan and stay vegan.

Like most children, William loves video games and is exceptionally animated. His brilliance astonishes me. Recently, my son asked me to let him grow up. I realized that I had become a helicopter mom since his diagnosis. I didn't know that I was paralyzing my own son because of my own fears about his diagnosis.
Our job on January 6th is to determine whether these are the electors the states sent us, not whether these are the electors the states should have sent us.
That's very astonishing news because we worked hard to get to what we wanted to get. - Athabasca Chipewyan Chief Allan Adam
The woman's mother, who is her legal guardian, is required under state law to submit an annual report that includes results of a physical, according to Maricopa County Superior Court documents. A doctor examined the woman on April 16 and found no change in her health during an external exam.
Paul is the first senator known to have contracted the virus. Two members of the House said last week that they had tested positive, making them the first members of Congress known to be infected.
Is this species liable to go extinct? Not yet, Wyneken told HuffPost. If this happens everywhere, we'll probably see a slow decline. Common sense tells you: One male and a hundred females ― that's going to be a very tired boy.
Prepping to go out into the cold and exercise is more of a mental hurdle than a physical one. It can be just too tempting to stay warm and cozy on the couch. Arrange to run with a friend. Not only will you be safer than if you run alone but you'll also have someone to hold you accountable for your fitness goals.
It's not that Trump rioters have actually fallen behind economically; it's that they're worried about the prospect of Black folks doing better. It's the same kind of anxiety that fueled the backlash to affirmative action decades ago.
Another significant finding from the poll: those people are more likely to be male. This isn't true in every case, but overwhelmingly, the demographics most likely to minimize the crisis are men aged 35 and over.
Beyond Oh's prescient line, the evening's proceedings were a metaphor for the incremental pace of social change itself: one step forward, two steps back.
According to de Leeuw, there is a lot of demand for more regional conferences, but only one in ten gets approval; we are looking for support from government, scientific partners and businesses. We do not just plant our flag in different cities, we are looking for true partnerships with the local organization.
Instead of self-rejecting yourself now, think of this phase as walking underneath a scaffolding. It's a little shaky and you might be scared, hesitant to keep walking, and wanting to give up because it could break down on you. However, you keep going because you can see the exit. Really, the only way to get out of it is to stay focused and patient. There is an end to it, and you'll reach it faster than you think.
Progressive activists and experts are calling on President-elect Joe Biden to expand his policy ambitions after two Democratic Senate victories in Georgia on Tuesday.

I think people are ready and could use a little smile. Everyone is depressed, and maybe that's as good a reason as any that everyone could use a little time to laugh and celebrate, said Samberg, a Saturday Night Live alum and Brooklyn Nine-Nine star. Not to ignore anything, but we spend so much time every day wallowing in a lot of things that are happening in our world that are really depressing, and with good reason — that stuff needs to be paid attention to — but there's also power to being positive and celebratory in the tougher times as well.
BJU Press did not respond to requests for comment.
For instance, Lord Farquaad's name may be a hidden joke since it sounds like f**k wad, and there's a lot of other questionable adult humor in the movie, too. Now, a Redditor may have just revealed another secret.
Medicine does do some wonderful things, Lieberman said. We all know people who wouldn't be alive if not for medicine.

But there's another part of me, a stronger part, that just wants to say: Stop lying to yourself and others. Just say you hate black girls and queer black people and go.
Let's say it all together now ...
More than anything else, I am famous in our social circle for being a political junkie. I have watched every presidential debate since I was 3 years old, starting with Barack Obama's re-election campaign. My favorite news sources are HuffPost, NPR and MSNBC. I am obsessed with Rachel Maddow. Maybe because she grew up in the same Bay Area city where I was born. I even had a chance to ask my congressman, Eric Swalwell, at a recent community meeting about the Democrats' Supreme Court strategy. But I think he was more focused on my age instead of my question. By the way, he is 1 of 1,000 Democrats thinking about running for president!
Speaking to The Associated Press from northern Syria on Monday, a Syrian Kurdish official said the Kurds have not been informed of any change in the U.S. position and were in the dark about Bolton's latest comments.
From what I understand of how the Trump administration negotiates, it likes to get competitive leverage by pursuing a zero-sum game. It's been long known that a partial trade deal will happen between India and the US and the US wants to get more access to agricultural goods, dairy products, Harley Davidson motorcycles amongst other things.
His office did not respond to a request for comment.
Many imagine that humans in the past all died young and that, thanks to medical science, people are now living longer and longer. Soon, perhaps, we'll all hit that 150th birthday — or achieve immortality.
We are taking a step towards a model centered on the consumer; where you can have options, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló wrote in Spanish in a series of tweets Monday, noting that the change would end PREPA's virtual monopoly in the generation of energy.
The same study found that men are more likely to lie to achieve short-term mating goals by which the researchers meant getting a woman into bed. This is a time-honored tactic, of course. I'm sure women in caves and sod huts throughout time have sat around complaining about the exact same thing, like Yeah, I actually believed him when he said he wanted to have twenty children with me!
The South African government on Tuesday announced that it will double to 10,000 the teams going door-to-door to test people for COVID-19, mainly in the overcrowded Black townships created during the apartheid era.
Well, I don't know perhaps forever. But what has really been undermined is going to the usual guys about what Muslims think in India and what they prioritise. I think that has really gone. These women are very eloquent about what they think should be done and what they want. I think it will be much harder to go back to a former time when journalists and politicians would rush to particular faces and ask what do Muslims want.
On Thursday March 19, Scott Morrison said Australia will implement a travel ban on all non-residents and non-Australian citizens coming into the country. The restrictions will be in place Friday evening at 9pm.
He added: Mr. President, we don't need to create artificial crises, we have enough real crises.
The piece opens with a scene at a Philadelphia hair salon, where women getting ready for a Kelly concert are discussing his rumored marriage.
For Suri, no events occur in a vacuum. A knowledge of history is essential, not only to understand the present, but to form a vision of the future. As he took us through the five turning points, it was clear how each of these set the stage for what was to follow.
Buhr: Honestly, everyone should be so lucky to have someone like Will — who, by the way, in his own right has been doing the hard work as a scientist during this whole thing. He probably doesn't give himself enough credit, but he's basically been responsible for making sure all of the testing for a whole set of studies on antibodies has been appropriate and that there's quality assurance that the studies are doing what they need to be doing to get good quality results.
Sood is also a huge supporter of Women's Empowerment world-wide through his work at WEDO, where he serves on the board as the Chairman of WED Fellows Program for Women's Entrepreneurship Day at the United Nations, which was founded by Wendy Diamond in 2014.
President-elect Joe Biden's advisers may simply be setting low expectations ― which, after four years of an administration that chronically overpromised, might not be the worst thing in the world. But the reality remains the same: Getting back to normalcy in 2021 will require doing much, much more than the U.S. is doing now.
The air traffic system is a resilient system with multiple backups in place, the FAA said in a statement. This shift is a regular execution of a long-standing contingency plan to ensure continued operations.

For the majority of our academic careers, we feel like we're constantly evolving. We choose new classes each semester, and with that comes new coursework, teachers and classmates. We learn new things, ace exams and actually feel ourselves getting closer to our ultimate goal: graduation.
Secondly, when Suu Kyi resumed public events, she led a national cleanup day. The 70-year-old put on a pair of plastic gloves and urged everyone to join her in picking up plastic bags and rubbish. Don't just stand there, she chided photographers, come help. The symbolism was Gandhi-esque. Our problems are many, Suu Kyi implied, everyone must pitch in to rebuild their broken country. She's right. She's the public face of reform, but she can't do it alone. Third, Suu Kyi extended a hand to the military leaders she had just unseated. She sought out current President Thein Sein, a former general who had been part of the military junta that kept her locked up. They discussed a smooth transition. She also met with the Commander in Chief of the Army, Min Aung Hlaing, because the army still controls key cabinet positions and 25 percent of the Parliament. They discussed cooperation.
Seventy years ago we ate nourishing whole foods, unprocessed grains and cereals, butter, whole eggs, meats, fish and poultry and there were no organic sections in the stores because everything already was organic.
In the last few years, as I transitioned from a woman trying to get pregnant to now a mother of two, and all the high and lows, joys and tears incorporated, I've seen first hand its impact on my sense of self and my intimate relationship with my partner, my husband. From the scheduled sex when getting pregnant wasn't happening as fast as we expected to the first sex right after baby to the sex now as we try and figure out if our family will remain a party of four.
I don't think that you can do the movie version of 'Suits' while also 'continuing to honour our duty to The Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages,' Treble said, quoting directly from their statement. To do that and still have royal titles? There's going to be a tension there.
The Hasty Pudding welcomes women to audition and perform in the roles in the show, and be given equal opportunity to play those roles based on the quality of their individual talents, former Hasty Pudding President Andrew L. Farkas said in a letter that the group's current president, Amira T. Weeks, read on Thursday.
But he said Pelosi is equipped to lead the House at this time because she believes that the House is fundamentally the institution best equipped to reflect the hopes, the dreams and the aspirations of everyday Americans.
The core issue remains that commission fees are very high (30-40% of the sale). No delivery provider has committed to any relief here and this is what the vast majority of restaurants need, Tewari told HuffPost Australia.
The Hong Kong government said in September it would recognize overseas same- sex partnerships when granting dependent visas, after a British lesbian who was denied a spousal visa took it to court and won.
If you must increase how much work your talented employees are doing, you'd better increase their status as well. Talented employees will take on a bigger workload, but they won't stay if their job suffocates them in the process. Raises, promotions, and title-changes are all acceptable ways to increase workload. If you simply increase workload because people are talented, without changing a thing, they will seek another job that gives them what they deserve.
The former would signal an egregious miscalculation. The latter puts a lot of faith in a 56-year-old longtime offensive coordinator, whose last head coaching experience came at Arizona State (2001-06). Should the Buccaneers do move Koetter up the ladder, it's a calculated gamble. If it doesn't work out, they'll have tossed Smith aside for nothing and likely will be back in a similar spot two or three years from now.
Vietnam allows same-sex weddings, but no legal recognition or protection of such unions.
I was recently working on a deal with Costco to have my book sold in their stores. At the last minute, the deal fell through. I won't bore you with the details, but I worked very hard for the better part of a year until it was beyond my control and there was little I could do but watch the green light turn yellow and then sadly, red.
excrement, and it is very strong, such that none may abide by it.
When the pandemic struck and we all piled into our houses, it was the perfect excuse not to tell anyone else about us. We could keep it protected. I loved that we were a secret because the way we were protecting it, it felt like the relationship existed on a higher plain than the things I'd created before.
For one, our DNA is protected by a membrane that prevents things from passing through easily, she explained. This messenger RNA just goes into the outer part of our cell, called the cytoplasm. And it doesn't enter into the nucleus, so it doesn't have access to our DNA.
Bjonda Haliti, a 22-year-old from Los Angeles who tested positive in March, posted about her symptoms when hardly anyone else was doing it.
Frantz offered one caveat: If Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), a former Sanders organizer, were 35 years old ― and thus eligible to serve as president ― she might be capable of generating the same level of enthusiasm.
Johnson's lawyers are fighting his execution, citing evidence of intellectual disability and evidence that lung damage from his recent COVID-19 diagnosis will make death by lethal injection a painful experience akin to drowning.
Though Ben kills it as Julie Andrews, if you watch her mouth closely, you can see her dropping words in the lyrics. She did the same thing in the Anaconda lip sync last week. What distinguishes Ben from, say, Kennedy, who is called out for missing words, is that she covers well. That's the mark of a smart queen.
The seats that Democrats picked up across the country this fall were largely won by reassuring voters that they are willing to fight for workers young and old, and ensuring that they will have affordable health care and gainful employment. The Green New Deal, a bold proposal to put Americans to work building green infrastructure, modeled after Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, was a central campaign issue for a progressive faction of the newly elected Democrats. At first, establishment Democrats scoffed at the Green New Deal as some ultraleft policy demand, but the more the idea of job creation through building renewable energy and climate-adapted infrastructure were floated with the American public, the more support they gained. Not to mention, the notion of slowing rampant income inequality and leaving no American behind sits favorably with working people throughout the nation.
Our goal is to give that money back to Iowans and to do so as part of a plan to take a comprehensive look at taxes in Iowa, said Iowa Senate President Jack Whitver, a Republican.
However, there is evidence suggesting that having cops in schools can help perpetuate the school-to-prison pipeline ― the cycle in which students, particularly students of color, are pushed out of school and into the criminal justice system when school authorities criminalize student misbehavior. A HuffPost investigation found that schools with police officers are significantly more likely to refer their students to law enforcement for incidents involving theft, vandalism and alcohol.

Many doctors — and I've read many, many doctors — can't believe the great job that we've done, Trump said.
That being said, deciding on what's appropriate for a funeral can be tricky. You want to look presentable and also be respectful of the deceased and their loved ones. Funerals are a time to remember those we've lost, not bring attention to ourselves.
So began the first powerful lecture that Life in the Boomer Lane attended, yesterday, at One Day University in Washington, DC. One Day U is the brainchild of Steven Schragis, who invites the most popular university professors around the country to give lectures covering a wide variety of topics. It's perfect: fascinating classes, minus homework and exams. Since 2006, One Day U has gone from one location to 55. Hundreds of professors across the country take part.

It was around this time that I decided to put Randsburg to my rudder. I had soaked up all the culture (read PBR) that I could. I packed up my bag, tipped the bartender, headed for the door, remembered I had to pee, turned back, peed, and headed for the door.
After your body is calm ― and you've given some thought to what was behind your burst of anger ― use I statements when you share your thoughts or feelings with the other person, advised Megan Negendank, a psychotherapist and sex therapist in Sacramento, California.
Would you take a selfie with someone who was robbing a bank? she told reporters. I can't imagine if a couple of thousand of [Black Lives Matter] protesters had descended on the Capitol ... that there would be 13 people arrested.

Tucker Carlson used the stain of pro-Donald Trump rioters storming the Capitol building Wednesday to launch a paranoid rant about what President-elect Joe Biden will do when he takes office. (Watch the video below.)
The plan marks something of a transformation for Stringer. A fixture in Manhattan politics for more than three decades, the 60-year-old Democrat forged his most significant climate policy in 2018 at his current post as the city's comptroller, kick-starting the process of divesting New York's pension funds of fossil fuel stocks.
SANTÉ - Mutation. C'est le mot clé indispensable de tout film apocalyptique évoquant une maladie. Alors logiquement, alors que le nouveau coronavirus se répand partout dans le monde, nous menaçant de pandémie, la crainte que ce virus ne mute est présente. À tel point que Jérôme Salomon, directeur général de la Santé, a souhaité rassurer jeudi 5 mars en affirmant que le coronavirus Sars-Cov 2 avait connu une évolution et non une mutation.

Santa Barbara County Fire Department Rain triggered mud and boulders to crash into homes in Montecito, California.
Wheeler took over the agency six months ago when scandal-plagued former Administrator Scott Pruitt resigned in disgrace. Close allies of Pruitt, including Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), swiftly touted Wheeler as an adequate replacement who would reliably carry out Trump's pro-fossil-fuel agenda.
Trump induces visceral reactions in many, but the causes for rage extend beyond him, and even beyond the damage his administration is actively doing. There are preconditions that allowed him to rise, that allowed the Republican Party to lie supine before him and to embrace him so fully. There is a sickness in this country that allowed this carbuncular president to swell to the surface, and it calls for more than the Democrats' signature bloodless, incremental technocracy to fix.
1. Exercise Faith: What is faith? Faith is when you take God at His word. It is when you believe that you will receive those things which you have been praying for. What are you hoping to accomplish in 2016? Do you want to live a healthier lifestyle? Does your financial situation seem hopeless? The good news is, God can do exceedingly and abundantly more than you could ever ask or think. Whatever it is that you long for, big or small, it is going to take faith to receive it. You must be determined to walk by faith and not by sight. In Matthew 14, Peter, one of the twelve apostles, defied the laws of gravity and walked on water, for as long as his eyes were fixed on Jesus. I wonder what monumental feats you will be able to accomplish and overcome through faith in 2016. Remain steadfast. Make 2016, the year that you believe God to do the impossible.
U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced that from this evening, Britons will only be allowed to leave their homes for very limited purposes, including shopping for basic necessities, one form of exercise a day, medical need and traveling to work only when absolutely necessary.
Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy winner Green Book ― which depicts the unlikely friendship between black pianist Don Shirley and his white driver, Tony Vallelonga ― took substantial liberties to reach its feel-good conclusion, according to Shirley's family members, who called the movie a symphony of lies.
International NGOs The fringe anti-imperialist narrative asserts that NGOs such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch are all part of the wider conspiracy to promote regime change in Syria. Vanessa Beeley has described Amnesty International as pernicious liars and Empire's little helpers and Prof Piers Robinson has written how NGOs engage in propaganda activities that contain obfuscation and exaggeration. What is ignored is that these very same NGOs write extensively on abuses carried out by Israel and those that occur in Yemen, both causes championed by these activists. The Silencing Of Syrians Notably, there are no Syrians among this fringe group, and numerous Syrian individuals have said that they have been shut down or blocked on social media when they have tried to engage with them. One such person, Maher Barotchi, lives in Sheffield and was forced out of Syria by the regime 30 years ago when he discovered he'd been blacklisted whilst studying in the UK. He said: It makes me angry to see people who are supposedly educated supporting Assad. You don't expect people to have posts at universities and still... these people... their so-called principles are more important than the suffering and the human rights. These so-called anti-imperialists, anything that's anti-Western, even if it's a mass murderer, they will defend them and find excuses for them. How can you be an educated person living in the West, enjoying the freedom of speech which the countries you defend don't have and don't allow?
Living without the Crown's money means likely means living a very different kind of life than the one they have now, Treble said. That's not a luxury home. That's not couture gowns. And they'd also likely have to pay for their own security. They could start blowing through money very quickly, she said.

The former minister says his biggest accomplishment in office was funding a massive expansion of public transit and investments in infrastructure like roads and bridges.
Y = Why you. Remember, you add value. A = Allowed to fail. Give yourself permission to fail. When you fall, you always get back up. S = See success. Breathe and reframe your mindset. S = Surge forward. Take a leap of faith, because if you don't ask, you don't get.
3. They Don't Care about Their Employees
What that means is that you can pore over the nutrition label and still be off in your dietary analysis.
Two years ago when Sood founded Novus, he saw that traditional pathways were disappearing internationally for both the young and old, but the drive and ability to turn their dreams into reality was stronger than ever. Sood views this as the core reason why we need to reimagine the pursuit of happiness.
Short is fashionable, but it's too short when people are taking second and third looks because you can't sit down, that's too short, Gottsman said. We know it's not inappropriate to have something above the knee, it's inappropriate when you bend over to look at the deceased and people can see your underpinnings.
The U.S. Senate passed a bipartisan bill that provides financial relief to Americans affected by the pandemic, after making some changes over the weekend that weakened the package's paid sick leave provisions.
You are almost certainly better off moving your money into a 401(k) than pulling it into an IRA. In addition, the advice given under the 401(k), these are run under the best practices standard, the fiduciary standard. The IRA is coming along, but it's still not there yet. The rules have still not been put in place.

No, because she wouldn't. She would never, ever, ever, ever, having been through it. She's an avenging angel, and she's coming with two things: She's coming with forgiveness and redemption, or punishment. She goes to places drunk, and she does nothing. She's completely inert. If people pick her up, that's what happens. If they don't, she goes home. But someone always picks her up.
As of Saturday night, a full picture of how Buttigieg fared with the more diverse electorate had yet to emerge. Still, the former mayor sounded a triumphant note in a speech to supporters in Las Vegas, before pivoting to a lengthy attack on Sanders. He reiterated his criticism that Sanders' Medicare for All plan would deprive Americans of the option to keep their private insurance coverage. Buttigieg began airing television ads on Friday in South Carolina that blast Sanders by name for forcing over 122 million Americans off their private plans, including 22 million seniors covered by Medicare's private variant, Medicare Advantage.
Still, the move comes across as hasty for a team clearly in a rebuild. Tampa Bay linebacker Lavonte David even expressed his frustration with the decision, also via Twitter: This is stupid, we can't even have a consistent coach, 3 coaches in 5 yrs, he wrote as part of an extended rant.
How refreshing is that? Instead of worrying about whether you might fit into those jeans again or if that pile of electrical cords could come in handy some day, just ask: Does this spark joy for me? If not, remove it from your life.
The good news is that you can learn to deal with well-meaning peers and people you manage, by employing a set of proven tactics, as outlined in a new book, Managing Annoying People, from veteran business leader and workplace consultant Ilene Marcus. As a long-time business advisor, I fully support her key pragmatic relationship strategies, which I paraphrase here as follows:
The withdrawal of Teck's Frontier Mine application is more devastating news for the Canadian economy, especially for Albertans & indigenous people.
There is no research showing that alkaline water has any benefit over regular water, she said. Marketers of alkaline water claim that they help to neutralize acidity in your bloodstream to a more alkaline level, which is a pH of 7-14 on a scale that starts at zero.

I have highlighted three products here to give my readers a flavor of the tools that are available, but there are other products on the market. I do not endorse one of these tools over the other but believe they can be an important addition to your accessibility efforts. I do recommend that corporations and organizations blend accessibility into the DNA of all offerings. These tools appear to be an effective way to assure accessible experiences for clients and employees with disabilities while also reducing risk to an organization while they update their processes, code their websites to be compliant to standards like W3C WCAG 2.0, and show that their brand cares about the customer's experience.
The supplies ― which Trump said will be delivered within 48 hours ― include gloves, medical beds, N95 masks and gowns. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will also provide these states additional support to build alternate care sites.
When asked if she finds it surprisingly that men, on average, take the pandemic less seriously than women, Sarosi said, No, not at all.

India To Go Under Complete Lockdown At Midnight — 3/24/20, 11:00 a.m. ET
Finally, of course, you asked about salvation for others than Christians. I was glad that your dialogue partner knows that his cannot be considered the Christian response. Who claims to know the ways of the Eternal! Yet imagine if all embraced the word of the prophet, My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways my ways, says the Lord. (Isaiah 55:8) Many Christians see that they have no standing to assert that salvation for all must be through Jesus Christ. If here and there the Bible tells me so, and if people not convicted by its word say, That's not my word! -- how do I respond? Either I say, You are wrong because I am right, so you change or else I hold you in the wrong on fundamental things. Ah! Those so certain to put others in the wrong abandon the way of Jesus for paths of power and control along which are strewn all the bloody evils of empires past and future. What is the alternative? We say, You are right; this word is not your word, it is mine. I will endeavor to listen well to what I have heard.
Since I was around 12, the dudes in my life constantly told me I was being too sensitive when I questioned the misogyny and racism in Tarantino's work. I was often told I didn't get it. Well...

Fifteen medical workers also tested positive for the virus, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission has said. Fourteen of them — one doctor and 13 nurses — were infected by a patient who had been hospitalized for neurosurgery but also had the coronavirus.
Let's be clear: Oh's monologue on Sunday was nothing short of refreshing, underscoring just how historic her stint as the first Asian host of the Golden Globes really was. As she said, things are changing in Hollywood; we can now demand more than the same people (historically, white men) tap dancing across the stages of celebrity soirees year after year.
The key here is to... reduce the amount we emit, Copernicus senior scientist Freja Vamborg told Reuters.
Snyder, a fiscal conservative, earlier had condemned the GOP tax plan as fiscally irresponsible because it adds to the federal deficit. But Republican members of the Michigan Legislature already are clamoring for deeper cuts to state taxes, beyond Snyder's simple solution to lower taxes just enough to make up for the federal windfall.
A new generation of left-wing Democrats, including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), ran as champions of a Green New Deal, a sweeping federal policy to end fossil fuel use and guarantee high-wage clean-energy sector jobs to every American. It's a popular idea. One poll released last month pegged the number of registered voters who support a Green New Deal at 81 percent, including 57 percent of conservative Republicans.
At Chanukah, we light candles for eight days to remember that, in the desecrated Temple, amid the rubble and the ruin, a drop of oil was found. There was only enough oil to last one day, but it burned for eight: the amount of time needed to find and prepare more sacred oil for the holy flames. The first drop of oil was lit not knowing what would be --and it burned brighter and longer than anyone thought possible.

A single-day ticket to the Magic Kingdom at World Disney World on the most expensive days will now cost $129, up from $124, for anyone ages 10 and older. For children between the ages of 3 and 9, the admission has also risen by $5, to $123. Children under the age of 3 will continue to get in for free.
Cuomo estimated the state will need an additional 140,000 hospital beds and 30,000 ventilators. Warning that the state could not do enough on its own to stem the spread of the virus, the governor did not mince words in criticizing the federal government's response.
If the coronavirus spread is as bad as it's been in Italy, the election will only be about the competence of the federal response, which to date Trump has completely bungled, Tyler said. He lacks the knowledge and leadership to offer any useful information. His mostly irrelevant or non-factual statements have only added to confusion, panic and destabilization. Trump should not attend press briefings, tweet or issue statements about coronavirus. He should let the professionals do their work keeping Americans healthy and safe.
The World Health Organisation this week stopped short of calling the outbreak a global health emergency.
Has the NDA government continued the UPA government's approach to the US?
One campaign adviser, Jason Miller, argued Democrats' efforts will serve to galvanize the Republican base behind Trump and end up harming Biden. He blamed the Democrats' swift pace for the silence, saying there wasn't time for mounting a traditional response operation. But he pledged that the real battle will be the Senate where there'll be a more traditional pushback effort.
But Biden has been distancing himself from his vote, making it seem like he was against the endeavor from the beginning.
'A clear and ongoing global health threat'
Sixty years ago kids walked to school, ran everywhere and played outdoors until dark. Adults did a lot of physical work. In 1950 only 10 percent of Americans were obese. Not anymore.
Still, those who have had issues with regular lubricants could benefit from one with CBD in it. It could be just the thing to ~spice~ up things with yourself or your partner.
The Department does have the power to prohibit forced arbitration clauses as a condition of receiving Title IV aid, and I commend the Department lawyers who got that right the first time. The Justice Department's position on the Federal Arbitration Act is not on point.
Jagmeet Singh highlighted NDP policies such as universal drug coverage and dental care in introducing himself to an American audience, and name-dropped high-profile Democrats in the process.
The document even ends with a bit of a threat.
The AAP questioned why it took the ECI so long (almost a day after the polls closed) to calculate the voter turnout.
But Oh's cautious optimism proved prophetic that very night. The ceremony started with a number of moments that signaled progress in the industry; winners including Oh and If Beale Street Could Talk star Regina King spoke about the significance of their victories while pushing for more racial and gender equality, and presenters referenced the diverse casts in nominated films such as Black Panther and Crazy Rich Asians.
When black people come to the defense of these men, here's what they are really saying: Black lives matter, but only certain ones, only convenient ones.
Fickle? Not really. I just missed the change of seasons. Growing up in Minnesota with four distinct seasons gives you something to look forward to. And in Minnesota, each season brings forth different clothing, activities, and foods--even conversations.
The Women's Agenda includes 10 policy issues, including racial and immigrant rights, and economic and environmental justice. Board member Linda Sarsour said that the policies, compiled by a committee of women from various national and grassroots organizations, establishes a precedent for not only the new Congress to work on, but sets a narrative for 2020. If you want to be my president and you don't have a position on the issues that are part of this woman's agenda, then don't knock on my door until you have an answer for these policies.
On Saturday and Sunday, the Liberals' 37,831 paying members will vote for delegates to represent riding associations, student clubs and women's clubs at Leadership Election Meetings (LEMs). Those approximately 1,984 delegates, along with hundreds of ex-officio delegates, who automatically get to vote because they are former MPs and MPPs, the party's executive council, and other party brass, will choose the next leader at a convention on March 6 and 7.
At least three states passed laws putting new criminal penalties on protests against fossil fuel infrastructure in just the past two weeks amid the chaos of the coronavirus pandemic. First came Kentucky. On March 16, Gov. Andy Beshear (D) signed legislation that ― while removing some of the original bill's most draconian measures on protest ― designated natural gas or petroleum pipelines as key infrastructure assets and made causing damage that totals more than $1,000 or tampering in a manner that renders the operations harmful or dangerous felony charges of criminal mischief in the first degree. Two days later, it was South Dakota. On March 18, Gov. Kristi Noem (R) signed a bill that expanded the definition of critical infrastructure to include virtually any oil, gas or utility equipment, and raised the charges for causing substantial interruption or impairment of such facilities to felonies. Five days later, on March 23, the governor approved a second measure defining a felony riot as intentional use of force or violence by three or more persons that causes any damage to property. On Wednesday, West Virginia followed suit. Gov. Jim Justice (R) greenlighted legislation assigning the same critical infrastructure status to a wide range of oil, gas and pipeline facilities, slapping fines as high as $20,000 on anyone found guilty of causing damage, destruction, vandalization, defacing or tampering that totals $2,500 or more.

And, like with all top CBD products, you should be mindful about the brand and site that you're getting lube from. (That goes for sex toys, too.)
Now, according to Refinery29, the chain has updated that policy.
Fourth, she met with ethnic leaders and assured them they would have a voice in the government. The offer of a seat at the table was a message that needed to be heard. Much still needs to be done to resolve the bloody ethnic conflicts that have gone on for more than 60 years. But inclusiveness signals respect. It opens to door to dialogue. And dialogue opens the way to change. The process is sure to be messy. But the alternative is worse.
Getting vaccinated doesn't offer immediate protection.
I didn't mind Milk in her season, and was even pretty impressed with her post-show modeling gigs. But her casting on All Stars confused me. I wasn't sure she had more to offer in this arena. After all, being successful off the show does not automatically make you great at Drag Race. But seeing her complain that the judges didn't properly congratulate her is a new low — a case of spoiled Milk. What's more, it's an off-putting display of her privilege.
This will force scientists to refine our thinking about the influences of genetics and environment, she said. Twins are very alike, but it is not a perfect similarity.
Structural, constitutional change must happen within Confederation or a referendum on Alberta's independence is an inevitability, the declaration reads. It is not our job to explain Alberta's value, it is now up to Canada to show they understand Alberta and our value to Confederation.
After the first Rudd report on food advertising spending disparities for black and Hispanic youths was released in 2015, a number of companies — like Coca-Cola, Yum! Brands (which owns Taco Bell and KFC), Hershey and PepsiCo — announced corporate responsibility initiatives to promote health and wellness, as well as sponsorships. Yet since then, overall food-related spending on black television programming aimed at a black audience grew by 50 percent from 2013 to 2017.
The department's decision not to press charges had left her feeling disappointed and ignored, Randall-Gay said Thursday.
As temperatures dip and days get shorter around this time of year, it's not uncommon to experience the winter blues. But for many people, these negative feelings and behaviors are signs of something more serious ― seasonal depression, also known as seasonal affective disorder or SAD.

No, there isn't any bra-strangling going on in The Last Jedi. (The Porgs would've been traumatized.) But there are instances in which the Last Jedi filmmakers seem to have heeded Fisher's request to be drowned in moonlight. First, when Leia appears bathed in light while briefly floating out in space after a First Order attack. And later, when she appears unconscious in a medical bay.
I proudly proclaimed that I recognized that they tried their best, that what they did for me was more than enough, and that I loved them so much. The irony is not lost on me, that the same words I wanted to hear my whole life were the words I tearfully told them as a newly married woman.
We'll be dealing with all of that on Wednesday, he said.
Of course, don't just peace out of the argument. Let whoever you're talking to know that you just need a little physical space, Mayo said. Otherwise, your actions might be misconstrued as passive-aggressive.
I think with your kids, whatever their passion is, you give your support. You give them the opportunity to try what they want to try.
The city is ready for this, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said during a news conference about the city's preparedness on Thursday. Make no mistake though, this is a heavy snow, heavier than we've seen in a number of winters.
Gaither recommends looking at the ingredients of any CBD lubricant and avoiding any with chemicals and artificial scents. Oil-based ones might degrade latex in condoms, making them less effective, so look for a lube that's water-based, Gaither said.
Many Christians, often concerned about compromising their sense of what they believe that Jesus would want, have doubled down on their fragile self-image of being holy, pure and sanctified. In their fear of compromising their beliefs about sexuality and gender, they have almost fully compromised one of the core teachings of Jesus: to love God and your neighbor as you love yourself.
In the race for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, then-Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois ― who eventually chose Biden to be his vice president ― was scathing in his criticism of opponent Hillary Clinton and her attempt to rewrite history concerning her Iraq war vote as a New York senator (Obama wasn't in the chamber when the vote occurred).
In the past, royal relationships were usually not confirmed unless there was an engagement, Harris told HuffPost Canada. But Harry broke that unwritten rule when he wrote an open letter to the press in 2016, identifying Meghan as his girlfriend and asking the press to treat her respectfully.
The president vows to keep the shutdown going as long as Democrats don't give him money for his border wall, but he's shown no willingness to negotiate on the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals immigration program, and Democrats have shown little willingness to give Trump even one dollar.
When I ask audiences to describe the best and worst boss they have ever worked for, people inevitably ignore innate characteristics (intelligence, extraversion, attractiveness and so on) and instead focus on qualities that are completely under the boss' control, such as passion, insight and honesty.
In the letter, the USOC also announced it would launch an investigation by an independent third party to see how Nassar was enabled to commit his abuses for so long. Three USA Gymnastics directors resigned on Monday and the USAG suspended Olympic gymnastics coach John Geddert, who had a close relationship with Nassar. USAG also cut ties with the national team training center, Karolyi Ranch, where much of Nassar's abuse occurred.
Brown says the benefit of working under a lone wolf is that they have a strong work ethic and they value assertiveness in team members. She said they often thrive at startups where succeeding means taking on multiple roles at once.
At first we were going to call out the magazine publicly, but then we decided to try to solve the problem instead of just expose it. We decided to create a tool that would make the volume of talented women illustrators from all different background out there undeniable. We wanted to make it as easy as possible for magazines, newspapers, advertising agencies and publishers to hire women, and encourage them to hire women of color and queer women and other groups of women they might not otherwise feel they have connections to.

As for the future of the @SuspendThePres account, Lazar said that he planned to continue posting updates related to Trump's remaining days in office, and might repurpose the account to focus on another political figure in the future.
Over the past several weeks, Hoda has seamlessly stepped into the co-anchor role alongside Savannah, and the two have quickly hit the ground running, Lack wrote.
This is a very tough morning for both of us, Kotb said on air the morning Lauer's firing was announced. I've known Matt for 15 years and I've loved him as a friend and a colleague, and just like you were saying, Savannah, it's hard to reconcile what we are hearing with the man who we know, who walks in this building every single day.
Full disclosure: Sean Combs and I go back like sneakers and hats. The first time I met Diddy his name was still Puffy. It was 1993 and I was music editor at Interview magazine; we had dinner in Soho because he wanted to meet hip-hop journalists who could help him launch Bad Boy Records. He had signed the Notorious B.I.G and told me he was interested in signing a rock band, so after dinner, we sat in his Range Rover and he listened to my CD. For some reason, maybe because my singing sounds like Lou Reed but more awful, he didn't sign me. But we stayed in contact.
If you look back at the reporting during the R Kelly-Aaliyah marriage, it was a massive failure, Jemele Hill, a writer for The Atlantic, tweeted on Jan. 3. Zero understanding of sexual abuse. Nobody treated this seriously. It was a collective shrug.

Being a parent to a child with a chronic illness is like feeling your lungs collapse and then breathing through a straw. In the beginning, I found myself hovering over my son's chest during naps to make sure he was still alive.
Stringer added that the city is embarking on one of the most significant divestment efforts anywhere in the world to date.
It's perpetuating the disparities that we all already see in kids' health. Kids are very vulnerable to advertising, much more so than adults, she said. It's making the public health community's job so much more difficult. It's making parents' jobs so much more difficult.
Sony introduced the first VCR, the Betamax, in February 1976, which established the whole notion of home video recording. Hollywood wasn't pleased and sued, but the U.S. Supreme Court narrowly decided we had the right to record TV shows. But the Betamax could only record for an hour. So RCA countered with this Matsushita-made VHS SelectaVision VCR, which could record for up to four hours, enough to record an entire football game, and triggered the establishment of the home video market.
During an appearance on The Late Show on Tuesday, Garfield explained why he kissed Reynolds at Sunday's Golden Globes, a moment that went viral on the social networks. I just wanted Ryan to know that I loved him no matter whether he won or lost, Garfield told Stephen Colbert. It doesn't matter. It's how you play the game, and he showed up and gave his all. It doesn't change anything in my heart. (Reynolds had just lost Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy, to Ryan Gosling.)

While reefs that bleach ― so named because once-colorful corals turn white ― aren't immediately killed, many of the creatures die in the intervening days and weeks. A mass bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef in 2016 left up to two-thirds of parts of the reef dead, and a back-to-back event in 2017 left some scientists in shock.
The queen's honors are awarded twice a year, in late December and in June, when the monarch's birthday is observed. The awards acknowledge hundreds of people for services to community or British national life. Recipients are selected by committees of civil servants from nominations made by the government and the public.
The government on Wednesday advised that Australians do not travel to Italy after Italian premier Giuseppe Conte enforced a lockdown on the whole country. It is the worst-affected country after China and is at the highest level of warning on DFAT's four-level advice scale.

You'll be required to spend 14 days in quarantine in a designated facility if you arrive in Japan from mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau or South Korea.
The burden wouldn't necessarily need to fall on the U.S. alone. The European Union, given its similar size to the U.S. economy, could take a lead role. The U.S. could also marshal its allies in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the 37-nation club of rich democracies, to aid in the effort.
For example, researchers with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center worked out a model of the Puget Sound region (around Seattle) that showed if the two existing COVID-19 vaccines do make individuals non-infectious to others, a fourth wave of the virus in that area could be avoided altogether. If the vaccine simply prevents symptoms in the individual who received it, there's likely to be a fourth wave of about 200,000 new infections in 2021.

It's also fair to point out that some people wanted to have this conversation before the #MeToo moment, but that a patriarchal hegemony of taste served as a bulwark against it. The cultural change didn't just begin in October. For example, when Tarantino released The Hateful Eight in 2016, critics explicitly called out his dicey use of extreme violence toward women in the film, questioning whether it was artistically essential or even justifiable.
Former House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, said in a statement that Biden's victory is entirely legitimate and that efforts to sow doubt about the election strike at the foundation of our republic.

Our movements are bigger than any presidential campaign, said Nelini Stamp, the WFP director of strategy and partnerships.
Daniel packs his bags often with new missions in mind, whether his efforts to train the most obese town in America for a 5K road race or picking peppers with migrant fieldworkers in Central California or spending three months sending out 18,000 emails seeking a Division 1 collegiate coaching position, where he landed roles with the University of Virginia and Northwestern.
These recent events show that a change in our policy is necessary, he continued. This week, I signed an order directing FAA safety inspectors and attorneys to pursue legal enforcement action against any passenger who assaults, threatens, intimidates or interferes with airline crew members. We will not address these cases through warning or counseling. This policy is effective immediately, and will remain in effect through March 30, 2021.
The Capitol Police have drawn scrutiny over the years for arresting journalists and protesters, use-of-force incidents and discrimination allegations. But documents surrounding such events are often inaccessible unless they're produced as the result of a court case. The agency shields basic records, like Office of Inspector General reports, from the public.
Republicans generally favor reducing government spending and enrollment in safety net programs. But kicking people off benefits is unpopular, so it's politically easier to push reforms that sound bureaucratic and benign. The new policy's block grants, for instance, are an administrative maneuver masking a clear goal: reduced spending and fewer people getting benefits. In the 1990s, the Republican Congress and Democratic President Bill Clinton converted cash welfare into block grants, resulting in significantly less aid being provided to low-income families.

In the end, the three groups that didn't advance expressed something we often hear: they were still excited about their projects and hoped they might be funded by other sources. They knew they had participated in an event that could have an important impact on the poorest urban neighborhoods in Guadalajara, and potentially in other urban centers around the world. That's something smart to be proud of.

But, much like defeating Prohibition before it, it is indeed a fight for liberation from government tyranny and overreach. Citizens used to regularly be locked up in prison for merely possessing even a trace amount of what is, in essence, just a plant. People were routinely given decades-long prison sentences for having natural plant matter in their possession. Those lucky enough to escape the hoosegow still faced steep fines, the destruction of careers, disqualification for student loans or government housing, and repossession of houses, cars, and money on the momentary whim of police officers ― on a daily basis. Marijuana is reportedly supposed to induce paranoia in its users, but how paranoid is it to be worried about such things when the consequences were so drastic for getting caught? To put it another way: Are you truly paranoid if they really are after you?

In comments to the Corriere della Sera newspaper, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said measures taken to close schools, universities and to impose severe restrictions on movement would have to be prolonged. Under current measures, Italy's 60 million people are only allowed to travel for work, medical reasons or emergencies under an order that runs until April 3, while most shops, except those selling food and pharmacies, are supposed to remain closed until March 25.

I don't think anyone wants to see Aziz's career ruined or his life ruined or anything like that, but that's where people's minds go, the comic told Couric. They go, 'Does he deserve this?' And it's really not about that. I think it's about expressing and showing women that that behavior is not OK and not only can you leave, but you need to leave. Because then the women who come after you, you're leaving a mark for them too.

But what does Ocasio-Cortez know about tax policy? A lot, said the headline of an opinion piece Saturday in The New York Times by Nobel economics laureate Paul Krugman. A similar tax rate was imposed in the U.S. for 35 years after World War II, which included some of the most successful periods of economic growth in history, Krugman wrote.

Yet, some members of the committee said they would never have endorsed a database as intrusive as the Social Registry appears today.
What is it that I do at parties? For starters, they're typically 60 to 90 minutes. (The longest I've done was four hours, but that was for a celebrity's child!) I do a meet and greet, an interactive story time with songs, princess/prince lessons (dance moves, manners, waves and curtsies), coloring pages, photos and everyone's favorite: face painting. (I am no expert, but I can paint a killer Olaf and this random swirly design I came up with that kids go wild for.)

This is an opportunity for our department to move forward and to continue to make the progress that has been made and to stay focused on my ... goals for our police department, which is first to keep us safe and second to respect all people, he said.
Less than a month after the Women's March Inc. announced plans for the 2019 event, a white supremacist attacked a Pittsburgh synagogue, killing 11 worshipers. The rise in hate crimes against Jews — which the FBI says accounted for more than half of all hate crimes in 2017 — and the resurgence of neo-Nazism meant that the issue would continue to plague Women's March leaders, despite their statements of support for Jewish victims, op-eds denouncing anti-Semitism and participation in rallies against hate crime.
Selon leurs résultats, la souche L serait plus virulente que la S. Mais le biologiste Richard Neher a rappelé sur Twitter que cette analyse est probablement biaisée. En effet, de nombreux séquençages de la souche L ont été effectués au début de l'épidémie, à Wuhan, où le taux de mortalité est plus élevé, mais pas en raison du code génétique du virus. Les raisons peuvent être multiples: prise en charge tardive de la maladie, encombrement des hôpitaux, etc. Une analyse que partage Emma Hodcroft.

While we have great respect for the art form that has been presented by the Pudding for over 170 years, which art form dates back to the ancient Greek times, the world is in a very different place, Farkas said in his letter.
The government closed a seafood market at the center of the outbreak, moved all patients with the virus to a specially designated hospital and collected test samples to send to government laboratories. Doctors were told to stay quiet; one who issued a warning online was punished. He later died of the virus.
Emissions are up since 2017, we're still putting pipelines in the ground, and air emissions have led to more COVID deaths in the Bronx than anywhere in the country, Stringer said.

The virus has killed more than 16,000 people worldwide and continues to spread at a rapid pace. Efforts to curb the outbreak have led to the global disruption of daily life and the economy, as schools and workplaces shutter in hopes of slowing transmission.
Under EU law, nations cannot reduce the rate of value-added tax on menstrual products below 5% as they are deemed to be luxury items and not essentials. Ireland is the only EU country that does not charge a levy on sanitary products as its zero tax rate was in place before the EU set its floor.
I'm really disappointed in the slow deterioration of popular film offerings from the Big 3 (Hulu, Netflix, Amazon). I remember when they started up, Netflix had an amazing selection. But now it seems like they never have any of the films I'm looking for. I have Amazon Prime, but any of the movies I really want to see inevitably require that I pay extra to rent them. The number of B and C-grade movies that are on these services is quite remarkable. That's a lot of chaff to pad their offerings. ― Susan Houston

Often times when we have obstacles we separate ourselves from the lives of other people. THEY can`t understand my problem or Just I have this problem. This doesn`t make any sense because often times many other people had the same problem. Be aware of this and make your research. This means look in the internet for how-to advice or speak with people you know about your problem and already solved it. You could also ask questions at blogs or comment specific articles in order to get more insides. Being proactive means trying to find a solution for your topic and using the help of others. Don`t see yourself separated from other people, see yourself reunited with people that already achieved or solved your obstacle.

I have an obligation to build a world in which those same girls and women aren't tasked with protecting those same men out of a sense of racial loyalty.

But this horrific situation has been the impetus for an incredible new unity in the industry for change. During the pandemic, we've seen hundreds of independent restaurant owners change their own wage structures to pay a full minimum wage with tips on top. Even the industry's top trade magazines have had headlines declaring that the industry is rethinking the subminimum wage for tipped workers. Now we just need legislators to follow workers and employers who've already come to agree on this issue.

Government shutdowns are costly affairs. Federal agencies must spend time and energy developing contingency plans in the runup to a closure, then have to make up missed work once the government finally reopens. As the messy situation in national parks has demonstrated, the government's work does not stop just because funds haven't been appropriated for that work. Agencies will face a backlog of responsibilities to handle once they are fully operational again.
Your partner in dialogue suggested that the only historically plausible explanation for the birth of the Christian movement is that many hundreds actually saw the risen Jesus. That assertion ignores the crucial fact that getting beyond dependency on eye-witness claims was the crisis of the early church, for sooner or later, there were no claims of appearances! Unless faith developed deep down, coming only through what was heard, there would be no church at all.

The Indian government announced on Monday that no domestic passenger flight will operate in the country starting Wednesday. International flights have already been banned for a week, and the Indian Railways, often described as the country's lifeline, have also stopped all train services until March 31. Many states have also announced strict measures to limit movement within and between their borders. The central government has asked states to strictly enforce the lockdown and take legal action against violations. As of Monday, India has 415 active cases of COVID-19, and eight people have died so far.
Opinions about the wider context, however, show sharp partisan divides. Many Republicans stop short of unilaterally disavowing the riots or say they view them as unrepresentative of Trump's supporters. Some baselessly suggest they weren't the work of his backers at all.
Families might be able to offset some of the personal exemption loss with the revised Child Tax Credit, which is now worth up to $2,000 in 2018. Congress also raised the income threshold to $200,000 (for single filers) before the credit starts to phase out, Rosatti said. The new law is also giving a $500 credit for qualifying dependents who are not children.

Many of the affected federal employees had missed at least one paycheck as of Saturday, when the shutdown hit record length. The financial stress is leading some workers to look for other jobs, ask relatives for money, apply for unemployment or even go without essentials like medication. Meanwhile, other Americans are facing a host of inconveniences and hardships, from shuttered museums to delayed farm loans.
One study investigating why living in the gay community increases depression found that the effect only showed up in masculine gay guys. The second reason the gay community acts as a unique stressor on its members is not about why we reject each other, but how. In the last 10 years, traditional gay spaces—bars, nightclubs, bathhouses—have begun to disappear, and have been replaced by social media. At least 70 percent of gay men now use hookup apps like Grindr and Scruff to meet each other. In 2000, around 20 percent of gay couples met online. By 2010, that was up to 70 percent. Meanwhile, the share of gay couples who met through friends dropped from 30 percent to 12 percent. Usually when you hear about the shocking primacy of hookup apps in gay life—Grindr, the most popular, says its average user spends 90 minutes per day on it—it's in some panicked media story about murderers or homophobes trawling them for victims, or about the troubling chemsex scenes that have sprung up in London and New York. And yes, those are problems. But the real effect of the apps is quieter, less remarked-upon and, in a way, more profound: For many of us, they have become the primary way we interact with other gay people. It's so much easier to meet someone for a hookup on Grindr than it is to go to a bar by yourself, Adam says.
But Democrats have been unable to pass background check legislation to close this gap in federal law. Congress nearly passed a bipartisan proposal in 2013 after the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, but the measure fell in the Senate.
Yes I do. It was at Mama D's Italian Kitchen in Manhattan Beach, and they had written out the Gratitude Rules in chalk on their board.

Subramanian had also said the BJP could salvage the Delhi election if we put a good chief minister's candidate.
I think she's in a cycle of self-harm, and I think that is a very similar cycle to the addiction cycle, which is that something has happened that she has not been able to directly look at for a long time. And so she's found an outlet to relieve some of that pain. What you see, particularly at the beginning of the movie, is somebody who has a very controlled, managed way. The build of tension, the build of misery, the build of anger and frustration. The act is her nights out, what she does during them and then the power that that gives her, the control that gives her. You see it the day after the scene with Adam Brody, with the hot dog and the walk of shame. It's pure power, pure adrenaline. But of course, in any addictive cycle, that high plummets and then it's the self-loathing and the revulsion.
Chance The Rapper -- Sunday Candy
Week by week, many Christians in political power seem to try to one-up the bigotry and oppression of their colleagues. It's the now-proverbial hold-my-beer ideology, with those Christians vying to be the most powerful and, by consequence, the most oppressive and violent. The sad reality is that significant elements of Christianity in the United States are entrenched in political power, on Sundays teaching that Jesus loves everybody but then moralizing people out of the Gospel that they say is free.

Tying your happiness to an achievement in the future ― such as losing 15 pounds, falling in love or getting a promotion ― is a dangerous game. Nicole Issa, a psychologist who serves clients in New York and Massachusetts, recommended changing your thinking pattern so you are not always willing your circumstances to change.

Thankfully, you hear a lot about body and overall appearance positivity these days. Models are stepping out with the skin condition vitiligo. There are models with Down syndrome. There are people with pink hair and no hair―at work, in the supermarket, jogging. Moles and stretch marks and flat tummies and gray hairs. We're embracing our teeth, tattoos, freckles, frown lines, and yes, our age and whatever physical changes come along with it.

What the government has done with the tools like Aadhaar is that they have excessively collected information and have then used privacy as an excuse to keep it away from the community, Dey said. The potential of misuse of techno-managerial tools is huge.

There are also likely behavioural reasons: men tend to smoke and drink more than women, Queen's University professor and infectious diseases expert Dr. Gerald Evans told Global. And heart and respiratory diseases are also more common in men, and can exacerbate coronavirus symptoms.
As of Wednesday, nearly 11 million shots had been administered across the U.S., according to tracking by Bloomberg based on federal and state data. That is less than half of the total shots distributed to the states, which is obviously a big problem and has been ever since the rollout began.
At a third, Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur said, Desh ke gadaron ko… and the crowd responded, Goli maron salon ko.

At two in the morning, she calls for me. She needs to go to the bathroom. First, she sits on the bed, gasping for breath. Funny the things you focus on at a time like this, she says. I'm looking at the dust on the bottom of the rocking chair. How long has it been since I dusted?
I realized that I missed my Live TV. I bought an HDTV antenna, however the only channel I could get was NBC because I'm not close to the towers. I researched all of the live streaming options including Hulu Live ($40/month), Sling TV ($20, $25 or $40) and DIRECTV NOW ($35). I got free trials for all three. I liked Hulu Live, however the live user interface took me awhile to get used to. Plus it was the most expensive at $40, still for a bunch of channels I don't watch. Also it did not have Animal Planet or TLC, channels that I watch. Next I was excited about Sling because of the price, however even with Sling's $40 option, you don't get all of the major broadcast networks. So my final selection for live streaming TV is DIRECTV NOW (Live a little package). It has the best value at $35/month with all of the major broadcast networks plus TLC and Animal Planet. Plus I like the user interface for browsing live TV. It has a nice channel guide similar to cable. The only channel that I don't have live and would like is the OWN network, but I'm not going to pay an extra $15 a month for the next higher package that includes it. ― Angela L. Lee
Actress Amber Tamblyn said at the time that she was friends with McGowan but that those remarks had been beneath her.
In the 11 weeks since that interview, the coronavirus has reached every corner of the globe. It has infected more than 500,000 Americans and killed at least 20,000. It has rewritten the rules of society, isolated people in their homes, closed schools, devastated the economy and put millions out of work.

Terry Parker High School and other schools in the Duval County Public Schools district only offer the class as a half-credit class, Superintendent Nikolai Vitti told the outlet. In a statement to CBS 47, Vitti said the students won't be punished for protesting, rather they are willing to consider extending the course:
Don't hesitate to do some work for free, as long as you keep the work relevant to the type of role you're interested in. Self-create a platform to showcase that you're curious, confident, committed to working with the company and not afraid to walk the talk. - Devanshi Garg, Icreon

In March and April, the Sunrise Movement will host events in Florida, California, Pennsylvania, New York, Kentucky, Michigan and elsewhere. The tour builds off an intensive new online training program, where volunteers are coached via webinars on how to confront politicians and frame an issue as overwhelming as global warming in terms of clear, effective action. Each event will include in-person training sessions, and conclude with organizing meetings for new converts.
The Japanese tidying expert gained widespread popularity in the U.S. back in 2014, when her first book, The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up, was released. It was a hit, becoming a New York Times best-seller and purchased by millions of people worldwide. The decluttering guru, as she's been dubbed, is now making headlines once again thanks to her newly released Netflix series, aptly titled Tidying Up with Marie Kondo.
HuffPost first reported last week that Frederick, 59, was under consideration for the solicitor general post. He previously served as a Clinton-era assistant to the solicitor general from 1996 to 2001 and appeared on the Obama administration's short list for the top job in 2008.
All Stars brings out all the worst parts of Thorgy. She's a mess from the word go this week, questioning why her part as Stevie Nicks isn't as funny as the others. (Having seen the full show: Girl, save Mariah and Julie, none of them were that funny.) In rehearsals with Todrick, she imagines herself focused and galvanized, but as Ben later points out in a confessional, she spends the whole time subconsciously self-sabotaging. It's honestly distressing to watch a talent like Thorgy melt down like this. As a result, her actual performance is kind of a mess. She looks like Stevie, but her affects are twitchy and bizarre. Her insistence during judging that Stevie Nicks isn't a gay icon — really, girl? — doesn't help her case.
Your unique selling proposition is what makes you stand out from the crowd. If you're interested in a job in marketing, for instance, you could position yourself by saying you always bring campaigns in on time and on budget.

Celebrities are also getting in on this industry, such as Cameron Diaz and Katherine Power with the Avaline brand.

All relationships require roots AND wings. Sometimes each partner is sufficiently balanced internally and can recognize and respond to whatever the needs of the day happen to be. More often than not, we are in relationship with someone whose personal set point in regard to the continuum is skewed in one direction or the other. The challenge in these situations is to resist the temptation to view ourselves as having the correct perspective and our partner as needing to conform to our point of view.

Our family must return to a place of talking about our issues, not making personal attacks, and denigrating one another.

I tried Aereo before they lost their court case. Then I was a SlingTV user for a couple of years and really enjoyed it. Just switched to YouTubeTV in the last week. Mostly so we could get local channels. It's okay but I am already missing A & E, HGTV and History Channel. We are going to give it a try for a while but may check out DIRECTV now because it has most of the channels we like as well as local options. ― Sean Cook
I think one thing this pandemic has taught us is how much we were taking for granted before. The ability to hang out in my favorite coffee shop, take a vacation, hang out with my friends and family members. I never experienced a sense of awe and joy at doing these activities before COVID, but I hope when I return to them after the pandemic, it will be with a bit more gratitude and a bit more understanding of how cherished these joy-inducing activities really should be. I think all of us will become a bit more appreciative of the little things we didn't pay attention to before.

Scientists have long said the world has already warmed 1 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels, or about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit. And if greenhouse gas emissions ― the prime driver of global warming and, in turn, coral bleaching ― remain unchecked, warming will skyrocket.

Marissa Meshulam, a dietitian and nutritionist, told Yahoo Lifestyle that social media influencers need to be careful because broadcasting an unhealthy lifestyle could be harmful for some of their followers.
The production of In Her Own Words may very well have been a powerful, even life-altering, experience for those involved with it. That's beautiful and special. The fact that it happened within the context of an exploitative and demeaning project isn't a contradiction; that's basically the American story in a nutshell. But to conflate an individual's positive feelings with an empowering end product is counterproductive and shameless, even by the standards of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue.
We are not aware of any reports at this time of human illnesses that suggest COVID-19 can be transmitted by food or food packaging, a spokesperson from the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service told HuffPost and mentioned in a statement.
Samantha McCulloch, an analyst at the International Energy Agency, said finding ways to commercialize the technology could offer an important backstop or hedge. But markets have been slow to develop. The biggest commercial use of capture carbon dioxide at present is for enhanced oil recovery ― shooting captured CO₂ at high pressures into nearly exhausted oil wells to extract what remains. Houston-based Occidental has invested heavily in direct air capture in a bid to ultimately reposition itself as a carbon management company that difficult-to-decarbonize industries, such as airlines or cement makers, may someday pay to remove CO₂ emissions from the atmosphere.

Both campaigns and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee knew pulling off the upsets would demand the type of massive ground game Democrats had eschewed during the pandemic era. Christie Roberts, a senior adviser at the DSCC, had begun searching for an operative to run a unified field operation even before Election Day. It was one of the crucial shifts the party made before the two-month runoff campaign that proved essential to Warnock and Ossoff's victories in elections that saw record-breaking turnout.

HuffPost spoke with several experts about some of the biggest myths still circulating about the immunizations:
The spark at the end of the reefer stabbed at Orla, the features behind its glow knit in fury. 'The fuck it is. What's a freedom fighter? What's an insurgent? What's a terrorist? That's what I want to know. We let ourselves be governed by old men who tell us what's good for us and what we need and the second we question it we're hauled off to face their idea of justice. You know what democracy is? Say you what you like, do what you're told. And we slap the label of terrorist on anyone who happens not to agree with us and doesn't conform to the restrictions we impose on them.'
Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) spoke to reporters following a meeting with Trump at the White House, which they characterized as contentious, signaling that negotiations over the shutdown are not likely to end soon.

This year, a giant spotlight was shone on the connection between racial redlining practiced a century ago, pollution hot-spots, urban heat island disparities and high COVID-19 dangers.
The CDC says that anyone who has had COVID-19 and recovered (and otherwise qualifies for vaccination) should be offered the vaccine — although the agency adds that reinfection is unlikely in the first 90 days, so it may make sense to wait a few months.

While the image leaves room for interpretation, the explicit character or sexual purpose of the image is questionable, from a legal standpoint. For example, it would be hard to prove to a judge that the image depicts someone under 18 years old.
People of all ages, genders and races idolize influencers and celebrities, but the images are particularly impactful on young women, Fox said. If influencers are mainly thin, this then tells the consumer that this is 'the ideal.' The young mind may think, 'they look this way and that's why they have status.' This keeps the 'thin ideal' mainstream and idolized. Without a diversified following list, the endless stream of impossibly small waistlines, what I eat in a day videos and celebrities promoting magic-bullet diet pills can start to get to you. Megan Retherford, a graduate student in Michigan, fell into that trap in high school. At the time, she had come off some medication and grew into an adult body she wasn't quite expecting. I went from a size 0 to a size 10 in a matter of two years as a teenager, and my body has continued to change throughout my adult life, she told HuffPost. Years went by where Retherford loathed her body, but eventually she got sick of fixating on her weight and yo-yo diets that went nowhere. She set out to improve her self-image. Diversifying the body types she followed on Instagram played a huge part in that. Over the course of many years, I have been able to change my mindset almost entirely and I have a very healthy relationship with food and my body now largely due to who I see living fulfilling lives as fat women on social media, she said.
Instead they seek to crack down on the sort of nonviolent civil disobedience that has shaped much of our nation's greatest political and social victories. The legislation's similarities were no coincidence. As climate change projections grew more dire and the bloody 2016 fight to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline became a new Alamo cry for environmentalists, the fossil fuel industry's political allies began promoting state legislation to restrict protests. Oklahoma passed the first legislation protecting pipelines as critical infrastructure in 2017. Shortly after, the American Legislative Exchange Council, the conservative policy shop funded by big business and right-wing billionaires, drafted a generic bill it called the Critical Infrastructure Protection Act.
If any players or personnel are identified as such, they would remain apart from the team and facilities for five days from the last exposure to a positive individual, McCarthy said in an email to The Associated Press. They would be eligible to return to the team and play in the game.

If you are encouraged to learn from the lessons learned from your mistake, you have a winning job.
I realized that while my aerobic capacity and muscle structure felt good in general, I was lacking the coordination of inner core muscles, which I had never had to think about before, she recalled. With help from a physical therapist specializing in postpartum-related work, she sought to regain that stability and added a third workout ― pilates ― three days a week.

You also need to figure out your essential expenses, such as housing, insurance, utilities, food, transportation, health care, debt payments and child care. These types of expenses can be cut down if needed, but they can't be eliminated from your budget.
Also, I do whine a lot over homework because it is boring and long. I think this worries my parents because they keep reminding me that work ethic and ethos are more important than IQ. They were concerned when I spent only one hour to study all 14 chapters for my chemistry final, but then I got a 101 percent. Remember their obsession with the marshmallow test? I hope to transfer to MIT in two to three years. Hopefully, MIT will disagree with my parents' definition of work ethic.

Soon, I not only started posting less but I became virtually paralyzed by my Instagram anxiety. Instead of venturing out to explore the new cities I was in, I would shut myself in a hotel room and do nothing. I'd sit on the bed for hours, convinced my pictures weren't ― and never would be ― good enough, so why go out and even try? I even put off plans because I didn't feel pretty enough, didn't have the right outfit, or told myself I couldn't get a worthy Instagram post out of the experience.

In response, youth activists and a new cadre of progressive lawmakers, led largely by the Bronx's own Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), outlined an alternative. The Green New Deal, a policy framework for the kind of federal industrial policy not seen since World War II, quickly gained steam.
