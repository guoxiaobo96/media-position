contrary to the high hopes that obama's presidency would bring the country together, americans were bitterly divided leading up to the election in 2016. the democratic party had become increasingly concerned with identity politics, which is the idea that a person's race, sex, and sexual orientation form the most important parts of their humanity and that politics should reflect that belief. republicans, meanwhile, believed that their politicians had been too compromising with the increasingly radical left and that they needed a political outsider who would not back down or compromise with the democrats. ... the republican party nominated real estate mogul and reality television star donald trump from new york, whose determination and bombastic mannerisms gave republicans the fighter they wanted. as a businessman, trump stated that he would 'take the brand of the united states and make it great again.' however, many conservatives were wary of trump because of his occasional vulgar speech, his past immoral behavior, and his public support of homosexual marriage; but some were persuaded by trump's choice for his running mate — indiana's conservative governor mike pence.

i think the moment will not only not be forgotten, but this moment will become a memory that galvanises, a memory that gives hope, a memory that shows you can leave certain domestic structures behind. these are women challenging the state, and it's an authoritarian state right now. even if they don't get what they want, this will not be a failure. even if nothing outstanding or iconoclastic comes out of it, the stories around shaheen bagh will be important as a mobilising force for whatever happens in the future. these women will be remembered for being the first people to take to the streets against the caa. that's really a story of courage.

in fact, that photogenic deep purple base that you think is all superfruit is really just a puree of other fruits, thickeners and sometimes dairy alternatives for added creaminess, with just enough powdered berry or sometimes juice concentrate to give it that dramatic hue. it's not often that it's even frozen pure açai berry, which carries an even higher cost for an exotic fruit that already requires a lot of preparation and processing for shipment.
note: a lot of people are bad with reading sarcasm online. it should be emphasized that this essay is written with sarcasm, and i don't actually believe the asian fetish is a good thing. but do what you do internet — drag my name across the web for the next 24 hours then forget about me until i pump out the next clickbait essay on yellow fever in a year when you will get mad at me again!
the treatment my friends and i experience at the capitol as advocates and activists stands in stark contrast with the way the proud boys and other rioters were treated on jan. 6. whereas i have come to expect metal detectors and strict enforcement of the rules that have kept the capitol safe for over 200 years, the capitol police opened barricades for the rioters and waved them in despite their display of such overt symbols of hate as the confederate flag and a camp auschwitz shirt.

there's no reason to take that video seriously, there's no reason to give him any credit for it, there is no reason at all to believe that it means that he's going to change going forward, mary trump said. we're still looking at a very difficult, potentially dangerous 12 days, and it certainly shouldn't do anything to let him off the hook.

first, she spent time meditating. she took time to calm her thoughts and restore her energy after months of expending herself on the campaign trail. leaders who are pulled a hundred different directions by advisers, supplicants and commentators need time to think deeply and fill the well. they seldom get the time. they should insist on it.

in 2009, when barack obama's white house chief of staff rahm emanuel wanted to change the census chain of command so that the bureau would report directly to the white house, oversight republicans, led by my former boss darrell issa, blasted the action as a shamefully transparent attempt by your administration to politicize the census bureau and manipulate the 2010 census. the appearance of white house interference in the census prompted house republicans to introduce a resolution calling on the secretary of commerce to use all legal and reasonable means to count every living person in the 2010 census. the resolution, by the way, made no mention of citizenship or legal status.

thus, in practice, there are only two ways to fix the euro: a far-reaching political union proposed in the five president's report in 2015 or returning to the system described in the maastricht treaty, where member states would be responsible for their own economies only (no bail-out).
german chancellor angela merkel has strived to be a leader on the world stage in tackling climate change. but germany is still heavily dependent on burning coal for power. some critics fear that phasing out coal too quickly would disrupt the country's economy and lead to major job losses.
the titans simply were not competitive, on either side of the ball—a reality that revealed itself even more clearly when they could not gain traction in a downtrodden afc south race. mariota is the key to this franchise's future, and titans ownership understandably wants to ensure it has the right guy running the show.

the key is making ice cream that helps keep him on track. he is, after all, a labrador whose attention wanders easily. i use mini disposable 5 oz. bath cups you can find at any grocery store. fill them almost to the rim with low fat plain yogurt, and then mix in a sprinkle of melted peanut butter (melting the peanut butter in the microwave helps you mix it in). make sure to choose natural, ground peanut butter to avoid giving them too much sugar. (read the ingredients. it should just say: peanuts.) one regular-sized 32 oz. tub of yogurt makes about 12 small cups. freeze them overnight. in the morning you can use them to get your pooch to follow you around in figure eights, or any other kind of healthy exercise in your home, for as long as you want. works like a charm.
i worked with multi-national corporations, organizations and countries helping them create policies, programs, and services that are accessible to everyone. these entities want to ensure that everyone has access to their services, products and that their employees also have access. in the late nineties, frances west, chief accessibility officer at ibm, gave a presentation stating that ibm had three priorities in all internal and external ict development:

i have had this disease since i was 6 years old. no one knows why this happens. autoimmunity is still a mystery to doctors, but we do know there are triggers, like traumatic events, stress, compromised gut health, allergies, mold, etc. i was so young when it started, i mostly remember my mom being upset and counting the hairs on my pillow every morning.

one really good thing that has happened, which is about women's empowerment, is that the usual people who used to be representatives of the so called muslim community — which is really really diverse, of course — people like (syed) shahabuddin — i think, that time has gone. that's really really important.

si la gestion de l'épidémie de 2002-2003 (774 morts dans le monde dont 349 en chine continentale et 299 à hong kong) avait valu des critiques de l'organisation mondiale de la santé (oms), c'est qu'à l'époque, les autorités chinoises avaient tardé à donner l'alerte et tenté de camoufler l'ampleur de la situation.

however it's painted, whatever new ingredients are used to give margarine a glow-up, they're still manufactured substitutes made from what is essentially water and one or many types of vegetable oil. at the end of the day, despite shiny stickers that may advertise lower numbers for saturated fat or cholesterol or feature added benefits that speak to today's trends, such as cultures for tang and body, and omega-3s, they're still 80% fat — just not milkfat.

prominent gop pollster neil newhouse said that his firm's final nbc/wall street journal poll in late october asked republicans and republican-leaning independent voters whether they considered themselves supporters of donald trump or of the republican party. a full 54% cited trump. only 38% said they supported the party.
some republicans, including many of the most vocal trump critics, said that the party deserves to lose both of the georgia senate seats for failing to stand up to trump over the past five years. doing so might be the best path forward to reclaim its independence from him, they added.
as a sensible precaution and for practical reasons in the current circumstances, a number of changes are being made to the queen's diary, buckingham palace said in a statement.
and yet, vindication isn't the only feeling at play. there's something about this sudden shift that's wildly infuriating as well. oh, now you're listening? i thought recently when a writer i'd criticized as sexist ― only to have my critique neatly brushed aside by male colleagues and friends ― faced career consequences after being accused of personal misbehavior toward women. why couldn't you take me seriously when i broke down all the none-too-subtle misogyny in his writing?
the arrest and beating inside the thana was payback, but not only for the facebook videos that embarrass the bjp government and raise questions about how the up police were operating on 19 december.
today the world faces a different kind of global threat, similarly metastasizing after years of failing to confront it. keeping the planet from warming beyond recognition requires an unprecedented economic effort to halt climate-changing emissions. but even the most optimistic scientific projections call for not only stopping the output of carbon dioxide but also removing the vast concentrations of the gas already in the atmosphere, where it will continue to trap heat for more than a century to come.

california governor projects over half the state, 25 million people, could get coronavirus — 3/19/20, 6:58 pm et in a letter to president donald trump, california gov. gavin newsom requested a u.s. navy hospital ship be brought into port in los angeles to help decompress our current healthcare delivery system. newsom noted that in some parts of the state, the rate of confirmed covid-19 cases is doubling every four days. we project that roughly 56% of our population — 25.5 million people — will be infected with the virus over an eight week period, the democratic governor wrote. the governor's spokesperson later clarified that this projection did not include mitigation efforts, which the state is already taking, such as establishing strict shelter-in-place policies in several major counties, including across the san francisco bay area. california is among the states with the highest numbers of reported covid-19 cases. nearly 700 californians have been confirmed to have the disease and more than a dozen have died, as of thursday. — sarah ruiz-grossman

kansas cut taxes drastically in 2012, counting on economic growth to make up the difference. but despite vast budget cuts, the state's revenue never caught up, creating a roughly $300 million budget hole and prompting a backlash among residents and lawmakers.
such changes have happened before. six-day weeks were routine in the u.s. and europe until the beginning of the 20th century. famously, henry ford increased productivity in 1914 by cutting down to an eight-hour day while doubling wages. change spread thanks to pressure from the organized labor movement but also the great depression, when employers sought to spread scarce work around.
the situation can get worse at any time and we cannot even predict how long it will last, woo kee-hong, the president of south korea's biggest airline, said in a memo to staff that summed up the turmoil facing the industry.
in 2014, researchers compared straight and gay teenagers on cardiovascular risk. they found that the gay kids didn't have a greater number of stressful life events (i.e. straight people have problems, too), but the ones they did experience inflicted more harm on their nervous systems. annesa flentje, a stress researcher at the university of california, san francisco, specializes in the effect of minority stress on gene expression. all those little punches combine with our adaptations to them, she says, and become automatic ways of thinking that never get challenged or turned off, even 30 years later. whether we recognize it or not, our bodies bring the closet with us into adulthood. we don't have the tools to process stress as kids, and we don't recognize it as trauma as adults, says john, a former consultant who quit his job two years ago to make pottery and lead adventure tours in the adirondacks. our gut reaction is to deal with things now the way we did as children. even salway, who has devoted his career to understanding minority stress, says that there are days when he feels uncomfortable walking around vancouver with his partner. no one's ever attacked them, but they've had a few assholes yell slurs at them in public. that doesn't have to happen very many times before you start expecting it, before your heart starts beating a little faster when you see a car approaching. but minority stress doesn't fully explain why gay men have such a wide array of health problems.
senning went on to explain that traditions have changed over the years, and not everybody wants to approach a funeral service in the same way. for instance, as elaine swann, founder of the swann school of protocol, told huffpost, sometimes the family may ask everybody to wear a particular color, because it was the deceased's color.

a lot of people are rightfully asking really tough questions of the capitol police and the reality is that, unlike most police departments, we're going to have a really tough time getting answers, said michael morisy, chief executive of muckrock, a news outlet devoted to public records access and reporting. they have a track record of not being transparent about their operations, especially when there's scandal or scrutiny.
the likelihood of transmission on a general flight isn't high enough yet for experts to recommend avoiding all air travel. if you're traveling somewhere that's considered low risk, like in the u.s., the cdc recommends practicing good hygiene by washing your hands frequently and avoiding contact with sick people. you can also wipe down common surfaces like your seat and tray table.

you have to hand it to your date: he or she picked the restaurant, effusively recommended things on the menu and knew exactly what bar you should head to after dinner. it might be nice to have someone plan everything out for you for a change, but narcissists call the shots for a very particular reason, malkin said: open-ended plans might end with them not getting their way ― something they don't respond well to.

as the recent drought showed, farmers respond to lower allotments of snowmelt by reverting to the pump—dropping wells to tap in to the central valley's underground aquifers. but that practice quickly led to a host of problems, from dry wells serving poor communities to rapid land subsidence, which snarls up roads, bridges, and aqueducts. farmers were grabbing groundwater so fast that in 2014, the california legislature passed a law requiring that groundwater basins achieve balance—the rate at which water is taken out can't exceed the rate at which water goes in—by 2040. by then, if climate change proceeds apace, farmers will be caught between tough groundwater rules and a vanishing snowpack.
municipales 2020 - je connais la culture de la lutte. je sais ce que les travailleurs français ont obtenu par le combat syndical, déclarait édouard philippe, lors de la présentation de la réforme des retraites, le 11 décembre dernier. mais les origines familiales du premier ministre, dont le grand-père fut docker adhérent à la cgt, n'impressionnent guère les grévistes du port du havre, bloqué par une opération port mort durant 72 heures, du 22 au 24 janvier. une mobilisation qui s'est conclue ce vendredi dans les rues havraises par une importante manifestation intersyndicale de plusieurs milliers de personnes, dont un long cortège de dockers et portuaires.
but what does back actually mean when the u.s. is still in the grips of the coronavirus pandemic, and the vast majority of americans are not vaccinated? is it safer now to spend time around friends, family or other daily contacts who haven't gotten their shots? can you see someone who has been vaccinated even if you have not?

subjecting the capitol police to foia wouldn't necessarily lead to major revelations about the storming of congress. the law includes nine exemptions, including provisions protecting sensitive national security documents and records involved in an open investigation. all transparency laws include major carveouts that shield departments from disclosing sensitive law enforcement records, particularly during an investigation, lomonte said.

le risque d'une 2e vague le risque devant une deuxième vague de contamination inquiète tous les pays du monde déjà touchés par le virus. dans la logique, la fin du confinement risque de permettre un nouveau pic épidémique. avec son relâchement, il n'y aura plus de barrière à la propagation d'un virus tel que le coronavirus. l'immunité collective est le seul moyen d'empêcher la propagation de ce type de maladie. mais pour cela, il faut que les deux tiers de la population soient protégés contre le virus. il y a plusieurs façons pour atteindre cet objectif, comme expliqué dans la vidéo ci-dessous. à ce propos, le 7 avril, le conseil scientifique estimait ainsi à peut-être 10 à 15% le nombre de français devenus résistants au virus. un chiffre encore très loin des 66% nécessaires pour l'immunité collective.

pour comprendre, le mieux est d'imaginer un texte que vous écrivez, explique au huffpost emma hodcroft, chercheuse à l'université de bâle, spécialiste de la génétique des virus. si vous faites une coquille, une faute de frappe, généralement cela ne va pas rendre le document meilleur, ou pire, c'est juste une coquille, explique-t-elle. il y a un très, très petit risque que cela change un mot clé et change ainsi tout le document, mais les chances sont minces.

a great boss is a port in a storm. they don't get rattled, even when everything is going haywire. under immense pressure, they act like eugene kranz, flight director for the apollo 13 mission. in the moments after the explosion, when death looked certain and panic seemed like the only option, kranz kept his cool, saying, okay, now, let's everybody keep cool. let's solve the problem, but let's not make it any worse by guessing. in those initial moments, he had no idea how they were going to get the astronauts home, but, as he later explained, you do not pass uncertainty down to your team members. people who've worked for an unforgettable boss often look back later and marvel at their coolness under pressure. that's why, 45 years after apollo 13, people are still talking about eugene kranz and his leadership during that crisis.

tragedies change the course of our life. they bring into the light our faults and weaknesses which would otherwise remain undetected. like shakespeare said in julius caesar in the words of brutus, we are underlings. everything good or bad that comes into our life is because of who we are. we attract not what we want but who we are and if we are to attract better people and circumstances, we must build those qualities in ourselves. we must become one with our ideal dreams and desires. creator of the universe has made us in such a way that we must move on in our life or perish. all the experiences in our life good and bad come to teach us things that we must learn at the moment, apply the information and get on with what we must do. each of us are here to perform the work of the creator. finding your dreams and reaching your destination.

if the plans of modi's bureaucrats and advisors are realised, this system will automatically track when a citizen moves between cities, changes jobs, buys new property, when a member of a family is born, dies or gets married and moves to their spouse's home. the interoperability of modern database systems means there is no technical limit to the extent of data that can be collected and indexed by this master database of databases. in a meeting on october 4, 2019, for instance, a special secretary of the niti aayog even proposed geo-tagging every single home and integrating it with bhuvan, a web-based geo-spatial portal developed by the indian space research organisation (isro).

cable has been here before of course. he served as acting leader in 2007 during the transition from sir ming campbell to nick clegg. but that was under very different circumstances than where he finds his party today. we had never been in government. so, you know, there was nothing to defend. it was all attack, attack, attack. ten years on cable, the former business secretary, acknowledges his association with the coalition has been a factor in the past but this diminishing as an issue. we do know from our surveys there about 25%+ of the electorate are considering voting for us. they may not, and they haven't firmed up on it, but there is a potential market, he says. from my recollection a majority of those who currently not voting for us but considering it are labour, on the left labour people. i guess the coalition was an issue for them but will become less so over time. the whole brexit thing has brought other issues to the fore. there are some good things happening, cable says of his party's position. we have this record level of membership, lots of enthusiastic young people. we are the youngest of the three parties, i've discovered, in terms of average age. you go around the country and lots of kind of idealistic young people, full of energy who want to do things and that's really good.

there really is no objective criteria one can use as a measuring stick to make these selections, except, maybe, for sales. but some important/impactful gadgets didn't sell particularly well at their genesis, and other gadgets are based on earlier products. i also differentiate impactful products from impactful technologies, and therefore didn't consider the first product in a new technology wave, such as the first of many cd or dvd players from a host of suppliers.

one study investigating why living in the gay community increases depression found that the effect only showed up in masculine gay guys. the second reason the gay community acts as a unique stressor on its members is not about why we reject each other, but how. in the last 10 years, traditional gay spaces—bars, nightclubs, bathhouses—have begun to disappear, and have been replaced by social media. at least 70 percent of gay men now use hookup apps like grindr and scruff to meet each other. in 2000, around 20 percent of gay couples met online. by 2010, that was up to 70 percent. meanwhile, the share of gay couples who met through friends dropped from 30 percent to 12 percent. usually when you hear about the shocking primacy of hookup apps in gay life—grindr, the most popular, says its average user spends 90 minutes per day on it—it's in some panicked media story about murderers or homophobes trawling them for victims, or about the troubling chemsex scenes that have sprung up in london and new york. and yes, those are problems. but the real effect of the apps is quieter, less remarked-upon and, in a way, more profound: for many of us, they have become the primary way we interact with other gay people. it's so much easier to meet someone for a hookup on grindr than it is to go to a bar by yourself, adam says.

on my second visit, i clean the living room. i have not seen her house this messy before. i pick up a wadded cardigan laying against the wall. bloodstains cover the beige cotton. i ask about it and she says it is from the day of her fall. tears blur my vision as i take it to the laundry room and spray it with cleanser. i imagine her panic as she bleeds, hurting and unable to stand. an hour after she fell, the mail carrier heard her yelling and called 911. the bloodstains wash out, but mom's fear of falling, of being alone, doesn't fade.

maybe it's because i've recently come to believe that there is no such thing as failure, really. yes, while rejection, mistakes and unfulfilled goals are very disappointing, they are not failures and they should not be perceived as stop signs. they are merely detour signs. life's way of saying, find another way to succeed. did you fail to win a new client's business, get in to your top college choice, get a publishing deal, a promotion, a dream job? there is a difference between when an objective fails to happen and failure. adopting this mindset is powerful. the very thing about failure that's so painful is that it makes us feel weak. it makes us turn inward and feel badly about ourselves. it pricks a hole in our balloon of confidence.

treder-wolff said this type of thinking is harmful because it eliminates that essential learning phase of a new role or skill when we must be free to flail and flounder as we figure it out. recognizing this thought as toxic is an important step, as is replacing it with new, healthy thoughts ― try: everything worth doing requires the freedom to flail and flounder, everything i put a good effort into will result in learning to do something better and better or everything i put a good effort into changes my brain.

after criticism that mandalay bay apparently did not check on paddock's room for a period of time, disney world resorts changed its do not disturb sign to a room occupied sign and said rooms would be checked by staff at least once a day. a spokeswoman did not link the change to the vegas mass shooting but told the review-journal it did so for safety, security and guest experience.
the problem, though, is that many of these statements, these feel-good pronouncements and glossy reports that are coming out of fortune 500 companies, are not being backed up with substantive action.

going to the grocery store, which i only do every two weeks and no more, requires me to meticulously plan ahead so that i have everything ready for the ritual i need to follow when i return with my food. (i say need here rather than want, because right now it is very much a necessity to have procedures in place to prevent the emotional distress associated with my germophobia). i need to carefully sanitize everything i bring home before putting it away. and i do this in the garage, thereby minimizing the potential germs brought into the house.
i put so much time and effort into my instagramming. in return, it was robbing me of my time, my confidence and my joy.
as covid-19 raged and georgia's small businesses went under, democratic candidates jon ossoff and raphael warnock owned the economic message of putting money in people's pockets, senate majority pac president j.b. poersch wrote in a memo to donors obtained by huffpost. this was the perfect contrast to the corrupt gop ticket, which saw a tidal wave of negative news that we hammered in ads.
i'm so grateful for every bit of it -- my own pain in the earliest days of discovering something that felt like a knife's edge, the itchy pain of being alone and figuring out what it all meant after the dust settled, and even the hardest pain of watching this season happen in the lives of the couple who was always my fixed center point and likely always will be.
german reinsurer munich re, in its annual natural catastrophe review, also said last year's total losses, including those not insured, were $330 billion, the second-worst in history after 2011 when an earthquake and tsunami wreaked havoc in japan.
with such a thin hold on power, that means democrats will still have to overcome major opposition from their republican colleagues in order to fully enact their agenda.
they also said they'll balance their time between the u.k. and north america, although they didn't specify whether that would be in meghan's native u.s. or in canada, where they just spent a six-week vacation.
the rare impeachment trial, unfolding in an election year, is testing whether trump's actions toward ukraine warrant removal at the same time that voters are forming their own verdict on his white house.
on 19 december, 2019, sadaf jafar, who came out to protest against the discriminatory citizenship amendment act, was the only woman arrested by the uttar pradesh police in the bharatiya janata party (bjp)-run state. for two days, the police did not tell her frantic family members where jafar, who is a member of the opposition congress party, was.
kejriwal's measured approach, neither left nor right, but not quite centre, say analysts, could be the only way to challenge the bjp in the present political climate of hindu majoritarianism.
in january, the stop enabling sex traffickers act, which was proposed by sen. rob portman (r-ohio), cleared the senate committee on commerce, science, and transportation.
i think it depends on what you are spending it on. obviously if you are spending on education, that's probably a good thing. if you are spending it on a lot of vacations because you are afraid you might not travel again after you have children, you might want to be a little more conscious of putting money aside. it really comes down to what the expenditures are.
when christians get behind any type of movement to further dehumanize entire communities in the name of jesus — a man who was lynched by a crowd of politically frenzied religious zealots — we must pause. no, pausing is not enough; we must both listen and speak up.
the defense faltered late in those defeats ... and at just about every key moment throughout the 2015 season. new york allowed 299 yards passing and 420 total yards per game, worst in the league in both categories. how much of that was on coughlin? he deserved blame, of course, but most coaches would have been hard-pressed to generate much from the group reese put together.
saraph said 32 separate petitions had been filed against aadhaar, highlighting its potential for misuse in everything from money laundering to profiling individuals.
this is a personal decision, and i have no doubt that her future husband and in-laws will support her in every way possible, he said.
we're going to keep saying black lives matter, the candidate added.
the supreme court converted all of them into one petition against the uidai and decided the case on the basis of what uidai said it could or could not do, saraph said. all those 32 cases must be reopened.
sure, the concept might seem a little strange (though not as strange as greeting each house), but the core of kondo's process is about being appreciative of all you have. gratitude is very important, she affirms. though owning too much stuff can become stressful, kondo reminds us that we shouldn't take our prosperity for granted.
the world health organisation this week stopped short of calling the outbreak a global health emergency.
survey questions about who's responsible are a case in point. some polls have asked americans to pick between blaming trump, democrats or republicans. in those surveys, very few respondents name congressional republicans as the group primarily to blame.
spacex is the only shipper capable of returning space station experiments and other items intact. the other cargo capsules are filled with trash and burn up when reentering earth's atmosphere.
the democrats have generally built alliances with those segments of the employee class who most need government support (those paid below median wage and salary levels) and with those who welcome those social trends such as secularism, urbanism, diverse sexuality and immigration that upset the people who the republicans target for alliances. the so-called culture wars in the u.s. both reflect and reinforce the class alliances constructed inside the two parties.
do we need to stockpile food to prepare for a possible quarantine?
yet there have been failures as well as successes. back in 2015, the u.s. programming education company treehouse declared it would have no managers and a four-day week. literally, i was, like, fuck the 40-hour workweek. we're going to work 32 hours, because who says we can't, right? because we write the rules,' founder ryan carson recalled last year in a growthlab interview. but over time, he changed his mind.
democrats are now strategizing ways to pass immediate economic relief, like the checks, and potentially use procedural maneuvers through the budget process to bypass their republican senate colleagues and move legislation on their own terms.
there were times when the poster was guilty of tmi.
if you recall, quinn develops a relationship with one of his captors, qasim (alireza bayram). qasim, conflicted about his group's mission in relation to his religion, eventually goes on to inject quinn with an antidote to the sarin.
my parents split up before i was 2 years old. my father went on to marry a total of seven times. my mother found true love with another woman. and me? i've been divorced twice. but i still believe in marriage, partially because although it took my parents several tries to find their soulmates, they both eventually did. mom and pat have been together over 40 years. dad and tricia have been together over 20. they have taught me to never to give up on finding true love. ― lara lillibridge, author of the forthcoming girlish: growing up in a lesbian home

hong kong has seen a number of lawsuits in recent years over the rights of gay couples, but this is the first legal challenge seeking to legalize same-sex union.
acog says that women should absolutely have access to all of the information that's available to them on vaccine safety in pregnancy (again, at this point, not much) and that they should be encouraged to talk to their health care providers about their options — but that having a conversation with a doctor or midwife beforehand is not a must.
however, the predicted shift turned to be not true as digital marketers still topped as the most in-demand jobs in 2016. while there has little to no change in this area, there are new trends in the field of human resources, too.

tax cuts for the ultra wealthy mean far less to them than cuts for people with modest incomes, krugman noted. and extra money in millions of hands boosts spending.

three years ago, moe amaya and his co-founders alex dixon and robert yuen were working seven days a week on their startup, creating software tools for architects. but they didn't want that culture for their staff, so when they started hiring they created a four-day week, allowing employees to choose their day off. fridays ease a long commute, but wednesdays seem favorite.
christian textbooks used in thousands of schools around the country teach that president barack obama helped spur destructive black lives matter protests, that the democrats' choice of 2016 nominee hillary clinton reflected their focus on identity politics, and that president donald trump is the fighter republicans want, a huffpost analysis has found.
i'm glad that my once unpopular opinion that tarantino films are rubbish because it's like watching the worst thoughts of the annoying lad you don't fancy but he bothers you anyway playing out in hypercolour, is finally getting it's moment. — jess phillips (@jessphillips) february 4, 2018
even if you have access to a 401(k) or other employer-sponsored plan, it is best to consider saving into other types of investment accounts because each has their own unique benefits and characteristics, revelli said. there are many other savings options out there that give you full control of your assets, have more flexibility in distributions and have more investment choices.
the sexism in your workplaces must end, judd says. only when women have critical mass in every department at your companies, including building platforms from the ground up, will the conversations about priorities and solutions change.

q: from whom did you learn how to be a man and is there any defining memory that you felt that you'd achieved it?
i hear talk shows and see articles shared online where people talk about marriage tips and what to do when you are struggling in a partnership. i'm realizing that people think marriage is hard these days because you aren't always happy. because you feel tired and you work too much and the kids are always demanding something and the other person can't make all that go away. is that hard? really? because now that i've seen what the hard part actually is -- the grieving and the accepting and the letting go -- burnt dinner on the stove or noisy children or a cluttered bathroom counter don't seem like a cause for unhappiness. whatever happy means anyway; it's always a moving target when you depend on the other person to provide it.
weinberg is far less certain about the country's long-term prospects. there are millions of people who believe trump when he says the election was stolen from him. a new administration won't change their minds.
security is so tight around the door leading to the senate chamber that when a friend who had clearance to be in that part of the building held up her phone to take a photo of herself and her infant son with their senator, capitol police immediately approached her and told her that she would have to leave if she did not put her phone away.

new york, the birthplace of the nation's annual climate march, has plenty of its own pollution problems. for example, in queens, the city's largest borough, the ravenswood generating station has another two years under city law to keep burning 3,264,000 gallons of fuel oil each year, producing annual emissions equivalent to about 500,000 cars. the city is also of the world's top garbage producers, and its recycling services lag behind other major metropoles.

it plays really well with the trump base. we buy almonds worth $600 million from the u.s. the produce comes mainly from california, which is the liberal stronghold of the democratic party. trump saying let's see how big the indian market is for nuts and let's try selling them pecan nuts becomes an election talking point. pecan nuts are mostly based in trump land, the flyover states like georgia. he says my trade deal with india is really helping you because i just got you another market. instead of buying almonds, they will also buy pecan nuts. in that sense, the trump base cares what happens with india.

ahead of the georgia senate runoffs, justice democrats and sunrise teamed up once again in december to argue that biden and democrats should turn the jan. 5 senate contests into a referendum on the inclusion of $1,200 checks in a covid-19 relief bill. around the same time, sens. bernie sanders (i-vt.) and josh hawley (r-mo.) mounted a public push for a second round of $1,200 payments ― americans received $1,200 checks from the cares act in march ― along with an additional $500 for every child. their pressure campaign, backed by the congressional progressive caucus, helped ensure the addition of a $600 stimulus in the bill that congress passed shortly before christmas.
here's what gives me hope. there's a traditional bifurcation in peoples' lives where they separate themselves into one part moral and one part economic. in other words, traditionally we are in a society of let me maximize my income during the week and then i'll give it away during the weekend, which is best embodied by the warren buffett giving pledge [where ultrawealthy people commit to giving away at least half their fortunes].
again, the mob traipsed through the city, unmasked and sure there would be no threats against their livelihood. the shedding of the masks was a subject of internal debate for the group, a move that some felt would grant their organization added legitimacy and respectability, the post reported.
larry cohen, chairman of our revolution, the offshoot of vermont sen. bernie sanders' 2016 presidential bid, said progressives will press democrats in congress to use the budget reconciliation process to work around the senate's 60-vote filibuster threshold. cohen argued that tactic might be used to accomplish long-sought goals like ending tax subsidies to fossil fuel companies and enabling the centers for medicare & medicaid services to negotiate as a single customer with pharmaceutical companies.

i've been a police officer for 10 years and it's definitely got worse. it used to be that people just wouldn't touch you, but now they don't have any second thoughts about doing it. [one day last may] i heard a radio call from lancashire police saying they needed a breathyliser for a driver in lancaster. it was 15 minutes from the end of my shift but i had one so i offered to help. they'd seen someone driving the wrong way round the one-way system and he looked drunk. this driver blows into the breathyliser and he goes over the limit. but as we were trying to get him out of the vehicle, his wife got out. she punched me in the face. i was in a state of shock, thinking 'what's just happened? ', then she punched me again. i sprayed her [with pepper spray] but she punched me again. and even as i tried to use my baton to defend myself, she punched me again. i only realised fully what she'd done when i saw the blood dripping from my nose as i tried to restrain her. she was in her late-40s, early-50s, quite short and sounded middle class. but she was drunk as well. she was prosecuted but was given a curfew order from 9pm to 7am for 30 days, told to pay £85 court costs and to compensate me with £100. for her, that £185 was not much more than a good night out.
a new generation of left-wing democrats, including reps. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.) and rashida tlaib (d-mich.), ran as champions of a green new deal, a sweeping federal policy to end fossil fuel use and guarantee high-wage clean-energy sector jobs to every american. it's a popular idea. one poll released last month pegged the number of registered voters who support a green new deal at 81 percent, including 57 percent of conservative republicans.
i am not saying any of those methods will not work. however, what i do encourage in addition to whatever method you choose is to:
but inslee said he's not wedded to a carbon pricing scheme as the central focus of a climate policy. carbon taxes are gaining favor among republicans and oil companies. but a new gas tax triggered fiery protests in france and became a rallying cry over the past few months against carbon taxes that don't directly benefit low- and middle-income workers.
steyer's decision not to run in 2020 only slightly shrinks the pool of democrats who are likely to attempt to unseat trump. elizabeth warren has already declared her candidacy, while former vice president joe biden, sen. kamala harris (d-calif.) and sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) are all rumored to be announcing runs, too.
his paramount concern, beyond his legacy, was what a second impeachment could do to his immediate political and financial future, according to four white house officials and republicans close to the west wing. they were not authorized to speak discuss private conversations and spoke on condition of anonymity.

brain friendly creative focuses on making work easier to recall by being recognised, resonant and relevant. we made activity brain-friendly by focusing on recognition: using yellow as a positive and dominant brand colour. we created emotional resonance through music and the use of 'good morning' (as a positive salutation). overall, the activity was relevant in context as it sought to tackle the curmudgeonly morning commuter mind-set head-on by giving him something to smile about.
how do you feel about consumption smoothing -- spending more than you might have, assuming your income is going to go up?
another good example is that which occurs in the north carolina department of public safety's polk youth detention center in butner, north carolina. there prison guards often use pepper spray and batons against the prisoners with minor provocation, which results in both enhanced violence amongst the prisoners themselves and a more pronounced them-versus-us attitude. this ratchets up the tension and violence of the facility.
we, as americans, are one hell of a screwed-up family but, even so, we're still a family.
the much further in question seems to be demanding things that would require a rewriting of the constitution, such as shifting resource projects to be under the control of the provinces and rewriting equalization payments. as well, the document calls for repealing policies such as the carbon tax and enforcing rule of law on energy project protests.

regardless of your frustration, they are the future of your organization. there are things that they do better than you and some that they do worse. complaining makes for interesting dinner party conversation, but it doesn't help your organization flourish in a future of upheaval and uncertainty. you need to change your perspective and lead today to ensure success tomorrow.

in a tit-for-tat sense, it does seem just that artists like louis c.k. and tarantino ― whose reputations were long bolstered by the plaudits of critics and the reflexive hipster posturing of fans ― have now slid to the wrong end of the my taste is better than yours hierarchy. that's not the point of this moment, nor should the goal of this reassessment be to simply unseat one set of white male icons, to turn the same smugly superior judgment on their fans that their detractors have experienced. it's only human, though, to feel vindicated.

as a child of divorce, i've experienced the sting of loss and i'm fine-tuned to the signs of rejection and abandonment. however, i've always believed that whether they last three months or three decades, relationships can provide their participants with the love, understanding and intimacy they need at the time. often, the courage to end a relationship that is no longer meeting both partners' needs shows the greatest strength. growing up in a divorced home taught me that marriage will never be my sole source of happiness so it's important to pursue your dreams to the best of your ability. ― terry gaspard, author of daughters of divorce: overcome the legacy of your parents' breakup and enjoy a happy, long-lasting relationship

girls who are smiling beside platters of stale, uneaten breakfast items are not enjoying a meal. i should know. i was one of them. couples who pose for hours in crowded tourist locations to get a perfect insta shot are not having the time of their lives. they are sweating, stressed, tired and completely blind to the very thing they are trying to get a picture of. i should know. i've been there. these photos make us crave a life that simply doesn't even exist. and then, when we can't achieve it, we feel badly about ourselves. it's sick, and it's gone way too far. so, going forward, i'm making a deal with myself when it comes to instagram. if i can grab a great shot during an activity i am already doing, in an outfit i am already wearing, in a location i am already going... awesome. i will snap a few photos and make a post. if the shot doesn't work out, at least i have a memory and a blurry candid photo to document it. when i look back on my past adventures now, it's the real, unstaged photos and seemingly pointless selfies that make my heart sing anyway ― not the curated, overedited, completely inauthentic shots. i haven't posted anything on instagram in over a month but i think i'm ready to give it a go again ― while following my new plan.

the things i have to do right now to keep my invisible nemesis at bay can be overwhelming. i'm not one to surrender without a fight though, so i have begun to employ a variety of ways to calm my mind. i listen to music and guided meditations, read novels, color, do jigsaw puzzles and play merge dragons on my tablet. and my two cats, bless them, are willing to give me lots of purr therapy, which helps immensely with the anxiety and the isolation.

today, medicaid is an entitlement program, like medicare and social security, meaning that spending automatically rises to cover the costs incurred for medical care. the federal government finances more than half of medicaid expenses, with states picking up the remaining share, which eases the fiscal burden on states, especially when the economy is poor. but states that adopt the healthy adult opportunity program would give up that open-ended guarantee of federal funding.

mysterybrand.net, which is riddled with grammatical errors, quietly removed its top prizes ― including beach vacations, premium california real estate and luxury vehicles ― following a maelstrom of scam accusations on social media in the wake of paul and le's viral videos. its now-deleted photo of a $250 million most expensive los angeles realty mansion was actually an image of a $188 million bel air home, the daily beast and others reported. and until recently, mystery brand's prize list included a 2018 lamborghini centenarió ― only 40 of which have ever been produced (all prior to 2018). the same goes for its real car rolls-royce phantom 2018 ― no such car was made last year.

in 1900, journalist and anti-lynching crusader ida b. wells wrote of the mass lynching that took place in new orleans that july, during which a white mob ran a relentless four-day campaign of racial terror against black residents. the incident, as wells described it, began with the inexcusable and unprovoked assault upon two colored men by police officers of new orleans. robert charles, one of the black men who was arrested, was attacked by one of the officers; he shot and killed the cop, and evaded arrest. white residents, long fueled by mob mentality as a course of retaliation, were given legal sanction to kill charles. reports say at least seven were killed as whites scoured the city preying on black residents.
sixteen major climate- and weather-related catastrophes caused a record $306.2 billion in damages and killed at least 362 people in 2017 as the united states suffered its worst wildfire and hurricane seasons in modern history, according to a report released monday by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration.

on occasion, questions and comments that seem insulting may be just that. buyers who come into a booth at the last hour of the last day of a show seeking large price reductions irritate stretan and other artists, because they seem to be putting down my work and me as a professional. he noted when someone comes into my display, they're not under any obligation to make my day or to support me, but to visitors who appear belligerent and want to bust your chops he gives short answers to their questions and recommends that they take a look at some of the other displays.
then-senator biden was not interviewed for this book, and we don't infrequently disagree with ari fleischer, the aide said. in fact, biden fought for legislation that would have forced bush to first attempt to get u.n. approval for any military action and in its absence certify to congress that there was no alternative course of action.

the 49ers started 1–0 with an upset of minnesota, then lost their next two (at pittsburgh and arizona) by a combined count of 90–25. any little hope left for the season was gone by then.
getting to that point will hinge largely on vaccination. the vaccine rollout has been slow thus far, and there is no approved vaccine for children yet. health officials have said in the past that most adults in the u.s. should have access to the vaccine by the end of june; it's not clear whether we are still on target for that goal.

the notion that great marriages are not about comfort and security isn't news to those of us who have been married for a while or anyone who has ever been in a stagnant relationship. while the idea that formalizing a commitment to a shared partnership may be news to those who haven't experienced the reality of long term matrimony, if you are in that group of veterans who have learned that this isn't necessarily the case you might be raising your eyebrows right about now or shaking your head. still you might want to continue reading. you might learn something new.

ari fleischer was bush's press secretary at the time. in 2005, he wrote a book, taking heat, in which he talked about a sept. 4, 2002, meeting at the white house where the president asked congressional leaders for support for a resolution of force against iraq. he recounted an exchange between bush and a democratic senator:

now, when amy poehler and maya rudolph took the stage on sunday, i wondered if those women ― two more of michaels' protégés ― could carry a contemporary awards show with minimal criticism. their timing, chemistry and delivery soared in the few minutes they were on camera. that, in part, had to do with their lack of dependency on the prompter, as they used most of their limited screen time to gaze into each other's eyes after a staged proposal. (a proposal that maybe mocked director glenn weiss' emmys engagement?) but wouldn't watching poehler and rudolph perform standup for 60 minutes be 10 times better than watching them read off overly rehearsed lines to a room full of people who are high on moët and their own egos?
yet there is something decidedly unique about this story, something that defies universalizing. lila and elena forged their friendship in poverty, entrenched in want and fueled by dreams of overcoming the turf wars and violence that defined their childhood. they grew up in a world full of words that killed, and their friendship was a buoy that kept them afloat among the wreckage. but when lila becomes engaged at fifteen, elena's identity, constructed in the image of her friend, is shattered: i was no longer able to trace a coherent design in the division of our fates. the concreteness of [the wedding] date made concrete the crossroads that would separate our lives. the last pages of this novel left me gasping for air, struck by the warped beauty and terrible injustice of growing apart -- and desperate for the next book in the series.
the point is, we have every reason to have faith in our military, he said. but while it is reasonable to expect the best, it would be irresponsible not to prepare for the worst.

johnson's own trial lawyers relied on a psychologist with no expertise in intellectual disability. that psychologist claimed johnson did not have an intellectual disability, based on an interpretation of johnson's iq test score that is now considered inaccurate. therefore, the jury was never asked to consider whether johnson had an intellectual disability that would disqualify him from a death sentence.
so, now the president who entered office promising to deport up to 3 million people is actually removing far fewer people than the democrat who preceded him ― even though ice's budget ballooned by more than 15 percent to $7.1 billion last year. and trump's fixation on securing partial funding for a wall is only making him more inefficient.
a non-alcoholic cheers to you, chrissy.
still, it's possible that president donald trump's goal was never realistic, given the challenges of launching such a massive program in a country with such a notoriously underfunded public sector. the pace is picking up now and, in a few parts of the country, states are well on their way to vaccinating the highest priority groups.

throughout all of these episodes, congressional republican leaders did nothing and continued to allow king to serve on the house judiciary committee, the committee that's responsible for immigration policy in america. so it's been interesting watching republicans, after all this time, pile on the anti-king bandwagon this week.

he continued, bizarrely: all of a sudden, 'well, maybe i'm going to hang on to that old clunker for another five years because i can't afford another new home because the government's taking a bigger portion of my income every year.'
public health experts and eventually the biden transition team called for changing that practice, on the theory that vaccine supply will probably be steady enough to provide second doses on time without holding any back now. the trump administration apparently agreed and, just this week, called for releasing the second doses.

many other countries with national health insurance systems don't have that kind of capability, which is likely one reason that vaccination in countries like france and germany has had a slower start. it may be no coincidence that the u.k., the european country administering shots the quickest, is also the one where, as in israel, the government is heavily involved in the provision of care and not just its financing.

despite trump's claims of voter fraud, state officials have insisted the elections ran smoothly and there was no evidence of fraud or other problems that would change the outcome. the states have certified their results as fair and valid. of the more than 50 lawsuits the president and his allies have filed challenging election results, nearly all have been dismissed or dropped. he's also lost twice at the u.s. supreme court.
kaepernick may have maxed out during the 2012 and '13 seasons anyway—he regressed last year, with harbaugh and roman around. but the chryst/tomsula combo put the finishing touches on it. tomsula benched kaepernick midway through the year, with the 49ers at 2–6.
when we talk about the body positive movement as it relates to women, we're often quick to point to the progress or lack thereof with regard to broad acceptance and inclusiveness of bodies of all sizes. but the pursuit of self-love is hardly a female-only problem, and the movement frequently fails to acknowledge just how much the burden of poor body image affects men.
we're ok with allowing our daughters and granddaughters to get an education and compete for great jobs, but there's still something inside that when a woman says, 'wait a minute, i'd like to lead, i'd like to be in charge,' little alarm bells start to ring, clinton said.

she also recommends that before people travel they take time to consider whether they can afford to take time off work if they are stuck in a quarantine, if they have sick leave, and if they can afford staying in a hotel abroad longer than planned.
at other times, the laugh can be enjoyed by all. i was at this one show, and an old farmer walked by, said hamden, connecticut painter william mccarthy. he took a look in my booth, then said about one painting, 'how long did it take you to do that, 10 minutes?' he was a large man, not to be reckoned with, and i said, 'oh, maybe about 25 seconds.' he then let out a big belly laugh, and we started talking. he actually said he liked my paintings. the farmer was not a buyer (he may have bought a hot dog there), but a testy situation was defused. in rare instances, mccarthy has found that what starts as a confrontation turns into a sale. visitors enter his booth display and begin voicing criticism of one thing or another (people think that artists are invisible, that they leave their feelings at the door, he said), such as that they hate the painting, they hate the colors, they hate the frame. although he was not part of the conversation, mccarthy may interject himself, saying, 'well, the intention of that painting was...' or 'i wanted to use those colors, because...' or 'i thought that frame was appropriate, because...,' which catches people off-guard. they take a second look. in fact, some sales have resulted, which surprised me: they started out saying that hated a painting that they end up buying.

in perdue's and loeffler's telling, a democratic senate would rubber stamp a socialist agenda, from ending private insurance and expanding the supreme court to adopting wholesale a green new deal that would spend trillions and raise taxes on every u.s. household by thousands of dollars each year. besides misrepresenting biden's and most democratic senators' policy preferences, that characterization ignores the reality of the senate's roster.

in fact, pro football focus lists the former stanford standout as the shiftiest running back in the league this season. no. 88 ― and yes, that should probably be changed to a number more befitting of a running back ― galloped for 163 yards and two touchdowns in a recent win over chicago. moreover, he has averaged a healthy 5.9 yards per rush, which would rank him first in the nfl if he had the qualified number of carries (100).

overall he's been a very adaptable kid because we travel all over ― we're in different time zones and hotels all the time. and he just kind of rolls with it, said randall. he's been a very solvable kid. when he's upset, you can usually figure out what he needs. so that's made it good because i think if he were more temperamental or difficult, then that would definitely wear on the sleep and recovery piece.

i was so afraid of destroying my friendship, but i knew i'd never forgive myself if i let my fear get in the way of what could be real happiness. my mom always said the reason she married my dad was he was the first person who loved her for who she was. i never understood that feeling until now. it doesn't feel like a risk, it feels safe. it feels like safety to observe another person, gazing at you all starry-eyed, and know that half the joy you feel comes from them really seeing you, and enjoying you so hard, knowing that there is not one part of them wishing you'd change.

the pandemic revealed both how insecure so many workers are, and that many of the most insecure, undervalued jobs are essential ― essential to our health, safety and well-being. from the farm worker and grocery worker to the child care and home care worker ― many of our essential workers lacked the wages, paid sick time and family leave, access to health care and family care needed to keep themselves safe as they were keeping us all safe. we must never forget that essential workers are essential all of the time, and that all work in america should offer the basic safety and security that allows for our collective well-being.

the bill, announced tuesday and set to be introduced wednesday, marks a significant step toward weaning the nation's largest and most economically influential city off fossil fuels. six cities across the united states already generate 100 percent of their electricity with renewables. the city council in washington, d.c., passed a bill last month requiring the city to offset 100 percent of its electricity purchases with renewable energy credits by 2032. but it would be a historic first for a metropolis like new york to shutter existing gas plants like these, and the city's move would likely ripple far beyond the five boroughs as other big cities sought ways to slash climate-changing emissions.
these concerns were highlighted in a guardian article in december that reported the rcmp were prepared to use lethal force against indigenous protesters blocking workers from clearing the coastal gaslink's natural gas pipeline route a year ago.

as a result of this increasing violence in federal prisons, union officials and pennsylvania lawmakers have advanced the idea of arming prison guards to keep them safe while on the job. senator bob casey, a democrat from pennsylvania, co-sponsored a bill which would permit many prison staffers to be armed with pepper spray. according to casey, guards face thousands of assaults every year, so it's important we give them the necessary tools to stay safe on the job.
at one campaign stop this week, ossoff said perdue's ridiculous attacks blow my mind. he scoffed at the claim that his policy ideas, which align closely with biden, amount to a leftist lunge. but the challenger agreed with the incumbent on how much the georgia runoffs matter.
president-elect joe biden is facing mounting pressure to drop a prominent lawyer currently working for one of the world's largest oil companies from the transition team's list of potential nominees for solicitor general.
crucially, the cra requires only a simple majority of senators to get a disapproval resolution through the senate. that's good for democrats, who will only control 50 seats in the senate and have to rely on vice president-elect kamala harris for tie-breaking votes.

for instance, you might refinance a 10-year student loan to a term of seven years. it would result in higher monthly payments, but you'd pay the loan off faster and save money on interest. and if you can refinance to a lower interest rate as well, more of your money will go toward paying down the balance as fast as possible.

he spent june and july in custody on remand. i attended court to read out a victim statement and the judge started giving him his sentences, two years in total. at that point i'm thinking, not bad, not brilliant. and then the judges said 'i'm going to suspend that sentence for two years'. i left the courtroom before i said anything. i walked out because i could have got myself into trouble. to say i was gobsmacked is an understatement. they've got to do something to protect the emergency services now because it's just getting ridiculous. we are definitely getting more police officers assaulted. one of my colleagues had his jaw broken. people are more willing to have a go at you. i've been 22 years in the police and it's got worse, for sure. it just seems to be every day a cop is getting injured and nothing is happening. nikki williams, 34, junior sister, a&e ward, london.

but, much like defeating prohibition before it, it is indeed a fight for liberation from government tyranny and overreach. citizens used to regularly be locked up in prison for merely possessing even a trace amount of what is, in essence, just a plant. people were routinely given decades-long prison sentences for having natural plant matter in their possession. those lucky enough to escape the hoosegow still faced steep fines, the destruction of careers, disqualification for student loans or government housing, and repossession of houses, cars, and money on the momentary whim of police officers ― on a daily basis. marijuana is reportedly supposed to induce paranoia in its users, but how paranoid is it to be worried about such things when the consequences were so drastic for getting caught? to put it another way: are you truly paranoid if they really are after you?

but a catastrophic epidemic is unlikely to dissuade republicans who have been clamoring to substantially curtail medicaid. the gop's failed obamacare replacement bill in 2017 included a similar block grants proposal and the party has been trying to impose one since the 1980s, when president ronald reagan backed a version of the policy.

it's true that there are some things that i am weirdly good at. the doctors call it asynchronous learning. that means i can learn academic subjects at an accelerated speed and even out of sequence. for example, i learned linear algebra concepts before i ever took a formal algebra class. my parents like to say that i literally khan academy'ed my way into college. but there are other areas where my brain is still catching up, like handwriting, spelling and taking notes. i am using spellcheck a lot for this essay! also, i am just ok on piano, and i don't learn foreign languages easily. i am trying to challenge myself by learning bengali from my family and mandarin from my very patient tutor ms. vienna. please wish me luck!

i remember this one time when i was teaching some elderly women a dance for an upcoming show they were having. they were so delightful to work with. i typically would bring my daughter with me to these rehearsals. she was about 3 or 4 at the time when i was teaching and i would usually bring toys with me to keep her occupied. this one particular day i didn't. i was already annoyed that i left the toys at home and i was running late so i couldn't turn back. i went into the rehearsal feeling irritated. as i started rehearsing with the ladies, my daughter kept going in between the dance lines and trying to dance with them. i kept giving her the eye (most moms know what that is) but she wasn't catching it. finally, i went and got her and put her on my hip while i was teaching. for some reason she was more active than normal and me being irritated did not help at all. i gave the ladies a five minute break and then i took that time to talk with her. while talking with her, one of the ladies, ms. mary, came up to me and said baby, let her be a child. she isn't a statue so she isn't going to be still. just let her be. well that shut me up for the evening. i think ms. mary sensed that i was annoyed and bothered.

do a simple google search for asian women and you'd think we were on sale. i'm not condemning asian women for being sex positive, but the pervasiveness of unrealistic and hypersexualized images of asian women feed the stereotype that asian women are sexually available to western men. these images aren't just dehumanizing, they put us at risk for violence. as rachel kuo writes: these stereotypes leveraged against east asian women have been normalized, just like rape culture. these tropes can be found in representations in media, comments that harass us sexually and racially, and ways we're constructed via laws and policy.
the leading option for cutting the average american man's 40.8-hour week (or the average woman's 36.2 hours) now, however, is enabling people to produce the same amount in less time. in practice, that means automating or ditching time-wasting activities to focus on what matters. look at your work and ask your people what would it take to carve an hour off, advises maroney. that doesn't mean every idea people come up with is going to be brilliant, but people who do the job every day have a better sense of it.

the tight margin, however, may force her out, as some moderate democrats may not want to run in 2022 with pelosi also running for reelection. with the house breakdown so tight, republicans could easily flip the house in a midterm election in any case.

still nervous of what people think? let's take a different route and perform our first act in disguise. for example: if you are a writer and terrified to come out for fear of humiliation, try using a pseudonym. or if you're hungry for leadership, invent a small blog that ignites your cause. try creating a fictitious persona. use an easy name, as not to attract too much attention. this will help ward of any humiliation.
1. exercise faith: what is faith? faith is when you take god at his word. it is when you believe that you will receive those things which you have been praying for. what are you hoping to accomplish in 2016? do you want to live a healthier lifestyle? does your financial situation seem hopeless? the good news is, god can do exceedingly and abundantly more than you could ever ask or think. whatever it is that you long for, big or small, it is going to take faith to receive it. you must be determined to walk by faith and not by sight. in matthew 14, peter, one of the twelve apostles, defied the laws of gravity and walked on water, for as long as his eyes were fixed on jesus. i wonder what monumental feats you will be able to accomplish and overcome through faith in 2016. remain steadfast. make 2016, the year that you believe god to do the impossible.

the way you can address it is to capitalize on time when the baby is asleep to connect with each other ― and of course, to use babysitters. a lot of babysitters, anderson said. turn off the tv and actually do some connecting – the same goes when you get a babysitter: get out of the house and enjoy some baby-free time.

valdosta, ga. ― strong turnout from black voters, fueled by on-the-ground canvassing operations and a backlash to vitriolic gop attacks on democrat raphael warnock, has put democrats within striking distance of winning two senate seats in georgia and full control of the federal government.
but the sierra snowpack has shown an overall declining trend for decades —most dramatically during the great california drought of 2012-2016 — and will dwindle further over the next several decades, a growing body of research suggests. in the latest, published in the peer-reviewed geophysical research letters journal, lawrence berkeley national laboratory researchers lay out what they call a future of consistent low-to-no snowpack. in other words, a new normal in which the robust snowpack developing this year would be an almost unthinkable anomaly.

in one of a number of standout stories in the recently released anthology a phoenix first must burn, sixteen stories of black girl magic, resistance and hope, jordan carter is a high school student who realises that the contaminant in the city's water — inspired by the ongoing public health emergency that is the flint, michigan, water crisis — has damaged a lot of other people. but instead of weakening her, she discovers that this epidemic has given her an extraordinary power. she double-checks the surreal nature of how crises show us where we are stronger and more magnificent than we could have dreamed with her crush.

i understand that we're still fighting over climate change — although that seems somewhat absurd to me — but to fight by objectifying and having a picture that demonstrated a level of violence against this young [17]-year-old girl, who has every right to stand up and say, 'you know world, you're not doing what needs to be done,' that's misogynistic, clinton said.

still, the biggest motivation for marchers has remained women's rights. at the women's march 2017, only 61 percent of the people in the crowd said women's rights was the main reason they were out in the crowd, said dana r. fisher, a sociology professor at the university of maryland college park, who has collected data on past marchers. at women's march 2018, 92 percent said they were out in the crowd for women's rights.
i want this to be about amy's sweet gesture, not my own, she wrote in an update to the original post. thinking about how many people have seen this has sparked an idea in me. can you imagine if that many people did even just one random act of kindness for someone? we need to truly be the change we wish to see in the world.

the convening of the joint session to count the electoral college votes has faced objections before. in 2017, several house democrats challenged trump's win but biden, who presided at the time as the vice president, swiftly dismissed them to assert trump's victory. rarely have the protests approached this level of intensity.

joining them in the top is 10th queen bebe zahara benet as diana ross. she effortlessly proves why less is more: she has few lyrics to lip-sync to, but every movement, every facial twitch, and every affect is right. here's the key that everybody should look at for that: you didn't do much to embody diana, head judge michelle visage says. subtlety won out for her. still, it'd be tough to argue for her win, considering how little she does compared to shangela and ben.

i managed to deflect—something like sorry, you're not my type—then i spent weeks afterward worried about what he was thinking about me. but he never brought it up. all the bullying took place in my head. the trauma for gay men is the prolonged nature of it, says william elder, a sexual trauma researcher and psychologist. if you experience one traumatic event, you have the kind of ptsd that can be resolved in four to six months of therapy. but if you experience years and years of small stressors—little things where you think, was that because of my sexuality?—that can be even worse. on tv i was seeing all these traditional families, james says. at the same time, i was watching a ton of gay porn. ... so i thought those were my two options. or, as elder puts it, being in the closet is like someone having someone punch you lightly on the arm, over and over. at first, it's annoying. after a while, it's infuriating. eventually, it's all you can think about. and then the stress of dealing with it every day begins to build up in your body. growing up gay, it seems, is bad for you in many of the same ways as growing up in extreme poverty. a 2015 study found that gay people produce less cortisol, the hormone that regulates stress. their systems were so activated, so constantly, in adolescence that they ended up sluggish as grownups, says katie mclaughlin, one of the study's co-authors.

of course, when trump vowed to protect the forgotten men and women of our country, he likely had a specific subset of men and women in mind ― working-class americans and, in particular, white working-class americans. stoking their racial resentment has been a theme of his presidency, just as it was a theme of his candidacy.
l'organisation mondiale de la santé a elle aussi été vivement critiquée ces dernières années. jugée trop alarmiste pendant l'épidémie du virus h1n1 en 2009, elle avait par la suite été accusée, au moment de la terrible épidémie d'ebola en afrique de l'ouest (2014), de ne pas avoir mesuré l'ampleur de la crise avant qu'elle ne s'amplifie.

less than a month after the women's march inc. announced plans for the 2019 event, a white supremacist attacked a pittsburgh synagogue, killing 11 worshipers. the rise in hate crimes against jews — which the fbi says accounted for more than half of all hate crimes in 2017 — and the resurgence of neo-nazism meant that the issue would continue to plague women's march leaders, despite their statements of support for jewish victims, op-eds denouncing anti-semitism and participation in rallies against hate crime.

president-elect joe biden's advisers may simply be setting low expectations ― which, after four years of an administration that chronically overpromised, might not be the worst thing in the world. but the reality remains the same: getting back to normalcy in 2021 will require doing much, much more than the u.s. is doing now.
nothing burns good employees out quite like overworking them. it's so tempting to work your best people hard that managers frequently fall into this trap. overworking good employees is perplexing; it makes them feel as if they're being punished for great performance. overworking employees is also counterproductive. new research from stanford shows that productivity per hour declines sharply when the workweek exceeds 50 hours, and productivity drops off so much after 55 hours that you don't get anything out of working more.

the trump administration also said it will immediately begin turning back migrants on the southern border who attempt to cross between official ports of entry. they pinned the decision on efforts to prevent the spread of coronavirus in detention facilities, arguing that the virus could harm border patrol agents. there are currently fewer than 100 reported coronavirus cases in mexico, whereas u.s. cases have blossomed into the thousands.
no more copays, no more coinsurance, no more deductibles ― yes, that's right, out-of-pocket spending would basically disappear under the existing medicare for all proposals. the only exception would be a provision in the sanders bill that would allow some token cost-sharing to encourage use of generic drugs.
2. that i would have anxiety before every doctor's appointment. after my first two pregnancies ended in miscarriage, i got so used to hearing bad news at doctor's appointments, that just going to the appointments in my third pregnancy gave me overwhelming anxiety.
thorgy thor, who i agreed with maybe once in season eight, speaks sense in her confessional: wake up, bitch! you had to make a decision. nobody envied you, but you made it. move forward. because that's the game. all stars is not drag race. the difference in the format exists for a reason. the best of the best should be capable of making hard choices to get ahead. ben is great at drag race, but as evidenced by her mealy-mouthed monologue when she had to eliminate morgan, she may not be great at certain elements of all stars.

whether we recognize it or not, our bodies bring the closet with us into adulthood. t travis salway, a researcher with the bc centre for disease control in vancouver, has spent the last five years trying to figure out why gay men keep killing themselves. the defining feature of gay men used to be the loneliness of the closet, he says. but now you've got millions of gay men who have come out of the closet and they still feel the same isolation. we're having lunch at a hole-in-the-wall noodle bar. it's november, and he arrives wearing jeans, galoshes and a wedding ring. gay-married, huh? i say. monogamous even, he says. i think they're gonna give us the key to the city. salway grew up in celina, ohio, a rusting factory town of maybe 10,000 people, the kind of place, he says, where marriage competed with college for the 21-year-olds. he got bullied for being gay before he even knew he was. i was effeminate and i was in choir, he says. that was enough. so he got careful. he had a girlfriend through most of high school, and tried to avoid boys—both romantically and platonically—until he could get out of there. by the late 2000s, he was a social worker and epidemiologist and, like me, was struck by the growing distance between his straight and gay friends. he started to wonder if the story he had always heard about gay men and mental health was incomplete.

trouble is, if all it took to fix what ails the american health care system were a handful of tycoons sitting in a room, those problems would be fixed by now. during decades of rising costs, however, employers' main innovations have been raising everyone's deductibles and enrolling workers in wellness programs that don't work.
i originally started featuring my travels on instagram as a way of documenting my journey. it was better than a travel journal because it was visual and because engagement with other people was built in. it made my adventures more interactive, and i got feedback and tips about the places i was visiting. plus it was a great way to stay in contact with my friends and family at home. it was mostly fun and games for the first year, then the platform slowly but increasingly became a way for me to critique and judge myself.

7. that i would feel alone. i'm sure that most pregnancies contain some sort of loneliness, but being pregnant after loss left me in a strange place. i didn't feel like i could happily join the other expectant mothers. for weeks, i watched several pregnancy announcements appear on my social media feed, yet i felt terrified to share my own. 'un-telling' people that i was pregnant was one of the worst experiences of my life and i didn't want to subject myself to that again.

manchin's position on larger stimulus checks could change when his party controls the senate. and there are also some republicans who have expressed support for the measure. notably, sen. josh hawley (r-mo.) partnered with sanders to lobby for the proposal, despite disapproval from his own party leadership. there will additionally be pressure on some republicans up for reelection in 2022 to support the checks ― especially now that trump has so vocally backed the idea.

i think we rest too much on the data that 90% of start-ups fail, so we figure chances are we are going to fail, so why make the massive effort to know what we're doing from the outset? as entrepreneurs, we measure success regarding the number of start-ups we've founded, and how we continue to make money from those failures, and not the number of successful ones and the number of lives we've impacted in those efforts.

we underestimate the importance of physical attraction in long-term relationships. in the beginning, couples make commitments to grooming, wearing clothes that make them feel desirable and feeling good about themselves. when you start to feel like roommates, you might need to change out of your sweats and comfy clothes and get ready for an intimate night together. take a long bath or shower, put on something that makes you feel good about yourself, and put energy into feeling sensual. even if you are staying in for the night, put something on that makes you feel open for sex and connection, like your favorite lingerie or use a new massage oil or perfume. ― shannon chavez, psychologist and sex therapist

in fact, congress has already recognized these realities. the first coronavirus emergency bill that trump signed includes additional medicaid funding for states as a means of shoring up their budgets. that law also forbids states from cutting enrollment or benefits as a condition for receiving the temporary bonus funds. extra medicaid funding is a common form of helping state budgets and providing economic stimulus during recessions.

my parents always had an open and transparent philosophy with me. that means our family does not have any questions that are off-limits, though i do sometimes get low-quality answers on controversial subjects. i think they regret their open philosophy after being forced to explain to me some words and concepts from the game of thrones books. i have a provocative personality. so my parents remind me (more like, threaten me) that i have to respect the boundaries other parents might have and i should not share controversial knowledge with my friends.

but house passage of the bill is unlikely to change much. even though the senate unanimously passed a clean continuing resolution at the end of december ― a stopgap spending bill extending operations without border wall money ― senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) has vowed not to bring up another bill in this new congress until there's agreement from trump.

since then, the last three decades have had top rates below 40 percent. many have tried to change that. sen. bernie sanders proposed a 54.2 percent rate for income above $10 million in his 2016 presidential campaign proposal and former secretary of state hillary clinton proposed 43.6 percent for earnings above $5 million.
you have a track record of getting things done, constantinides said. and that's what we need in the next mayor on climate.
the zen influence on kondo's practices is evident in the first episode of her netflix show. in one scene, she greets the featured couple's house, taking them through a sort of meditative process of thanking and appreciating the home for protecting them.
again, just to be clear: this doesn't discount the value of milk's drag. she is one of the most avant-garde thinkers drag race has ever seen, up there with sharon needles, raja, and kim chi. as she reminded us in the premiere, she has literally inspired drag race challenges. but whining that she's not getting kudos — and discounting her fellow queens' performances while doing so — is ignoring the ways in which she benefits from her privilege. she gets to stay in the competition and continue to show her unconventional drag, despite her flawed execution of it.
when you don't include moms in the football safety conversation, we take control of it ourselves. after paul died, i joined other victims' families to create an awareness group that encourages kids and families to drop tackle football and instead play flag football, which has all the fun and teamwork of tackle without the risk of repetitive brain trauma inside a too-large helmet.
the good news is this change only applies to new homeowners, according to josh zimmelman, owner of westwood tax & consulting. the $1 million cap still applies to homeowners who took out a mortgage before december 15, 2017, he said. new homeowners can take this deduction on mortgages up to $750,000.

raisman, along with olympians gabby douglas and mckayla maroney, have alleged that nassar abused them for years under the guise of treatment.
changing that narrative may prove difficult. in a survey conducted by republican pollsters for a pro-trump organization, only half of the voters in gop-held congressional districts support the plan, even after being introduced to key features of the bill and hearing the messages on both sides of the tax reform debate. even among americans who'll see their taxes fall, there's no guarantee that they'll notice — or that they'll look more fondly on the republicans' effort.
biden's team is keenly aware of the stakes. the president-elect will travel to atlanta on monday, the eve of the runoffs, to campaign with ossoff and warnock for the second time in three weeks. biden's campaign aides have helped raise millions to boost the party infrastructure that helped biden become the first democratic presidential nominee since 1992 to carry the state. vice president-elect kamala harris will campaign sunday in savannah.
the carefully packed wine — each bottle nestled inside a steel cylinder to prevent breakage — remained corked aboard the orbiting lab. space cargo unlimited, a luxembourg startup behind the experiments, wanted the wine to age for an entire year up there.
known as direct air capture, such technology could eventually extract roughly half the atmospheric co₂ that united nations forecasts show needs to be removed to keep the planet's temperatures from surging to catastrophic levels. the machines essentially function like giant vacuum fans that pull carbon from the air and magnetically attach it to calcium or potassium molecules, transforming the emissions into a substance that can be injected underground for permanent storage, to prevent its return to the atmosphere.
the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists recommends that women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should get the covid-19 vaccine, although there have not yet been trials done specifically in that population.

the crop art, intended to inspire voter participation ahead of the runoff elections, depicted a famous mugshot of lewis taken 1961, after he was arrested for using a whites-only restroom.
addiction is a family disease. this nightmare became my reality, i never asked for this, and that is what gets me so angry at times. i woke up, and my entire life changed. it may never be the same. the thing is, even though i am not an addict, i am suffering just as much, though in a different way because the family witnesses helplessly how one lapse in judgment, one wrong decision, one chemical dependency, can ruin everything.

huffpost talked to doctors, nurses and emergency medical technicians in california, new jersey, hawaii and rhode island about what it's like fighting the pandemic. as they report for duty, the stock of personal protective equipment (ppe), which helps keep them and their patients safe and curbs the spread of the coronavirus, is running dangerously low.
some republicans are particularly aggrieved with the metal detectors (which they go through regularly anyway for their air travel). on tuesday, rep. greg steube (r-fla.) attacked the use of the machines as an appalling infringement on his rights, rep. chip roy (r-texas) said they were unnecessary, unconstitutional, and endanger[ed] members, and newly elected rep. lauren boebert (r-colo.) simply pushed her way through them and rebuffed officers' requests to check her purse.

as john lie, a professor of sociology in the center of japanese studies at the university of california, berkeley, explained, there's also a long-standing zen influence on japanese culture, which valorizes minimalism.
i think that breaking the stigma associated with sharing our insecurities, breaking through the toxic masculinity that makes us feel ashamed about talking, addressing why as a community we regard thin white chiseled bodies over all other bodies, and making sure there's body diversity and inclusion in both lgbt and straight media, that we can be kinder to one another and hopefully create change within the community.
sometimes, i still have a hard time believing it, and i've been doing it for three years.
look at what carbon engineering says when they're criticized by environmental groups for working with oil companies, hanna said. their response is simple: if there were incentives from the government to do this without the oil and gas industry, to do it as a public good, we'd do it. but it's just not there, so we need to go forth by any means possible to develop this technology.

democratic leadership rejected the plan, but the effort succeeded in shifting the climate debate in the direction scientists say matches the extent of the crisis. by mid-december, more than 300 local and state officials voiced support for a green new deal in an open letter. days later, a poll from yale university and george mason university found 81 percent of registered voters surveyed said they supported a green new deal, including 64 percent of republicans and 57 percent of conservative republicans.
trevor bedford, directeur du laboratoire bedford au centre de recherche fred hutch, explique dans un blog que le coronavirus semble muter environ deux fois par mois. à côté de cela, il se passe environ 7 jours entre le moment où une personne contracte le coronavirus et celui où elle va contaminer quelqu'un d'autre. on peut donc imaginer que toutes les deux transmissions en moyenne, le virus mute. encore une fois, ce sont de toutes petites mutations, qui sont souvent insignifiantes, de simples coquilles dans le code génétique.
in the race for the 2008 democratic presidential nomination, then-sen. barack obama of illinois ― who eventually chose biden to be his vice president ― was scathing in his criticism of opponent hillary clinton and her attempt to rewrite history concerning her iraq war vote as a new york senator (obama wasn't in the chamber when the vote occurred).

what did you see cassie as being addicted to?
she knew the twisty rape-revenge comedy would piss off some people and leave others gleefully pumping their fists. i'm in the latter camp. fennell's directorial debut, which she also wrote, is cunning and audacious, from its winky pastel palette to its take-no-prisoners finale. we root for cassie thomas (a career-best carey mulligan), the medical-school dropout at the film's center, as she outwits male predators who assume they can take advantage of her, yet fennell cleverly coils our allegiance by making cassie a bit dastardly herself. when cassie lets an old friend (alison brie) think she's been assaulted, or when she dupes an unsympathetic university administrator (connie britton) into believing her teenage daughter is vulnerable to the same horror, vengeance starts to feel thorny.
one of my clients traveled to ireland to visit her ancestors' farm, vogele said. she met current-day occupants who then proceeded to spend hours with her and her daughter, sharing what they knew about the farm's previous owners. she enjoyed her experience so much, she returned to visit other parts of ireland where other family lines resided.
ocasio-cortez and other proponents of the green new deal have argued that the program would help alleviate inequality through public spending on sustainable energy sources aimed at curbing the devastating effects of climate change on low-income communities. precisely how much the plan would cost, however, has not yet been hashed out.
for a start, health care represents 18 percent of the u.s. economy. a lot of people think that's too much. you know who doesn't? the people who run and profit off the health care system.
i never did. i can't tell you why, really, except that i think by the time i felt brave enough to bring it up to my doctor, i'd already been handling it myself for years. and while it caused inconveniences and stress, it never became debilitating. plus, my fear of germs started out so gradually in my early 30s that at first, i saw it as more of a quirk and a minor annoyance than a problem that required the assistance of a mental health expert.
ducsay reiterated that audiences bring a whole extra level of emotion to the film now.
mckenzie said it made her feel whiplash and that her religion was telling her she was dirty for who she is and unwanted by god. she's reassessing whether she wants to finish her studies at byu even though she loves her professors and the education she's receiving.
if you were among the many who have been anxiously awaiting the new year, how do you plan to make 2017 different? or, perhaps 2016 was great and 2017 will be even better? but what steps have you put in place to make that happen? when the clock struck midnight, there was do over button or magic pill. it was just the start of another year. it has no influence or impact on any of the situations in your life from the previous day. in fact, if not careful, we can repeat the year we had before if we don't have a plan to act or react differently.
second, we must pull our current youth helmets from shelves and create new ones specifically designed for kids between 14 and 17 years old. this includes correcting current design defects, such as weight. for decades, football parents have been led to believe that youth helmets adequately protect their children, but this gear wasn't designed with kids in mind ― it's merely a smaller version of what professionals use. we recommend bringing in an outside organization to promulgate sports equipment standards. this would allow independent researchers, engineers and advocates to act on behalf of consumers' best interests, rather than putting our trust in the companies who profit from the products we buy.
i believe that beauty is truth. beauty is not makeup or hair or clothes. those are skills. beauty is real, vulnerable and honest. i am not saying that this is easy. i will never say that. it is hard, and you should respect the process. what i will say is that the risks are worth the reward.

the sore throat is sort of like smoking a pack of menthol cigarettes when you're already a little sick. and you'll feel very tired, she wrote. you'll be surprised how much your eyeballs hurt, and ice packs on your eyes won't help.
inside cops-only message boards and other pro-law enforcement media groups online, police officers are grappling with how a group that usually proclaims blue lives matter could turn its wrath on them. instead of facing the uncomfortable implications of the siege, many are pushing the debunked conspiracy theory that the chaos was orchestrated by anti-fascist activists who disguised themselves in a scheme to make the president and his base look bad.
throughout the video, these girls have words on their arms like loud, angry and unladylike. but at the end, they wipe them off to show they're not aggressive despite what school officials might think.
of course, whether most republicans — especially those with presidential ambitions themselves — even want to reclaim the party trump hijacked five years ago remains unclear.
a major draw can be a deep, historical interest in a particular period or subject of a country ― the renaissance in italy, the royal family in england, or recreations of historical events, said vogele.
the accessibility testing and remediation process can be complicated. even with software that guides developers and testers through the testing process, they will still need to figure out how to resolve the issues that are found. furthermore, testing can take a lot of time. even with automated testing, users will frequently need to sift through thousands of violations on hundreds of pages or more. alchemy addresses these issues.

his nomination to serve as pruitt's no. 2 faced little opposition. democrats largely overlooked him during the initial confirmation hearing in november 2017. he couched blatant climate change denial in smooth legalese. he appeared moderate next to kathleen hartnett white, the right-wing ideologue nominated to serve as the head of the council on environmental quality, whose humiliating performance captured democrats' attention at the confirmation hearing she shared with wheeler.

(muslim women are 6.9% of india's 1.2 billion people. there are three muslim women in the current lok sabha, 0.5% of the lower house, and zero in rajya sabha, the upper house).
there's definitely a way of making serious movies about serious things. i think that really bypasses the experience of a lot of people. a lot of nasty things happen in beautiful places. this is a movie about appearances being deceptive. and so it made sense to me that it would look and sound appealing. and from a practical point of view, i didn't want to make something didactic. we set out to make something that would stand on its own two feet as a thriller, as a dark comedy, as a romance. when i sent the script out to people, i sent it with a playlist featuring britney spears and paris hilton and with mood boards of how it would look. i wanted to be very clear that it wouldn't feel dour, it wouldn't feel preachy, and it would not let anyone off the hook.
friedman was the first to define the various stages of childbirth, and he established the idea of a normal labor curve, plotting it out on a graph. once labor begins, the cervix — which must open and thin before a vaginal delivery — should dilate at least 1 centimeter per hour, he said.
the sight of aussies and tourists defying the strict advice on social distancing jolted fury from many online, with some comparing the sydney images to empty pictures of new york city and los angeles, which are in lockdown.
the policy stormed into mainstream political debate over the past two months after activists staged sit-ins in pelosi's office and ocasio-cortez proposed a resolution to establish a select committee charged with drafting a green new deal. eighty-two percent of americans said they had heard nothing at all about a green new deal, yet 81 percent of registered voters said they supported the policies outlined under early proposals, according to a survey released last month by the yale program on climate change communication and george mason university.

sandra: i have to fall in love with each and every project in order to be able to design them. it's the 'getting happy with it' stage, a line borrowed from one of my favorite movies something's gotta give. it's when the truth of the space becomes apparent and i can't work on anything else until i capture the essence of the design.
people really responded to that message. at the same time they would still ask, what should we do? what should we do? people wanted a bit more of an explanation, so that's why we decided to write the book. people don't always want to be told what to do, after all, they also want to be told why they should do it.

too often when a car cuts someone off, they end up in a line that isn't moving, their luggage gets lost, their flight is delayed, or they end up receiving an item that comes broken or destroyed, their first negative impulse is to say that this always happens to them. really? always? said toni coleman, a psychotherapist, relationship coach and divorce mediator in mclean, virginia.
once you're aware of the real emotions at play, you can communicate it to the person you snapped at, tully said. in the scenario above, you'd apologize to your co-worker — explaining that you snapped because you're overwhelmed (and acknowledging that doesn't justify your behavior!) — and perhaps consider asking your manager to lighten your workload.

he promised to block all new fossil fuel infrastructure, including a controversial pipeline currently under construction in brooklyn, and vowed to ban all gas hookups in newly built and renovated construction. he called the city's network of roughly a dozen gas- and oil-burning power plants relics of the past, and that's where i'll put them, and promised a fleet of electric buses and subway improvements. he said he'd implement a standing proposal to shutter the infamous prison on rikers island and convert the facility to a solar farm and target aid to communities that suffered the worst excesses of both polluters and policing.
thus far though, congressional democrats have shown the most interest in removing the federal income tax deduction for state and local taxes, which mainly affects upper-middle-class homeowners in blue states. biden has already promised not to raise taxes on households earning less than $400,000, and wants to restore the corporate tax rate to 28%, not its pre-trump level of 35%.
these women just speaking with so much confidence and eloquence and clear headed analysis. i think that is a huge shift. politicians using muslims as a vote bank, and then putting their cherry-picked people as spokespersons, and then deciding what are the women's questions, i think those days are gone. that is an enormous step forward for women who are muslim in india. that is terrific. nobody is going to go back to those men who were not necessarily representative at all. they are just men with a particular kind of political capital. i think this is a huge step forward for a muslim women's movement or any kind of women's movement.

when democrats re-took the house in 2007, they reinstated expired pay-go rules requiring any new spending to be offset. but following a decade of frustration with republicans' willingness to discard their professed fiscal conservatism to cut taxes for the wealthy ― and a burgeoning field of research downplaying the importance of low budget deficits ― many democrats have soured on pay-go as a vestige of a misguided era of centrist triangulation.
we also don't feel it's appropriate, of course, but it isn't a criminal matter, he added.
no, this is not the kind of presidency that trump promised. as a candidate, he portrayed himself as a different sort of republican, one who would attack the financial industry, govern independently of wealthy special interests, and protect public programs on which poor and middle-class americans depend.

worst of all, however, was the lack of concern for state and local governments. back in july, the center for budget and policy priorities, a liberal-leaning think tank, estimated that the coronavirus crash would create state government budget shortfalls of about $555 billion ― a figure that would increase substantially if local and tribal governments were included in the calculation. the cares act included just $150 billion in state and local government relief.
turkey insists its military actions are aimed at kurdish fighters in syria — the syrian kurdish peoples protection units, or ypg — whom it regards as terrorists, and not against the kurdish people. that has been ankara longtime position and turkey rejected any role for kurdish fighters in restoring peace to the war-torn region.
barbara guzman, who owns a label business in cape coral, florida, and who saw trump at a 2018 rally in nearby naples, said trump would be better off keeping his mouth shut and letting the experts in the government speak, rather than make a series of misleading or false statements that wind up needing to be corrected, thereby confusing the public.

while the number of confirmed cases continues to increase, in part because of the increased availability of tests, cuomo was cautiously optimistic.
when the movie first opens and we get the introductory scenes with cassie, we are fully rooting for her to one-up these predatory goobers. but that starts to get tricky when she has lunch with alison brie's character. and it gets even trickier when she's making connie britton's character think that her teenage daughter is being sexually assaulted. what did you imagine the audience would be feeling at those two moments?
disney noted that there have been no reported cases of covid-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus, at the park.
taking into account both the challenge and the redeem-a-bad-look runway, some of the other results are puzzling. trixie mattel is safe after a terrific dolly parton impression, i'd imagine because it's too expected for her (though personally, i'd have put her in the top three over bebe). aja joins her; her amy winehouse is tame, but a spectacular reworking of her princess disastah runway keeps her in. chi chi devayne falls just outside the bottom two, even though her patti labelle is a laugh riot. the problem seemingly lies with her reworked neon look, which judge carson kressley knocks as basic. her dancing diva sister kennedy davenport is not as lucky, as a poorly executed janet jackson impression lands her in the bottom two.
i think we've done well, dawkins said last month. apparently we need to do a little bit more.
academics at some of the uk's top universities pushing pro-assad propaganda have been accused by parts of the syrian community of peddling conspiracy theories and whitewashing war crimes. the working group on syria, propaganda and media (wg) has been set up by a number of left-wing professors to examine the role of both media and propaganda and provide reliable, informed and timely analysis for journalists, publics and policymakers. although in its infancy, the group's published material as well as public posts by its members have already drawn accusations of circulating islamophobic tropes and wilfully ignoring the depravity of the regime. latest: pro-assad academics blame criticism on conspiracy two of the academics in particular, professor tim hayward of edinburgh university and professor piers robinson of the university of sheffield, promote the work of a fringe group of bloggers and activists who have been accused of spreading false information about the syrian civil war, which is now in its eighth year. as part of an ongoing series on propaganda and disinformation in the syria conflict, huffpost uk has analysed some of the material published by the academics, including an open letter to the guardian newspaper. the survey reveals a number of problematic areas and false claims, and illuminates the murky world of online pro-regime activism the academics are promoting.

why is this important? because the census is how representation in our government is determined. the demographics in this country are changing, and this terrifies the virtually all-white club that is today's republican party. its only chance at staying in power is to rig the way power is distributed. what happens with the census could be one of the most important and immediate fallouts of the trump presidency.

up until last week, when i finally snapped and said i was too tired to do it, my husband had actually never bought any clothes for our son, said natalie, who is 36 weeks pregnant. he's three and a half. maybe clothes don't seem like a big deal, but given how fast a kid grows, having a wardrobe for every size and season — and then packing it away and replacing it with new items — takes so much work and planning. did you know some of the best snowsuit deals happen in august? this is the kind of information i now store in my brain.
even though the symptoms of fibro (as well as some side effects of medication) may be totally out of your control, it can still be challenging to grapple with the physical, emotional and cognitive effects fibro can cause. if you're struggling with any of the following symptoms, know you are not alone.

but employer coverage is still popular, at least according to industry polling. as the 2017 fight to repeal obamacare and pretty much every other health care battle has shown, change of any sort is scary. americans are unlikely to welcome it unless they are absolutely convinced it's a change for the better.

but is that true for everyone?
the president of chicago's fraternal order of police lodge john catanzara, whose organization represents 12,000 police officers, promoted baseless accusations of election fraud and referred to the rioters as a bunch of pissed-off people that feel an election was stolen while falsely claiming that there was no violence and little destruction of property.

it's a very different exercise than defending a criminal defendant where the lawyer might say, 'sure, murder should be illegal, but my client didn't do it,' said marco simons, general counsel at the environmental legal nonprofit earthrights international. this is the equivalent of the lawyer starting out the case by saying, 'oh, murder is not illegal.'

in june 2017, the ministry constituted an inter-ministerial expert committee for examining the feasibility of updating the secc 2011 data and suggesting institutional framework for managing the social registry.
usually, criminals want to avoid detection when committing a crime. but the violent mob that descended on the capitol on wednesday, leaving destruction, terror, and four of their own dead in its wake, didn't bother with criminality 101. they waved trump 2020 flags and wore sweatshirts emblazoned with phrases like civil war, camp auschwitz and fuck your feelings. they gave out their names and didn't bother with masks — not even during a raging pandemic. one maryland man even wore his work id badge to the insurrection. (he has since been terminated by his employer.)
south korea has reportedly seen the peak of the outbreak and seen a decline in coronavirus cases after mass testing. more than 7,300 coronavirus infections have been confirmed throughout south korea with the death toll at 50.

pire pour le parti macroniste, les dissidences et les candidatures contestées se sont multipliées à l'échelle nationale, augurant des municipales particulièrement compliquées pour lrem. ce qui, évidemment, ne manque pas d'être souligné avec délectation par l'opposition. guillaume larrivé, député lr de l'yonne, a pointé dans une interview à l'opinion l'incapacité totale du président macron à mettre de l'ordre là-dedans, alors même qu'il a l'air de s'en mêler.
much like prohibition (of alcohol) before it, though, this is becoming increasingly nothing more than a scofflaw, to varying degrees. it is now easier to keep track of the states which have not legalized at least medicinal marijuana, since there are fewer of them than those that have (21 versus 29 that have legalized some form of medical use). this strikes to the very core of the federal law against marijuana which states that marijuana (or sometimes marihuana, reflecting the increasingly ancient nature of these federal laws) has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the united states. when almost six out of ten states have medicinal marijuana laws on the books, that statement is now nothing short of patently and laughably absurd.
while inmate-on-guard violence and understaffing in federal prisons are serious concerns, this type of approach to solving such issues misses the point. giving prison guards weapons will provide a minimal level of safety. . . if they see the attack coming. but personal experience has shown me that arming prison guards is often a bad idea. for example, shortly after providing select prison guards at the medium-security fci petersburg with pepper spray, one of the compound officers accidentally shot herself in the face with the aerosol weapon when playing with it.

before aggressively paying down your student loans, you should make sure you paid off high-interest debt such as credit cards or personal loans, said walsh. you should also make sure you are saving enough for your long-term goals, he said ― think retirement ― since, over time, the returns from investing have been higher than the interest rate most people pay on student loans.

dfat warned on wednesday, if you're returning to australia from south korea, as an australian citizen or permanent resident, you'll need to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival in australia.
congress have been loathe to interfere in the state-run election systems, a longstanding protocol. states choose their own election officials and draft their election laws. during the coronavirus pandemic many states adapted by allowing mail voting to ease health risks of voting in person. those changes and others are now being challenged by trump and his allies.

as the years passed, manhattan, beloved by male critics who were unbothered by or eager to explain away the movie's troubling sexual undertones, became cemented in film canon. if kael and didion couldn't get us to openly acknowledge the flaws in allen's work, who could? at least now it seems right to go back and examine the catastrophic failures of some critics to tease out these threads. many critics, including the new york times' a.o. scott, are now openly reckoning with the insufficiency of their past criticism of allen's work, and they're right to do so.
my germophobia has been creating obstacles to living a peaceful life for decades. long before covid-19 began invading every corner of the world and irreparably changing lives, i found it necessary to adopt certain behaviors in order to lessen my anxiety in regard to germs. at first, i had to consciously think about how i could change my behavior in order to minimize my exposure to this ubiquitous enemy.

the biden team has said that its goal is 100 million vaccine doses within the first 100 days. that's not as audacious a goal as it seems, even though press reports suggest that members of the transition are worried about reaching it. the figure works out to a million a day, which isn't that far from where the vaccination effort is now. to reach herd immunity by summer, the pace probably needs to be twice as fast ― at least.

many itemized deductions ... will be capped, eliminated or otherwise diluted in power, said ben flood, a certified financial planner and vice president of bigelow investment advisors. offsetting this for many tax filers is the fact that the standard deduction is significantly higher.
as jill filipovic put it in a piece for cosmopolitan in march 2016, feeling good is criminally underrated, and making a bunch of money sounds cool — but feeling 'empowered' is not the same as real, actual power. actual power means economic, political and social access. it means your words will be heard, even if they aren't splashed across your naked body.
asked if the pm was giving her personal support to the bill, a no.10 spokesman told huffpost uk: that's one the government is backing, so you can take that as a 'yes'. the ministry of justice and home office are expected to signal on friday their support for the new legislation. backed by trade unions and staff bodies such as the police federation, an alliance of emergency workers held a 'drop-in' lobby of mps in the commons on wednesday. bryant told huffpost uk: i'm really encouraged by how many mps have come along, listened to emergency workers and said they'll support the bill. it's not over until the votes are counted though and i'm not counting my chickens yet. all sorts of things could still go awry. alan lofthouse, national ambulance officer for the unison trade union, said: it's only right that the full force of the law is used against anyone who attacks those trying to save lives and protect the public. this bill will help the courts to bring offenders to justice. huffpost uk talked to five emergency workers, each with their own stories of why a new law was needed. gavin taylor, 50, paramedic, manchester

as recently as this time last year, anti-trump protests were held in the capitol during the impeachment, limbaugh insisted. all of the sudden protesting congress is being called the end of the world. ... the worst crime against democracy in our nation's history. and yet, all kinds of anti-presidential protests were held in the capitol during the impeachment and nobody was concerned about it in terms of the damage being done to our government institutions.

as someone whose eating disorder was heavily influenced and reinforced by my desire to look like the thin, chiseled men all over instagram and magazine covers, i kept thinking of the power these images may have on someone who's desperately trying to live up to those unrealistic beauty standards that impacted me, and that they may see my photos and think, hey, i look like that, maybe i can be kinder to myself!

3. fight on: whether you realize it or not, you are a fighter and you were born to win. you are an overcomer and more than a conqueror. but being victorious is not going to be easy. you will need to fight. so ready yourselves for battle, now. put your war clothes on and refuse to waive the white flag. fight for your marriage, fight for your children, fight for that business, fight for everything that is valuable to you and keep fighting until the battle is won. but choose your battles wisely. ask god for wisdom. some battles you will win without saying a word. allow god to fight for you. do your part by praying, believing and standing on the word of god. be still and trust that he is working behind the scenes on your behalf. it is through faith and patience, that you will receive the promises of god.
for example, the civil war wasn't about slavery. it was, instead, a war over three economic systems that were not able to function together. the south: labor-surplice economy, in which people were the currency. the north: an industrializing economy, in which money was the currency. the west:a natural resources economy, in which land was the currency. and the victory of north over south (i.e. the victory of industrialization over labor-surplice) put in motion all of the events that occurred for decades after.

we had an event here at mclean in which several teams were put together and their goal was to see which team collectively lost the most weight. there was a buzz for several months and people were all excited about it, and some people did better in that exercise than they had ever done before with a new year's resolution or the equivalent of setting a goal. so there's something about the social context that helps to increase the probability.

pubs have been ordered to close from midnight tonight, as the u.k. government escalates measures to fight coronavirus. prime minister boris johnson has previously urged people to avoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues in order to try and slow the spread of the virus. but despite the plea, many londoners were still gathering in pubs in some parts of the capital this week. the government also announced it would step in to pay 80% of the wages of workers to encourage employers not to layoff staff.

to sanders, the loss of that endorsement to warren was especially biting because his political director, analilia mejia, was a former head of the new jersey working families party. several people with a say in wfp's endorsement process told huffpost at the time that warren's team had simply put in more work for it, with sanders forgoing the opportunity to address wfp delegates in a private address in which warren and former housing secretary julián castro participated.

a closer examination of the amatrice-monte vettore fault system shows that it is actually divided into four principal, 10 to 20km-long sections, called segments (see figure). these four segments are separated by a gap of a few kilometres or by pronounced bends. the amatrice-monte vettore fault trace is thus jerking from one of its segments to the next.

even some republicans are hopeful. michael steel, once a top adviser to republican house speaker john boehner, a chief obama foil along with mcconnell, blamed obama's capitol hill troubles on his personal approach to his fellow politicians. conversely, steel said, president-elect biden is a legislator by avocation, by training, by instinct, by experience in a way that former president obama was not.

i know you may be thinking, i hope to make my goals to the end of january. ninety day is march and that's a long ways out! however as i was preparing for the new year, i was reminded of a book given to me when i moved into a new corporate role, called the first 90 days: critical success strategies for new leaders at all levels. then it hit me, if we need critical success strategies for the first 90 days of a new role, why not a new year?
rep. val demings, a democrat from florida and a former police chief, said wednesday that it was painfully obvious sund's officers were not prepared for today. i certainly thought that we would have had a stronger show of force, that there would have been steps taken in the very beginning to make sure that there was a designated area for the protesters a safe distance from the capitol.
richard benedict, one of johnson's special education teachers at the facility, described him as a likable kid who needed a high level of structure and support to survive. i knew he'd never make it on his own, benedict said in an interview. johnson was self-conscious about being stupid, as he put it to benedict. he wanted to be liked and could be talked into things that would get him in trouble in his pursuit of acceptance.

protests have been planned at 40 train stations across the uk after average rail ticket prices rose by 3.4% today - the biggest rise in five years. campaigners have warned that people are being priced out of getting to work, with many commuters seeing their season tickets rise by more than £100. meanwhile, average season tickets into london terminals have gone up by £146 this year, according to the campaign for better transport (cbt). the government uses the previous july's retail prices index (rpi) measure of inflation to determine increases in regulated fares. but new research has shown that britons fork out up to five times as much of their salaries on rail fares than other europeans. shadow transport secretary andy mcdonald described the situation as an absolute racket, telling bbc radio 4′s today programme that the current rail franchise system has completely and utterly failed. people have got to the end of their tether, and understandably so, said the labour mp.
how it works: a roth ira is similar to a traditional ira with a few exceptions. the first is the way your money is taxed: rather than contributing pre-tax money, you contribute funds after taxes have already been taken out. that money is never subject to capital gains taxes or dividend taxes from that point on, alden said. in other words, your withdrawals in retirement are made tax-free.

on top of all this, the trump administration's hostility toward migrants and hyper-polarization of the immigration issue has made democratic-led jurisdictions far more likely to embrace sanctuary policies limiting cooperation with ice than they were under obama. the consequence of trump's lack of diplomacy is that ice now has far less leeway to make arrests at local jails than it once did, reducing the agency's efficiency.

the eurozone is in a stalemate. a federal union would be needed to fix its problems, but there is no public support for it. returning to national fiscal responsibility would lead to defaults and exits. half-way solutions will prove insufficient but expensive and obfuscate the issues. therefore, there may be no way to avert the partial or complete break-up of the eurozone in the years to come. the fate of the euro may already have been sealed.
• ideal hire: mcdaniels. maybe ideal is the wrong word here, since there are unknowns about mcdaniels that cannot be answered until he gets another shot. how has he matured as a coach since his failure in denver? can he succeed without bill belichick's guiding hand? regardless, he is almost certain to receive a second chance somewhere, and soon.
there is a crisis today, castro said. it's a crisis of leadership. president trump has failed to uphold the values of our great nation.

one of my dog's favorite things to do is figure eight exercise. i learned this trick last spring from dr. gina kwong, dvm at the vca west los angeles animal hospital, when we had to rehabilitate minjay's knee after surgery. now that it isn't too hard for him to do (yay for recovery), he loves it. i use barstools as the guideposts to circle around, but you could use just about anything.

of course, a large part of this is being older. we need more stuff to sustain us. medications. shoes that don't hurt. sunblock. insect repellent. enough clothing to wear for eight days (no way i'm washing underwear in a hotel sink like i did back in 1968). and for me, makeup. so yes, we need more than a backpack each to get by for over a week.
a highly skilled narcissist may casually mention the high-end gym that they belong to or that they only fly first-class, but it is done with such subtle sophistication that their target may not even register it as a red flag, she said. the less-skilled narcissist will openly and obnoxiously discuss their ivy league degree, or the square footage of their new apartment.
it would seem that mat staver, the founder and chairman of liberty counsel, and his supporters are trying to prevent lgbtq people from being protected from lynching as a means to keep them from being protected from discrimination. an anti-lynching law is, according to staver in an interview he gave to the christian news siteonenewsnow, only a baby step to one day passing employment, housing and health care legislation that would offer protections to lgbtq people. thus lgbtq people's lives become a small sacrifice for the ideological comfort and control of the religious right. he and liberty counsel seem to care more about what people do in their sex lives than the violence and inequity that they experience because of their identities.

somali al shabab terrorists drag pat into his former profession by abducting orla to pressure him into action by producing explosives for their nefarious purposes.
and again, this is why i'm so interested in female rage and how it manifests itself, because i think it's so much more interesting than what we're expecting. if you're a woman, for me, i had to think, ok, what am i capable of physically? not much. i don't go to the gym. and it was important that, for the end of the movie, when it comes to that, when the idea of violence is flirted with, it ends like it ends. because there's a reason that we don't go out and do these things, because the chances of us surviving are just so slim. for me, it was like, what could i do? and the thing that i could do is i could play tricks on people. i could fuck with their minds, and i could outsmart them and i could make them think things had happened in order for them to change their views. that's what she's doing. she's sort of a pimp, a mephistophelian baddie. but what's so interesting is, if she just was going and torturing people and killing them, nobody would find it very discerning. there was a really fun and satisfying version of this film that was kick-ass and empowering, but that would've felt so completely bogus to me. but it also does mean that it has been a little bit controversial, i think. but not as much as we thought it would be, honestly.

he is 6'2 with clear blue eyes and an uncommon steadiness and more strength and integrity than anyone i've ever met. i was there in june when a hospice nurse told us it would likely be less than a week or so until the end, and after the nurse left, i could hear him sobbing in the room where she was laying as i waited downstairs. never once pushing her to abide by his own plans and always holding steady in the hard work of compassion.

i used to have things like aspirations or desires for people to see my depth of character. turns out that if i don't even try, dudes will just see me as an exotic, submissive lotus blossom who doesn't threaten or challenge their power. white supremacy needs allies if its antiquity is to survive the global majority (memo: white people are outnumbered by people of color on this planet). and what better way to fan the flames of structural racism and inequality than to literally allow yourself to be viewed as the perpetual foreigner who will never be considered fully american until you are white?

: customers reward consistent excellence not occasional brilliance. the businesses experiencing this challenge may need to optimize their processes, increase consistency with their existing process, or both. complacency and lack of urgency: a sense of complacency in an organization can be seen and felt. customer comments and requests are discounted or even ignored. decisions seem to take forever. there is a prevailing attitude that says, why do something today that can be put off until tomorrow?

blaming a dark-skinned other for one's misfortune is an old and redoubtable tactic in american politicking, but the current administration has embraced it with passion. the wall that caused the government shutdown embodies this well: as a promise, it's a baldly phallic, ultimately grotesque monument to the desire to close america off to its southern neighbors. the crude prototype the president posted to twitter is spiky, dense and, in its crude way, potently symbolic.

the seats that democrats picked up across the country this fall were largely won by reassuring voters that they are willing to fight for workers young and old, and ensuring that they will have affordable health care and gainful employment. the green new deal, a bold proposal to put americans to work building green infrastructure, modeled after franklin d. roosevelt's new deal, was a central campaign issue for a progressive faction of the newly elected democrats. at first, establishment democrats scoffed at the green new deal as some ultraleft policy demand, but the more the idea of job creation through building renewable energy and climate-adapted infrastructure were floated with the american public, the more support they gained. not to mention, the notion of slowing rampant income inequality and leaving no american behind sits favorably with working people throughout the nation.

that's a good question. what does it mean? it is true that women who are out there would have never imagined leaving their homes and husbands and sitting out in the open for days. these are not working women for the most part. leaving their identities as wives and mothers — that experience will change anybody. in that way, it has got to be transformative for the consciousness of these women. and maybe other women of the same background will perhaps find a voice that they have not had before. it's probably quite a coming into the consciousness for a group of women who are muslim, in a way that they wouldn't have otherwise. will this mobilise into a classical definition of political empowerment — what does it mean — more women in education, in the political sector. if you've read the sachar committee report, there has got to be more structural changes to make those things happen. when we think muslim women, we only think religious issues. and that's just not true. muslim women don't just think about muslim issues.

the capitol police have drawn scrutiny over the years for arresting journalists and protesters, use-of-force incidents and discrimination allegations. but documents surrounding such events are often inaccessible unless they're produced as the result of a court case. the agency shields basic records, like office of inspector general reports, from the public.
here's a quick rundown of what we know, what we don't, and what it might take to make things go more quickly:
some of this turns out to be good news for trump's critics. when trump took over the white house, he inherited an enforcement system capable of expelling a quarter-million migrants from the interior annually. but if the shutdown debacle offers any insight into his thinking, it would appear trump does not care. he'd rather have a wall.

huffpost's previous investigation of these textbooks found that they also dismiss evolution as junk science, characterize nelson mandela as a marxist agitator who helped drive south africa to radical affirmative action, and suggest that satan hatched the idea of modern psychology. many of the schools that use these books also ban lgbtq students and families, and the books repeatedly condemn homosexuality. at one point in an abeka textbook, slavery is described in purely economic terms, saying that slaves seemed to be better investments than indentured servants.
the agency's lack of preparation for protesters who openly planned to storm the capitol, some officers' apparent friendliness with the rioters, and the stark contrast between wednesday's lackadaisical showing and the militarized response to black lives matter protests over the summer have combined to drive multiple congressional investigations. capitol police chief steven sund has already resigned, and two capitol police officers have been suspended, while many others are under investigation.

first off, if you experience only the occasional false awakening (once a year or once every few years), hohne says it's likely due to a change in your schedule or an increased sense of urgency around an upcoming task. this sort of false awakening may occur the night before a trip, major life event, or anything that requires you to be on your game. the pressure to perform likely stresses you out to the point that that those concerns bleed over into your dream.

forgiveness is not just for those who have trespassed against us. we must also be willing to extend an olive branch to ourselves for our own trespasses. let 2016 be the year that you walk in total freedom from guilt, shame and blame. stop reliving your mistakes. stop replaying those memories. you cannot change the past. but you can live with it and learn from it. forgive yourself. let it go. move on and make it part of your life story. god has forgiven you. he loves you. end of story. psalm 103 tells us that god is merciful, gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy. learn to love yourself enough to forgive and make it a daily occurrence in 2016.

i usually get home from work around 7 p.m. lately and am on email and writing research papers or grants until 8 or 9 p.m. when i can squeeze in a peloton ride, walk the dog, watch some great british bake off or listen to a podcast to turn off my brain a little, i'm pretty happy about it.

we must change the culture of the sport, the statement listed as the first change: this was the primary recommendation of the independent deborah daniels report on usa gymnastics and the athlete testimony underlined its importance. we heard athletes describe being unsure or unaware of how to report abuse and to whom, and sometimes even what constitutes abuse. we heard athletes describe being afraid or discouraged from reporting abuse.
climate and environmental rules have been perhaps the biggest target of trump's deregulatory agenda. since taking office, the industry-friendly administration has scrapped, weakened or proposed rolling back nearly 100 environmental rules and regulations, according to a new york times analysis.

when the first european settlers arrived in north america, as many as 60 million bison inhabited the continent's grasslands, according to the u.s. fish and wildlife service. and yes, bison are different than buffalo. scientifically speaking, buffalo actually refers to animals like water buffalo in africa. bison refers to the big brown woolly folks the buffalo declaration used as their logo.

in the spending bills democrats plan to pass on thursday, the february date for dhs funding would serve to continue negotiations. some republicans in the house may end up voting for the bill, and there's a possibility that if the shutdown drags on for long enough, senate republicans could pass the bill and both chambers could override trump's veto.
in order to make lasting change, there must be some passion and true desire to do the work. it's not enough to want the result. you must want the result so badly that you're willing to make it a top priority this year. most resolutions don't make the grade when you review them in this manner.

the disaster took place in the same community where just weeks ago firefighters confronted the largest wildfire in the state's history. the back-to-back disasters ― fire and flooding ― may seem like a cruel irony, but they're directly related.
but oh's cautious optimism proved prophetic that very night. the ceremony started with a number of moments that signaled progress in the industry; winners including oh and if beale street could talk star regina king spoke about the significance of their victories while pushing for more racial and gender equality, and presenters referenced the diverse casts in nominated films such as black panther and crazy rich asians.

others are enthusiastic about medicare for all, but think it would be more practical, as policy and politics, to have a more gradual transition ― for example, by making the new public insurance plan voluntary for individuals and employers, while enrolling newborns so that it gets bigger over time. that's the approach of a new bill from reps. rosa delauro (d-conn.) and jan schakowsky (d-ill.).

back in the day, getting married meant that once some mules, hay and gold changed hands, you left your family for the first time and were off to start a whole new life. today, most modern american couples live in sin long before they make it official. this left us wondering: how much does getting married these days really change a relationship? here, seven legally wed folks — from two months in to six years deep — share their experiences.

it's probably good to have a couple of extra weeks of supplies just so that you don't have to actually go and frequent these places if there happen to be cases that show up, kindrachuk said. but he pointed out that storing enough supplies to last you months is likely going too far.
but the gop's increased margin opens the door to trump putting forward even more extreme judicial nominees. and there's no reason to think republicans would say no.
food system failures tend to highlight the lack of control that everyday citizens around the world have over the products they consume ― beyond the fairly passive act of selecting one item at a shop over another. as food supply businesses grow in size and spread across national borders, consumers can begin to feel increasingly distant from the farmers and workers who actually grow and make the things they eat.
nurphoto via getty images deliveroo says it wants to offer riders better benefits.
the other side of the coin concerns federal prisoners. it's not enough to search for ways to put prisoners down more efficiently when they engage in violence. that misses the point. do pepper spray and batons work? sure, as long as the guard sees the problem developing and isn't caught unaware. by the same token, guns and tasers also work. but this is how you control behavior, not change lives and win minds. this isn't the recipe to reformation or rehabilitation, but the recipe for negative reinforcement.
the concept behind block grants and similar proposals for medicaid is simple: instead of open-ended federal funding to cover whatever costs the state's medicaid beneficiaries require, the state gets a flat amount of money it must stretch over the year. and that amount is less than states get now.

―americans reject the president's assertion that there is an illegal-immigration crisis on the southern border, according to a washington post/abc news survey released sunday. in that survey, 53 percent of americans say trump and the republicans are mainly to blame for the shutdown, with 29 percent calling democrats mostly at fault, and 13 percent believing both sides share equal responsibility. a 54 percent majority oppose building a border wall, although that's down from 63 percent in a post/abc survey taken last year ― the change is due largely to increased support among republicans.
she has also secured the tacit backing of the russian government: in may of last year russia presented a document detailing allegations that the white helmets were terrorists. this document consisted entirely of a presentation beeley had given at a talk in london earlier in the year.
reaching out is an act of self-preservation. maybe don't physically touch anybody, unless it's a fist bump with gloved hands. texting and emailing is cool. phone calls are also a good look. here are some other lessons to be learned from a few fictional characters:
in a significant shift, deputy leader tom watson told corbyn in july that he would not stand in his way on party reform, although allies warned the leadership to focus on taking on the tories than 'faction fighting'. katy clark, who is now corbyn's political secretary, will lead the wide-ranging structural review. a senior source at grassroots group momentum told huffpost uk: the review is a very promising first step towards a labour party that is election ready and fit for the 21st century. i'm sure the 500,000 members who showed such energy, enthusiasm and dedication during the last election will welcome having more of a say, and we're glad that every wing of the party is recognising the huge contribution they make. but richard angell, director of progress, labour's centrist pressure group, said: today, labour's new establishment bounced the nec in private session into a series of reforms that amount to a factional power grab and more roles for members in london and the south-east. it is a missed opportunity to not give members in every corner of the country a voice by regionalising the nec. in a bizarre turn of events corbyn's political secretary will be leading a review into party structures rather than working out how to beat the tories and run the country. it is a warped set of priorities when a general election could take place at any point.
our job on january 6th is to determine whether these are the electors the states sent us, not whether these are the electors the states should have sent us.

―three-quarters of the public, including most republicans, think the shutdown is embarrassing for the country, per an npr/ipsos survey released friday. about 7 in 10 agree that the shutdown will hurt the country and economy, with a similar number saying congress should pass a bill to reopen the government now while budget talks continue. just 31 percent want the government to remain closed until a border wall is funded.

the rapid development and approval of covid-19 vaccines for use in the u.s. has been truly remarkable. millions of americans have already received at least one dose of the pfizer/biontech or moderna vaccines (two doses are required for both). and public health experts are working hard to improve distribution across the u.s.
pettine was handed the talented but enigmatic qb ahead of the 2014 season. manziel then sat behind brian hoyer for much of the year, as the browns raced out to a surprising 7–4 start. but they dropped their final five games before this year's slump—that's a 3–18 close to pettine's cleveland career, if you're keeping score.
if he had his way, we'd wind up in a very bad state in this country, he said. i mean, the way i understand it, they laughed at hitler. they all look funny. hitler looked funny, mussolini looked funny and other dictators and despots look funny.
james weldon johnson, the president of the naacp, wrote to president calvin coolidge in 1925, warning that black voters planned to vote against candidates supported by the ku klux klan. the naacp and its leaders were demanding that the republican party denounce the racist organization, to no avail. (trump infamously refused to condemn the kkk on television in 2016.)

your alarm goes off. you roll out of bed, rub your eyes, and start your daily routine. maybe you make it as far as your first meeting of the day, or you might only get to your first sip of coffee. at some point, your actual alarm goes off and you actually get out of bed and start your day. and you realize that you had only dreamt that you woke up as usual.
i absolutely support the movement to raise taxes in new york state on the super-rich. that should have been done early this year when it was immediately clear that we could not rely on the federal government under donald trump to deliver the state and local aid that was needed.

the wave of legislation came as the united states became the epicenter of covid-19, the rapidly spreading respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus. by friday, the u.s. death toll topped 1,000, with more than 100,000 confirmed cases, overwhelming hospitals and forcing doctors to publicly beg for basic medical supplies. the economic fallout exceeded even the worst expectations: 3.3 million americans filed jobless claims this week ― topping both goldman sachs' 2.25 million forecast from last week and smashing the previous one-week record of 695,000 reported job losses. yet, as experts blamed the white house's back-footed response for inflaming the crisis, the trump administration appeared to ramp up its environmental agenda, ordering the environmental protection agency's enforcement division to temporarily stop policing polluters, approving a slate of mining projects, auctioning off new drilling leases and reviving a dormant fight over auto emission standards. the efforts on both the state and federal level offered jarring real-time examples of what the author naomi klein dubbed the shock doctrine: the phenomenon wherein polluters and their government allies push through unpopular policy changes under the smokescreen of a public emergency. while we are all paying attention to covid-19 and the congressional stimulus packages, state legislatures are quietly passing fossil-fuel-backed anti-protest laws, connor gibson, the researcher at greenpeace usa who tipped huffpost off to the bills' passage, said by email friday. these laws do nothing new to protect communities.

if the #metoo movement is going to amount to sustained culture change ― rather than simply a weeding out of the worst actors in a broken system ― we need to renegotiate the sexual narratives we've long accepted, wrote huffpost's emma gray. and that involves having complicated conversations about sex that is violating but not criminal.

however, modi did not announce any economic relief package, raising concerns about how people with low incomes will survive if they are unable to work for 21 days. news reports have said that poor migrant laborers who have been trying to reach their homes in the midst of the lockdown have been harassed and beaten up by the police. the prime minister also did not clearly outline how indians could access food, medicine and other essential goods.

of course, it is still possible for you to get arrested in california for smoking a joint, but you've really got to try hard for it to happen. if you were stupid enough to travel up to yosemite national park and spark up a doobie in front of a park ranger, you would get arrested and tried under federal law for doing so, since the park is federal land. they've even got their own jail and federal judge, so you wouldn't even have to leave to park for this to happen. but short of blatantly smoking weed in front of a federal law enforcement officer on federal land, nobody in california has to fear such a prospect again. of course, there are still state and local laws banning consumption in public, but it's hard to see the cops caring much except in the most egregious cases (please just put out the joint, sir or ma'am, and move along is much more likely). the federal government might also conceivably attempt to bust growers, middlemen, or retailers, but the sheer size of the market means it would be absolutely impossible for them to even make the attempt at arresting people for merely possessing or consuming marijuana ― hopefully, ever again. adults in the golden state can now buy marijuana with only slightly more hassle than it takes to buy a sixpack of beer, a bottle of antihistamines, or a pack of cigarettes. which is as it should be. everywhere.
the study points to hydropower, nuclear and natural gas as the best options to run direct air capture plants at present, noting solar and wind will remain too intermittent until battery technology improves enough to sustain a powerful baseload of electricity.

it is sad to see conservatives acting like liberals and resorting to violence when they are unhappy.
we need more diverse messages and messengers: there are hundreds of exceptionally qualified black & brown, native, lgbtq+, multilingual, multicultural public health and health care leaders who are better versed at communicating and connecting with the diverse communities they come from. public health and health care have to elevate diverse leaders to positions of authority and visibility and learn how to speak the language not of science, but of the people ― by connecting with community leaders, faith leaders, and everyday americans long before the point of an emergency.

previously, landry also investigated how musicians' brains process sensory illusions. together with their previous findings, the results suggest that musicians are better at integrating input from various senses, the study's authors noted. more studies are needed, however, to determine whether and how musical training might slow the natural cognitive decline that occurs as we age. playing a musical instrument has an effect on abilities beyond music, landry concluded. we're only now starting to better understand the benefits of musical training and they seem to range beyond simply playing music.

democrats can't do much to stop mcconnell from confirming objectionable nominees; republicans have been blowing up senate traditions that previously gave the minority some leverage. and the reality is that even though republicans have a slightly stronger hand now, all the gop senators have been voting for trump's court picks nearly all the time, meaning the vote outcomes in the new senate likely won't change.

this is where your idea is truly in motion. it's the most difficult phase, leaving your comfort zone with some much uncertainty, but have faith in what you're doing and understand you'll grow from the experience. as the saying goes, a journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step. keep stepping!
the number of confirmed cases in china stands at 1,287. the virus has also been detected in thailand, vietnam, singapore, japan, south korea, taiwan, nepal, and the united states.

more expensive options, like an n95 mask, can provide protection, as they contour to your nose and face, and can filter up to 95 percent of particulate matter from the air. men with facial hair, such as avol, are often out of luck, though, as beards and mustaches prevent an airtight seal.
this was the case for pro-trump rioters in 2021. it was also the case for white supremacists in wilmington, north carolina, in 1898, in america's first and only successful coup d'etat.

first, what's normal kid stuff for you as a parent won't be the same for another parent. with that being said, most parents correct their children because they are either doing something wrong (like hitting someone, being mean, etc.) or they've picked the wrong time and place to do that normal kid stuff. doesn't it seem as though kids have the most energy and things to say at the most awkward time? and then once that happens, we spend so much time correcting them that we end up having to leave the place where we're at or resort to staying and having a stressful time. kids!!!!

the question has pretty significant implications for our collective ability to curb transmission, because if the vaccine stops people from spreading the virus to others we're likely to get herd protection much sooner than if it only prevents the vaccinated individual from developing symptoms themselves.

this moment is truly unlike any other. it's made plain the deep social imbalances ― like poverty, racism, sexism, classism to name a few ― that are a new revelation for some, but have been common knowledge for many. as a trained public health professional and former state health official, i can't help but think about the lessons that i hope health care and public health take and learn from the moment we're in.
ramirez also weighed in: while a great alternative for vegetarians and vegans, it's not always healthier. fake meats can often be high in sodium and also are considered a processed food.
when people think of yoga, they typically think of downward dog and other muscle-bending moves. however, as porchon-lynch noted above, the foundation of the practice lies in the simple art of deep breathing. and there's more to it than just inhaling and exhaling.

the hit came shortly after iran launched missiles at two military bases in iraq — including one where canadian troops were stationed — in response to a u.s. drone strike that killed iranian maj.-gen. qassem soleimani in baghdad. canadian troops were not injured in the iran missle strikes.
in many other capitalist countries, it was not possible to limit political parties to two. in france, germany and beyond, while there are center-left and center-right parties similar to the democratic and republican parties in the u.s., there are also politically significant parties further to the right and left. in france, for example, the national front is a powerful rightist party led by marine le pen, while the la france insoumise (france unsubdued) is a powerful leftist formation led by jean-luc mélenchon.
it all started while flipping though a well-known magazine that uses illustration prominently on their cover and interior. after going through a big stack and counting the number of illustrations they printed and what percentage were drawn by women, we saw there was a big bias in hiring. and it seemed to be similar for some other publications as well.
what i have come to know is a profound isolation and loneliness that so many individuals experience at the end of life. that isolation is often compounded by the fear felt by those of us who are well.
now the sunrise movement, likely the nation's fastest-growing climate advocacy group, is planning a 14-stop tour meant to drum up grassroots support for a green new deal across multiple states, huffpost has learned. it's the first leg of the group's effort to make the policy the defining issue of the 2020 election.
they think of when they had black lives matter over the summer, peacefully protesting, and were tear-gassed. people are literally storming the capitol and nothing is happening to them, althimer told huffpost. one of my students said, 'if 20 of us had done that, we all would have been dead.' i said, 'no, 20 of you wouldn't have even gotten that close.'

you probably are not the stupid, crazy, incompetent person your ex says you are, so stop taking what he says personally. remember: high-conflict people are always looking for someone to blame and you are a convenient target. he is likely spouting off as a way to defend against the shame of divorce, or to project his unowned sense of inadequacy on to you. what he thinks of you is about him, and you can't change it anyway, so get on with your life.
in the midst of social distancing, the last thing anybody wants is to feel further removed or pushed away by friends.
lawmakers passed a series of bills monday that include establishing an early voting period, consolidating primary dates, automatically updating voter registrations when people move, and allowing 16- and 17-year-olds to pre-register to vote. despite its reputation as a progressive state, new york stuck out for its abysmal voter turnout and not having early voting, a practice in place in some deep red states. it was also the only state in the country in 2018 to have separate primaries for state and federal offices.

in an example of the concerns that spurred the change, one agent assigned to trump was allowed to take a leave to become a white house political aide and became enmeshed in a particularly contentious, controversial incident marking his presidency. anthony ornato, who worked as white house deputy chief of staff earlier this year, helped arrange the photo opportunity in june when trump posed with a bible across lafayette square in washington as peaceful protesters were attacked by federal officers. the protests had been sparked by the police killing of george floyd days earlier in minneapolis.
this type of trafficking is unique, because it's so publicly observable, said myles. there's a misconception that these places are harmless, and so they fall lower and lower on the priority list of all the things law enforcement has to deal with.
he attacked president donald trump's immigration policies, highlighting the white house's six-week experiment with systematically splitting parents from their children at the border.
but newhouse said it makes little sense to worry about how things might shake out in a 2024 republican presidential field before trump has even left office.
in his rose garden press conference alone, trump lied multiple times ― about his past support for a concrete wall, about who is paying for the wall (surprise: it's u.s. taxpayers!), and about the status of a u.s-mexico trade deal that hasn't passed congress.

i'm currently married, and i was married once before this. when i married my first wife, it completely changed the dynamic of our relationship, to the point where the act of getting married seemed to make it clear we weren't right for each other. when i got married for the second time, it definitely felt more like the ideal progression of our relationship. we became stronger as a couple as a result. - chris, married five years

the vow, administered by a coalition of 16 left-leaning environmental groups, commits candidates to adopt a policy to not knowingly accept any contributions over $200 from the pacs, executives, or front groups of fossil fuel companies — companies whose primary business is the extraction, processing, distribution, or sale of oil, gas, or coal.
both congressmen were in washington on friday and said they began to develop symptoms of illness over the weekend and self-quarantined. they both urged people to take this seriously and follow health officials' recommendations.
people have focused on this issue of a carbon tax, but it may not be necessary to finance renewable energy infrastructure, inslee said. we may find other ways to finance this. you look at the trump tax cuts that were misbegotten and gave all these tax benefits to the upper-income groups, and people weren't worried about the deficit when they did that.
worse still is the phenomenon of international trade growing at a slightly slower pace than global production. the ratio of international trade-to-gdp, which indicates the relative importance of international trade in the economy of a country, has been falling sharply since 2009 except a gradual recover in 2010-2011.
the 'party' has become so dysfunctional that i'm not sure anything can save it from itself, said terry sullivan, the campaign manager for the 2016 run by sen. marco rubio of florida for the gop presidential nomination.
during his last full week as president, the trump administration plans to execute three people on death row, capping a historically unprecedented six-month execution spree. the people scheduled for execution — just days before the inauguration of a president who opposes the death penalty — include a woman with a mental illness untreated at the time of her crime, a man with an intellectual disability that should render him ineligible for execution, and a man who did not pull the trigger in the killing he was convicted of.

medicare for all envisions the federal government spending a lot more money on health care than it does today. the government has to find that money ― by raising revenue through taxes or government-imposed premiums, cutting other spending, accepting higher deficits or some combination of the three.

indeed, sexism is a core trumpist value: a study released just this week in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences found that the one key view trump supporters have in common is not economic dislocation but the idea that men should be the ones in charge. (and not just men think this.)

students and their parents met with school administrators on tuesday. their next step is to write a proposal before the district begins working with the state on standards, staffing, costs and other logistics.
most of us know by now that public health advice strongly encourages staying home when sick. but for some restaurant workers, this isn't an option because of america's lack of important social services, as rep. alexandra ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.) pointed out in a recent tweet.
this is the first jan. 8 that i haven't been in tucson, and it's the first time that i didn't wake up in tears, said reed. i believe the moment is right, but i will continue to work to change hearts, because people that have closed minds just have not had enough information, have not seen enough heartbreak, have not seen enough frightened, injured and dead children.
many democrats do not support medicare for all. but at this point even democrats unwilling to endorse it are frequently calling to expand public insurance programs in some fashion ― if not by creating a new government plan that enrolls everybody, then by opening one of the two big existing programs, medicare or medicaid, to more people.

officials said it was too early to compare the new virus with sars or mers, or middle east respiratory syndrome, in terms of how lethal it might be. they attributed the spike in new cases to improvements in detection and monitoring.
so i whispered to my sister, my parents, my best friend: does this seem right? does this seem real? do i seem happy?
the party quickly made a crucial decision. rather than pursue swing voters, they would focus on turning out the democratic base, especially black voters. the choice wasn't obvious. there were roughly 100,000 voters, mostly in the atlanta suburbs, who cast ballots for biden and purdue in november. but knowing republicans had roughly 300,000 more high-propensity voters in the state than democrats, the campaigns wagered their best bet was to fire up black turnout.

yet ukraine's soldiers have been reluctant to seek treatment for post-war mental trauma, ioana moldovan, a photojournalist who visited ukraine in 2015 to document soldiers receiving psychological treatment, told the worldpost in an email wednesday. many soldiers feel that psychologists will prevent them from serving in the army, the international business times reported in april. others avoid talking about emotional problems in general, as mental illnesses have typically been considered a taboo in ukrainian society.
illinois authorities are looking into a cook county marriage license issued three weeks ago in the names of robert kelly and aaliyah haughton, a 1994 issue of the detroit free press reads.
no objective person who reads my books and those written by authors like larry swedroe, john bogle, burton malkiel, william bernstein and many others would continue to be seduced by the marketing hype of wall street. movies like the big short do a great job of exposing the underlying greed that pervades the industry. but don't be fooled. while the financial crisis dealt a devastating blow to the retirement dreams of many, it pales in comparison to the daily plundering of assets that occurs when investors listen to the recommendations of those who claim an ability to beat the market.
the union has also been disappointed by the relative quiet from the occupational safety and health administration. perrone said he would like to see the agency ramping up safety enforcement in grocery stores and plants but sees little evidence that is happening.
mais cela n'a été découvert qu'après beaucoup de recherches. si nous savons aujourd'hui séquencer les génomes, et ce de plus en plus facilement, on ne sait pas si facilement à quoi correspond chaque gène. on ne connait pas directement, quand on voit la mutation dans le génome, l'impact pour le virus, précise la chercheuse. ce n'est pas parce que nous arrivons à lire le texte que nous en comprenons le sens, en quelque sorte.
and that is precisely what it is about making predictability security, comfort and stability your marriage's main priority. while wanting to minimize risks by co-creating a supportive structure that will shield us both from threats and dangers that we would face without a partner is a legitimate and worthwhile desire, too much of a good thing can result in undesirable and unwanted consequences, such as boredom, restlessness, resentment, depression, acting out (as in affairs) and flat-lining of genuine intimacy.

before being sworn in at the interior department on aug. 1, 2017, bernhardt, a colorado native, worked for eight years at the law firm brownstein hyatt farber schreck, where he lobbied on behalf of oil, gas, mining and agricultural interests. he also previously served as a top interior official under former president george w. bush, leading an attempt to open alaska's pristine arctic national wildlife refuge to oil and gas development. (last month the trump administration took a significant step toward its goal of allowing drilling in the refuge, which zinke said stands out among the most impactful interior accomplishments in terms of bolstering america's economic strength and security.)

even worse, the more i studied what other influencers were doing, the more it stomped out my own creativity. i became envious and depressed when comparing my feed to others. i knew better, but i couldn't help but be sucked into the comparison vortex. why were they able to get that dream shot with no people in the background? i asked myself. how does she always look so flawless while traveling? why don't i have as many followers? as many likes? more brands that want to work with me?

the textbooks don't give a full-throated endorsement of trump, noting his crude remarks and previously liberal positions, but they ultimately represent him as someone on the side of christians who is fighting for their values. one description from the abeka textbook reads:
especially if you've just moved to a new city, it's so easy to let the dating apps become your social life. it's harder to look for social situations where you might have to make more of an effort. i have moments when i want to feel desired and so i get on grindr, paul says. i upload a shirtless picture and i start getting these messages telling me i'm hot. it feels good in the moment, but nothing ever comes of it, and those messages stop coming after a few days. it feels like i'm scratching an itch, but it's scabies. it's just going to spread. the worst thing about the apps, though, and why they're relevant to the health disparity between gay and straight men, is not just that we use them a lot. it is that they are almost perfectly designed to underline our negative beliefs about ourselves. in interviews that elder, the post-traumatic stress researcher, conducted with gay men in 2015, he found that 90 percent said they wanted a partner who was tall, young, white, muscular and masculine. for the vast majority of us who barely meet one of those criteria, much less all five, the hookup apps merely provide an efficient way to feel ugly. paul says he's electrified waiting for rejection as soon as he opens them. john, the former consultant, is 27, 6-foot-1 and has a six-pack you can see through his wool sweater.
it was traumatizing to have something so private and scary suddenly released to everyone. i had known i was gay for years at that point, but had no intention of being out. growing up in the small farm town of plainview, texas, was not the most acceptable place for a gay person to fit in.
short is fashionable, but it's too short when people are taking second and third looks because you can't sit down, that's too short, gottsman said. we know it's not inappropriate to have something above the knee, it's inappropriate when you bend over to look at the deceased and people can see your underpinnings.

the test mandates, 1. that state action should be lawful - i.e. with the backing of enacted law. 2. it must pursue a legitimate purpose. 3. it must have rational connection to the object sought to be achieved by the law under which such state action happens. 4. such state action must be necessary to achieve such objective. and 5. such state action must be proportionate i.e. the least restrictive of all means available to achieve such objective, prasanna said.
if there is ever a question about whether any people should be protected from lynching, we have a problem. if there is a question about whether lgbtq people are made in the image of the god we claim, we have a problem. christians must recognize, particularly in the political realm, when we're failing to hold truly christlike belief and behavior.

so far, this winter has brought ample snows to the sierra nevada, the spine of mountains that runs along california's eastern flank. that's good news for californians, because the range's melted snow provides 60 percent of the state's water supply. anyone in the united states who likes fruit, vegetables, and nuts should rejoice, too, because water flowing from the sierra's streams and rivers is the main irrigation source for farms in the arid central valley, which churns out nearly a quarter of the food consumed here.
the collective shrug can be attributed, in part, to the fact that fans and journalists alike saw kelly as a hitmaker beyond reproach. as writer and former entertainment journalist alexia hudson-ward put it, some folks want to enjoy his music without guilt, and that included writers and reporters within the entertainment industry. this much is clear in nekesa mumbi moody's 2001 obituary of aaliyah for the associated press, penned after aaliyah's tragic death in a plane crash, where she refers to kelly as an r&b superstar who had the greatest impact on [aaliyah's] career.
amid this profoundly dysfunctional existential wrangling over the fulfillment of a campaign slogan, speculation about the 2020 presidential election has begun in earnest.
sanders' hold on the progressive mantle may have seemed like it would be a given. but in september, when the working families party, a network of progressive groups with a presence in over 14 states, endorsed sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.), it looked like an activist exodus was underway.
yet another group that trump loves to champion is farmers. but trump this year overturned a regulation that made it easier for independent farmers to sue food companies and large agricultural conglomerates. and now the environmental protection agency is talking about rescinding regulations that prohibit underage workers from handling toxic pesticides.

become clearer on the value you provide. abraham lincoln's quote about preparation applies in this situation as well: give me six hours to chop down a tree, and i will spend the first four sharpening the axe. every hour spent increasing the clarity on the value you provide pays dividends in your marketing, sales, and execution. ramp up the urgency. urgency is created by impending crisis or compelling opportunity. never waste a legitimate crisis, but don't create a bogus one. most businesses can ramp up the urgency by enlisting support, reinforcing action, and ensuring accountability for behavior and performance that supports a compelling vision. enlist others to support a cause, and they will follow. make flawless execution the norm. process and structure create habits, and as aristotle taught excellence is a habit. are your key processes optimized to provide customer value and organizational profitability? now is the time to review and update key processes starting with those that add value to customers. look for something to improve, and then look for something else. remove one barrier to excellence in the next thirty days. follow that up with removing a barrier every thirty days for the next three months. make the results visible to everyone. you may need to start a longer-term improvement during this period, but your goal should be demonstrating urgency for continual improvement and change. value your employees so they will value your customers. discuss positive contributions in every staff meeting. make sincere, performance-focused recognition a priority.

the 1st of january 2017 marked the 18th anniversary of the european common currency, the euro. despite its success from 1999 to 2007, after 2008 the euro has become a burden for many of its members. for example, living standards in italy and greece are below the levels when they joined the euro. finland is the only nordic country using the euro and it is also the only nordic country which has not yet recovered from the financial crash of 2008.

the question then arises about how we can understand these texts. this has been my mission for over thirty years. my biography explains my journey. beginning on new year's day in 2003 i first began writing about hidden meanings in the bible. these hidden meanings are not associated with any religious philosophies; they apply across the board and appeal to many kinds of readers.
intelligence agencies have been warning on this since january, a u.s. official told the post of the intelligence reporting, which was sent to trump administration officials as well as members of congress. donald trump may not have been expecting this, but a lot of other people in the government were — they just couldn't get him to do anything about it.
some women in the study took more than seven hours to dilate from 4 to 5 centimeters, and more than three hours to go from 5 to 6 — well outside of what is considered normal based on friedman's standards. yet they and their babies were healthy.
it's all connected though, i think. if you can't do the hard work of putting aside your own selfishness in the earlier years, what do the later years look like? it took 62 years to build what they had, and i understand that. but if there's one thing i've learned, it's that maybe the little things are actually the big things. honesty and integrity start with lending a helping hand and showing respect and saying i'm sorry and meaning it. if i knew then what i know now. but isn't that always how it goes?
the most inspirational part: one thing that google taught me that i will always be thankful for is to embrace change. prior to google i had worked for bigger, more traditional companies where day to day things just kind of moved along (bank of america, mckinsey, aeropostale). within just a few months at google, there was a re-org and my role completely changed. that change gave me the opportunity to work with new people across the company and take on more responsibility. i learned at google to look forward to change, and to recognize that it creates opportunity. and that, at the core, allowed me to have the confidence to make the jump to starting a company.

it's a model that worked for sen. ed markey (d-mass.), whose fealty to green new deal activists revitalized his 44-year record in congress and helped him beat back a spirited primary challenge last year from democratic rep. joe kennedy, who had been favored to win.

this is not to dismiss the individual empowerment (a word used so blithely and frequently that it has almost lost all meaning) that the women who participated in this or any other sports illustrated swimsuit photo shoot may feel. brinkley cook told e! news that the project made her feel sexy, but also more emotional. it helped me accept myself, she said. raisman had similar praise for the project. for me, 'in her own words' serves as a reminder that we are all humans, we are all battling something, and it is ok to not be ok, she said. we are not alone and we need each other.
the guy got charged but i'm still vague on what happened to him. on another occasion, i was in a rapid response car and called to treat a man who had knocked himself out by slipping on wet stairs. his friend was upset that i wasn't in an ambulance and wasn't going to take him straight away to hospital. i explained i was there to give first aid quickly and my colleagues would arrive with an ambulance. but he pushed me down the stairs and i broke my wrist. it has got worse. i definitely get verbally abused every day now and physically pushed or shoved or worse at least once a week. that's why we need this protection. at the moment, it's hit and miss, this would give judges the power to give a minimum sentence. eventually people are going to realise before pushing a paramedic over, 'let me take a deep breath, i will end up with consequences if i push him'. what makes it worse is we are overstretched and over-demanded and when we arrive people are already irate that we weren't quicker. and they take it out on us. laura barrett, 47, paramedic in east london

i don't know how many times i was told to get lost, and that i was going to hell. i couldn't have gone to my coach because telling him would have made my situation worse. he likely would have gone to those team members and maybe punish them, but ultimately make them resent me more. if they knew i told our coach, they would have harassed me even more, possibly even at school and not just practice. out of fear, i just didn't tell anyone.

dairy is one. on dairy, it is not an issue of tariffs but certification. india has been saying that the american dairy products can surely come into india, but they have to assure the indian consumer via packaging, that none of the products that are up for sale are procured from animals that have been fed blood meal. blood meal is a protein supplement that the american dairy industry uses to get greater yield from their cattle. it is derived from dead ruminating animals, dead bones, dead blood and so on. india is putting the argument that it hurts our religious sentiments if products like that are going to be up for sale and no one is going to buy them. so, the u.s. dairy industry needs to create a different production line just to cater to the indian market. a production line in which cattle have not been fed blood meal and reinvest in a specific packaging for the indian market. that is what their dairy industry has not been willing to do.

besides fighting for change, you mean?

the problem with that argument is that if you go back and look at when adam smith was writing [in the latter half of the 18th century], nearly all economic activity globally was happening in small, local farms and workshops with the exception of a few large trading companies. when it happens at the local level, there is a lot of local accountability. so if you own a local small business and you hire workers, those are your neighbors you are hiring. if you fire workers, those are your neighbors you are firing. if you pollute a river, it's your stream; if you are donating money, it's your community that's benefiting.

just as i am learning not to step in and try to fix a family crisis myself, the family is learning to move beyond rigid gender roles. when my sister, brother and sister-in-law meet, they agree more people are needed. my sister, capable of running a small army, swings into action. she texts and calls family members, tells our brother to get his kids to step up, and pencils in names to create another week of coverage. she accomplishes this within an hour.
gop perceptions about trump's standing in his party have also changed. just 48% of republican and republican-leaning voters now think that most or all congressional republicans support trump, down from 65% in december. there's less movement in these voters' own loyalties: a 41% plurality of republican and republican-leaning independents who voted for trump in this year's presidential election say they consider themselves more supporters of trump than of the republican party, indicating little change from the 42% who said the same last month.
the policy, which the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services calls healthy adult opportunity, is the trump administration's attempt to accomplish a long-held republican goal: to shrink medicaid by establishing annual caps on how much federal money goes to state medicaid programs.
that was the case with poehler and fey when they were given the chance to host the golden globes three years in a row, thanks to their near-perfect rapport. their banter and charm was certainly a welcome distraction from the otherwise methodical format of awards shows, which is why people are campaigning for duos like john mulaney and nick kroll to host. except i'd rather just watch funny people perform their netflix specials than schmooze through a set of overly vetted jokes performed in front of the crème de la crème of tinseltown. maybe awards show hosts were more popular in the 1980s and '90s because we had few opportunities otherwise to see comedians like billy crystal and chris rock live. now, streaming platforms, social media and youtube make it easy to get your fix.

but there is a significant downside to being an old programmer. the world is changing rapidly, and the pace is increasing. 15 years ago, i dove into c+ and became excellent at it. about four years ago, i jumped into jquery and learned how to hook jquery and c# together to make super fast user interfaces. i got laid off about three years ago, so i turned my back on c# and dove into wordpress. now it's drupal. and the pattern is that learning the new stuff is becoming increasingly difficult. i am still trying to get a wordpress plugin working that uses local storage and web workers. debugging this complexity wears out my brain.

the trump-led furor over a migrant caravan that formed a superheated prelude to the midterm elections was an expression of visceral rage, of fear, of a terrible anger to which trump's supporters have responded eagerly at his legions of rallies. a dhs memo on the christmas eve death of a guatemalan 8-year-old in custody that used the word illegal five separate times offered more of the same fear-mongering rhetoric, claiming that migrants are harboring illness.

there is a big difference between marijuana legalization and two other historic political battles for liberation, of course. both the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s and the leaps and bounds gay rights have made in the past decade or so were also struggles for liberation ― both of which have not fully been realized, even today. these fights for equality, though, ran a whole lot deeper than the fight to be left alone to smoke a joint in peace. you cannot change the color of the skin you were born with, and as lady gaga will tell you, people don't choose to be who they are sexually, they are born that way. but nobody is a born pot smoker. it's just not an inherent part of a person at birth.

how about slackers living at home with their parents? there's an explanation for that as well. a report from the pew research center explains that the increase in millennials living at home is driven by the economic conditions, the high cost of housing, education level, and marrying later in life. in other words, millennials as a group aren't slackers. if anything, they may be being more practical.

but, as is often the case in recent public opinion, the most glaring divide is political. president donald trump, who on monday warned of the seriousness of the outbreak, had often downplayed the issue in previous statements, an attitude that's reflected in his supporters' reactions. democrats are 35 percentage points likelier than republicans to say they're at least somewhat concerned about the spread of coronavirus in the u.s. a 55% majority of democrats, but just 19% of republicans, say they're very concerned. (previous epidemics like avian flu, h1n1 and ebola, it's worth noting, also drew polarized responses.)

verbal abuse is very, very common. it's absolutely got worse. there's more people, we are busier than ever. drink and drugs plays quite a big factor in things and that's more readily available. in 2015 i was called to a patient listed as fitting in a budgens supermarket. it wa very busy, six o'clock in the evening, lots of people around. when it became apparent that he wasn't fitting, he realised we knew and started verbally abusing us. we thought let's get him out of the shop and that will calm him. however, when we got him outside the shop he became more and more aggressive. and then he kind turned. i said to my crewmate get back in the ambulance and we will lock the doors. he came up to my window, was smashing the glass saying 'i'm going to kill you'. i actually though he was going to strangle me. it was very, very frightening. he started jumping on the bonnet saying to my crewmate 'i'm going to kill you both'. it was a very busy junction, there must have been a hundred people around and nobody wanted to intervene. one girl that picked the phone up, dialed 999 and said 'he's trying to kill the crew and smash the ambulance'. he heard her say that and chased her into a very busy road, jumped her and smashed her face into the floor. she was a deputy head and she was the only person who decided to help.

part of the problem is there is no easy mechanism for nations to enforce their rights, she said. the issue is that nations are not able to litigate the full scope of indigenous rights violations as part of a judicial review of a project. they are told that to do a full-on civil action for infringement, and those cost millions of dollars.

for many voters who backed trump in 2016 and continue to back him now, that unconventional style is still attractive, even if it might lead to some poor decisions. they believe trump is doing the best he can, and they doubt anyone else would have done much better — even republican governors who had run against trump in 2016 like florida's jeb bush or new jersey's chris christie, both of whom had experience guiding their states through natural disasters.

in recent years, the united states has seen a rise in mass consumption and urbanization, leading to a 'more is better' mindset, kondo told huffpost via email. however, i believe that a shift toward mindfulness is occurring. we are beginning to give more attention to each item we own and determine the few things that truly matter. i think people's interest in the konmari method coincides with these cultural changes in american society.

i am fortunate enough to be able to work from home, and have been since around mid-march 2020. the workdays are long for us both. we do a lot of texting back and forth throughout the day for moral support and to gauge when he might be able to return home. it helps us determine our dinner plans. planning meals is challenging these days, and we admittedly do a lot of takeout during the week simply because it provides the needed flexibility when he inevitably gets delayed. otherwise, i'm often eating dinner alone or it's a lot of reheated meals and leftovers.

and even he says most of his messages don't get replies, that he spends probably 10 hours talking to people on the app for every one hour he spends meeting for coffee or a hookup. it's worse for gay men of color. vincent, who runs counseling sessions with black and latino men through the san francisco department of public health, says the apps give racial minorities two forms of feedback: rejected (sorry, i'm not into black guys) and fetishized (hi, i'm really into black guys.) paihan, a taiwanese immigrant in seattle, shows me his grindr inbox. it is, like mine, mostly hellos he has sent out to no reply. one of the few messages he received just says, asiiiaaaan. none of this is new, of course. walt odets, a psychologist who's been writing about social isolation since the 1980s, says that gay men used to be troubled by the bathhouses in the same way they are troubled by grindr now. the difference he sees in his younger patients is that if someone rejected you at a bathhouse, you could still have a conversation afterwards. maybe you end up with a friend out of it, or at least something that becomes a positive social experience. on the apps, you just get ignored if someone doesn't perceive you as a sexual or romantic conquest. the gay men i interviewed talked about the dating apps the same way straight people talk about comcast: it sucks, but what are you gonna do?
people of all ages, genders and races idolize influencers and celebrities, but the images are particularly impactful on young women, fox said. if influencers are mainly thin, this then tells the consumer that this is 'the ideal.' the young mind may think, 'they look this way and that's why they have status.' this keeps the 'thin ideal' mainstream and idolized. without a diversified following list, the endless stream of impossibly small waistlines, what i eat in a day videos and celebrities promoting magic-bullet diet pills can start to get to you. megan retherford, a graduate student in michigan, fell into that trap in high school. at the time, she had come off some medication and grew into an adult body she wasn't quite expecting. i went from a size 0 to a size 10 in a matter of two years as a teenager, and my body has continued to change throughout my adult life, she told huffpost. years went by where retherford loathed her body, but eventually she got sick of fixating on her weight and yo-yo diets that went nowhere. she set out to improve her self-image. diversifying the body types she followed on instagram played a huge part in that. over the course of many years, i have been able to change my mindset almost entirely and i have a very healthy relationship with food and my body now largely due to who i see living fulfilling lives as fat women on social media, she said.

especially when you're making a movie like this in a very short amount of time on a very low budget, you need to firstly cast people who you know are brilliant, and i think every actor in this is brilliant. and i think often comedy actors don't get an opportunity to show that so much. but i certainly, in my experience, think that comedy actors are willing to go places and have a lack of inhibition that's really amazing. so i didn't mean for it to be meta, i suppose, but the quicker you can put people in a headspace, the better.
representatives from bju press and abeka did not respond to inquiries about how many schools use their products. however, a 2017 huffpost investigation found that about one-third of christian schools participating in private school choice programs used a curriculum created by these two publishers or a similar company called accelerated christian education, amounting to around 2,400 schools. the number of schools using these company's products that do not participate in a voucher program likely amounts to thousands more.

we aren't quite there yet, though. as jericho apo, digital strategist at the story of stuff, a community of people working to change our consumption-crazed culture, told huffpost, we still live in a very consumer-driven economy, heavily influenced by materialism. we often tend to attach our self-worth and values to the things we own as a result of living in this consumer culture, he said.

there was a few things. i think, firstly, i really wanted the whole film to feel part of cassie's life and cassie's journey. she's learned to subvert her femininity and her prettiness and her blondness to effectively hide and mislead — like lots of addicts do, actually. i very much think of her as an addict. and so she's just learned the tricks to keep things functioning on the surface, to stop people from asking too many questions. for me, if she's fluffy and pink and welcoming but she's boiling with this terrible rage, then i think it was important that the film itself reflected that, that it felt just as inviting as her and just as misleading as she is.

as hazy as the immediate political impact of the shutdown may be, its implications for the future are still more unclear. in the past, those effects have often been ephemeral. the 2013 government shutdown sent ratings for the republican party falling to historic lows, but faded quickly from public memory and didn't prevent the gop from claiming victory in the midterms a year later. as the current shutdown stretches on, however, there's still room for that calculus to change.

fairly or not, employers are developing certain stereotypes of millennials that are reinforced by the media. but you can actually use this to your advantage. go out of your way to demonstrate that you are willing to work your way up, stay late, and won't expect a promotion after six weeks. you can do this by discussing your values or, even better, a time when you really worked to reach a goal. - john rood, next step test preparation

full disclosure: sean combs and i go back like sneakers and hats. the first time i met diddy his name was still puffy. it was 1993 and i was music editor at interview magazine; we had dinner in soho because he wanted to meet hip-hop journalists who could help him launch bad boy records. he had signed the notorious b.i.g and told me he was interested in signing a rock band, so after dinner, we sat in his range rover and he listened to my cd. for some reason, maybe because my singing sounds like lou reed but more awful, he didn't sign me. but we stayed in contact.

and the wfp endorsement crystalized a residual sense from the 2016 election that sanders had not yet mollified critics in the activism community who considered him unduly articulate about and focused on questions of racial justice. his groan-inducing remarks at the she the people conference in houston for women of color in april and his absence at the netroots nation conference in philadelphia in july contributed to a sense that sanders had missed his moment. while those activists do not directly affect votes in the early primary and caucus states, they are influential in liberal organizations and websites that help shape perceptions of candidates.

cable was essentially anointed party leader after jo swinson, now deputy leader, decided not to run. what is the difference between farron's lib dems and cable's? well it's an evolution of the same, cable says. i think the change is not from the tim farron era, but pre-2015 and post-2015. we had taken a very bad hit in 2015. i think two thirds of our members have come in since 2015 and that process started under the last leader and its continued since. the membership has changed and the nature of the party has changed and of course brexit has become an all-consuming issue. cable, initially sceptical of committing the party to another referendum, has embraced the idea of giving the public a vote on the final brexit deal. it didn't happen in the 2017 election for sure, he says of the success of that strategy. but we haven't had any real tests of electoral support since then. we do have lots of local by-elections where we tend to do very well actually. i think if there were an election now, there isn't going to be, but if there was, i think our position is much more appealing.

when black people come to the defense of these men, here's what they are really saying: black lives matter, but only certain ones, only convenient ones. men like kelly are worth defending, but not the black women and girls in our communities who fall prey to these men. men like kevin hart deserve a second chance for their homophobia, even after doubling down and initially refusing to apologize for this homophobia, and this second chance should come at the expense of gay black people, particularly the femme gay black men and boys who hart targeted in his tweets.
there is very little money being spent to reduce the numbers of officer suicides, said karen solomon, president and co-founder of blue h.e.l.p. we hope that by raising awareness about the scope of this problem — and shining a light on the need for increased mental health resources directed to officers approaching crisis — we can ultimately reduce the number of officers who die by suicide.

having established i wasn't a townie, the bartender proceeded to give me a third grade book report on randsburg. i learned that their chief export is the same as their average annual rainfall: no dice. i also learned that randsburg was originally a mining town in the 1800's. gold, silver, and something used for making batteries. i don't know if the mines are still operating, but in the same way you might not ask a waiter if he's been on any great auditions lately, i took one look around at the burnt out houses that dotted the village and decided not to ask, how's business?

the draft rule would impose one of the toughest legal standards the government has ever required of a private party – and impose them on lower-income people who lack the means to meet the burdens, whatever the justice of their claims. the draft rule also would render the 1994 law a nullity. the department doesn't have the power to do that.

but this is a moment of hope for muslim women movements as well as other movements. when i was at shaheen bagh, i heard a speaker say that we did not come out on the streets when the teen talaq thing happened, we did not come out on the streets when the babri masjid judgment happened, but we could stand back no longer. and the assumption seems to be that this time it is because of the constitution and because the constitution is so sacred. my reading would be that this is a particular moment in india in which muslims simply cannot stay quiet because their very existence and subjectivity is at stake in the caa. i heard one woman say that i'm doing this for our children's future. i don't even think they are thinking of this as a great feminist thing. it's about the children, the sons and the daughters. i think they are thinking that if they don't speak out as muslims now then they will never speak out.

4. follow jesus: it seems simple, but it really isn't. following jesus doesn't mean that you simply know him. it means that you know him intimately. it means that your heart is in sync with his heart. it means that you obey him, you trust him, and that you allow him to lead you, even when you do not understand the journey. you will never go wrong by following the one who will never lose his power, credibility or popularity. allow him to be your spiritual navigation system as you learn to discern his voice. let his word be a light unto your feet and a lamp unto your path. do not worry about making unplanned or unexpected detours. god has a way of getting you back on his divine path. and when the road gets hard and lonely, he promises to never leave you or forsake you. when you feel too weary to continue the journey, let him carry you. trust in him with all your heart, do not lean on your own understanding, in all your ways acknowledge him and watch him make your paths straight.

i worry that focusing on the cause of the financial crisis and wall street's seemingly endless proclivity to create complex investments will obscure the larger issue. it's that the underlying premise is fatally flawed. many investors believe their stockbrokers have a legal obligation to put the interest of the investor first. they don't understand the inherent conflict of interest that comes with permitting stockbrokers to sell investment products that generate higher fees as long as those investments are deemed suitable. stockbrokers are under no obligation to advise their clients that lower-fee investments, with higher expected returns, are available.

you asked whether belief in the virgin birth is essential. essential to whom? you were told that if something is truly integral to a body of thought you cannot remove it without destabilizing the whole thing. that is a truism, but it does not help sort what is integral from what is not. moreover, the truism pertains only to thought. religious life is not mainly about thought, but about wholeness and well-being -- not in the unknowable future, but now. it is said that a man once asked, teacher, how can i inherit eternal life. and the teacher replied, what is written in the law? what do you read there? (luke 10: 24-25) the teacher turned first to learn from the man. who are you? what do you hold to be essential? what a beautiful beginning.

my new year's resolution is to embrace the imperfect. i think as designers we so often strive to have everything be just so - always attempting to makes things appear perfect. however in letting go of the unachievable - and embracing the imperfections in life - we also find the joy. the dog hair on the sofa, the cluttered coffee table, the remnants of a meal - these are the results of things that bring me happiness. curling up with one of my dogs for a nap on the sofa, reading the sunday papers around the coffee table, or gathering with friends for a memorable dinner - all bring great joy. a little mess can be the sign of a life well lived. i intend to embrace it and give myself a hall pass when it comes to seeking perfection!

2. fear not: we are commanded numerous times in the bible to fear not. in john 16:33, jesus warns that trials and tribulations will come, but to be of good cheer. why? because he has overcome the world. we live in a fallen world, where it can be easy to give in to fear and panic. but do not be moved. go ahead and start that new business venture. give love another chance. go back to school if that is what you desire. do not allow the what ifs to hold you hostage. live your best life in 2016, with no regrets. when challenging circumstances arise and try to paralyze you, stand on this promise from isaiah 41:10: fear not, for i am with you. be not dismayed. for i am your god. i will strengthen you, i will help you, and i will uphold you with my righteous right hand. that means whatever you face in 2016, god will be there with you every step of the way. he will protect you, give you peace and will calm your heart in the midst of the storm.
the results: by mid-century (2039–2059), the average annual snowpack will fall by 54.4 percent compared to the late-20th century baseline. by the time today's teens are in their 70s, it will be 79.3 percent beneath the old standard. to analyze massive amounts of water, planners think in acre-feet—the amount needed to submerge an acre of land by one foot. at the end of the last century, the sierra nevada captured an average of 8.76 million acre-feet. by mid-century, they project, the average will fall to 4 million acre-feet, and by century's end, 1.81 million acre-feet.
vegan oreos are nice, but are they worth creating a whole vegan kickstart program and website? once the giddiness of their idea wore off, the york-based couple weren't sure, either. when they debuted veganuary in 2013, land prayed a hundred people would pledge. glover was pushing for a thousand. after 3,000 people pledged, they realized, the world was ready for a vegan month, says land. we ploughed the rest of our savings into building a much bigger and better website.

so much of that, and more, is contained in h.r. 1, [the for the people act], which is a great piece of legislation. it doesn't contain everything i would have in there. election day, for example, should be a national holiday. but it would be transformative to enact that incredible piece of legislation.
michael ertel, the incoming elections chief for the state, recently told the orlando sentinel that he saw no reason why ex-felons who've completed all of the conditions of their sentences shouldn't be able to register to vote on tuesday.

westjet and sunwing airlines are drastically changing their commercial operations to help bring canadians home after prime minister justin trudeau called on citizens and permanent residents to return to the country.
in my view, there is no plan too bold or too ambitious. rep. kathleen rice (d-n.y.)
it is rare that visitors to a booth or exhibition are looking to quarrel - after all, they often have paid admissions to enter the fair and have some idea of what to expect - but simply want to strike up a conversation (itself a compliment of sorts) and don't know what to say. artists are sometimes told that they dress like artists, which may seem like a backhanded compliment (are their clothes oddly matched or funky or ill-fitting or in disrepair?), or that their work reminds the visitor of some other artist's (is their art derivative, unoriginal, plagiarized?). it is likely that both comments are meant in a positive light, indicating in the first instance that the artist is a unique individual and in the second that the artist's work is as good or as pleasing as someone else's. knowing how to find the positive side of a potentially negative remark may turn an awkward situation into a more relaxed moment. shows can go for days, and artists may become tired and irritable by the end, apt to find a question insulting simply because they have heard it repeated so many times. possibly, there is no ulterior motive to the question of how long it took to paint that picture. artists might simply need to refresh themselves periodically in order to maintain a positive attitude.
in a statement released sunday, zirinsky, who has long been the head of 48 hours, emphasized that the change in title wouldn't mean a change in goals.
given these considerations, here is my own top 10 most important/impactful products of the last 50 years. obviously feel free to disagree and discuss after you've perused my choices.
we were misled in economics back in university with the concept of an invisible hand, the unseen forces that move the free-market economy. in reality, the economy is just a reflection of all our individual decisions.

it was not until mid-march, when some hospitals were already treating thousands of infected patients without enough equipment, that the government placed bulk orders for n95 masks and other necessities for its stockpile, the associated press reported. washington dithered on supplies for two months after global alarm bells rang about a coming pandemic in january.
my father worked at shell oil company for many years, and while on the seventh circuit, in an abundance of caution, i have recused myself from cases involving those shell entities with which he was involved, she wrote in an answer to a questionnaire during her senate confirmation hearings in october on her supreme court nomination by president donald trump.
he went on to thank trump for working quickly to help the state set up emergency hospitals, and to allow federal emergency funding, including waiving the requirement that the state pays for 25% of it.
i was recently working on a deal with costco to have my book sold in their stores. at the last minute, the deal fell through. i won't bore you with the details, but i worked very hard for the better part of a year until it was beyond my control and there was little i could do but watch the green light turn yellow and then sadly, red.
still, there's no indication mcconnell would allow consideration of other top biden priorities, most notably a public option expansion of the 2010 affordable care act, which passed without a single republican vote when democrats controlled both chambers on capitol hill. biden's proposed tax hikes on corporations and the wealthiest americans also are likely dead in a gop senate.
there are common pitfalls that historically prevent people from reaching their goals every year. to help increase the probability of achieving one's goals this year, i offer the following strategies:
• what went wrong: kelly wanted, and was given, almost complete control over the franchise's personnel decisions ahead of this season. the power grab negated any work kelly had done as coach over the 2013 and '14 campaigns.
democrats also had a strong class of candidates, including popular former governors in colorado and montana, as well as famed former astronaut mark kelly in arizona.
instead of self-rejecting yourself now, think of this phase as walking underneath a scaffolding. it's a little shaky and you might be scared, hesitant to keep walking, and wanting to give up because it could break down on you. however, you keep going because you can see the exit. really, the only way to get out of it is to stay focused and patient. there is an end to it, and you'll reach it faster than you think.
a new way to go about your days.
add tomatoes, cinnamon stick, amchoor or lemon juice.
by comparison, 57% of the public thinks the government has a responsibility to make sure all americans have affordable health care coverage, with 24% saying it does not. by a 10-point margin, 45% to 35%, the public supports the idea of all americans getting their insurance from a single government plan. (half of those surveyed saw the coronavirus questions prior to the other questions about health care, and half after; the order did not appear to make a significant difference.)
as long as trump continues to talk about running — whether or not he actually winds up doing so — it will likely make it difficult for other 2024 hopefuls, particularly those who seek to run as trump's heir by appealing to the racial and cultural grievances that are trump's specialty.
daniel packs his bags often with new missions in mind, whether his efforts to train the most obese town in america for a 5k road race or picking peppers with migrant fieldworkers in central california or spending three months sending out 18,000 emails seeking a division 1 collegiate coaching position, where he landed roles with the university of virginia and northwestern.

the safety of our riders and customers is our top priority. that is why we are launching a new, contact-free delivery service [where] customers and riders can request in the app that food is left safely on the doorstep, a company spokesperson said.
she knew what it could be, at least. i think that's what she's deliberately doing. the way that she fights certainly implies she was not looking for that to happen. she really wasn't. but i think she's become so cavalier with everything; she's so furious that her risk-taking has gone much further. she's taking risks that she never should have, which is why she never went down this road in the beginning.
again, [trump's] lies have a large number of people believing them, truly astonishing really. he amped them up enough to commit a crime, just embarrassing.
if elected, much of what he proposed, including new spending and the establishment of public utilities, would require stringer to marshal allies in the city council, albany and washington to enact new legislation. and the executive job in a city with an economy bigger than that of most countries offers a powerful bully pulpit.
i would remind the president that under president trump's watch, we have added more debt at a faster pace than ever since world war ii. we have never done this. people need to know that, manchin told a local west virginia television station in december after trump called on congress to increase direct payments to $2,000.
washington state gov. jay inslee (d) signed a pledge tuesday promising to reject donations from the fossil fuel industry ahead of a likely run for the white house that he's vowed to uniquely center on climate change.

we also quickly saw how severely covid-19 affected people with conditions related to poor diet: obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease, and how important healthful diets are for preventing these problems.
but the variant first discovered in south africa has an additional mutation that has scientists on edge, one named e484k.
for decades, this is what psychologists thought, too: that the key stages in identity formation for gay men all led up to coming out, that once we were finally comfortable with ourselves, we could begin building a life within a community of people who'd gone through the same thing. but over the last 10 years, what researchers have discovered is that the struggle to fit in only grows more intense. a study published in 2015 found that rates of anxiety and depression were higher in men who had recently come out than in men who were still closeted. it's like you emerge from the closet expecting to be this butterfly and the gay community just slaps the idealism out of you, adam says. when he first started coming out, he says, i went to west hollywood because i thought that's where my people were. but it was really horrifying. it's made by gay adults, and it's not welcoming for gay kids. you go from your mom's house to a gay club where a lot of people are on drugs and it's like, this is my community? it's like the fucking jungle. i came out when i was 17, and i didn't see a place for myself in the gay scene, says paul, a software developer. i wanted to fall in love like i saw straight people do in movies. but i just felt like a piece of meat.
he said his biggest accomplishments were passing a child protection bill that laid the groundwork for indigenous-led child welfare agencies, reorganizing autism services and delivering the pan am games in 2015.

a first line of defense is to increase light exposure, hartstein said. get outside during the day, even if you have to bundle up, and get more vitamin d and exposure to sunlight. for mild cases, this change alone can have lasting benefits.
we're talking a handful of males to hundreds and hundreds of females. we were shocked.
when it comes to technology addiction many kids are only copying what they see their parents do. truthfully there are times when we're no better. i know i've been guilty of a little phone addiction every now and again. do we really need to constantly check our facebook feed to see who is blowing their nose every minute? i think we all know the answer to that.
according to miriam groom, the vice president of groom associes, what any recruitment agency is really looking for in a talent management platforms is for them to enhance their recruitment solutions and support critical workflows. however, this was not achieved this year even though there was significant progress on it.
seikatsu club attempts to transform that dynamic by putting members at the center of the quality-control process and increasing transparency. this helped to attract people in large numbers at critical moments, including after the fukushima nuclear disaster. in the months immediately after the nuclear accident, seikatsu says its membership grew at nearly double the normal rate.

the other asterisk is that different countries started vaccinating on different days because government approvals of vaccines didn't happen simultaneously. the u.k. started first, then came the u.s. and then, finally, the european union. adjusting for that factor, the performance of the u.s. comes closer to that of the u.k., but several european countries, like denmark, ireland and italy, come close to or look better than the u.s.

yes, absolutely. well, meta? probably not, because i think anything too meta can be a bit alienating. it's funny, a lot of the conversation has been about me casting them against type. actually, i've cast them completely to type. it wasn't so much that it was meta, but for both the men and women — including connie britton and alison brie — i really wanted to cast people you like. it was all about testing the audience's allegiances to people. there's nothing we love more than a villain and a very clear-cut victim. we love that as a society and as a viewer because we know who's good and who's bad. what is really discomforting is when we're seeing people that we really like and respect who've been people that we've had crushes on since childhood do stuff we don't like.
they have had to make these and many more such political alliances because they are simply too vulnerable to go it alone. their alliances' goals always included making sure that the capitalist system itself survived, partly by preventing the majority from voting for tax and regulation policies that would undo the inequalities and instabilities of capitalism.

it's also fair to point out that some people wanted to have this conversation before the #metoo moment, but that a patriarchal hegemony of taste served as a bulwark against it. the cultural change didn't just begin in october. for example, when tarantino released the hateful eight in 2016, critics explicitly called out his dicey use of extreme violence toward women in the film, questioning whether it was artistically essential or even justifiable.

there were numerous interactions with stephen paddock every day at the resort, including a room service delivery and a call with housekeeping on october 1, all of which were normal in nature.
buhr: it's honestly been exhausting. icu doctors like me are used to having patients die, but the magnitude of death and suffering has been so much more than usual. additionally, because of infection control measures, patients' families can't come be with them in the icu anymore in person. we use video chat to try to keep them involved, but it's not the same. it also means i spend a lot more time calling people instead of involving families on our rounds. it's really challenging to connect with people and have difficult conversations about what is often the end of someone's life solely over the phone.
peacock echoed that caveat. on their own, each of the components easily fit into a well-balanced and nutrient-dense diet. however, when they all come together into a single meal, it can be a sugar overload. looking at a couple of popular chains that sell açai bowls, they can have upward of 70 grams of sugar! with such a significant amount, it's frustrating seeing them touted as a super healthy breakfast or snack.

he was removed from the no fossil fuel money pledge roster, and the revelations prompted fresh scrutiny of his voting record. the houston chronicle, the newspaper of record in texas' biggest city, criticized his oil and gas ties in an editorial and warned that if fans of fossil fuels can't find an effective way to address climate change, texas will have to start dealing with problems even more destructive than an oil bust.

the perception that pocketbook issues motivated trump voters likely comes from the fact that americans with less education did tend to vote for him in 2016 and 2020, she said. but their motivating factor wasn't about, say, the rising cost of health insurance. lower education also correlates with what she calls group animosity, fear of the other.

eventually, with no family barbecues or accidental chats in the grocery store lines, we decided we had to call our friends and let them know. it was awkward because what should have been a natural aside needed to be said so very intentionally. it felt like we were calling people to announce big news, which was in fact, just regular life. but one by one we reached out to people, blushing like teenagers. no one was surprised, and the predictability made me sting with embarrassment.

why burma? burma (renamed myanmar by military rulers), is where aung san suu kyi is preparing for her party to assume leadership in parliament in march. her national league for democracy swept an astonishing 78 percent of the seats in fall elections. one can only imagine the joy, relief and exhaustion the nobel laureate must have felt, having led the struggle against military rule since 1989. she spent 15 of those years under house arrest. it's instructive to note some of the first things the democracy leader did after the election victory:

in early february last year, the intercept reported that wheeler held fundraisers for sens. john barrasso (r-wyo.) and inhofe in may, five months before his formal nomination to be deputy administrator came before the senate environment and public works committee, on which the senators serve. that same month, huffpost reported that two nonpartisan groups of regional air pollution regulators accused wheeler of abusing his power as a senate aide in the early 2000s to bully and intimidate the organizations when they opposed a bill inhofe, wheeler's boss at the time, introduced. in a statement wednesday, barrasso, the environment and public works committee chairman, vowed to push to confirm wheeler as administrator. acting administrator wheeler has done an outstanding job leading epa and is well qualified to run the agency on a permanent basis, he said. i will work with committee members to get him confirmed. this story has been updated with statements from barrasso and wheeler.

why the shift from original lyrics to a dance focus? it could be that todrick hall is now in charge, after the unfortunate public meltdown of former favorite ru producer lucian piane. but that seems wrong, considering hall is a prolific parodist, and his kardashian was an original piece. whatever the case, it gives queens relatively few chances to be funny or impressive — save shangela, whose mariah number is minimally about singing and more about camping it up, and ben, whose hard-rapping julie andrews is perfect. even a cold-hearted ben skeptic like me can admit she utterly slays this challenge. under drag race rules, she'd have been the sole winner (though, under the same rules, i think aja would've been the champion last week).

instead of providing better, cheaper health care to all americans ― a vow trump made repeatedly in his campaign, sometimes using it to distinguish himself from rival gop candidates ― repeal would have meant millions of poor and middle-class americans losing their coverage. some younger and healthier people would have ended up saving money, but only because older, sicker people would have ended up spending more ― or going without insurance altogether.

gay men are, as keuroghlian puts it, primed to expect rejection. we're constantly scanning social situations for ways we may not fit into them. we struggle to assert ourselves. we replay our social failures on a loop. the weirdest thing about these symptoms, though, is that most of us don't see them as symptoms at all. since he looked into the data, salway has started interviewing gay men who attempted suicide and survived. when you ask them why they tried to kill themselves, he says, most of them don't mention anything at all about being gay. instead, he says, they tell him they're having relationship problems, career problems, money problems. they don't feel like their sexuality is the most salient aspect of their lives. and yet, they're an order of magnitude more likely to kill themselves. the term researchers use to explain this phenomenon is minority stress. in its most direct form, it's pretty simple: being a member of a marginalized group requires extra effort. when you're the only woman at a business meeting, or the only black guy in your college dorm, you have to think on a level that members of the majority don't. if you stand up to your boss, or fail to, are you playing into stereotypes of women in the workplace? if you don't ace a test, will people think it's because of your race? even if you don't experience overt stigma, considering these possibilities takes its toll over time.
as asian-americans, we have benefited from the work of black and brown activists who literally died so that we could reap the rewards of the civil rights movement. and unfortunately, while we have benefited from their work, those communities are consistently left behind. some would say this is incredibly unfair and as asian-americans, we owe it to them to not leave them behind. but hey! we're basically enabling white supremacy when we allow white power structures to view non-whiteness as pleasurable or interesting. we also allow them to control the consumption and appropriation of us! it's like we can bring all non-white people down by accepting this bs as a compliment! efficiency!

republicans who called the storming of the capitol going too far, but said the rioters had a point:
jeremy corbyn's mission to hand more power to labour members has received a major boost after the party's ruling body agreed his sweeping reform plans. the leader's plan to 'democratise' the party was approved by the national executive committee (nec) on tuesday, and will now go forward for a vote at the annual conference in brighton. under the changes, party members are set to get three extra seats on the 35-strong body, with an extra place for trade unions too. the move will further embed corbyn's vision for labour and underline its leftward direction since he became leader in 2015, attracting more than 250,000 new members to the party. his reform package, which included a plan to reduce mps' veto over future leadership contenders, was adopted by the nec with no opposition. a wider review of party structures, to be led by former mp katy clark, will now take place with everything from one-member-one-vote leadership rules to regional structures and new policy-making powers. the only reform not on the review list is mandatory reselection of mps.

revelations that tarantino is a piece of shit (not new) doesn't suddenly require you to tell the world how much you have always hated his films (which suck incidentally). — richard whittall (@rwhittall) february 3, 2018
over the course of my life i can see how what i was taught in christian schooling has impacted me, and the riots on jan. 6 played into it. that whole belief system revolves around the idea that you want the rest of the world to think like you, said garman, who is now a social worker. it's a 'the ends justify the means' type of thing.

our average routine shifted from reminding william to brush his teeth to checking his glucose levels, testing his urine for ketones and giving him a dose of medication to regulate his glucose levels after every meal. i watched my child's innocence walk out the door and be replaced with calloused fingers and bruised injection sites.
but despite these rising questions, the classic films ― pulp fiction, kill bill ― seemed untouchable, and disliking them remained taboo. if you've ever told a date, a classmate, a mentor or a friend that you can't watch tarantino because you find his work to be exploitative of women, only to be informed that you simply don't understand his art, the indisputable revelation this month that he's a bona fide creep is, in a small but real way, liberating. it's something solid to cling to, at last, evidence that you're not overreacting or too obtuse to appreciate the aesthetic perfection of his tobacco-spit trajectories. distaste for his work, often cast as a mental flaw or tragic unhipness, has become, in an instant, a mark of discernment.
piercing that fog is the reality that americans are going without the medical supplies and much of the financial help they most need from the government at the very time they need it most — and were told they'd have it.
5. forgive daily: we have all been hurt and betrayed at one time or another. in fact, as long as we are on this earth, there will always be an opportunity and need to forgive. extending forgiveness is not easy, but it is necessary. it is a difficult and sometimes painful process. however, you must find room in your heart to forgive. no, that person does not deserve your forgiveness. yes, they were wrong. but how much more do we deserve to be forgiven by our heavenly father? let us not forget that we are not perfect. we all have fallen short in the eyes of god. by refusing to forgive, we are unintentionally agreeing to keep ourselves enslaved to the past.
in response, youth activists and a new cadre of progressive lawmakers, led largely by the bronx's own rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.), outlined an alternative. the green new deal, a policy framework for the kind of federal industrial policy not seen since world war ii, quickly gained steam. by the time democrats began declaring their bids for president the next year, nearly every major candidate embraced the framework, including the ultimate victor, president-elect joe biden.

a couple months later, at the end of a spectacularly difficult week, stace insisted we take the day off and go for a road trip. she was swamped at work, but she told me i needed a break, and refused to take no for an answer. she packed the car with coffee and fruit and the little bags of popcorn i usually put in the kids' lunches. she drove me to the middle of the state to see the bridge of flowers, a garden bridge suspended like magic above a river.

trump frequently talks about factory workers, and just this week he was in western pennsylvania pledging to fight for them. but in the past year he has delayed implementation of rules designed to protect workers from inhaling toxic substances, including beryllium (a major hazard for steelworkers) and silica dust (a major hazard in construction). the plan, once again, is to scale back the rules in ways that expose many more workers to the hazards.

in may this year, on a saturday evening. i was called to an incident, single crewed, to where a man was reported to be acting weird in a shop in hartlepool. i went inside, got a couple of people out. there was a bloke standing next to the till with a half bottle of wine in his hand, off his head on something. i started talking to him and his first question was 'are you here to kill me?' and then all of a sudden he just went 25,000 feet and climbing and pulled out a rather large kitchen knife. probably about nine inches long, and started waving it around. i got my incapacitant spray out, still tried to talk to him. i shouted at people to get out of the shop, but one didn't. he came towards me with the knife, i backed out and he followed me out, but then went back in and closed the door. the problem was there was a female member of staff still in there and here was somebody armed with a knife. so rather than back off and contain it, i've got to try and go in there and ensure her safety. so i kicked the metal door to knock him off balance. at that point his arm's come round and the knife has gone straight into my forearm. two or three minutes later the cavalry arrived and he ended up being tasered by one of the other lads.

on tuesday night, president obama gave his final speech as sitting president of the united states. it was an emotional farewell, to say the very least.
hundreds of women have sat on a public road in a locality called shaheen bagh in south delhi, demanding lawmakers to repeal the caa, which critics say makes religion the basis of granting indian citizenship. when combined with the national register of citizens (nrc), an exercise to identify people living without documents, critics say, the caa discriminates against indian muslims. women of all ages have sat, sang, spoken and sloganeered, day and night since december, even on nights when the temperature dropped to 2 degrees celsius. they have moved thousands, and, on some days, lakhs of people into making their way to the vibrant protest site in the nation's capital. they have inspired other muslim women to lead the anti-caa protests in cities across the country.

now, documents obtained through the right to information act by srinivas kodali, data and internet governance researcher, and this correspondent suggest quite the opposite: under the guise of creating a secc that automatically updates itself in real time, the national social registry (or the social registry information system or secc social registry as it is also known) will either be a single, searchable aadhaar-seeded database or multiple harmonised and integrated databases that use aadhaar numbers to integrate religion, caste, income, property, education, marital status, employment, disability and family-tree data of every single citizen.
that follows general male attitudes towards health care. a u.s. study found that men were much less likely than women to regularly see doctors, and much more likely to skip suggested appointments. in general, men who have the most traditional, macho views about masculinity are the least likely to get routine check-ups and necessary medical care, according to harvard men's health watch.

at one such rally, while trying to attack prime minister narendra modi over the unemployment crisis in india, rahul gandhi said the youth of this country would start beating him with a stick in six months. gandhi's remark, like his 'chowkidar chor hai' jibe at the pm in the lok sabha election in 2019, failed to resonate and was not well received.

the current closure had only marginal impact on the general public at first, when many people were on vacation for the holidays and government offices were closed anyway. but as the shutdown drags on with no obvious end in sight, americans are growing more aware and more annoyed by the disruption. more than four in 10 americans now consider the partial shutdown a very serious problem, according to a huffpost/yougov poll conducted jan. 4 to 7.

to date, the same oversight republicans who were so willing to attack obama have been silent about trump, silent about bannon's intervention, and silent about ross' false testimony before congress. committee democrats have diligently pursued the issue and made multiple requests for hearings and subpoenas. oversight republicans ignored them and did nothing. that's all about to change.

a 2001 montclair times opinion piece remembering aaliyah's life by jeff harrell similarly places the onus on the young singer for kelly's allegedly criminal behavior. aaliyah's life was not filled with enough sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll to kill a rock god, harrell wrote, referring to the singer's public persona. of course, if the bare midriffs in her videos and lyrics like 'going all the way with an older man' are any indication, there was sex. aaliyah was a mere teenager when she reportedly married her producer, the grammy winner and older man r.kelly.
given the failed federal response to covid-19 so far, that can only mean improvement. on public health, the record is one of unmitigated disaster. where south korea, taiwan, new zealand, singapore and other places swiftly implemented effective measures to avert both mass death and economic calamity, the united states has been an uncoordinated and morally callous disgrace.

he was arrested and in the process he bit three police officers and he's hiv positive. they had to go on the prophylactic drugs for six months. i spoke to one of the officers and he's newly married, trying for a baby and now can't try for a baby for six months. he pleaded guilty and was put away for a year, but he's out now. i saw another crew and they asked me about him because he's pseudo fitting again. and i thought 'oh no'. four years ago, i took a patient to hospital. i turned my back on her and completely unprovoked, she jumped out of her chair and grabbed my hair and started kicking and punching me. clumps of my hair fell out. maybe if there was a change in the law, it would be a deterrent. the doctors and nurses get a lot more abuse than us, because these people are waiting hours in hospital. our time with them is short lived. i've been spat at too. i'd rather take the punches than be spat at. that's the worst thing. you think of the diseases, the tb, the hepatitis, and we are going home to our families, it's just a worry. adam heslop, 28, british transport police, lancashire

this is a picture of me and my family when i was 9. my parents still claim that they had no idea i was gay. they're sweet. jeremy and i are 34. in our lifetime, the gay community has made more progress on legal and social acceptance than any other demographic group in history. as recently as my own adolescence, gay marriage was a distant aspiration, something newspapers still put in scare quotes. now, it's been enshrined in law by the supreme court. public support for gay marriage has climbed from 27 percent in 1996 to 61 percent in 2016. in pop culture, we've gone from cruising to queer eye to moonlight. gay characters these days are so commonplace they're even allowed to have flaws. still, even as we celebrate the scale and speed of this change, the rates of depression, loneliness and substance abuse in the gay community remain stuck in the same place they've been for decades. gay people are now, depending on the study, between 2 and 10 times more likely than straight people to take their own lives. we're twice as likely to have a major depressive episode. and just like the last epidemic we lived through, the trauma appears to be concentrated among men. in a survey of gay men who recently arrived in new york city, three-quarters suffered from anxiety or depression, abused drugs or alcohol or were having risky sex—or some combination of the three.

for one, ocasio-cortez did not propose taking 70 percent of anyone's income. in an interview with 60 minutes, the 29-year-old suggested applying this marginal rate only to earnings amounting to more than $10 million. this means that those impacted would pay a much lower share of their income overall and the average tax rate for working americans could potentially go down under her idea.

just like we do not recommend that women avoid getting pregnant each year during flu season, we are not recommending that women do not get pregnant due to the coronavirus disease, she continued. women who are pregnant or trying to get pregnant should take precautions to avoid getting sick, like staying away from others who are known to be ill and washing their hands frequently.
scientists suspect the virus that has killed more than 1.9 million people since late 2019 jumped to humans from bats or other animals, most likely in china's southwest. the ruling communist party, stung by complaints it allowed the disease to spread, says the virus came from abroad, possibly on imported seafood, but international scientists reject that.

trump and his allies say those numbers don't matter, because the tax cut will mean higher wages and more jobs ― both of which will benefit american workers. and lately trump has been touting news of one-time bonuses that companies are offering, supposedly because of the tax cut, as vindication of the gop argument.
the shutdown, which began dec. 22, was technically the third to take place in 2018, although the first lasted a mere three days, and the second lasted just a few hours and did not result in any furloughs. there have been 21 similar funding lapses since 1976, but only a handful of major shutdowns in which workers went without pay. until now, the longest one had been a 21-day shutdown starting in december 1995, amid a deadlock between then-president bill clinton and congressional republicans.

i think it's about both sides failing to progress the issue beyond a top heavy approach. for the longest time in the post cold war-era, the relationship has largely been dependent on the political chemistry between the two heads of state, whether it is a bush and manmohan, who enjoyed working together, or obama and manmohan, where obama revered manmohan singh's advice on macroeconomics even when it came to the eurozone crisis. there is a lot of personality driven partnership and camaraderie there. the same for modi and obama and modi and trump as it was for clinton and vajpayee.

at least three states passed laws putting new criminal penalties on protests against fossil fuel infrastructure in just the past two weeks amid the chaos of the coronavirus pandemic. first came kentucky. on march 16, gov. andy beshear (d) signed legislation that ― while removing some of the original bill's most draconian measures on protest ― designated natural gas or petroleum pipelines as key infrastructure assets and made causing damage that totals more than $1,000 or tampering in a manner that renders the operations harmful or dangerous felony charges of criminal mischief in the first degree. two days later, it was south dakota. on march 18, gov. kristi noem (r) signed a bill that expanded the definition of critical infrastructure to include virtually any oil, gas or utility equipment, and raised the charges for causing substantial interruption or impairment of such facilities to felonies. five days later, on march 23, the governor approved a second measure defining a felony riot as intentional use of force or violence by three or more persons that causes any damage to property. on wednesday, west virginia followed suit. gov. jim justice (r) greenlighted legislation assigning the same critical infrastructure status to a wide range of oil, gas and pipeline facilities, slapping fines as high as $20,000 on anyone found guilty of causing damage, destruction, vandalization, defacing or tampering that totals $2,500 or more.

alex, a fitness instructor in seattle, was told by a guy on his swim team, i'll ignore your face if you fuck me without a condom. martin, a brit living in portland, has gained maybe 10 pounds since he moved there and got a grindr message—on christmas day—that said: you used to be so sexy. it's a shame you messed it up. for other minority groups, living in a community with people like them is linked to lower rates of anxiety and depression. it helps to be close to people who instinctively understand you. but for us, the effect is the opposite. several studies have found that living in gay neighborhoods predicts higher rates of risky sex and meth use and less time spent on other community activities like volunteering or playing sports. a 2009 study suggested that gay men who were more linked to the gay community were less satisfied with their own romantic relationships. gay and bisexual men talk about the gay community as a significant source of stress in their lives, pachankis says. the fundamental reason for this, he says, is that in-group discrimination does more harm to your psyche than getting rejected by members of the majority. it's easy to ignore, roll your eyes and put a middle finger up to straight people who don't like you because, whatever, you don't need their approval anyway. rejection from other gay people, though, feels like losing your only way of making friends and finding love.

later that month, with trump's backing and bipartisan support, the house passed a bill to increase those direct payments to $2,000. but senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) repeatedly blocked that bill from passing despite support from both democratic and republican senators. he dubbed the effort socialism for rich people because it would have sent checks to some higher earners.

the committees want the government to rule out any changes to legislation that would undermine the national minimum and living wage, as well as end loopholes which allow agency workers to be paid less than permanent staff. they also want companies to either guarantee workers a set number of hours each week, or compensate them for uncertainty. rachel reeves, chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy committee, said: uber, deliveroo and others like to bang the drum for the benefits of flexibility for their workforce but currently all the burden of this flexibility is picked up by taxpayers and workers. this must change. we say that companies should pay higher wages when they are asking people to work extra hours or on zero-hours contracts. recent cases demonstrate a need for greater clarity in the law to protect workers. responsible businesses deserve a level-playing field to compete, not a system which rewards unscrupulous businesses. we need new laws but also much tougher enforcement, to weed out those businesses seeking to exploit complex labour laws, and workers, for their competitive advantage.

committing to remove some of the centuries of carbon emissions that countries such as the u.s., united kingdom and france have produced since the dawn of the industrial revolution could prove a powerful tool in global climate negotiations. developing nations such as china, india and vietnam, whose emissions make up the bulk of those that could push the world over its climate threshold, have complained it's unfair to demand they sacrifice fossil-fueled economic growth that lifts their populations out of poverty at the behest of countries that grew wealthy exploiting coal and colonizing their ancestors.
the question was on the tip of my tongue as i watched the very talented stars awkwardly rattle off jokes side-by-side sunday evening. maybe it was their lack of chemistry. former emmys host samberg is a natural funnyman, kicked into gear by live tv king lorne michaels. oh's humor is a little drier, sharper; a bit of cristina yang bled through her carefully timed delivery. separately, their demeanors are fantastic. forced together, one host always seemed to be chasing the other's lead.

my parents were very hands-off throughout the wedding planning process. they didn't ask for much, but they didn't need to. i had been to enough family weddings to know what was expected of me: a tea ceremony, a red qipao and a father giving away his daughter. i also knew that this wedding would be a reflection of my parents, and i had to give them something to be proud of, to honor them and to recognize their sacrifices.

lawmakers vowed to investigate the stunning breach of security, which occurred as they prepared to certify president-elect joe biden's electoral college victory over trump.
trump induces visceral reactions in many, but the causes for rage extend beyond him, and even beyond the damage his administration is actively doing. there are preconditions that allowed him to rise, that allowed the republican party to lie supine before him and to embrace him so fully. there is a sickness in this country that allowed this carbuncular president to swell to the surface, and it calls for more than the democrats' signature bloodless, incremental technocracy to fix.

this guaranteed a large round of unnecessary layoffs for teachers, firefighters and other public servants. but it also encouraged disastrous pandemic policies. in order to boost tax revenue to balance state budgets, governors encouraged reckless reopening strategies, hoping to get money to local businesses that would make their way to state coffers. the results for state budgets were disappointing, but more importantly, they encouraged the spread of a deadly virus.
how it works: an individual retirement account, or ira, is a type of tax-advantaged retirement savings account. it's similar to a 401(k) except you don't have to open one through your employer. it's common for people to change employers frequently, and the great thing about an ira is that it's employer-independent, said lyn alden, the founder of lyn alden investment strategy. you can keep the same account open and keep contributing to it year after year, regardless of who you work for.

say you're arguing with your s.o. about how you deal with your parents, negendank said. you might say something like, 'i feel frustrated when you criticize how i am handling things with my parents because it seems like you don't trust me to make the right decisions for myself. i would like you to be supportive of me and only give me your input when i ask for it. i know you care about what is best for me, but when it comes out as criticism it just hurts me.'

you would be forgiven for thinking that brand experiences have their work cut out in a world that seems obsessed with 'frictionless' experiences. but in fact, the most memorable real-world experiences have a little bit of friction built in. airbnb for example took the conscious decision to design in a little friction. they removed their role in managing any issues between hosts and guests. counter-intuitively this direct connection of guests and hosts deepened satisfaction scores across both. similarly, brands like amazon recognise they have a problem with this because interactions with them are so fluid that people aren't actually engaging with the brand. amazon themselves say they need to build in more of a human touch.

one example is the case of economic standstill in terms of growth. i have come to the realization that serious and deep innovative thinking in economic policy is needed to overcome the period of slow growth, as coined by willem buiter, chief economist of citigroup global. i believe the traditional ways of handling economic policy need to be revised. simply because, the known developed-world has been saturated and new ideas do not easily reach the decision-making top, thus there is greater rigidity to change. this is a rather oxymoron phenomenon, as the developed world gives the impression of being open and welcoming to new ideas...

the bad news is piling up at a time when central valley farmers (egged on by the trump administration) are already fighting with state managers for larger annual allocations of snowmelt, at least some of which has to flow into the sacramento–san joaquin river delta and to the pacific. according to the water education foundation, 80 percent of the state's commercial fishery species live in or migrate through the delta, and at least half of its pacific flyway migratory water birds rely on the region's wetlands. its ecosystem already teeters near collapse, driven in part by relentless shunting of water to farm interests in the central valley.

i contacted success coach michael neill for his insight on how to overcome the feeling of being stuck, and he provided me with some insight on the matter: the only thing that can truly get stuck is your thinking. life is continually changing and flowing, and our businesses and careers change and flow with it. but from time to time we get stuck in a certain mindset or idea of how things should be (as opposed to how they are), and if we start to take it too much to heart, it can bring us out of the creative flow and make it look like we need to make a major life change to get things moving again.

when your partner is starting to feel like a 'best friend' that you want to gossip on the couch with after a long day at work instead of connecting in a sensual and intimate way, it's time to create some space for being lovers and bring erotic energy into your connection together. flirt, make eye contact, use body language to feel sexy and sensual. move your body and be intentional about turning your partner on. instead of turning to your partner and saying, 'do you want to have sex?' at the end of the night, work on creating anticipation, hints outside of the bedroom, texting and communication that show you are interested in being connected and intimate together. ― chavez

what i've realized this year — and what i knew in my heart that i've had to practice much more literally — is that what people think of this movie is none of my business and completely their right, fennell told me. there was a version of this movie that could have been made that would have been a lot less likely to have think pieces, and that would have, i hope, been good, too. but that's not what we wanted to make at all.

by 2050, the study found, a direct air capture program expanded with that kind of money could remove 2 to 2.5 gigatons of co₂ per year. estimates from the u.n. intergovernmental panel on climate change, the leading global climate forecasting body, vary on how much co₂ needs to be removed from the atmosphere annually to keep warming in check, but most models suggest a figure close to 6 gigatons per year by midcentury. the rest would need to be made up with newly planted forests and styles of soil cultivation that trap carbon underground. (there is some debate among carbon removal researchers about whether that much will, in fact, be necessary.)

as plant-based becomes an even more popular term, margarine ― or something like it, as margarine is allowed to have small amounts of dairy ― has been making a comeback. mass-market brands like country crock and land o'lakes have joined the fray with their versions of vegan butter in addition to those made by burgeoning brands such as miyoko's and forager project and alternative mainstays like earth balance and its sister brand smart balance. but is it butter, when the very definition of butter means it must legally be made with a minimum of 80% milkfat, as defined by the butter act of 1886? the answer is a firm no on that count, making plant-based butter not necessarily a health halo, but a marketing lie for sure.

queens officials, including constantinides, have long blamed the plants for the two neighborhoods' high levels of asthma, which earned one part of northern astoria the nickname asthma alley. in 2017, the city council passed legislation requiring the utility operators to stop using no. 6 fuel oil by 2020 and no. 4 oil by 2030. the new bill would be the first to lay the groundwork for phasing out the plants altogether.

numerous officers who were dispatched to defend the capitol were also caught on camera shaking rioters' hands, posing with them for selfies and passively allowing them to bypass police barriers and launch their assault, which was inspired by trump's relentless, evidence-free claims that the election was stolen from him through mass voter fraud. the cops' seemingly friendly demeanor harshly contrasts the brutal force with which american police descended upon racial justice protesters nationwide following the killing of george floyd.

all criticism in a relationship is painful. complaints that include specific request for change, can make a relationship better. criticism does not. inevitably criticism makes the relationship worse. we all know this. yet, many of us, myself included, are guilty of being critical of our partners.
when this degree of fluidity and flexibility is present in the relationship and embodied by each partner, the set point and tolerance level will actually change and rise to a higher level as a result of the feeling of trust, support, and mutual understanding that has grown through the process of reciprocal appreciation of differences.

india is trying to get a totalisation agreement on people who have h1-bs. a totalisation agreement is how do you square the circle on social security and taxes when you have individuals who split their time between the us and india. that is the next step on to the axiom that indians are going to continue to dominate h1b visas. but immigration being such a hotbed issue and at the core of trump's 2016 campaign, and possibly once again in the 2020 campaign, i don't think anyone wants to sort out the h1b visa, right now. it's going to be on the back-burner.

when writing the story of your life don't allow anyone else to hold the pen ... an easy to understand concept but hard to follow rule. wouldn't you agree ... especially since so many people on a daily basis influence our decision making processes and what we do with our lives. tale for example, the people you work with - they dress and speak a certain way and you also over time will begin to speak and dress like them. you will also probably begin engaging in activities outside of work together and eventually you become like the people you hang around most - it's call the law of attraction. that is why i am suggesting that we honestly make our own goals and stick to them - no matter what anyone else says and does to try and get us off track. i also recommend doing whatever it takes to make your dreams a reality and don't allow critics to dampen your light. and lastly, tell your story in a honest, humble and vulnerable way so others can know your struggles and how you overcame them to change your life like i did when i grew through pain to teach others never to give up on themselves and instill belief where it used to be nonexistent. how are you going to take control of yourself and live your journey and no one else's.

in retrospect, support for the affordable care act when it was newly enacted looks downright robust. when president barack obama's health care law passed in march 2010, it faced similar levels of opposition, but considerably higher levels of favor: on average, about 42 percent of americans supported it. yet even those comparatively rosy numbers were enough to leave democrats ducking furious constituents and, according to some research, helped doom the party to a historic midterm election defeat later that year.

the first is an emotionally unavailable partner. when kris continues to ignore susan's complaint about him leaving his shoes and socks in the living room, she is likely to start escalating the issue by criticizing him in hopes to get a reaction. she may start calling him a slob and irresponsible instead of kindly reminding him to put his shoes in the closet. the shift from complaints to criticism is understandable, but unhelpful since the criticism makes kris less responsive.

corey was a follower. corey would go along with anything anyone in the family — our group — would say, darold brown, a member of the new jersey group, said in a 2011 affidavit. if, hypothetically, you would say to corey, 'let's rob a bank,' corey would be there with you. he wouldn't analyze whether it was a good idea. corey's view was that he'd do anything for the people he considered his family.

it's not the only strain being closely watched. in december, health officials identified another variant of sars-cov-2 circulating in south africa (official name 501y.v2). like the uk strain, it appears to be more contagious but does not necessarily appear to make people sicker.
dormitzer said if the virus eventually mutates enough that the vaccine needs adjusting – much like flu shots are adjusted most years – that tweaking the recipe wouldn't be difficult for his company's shot and similar ones. the vaccine is made with a piece of the virus genetic code, simple to switch, although it's not clear what kind of additional testing regulators would require to make such a change.

i was too young when my parents divorced to get the concept of marriage before it was gone. my ideas about marriage, therefore, came from watching my grandparents. their lives together seemed effortless and comfortable like a locomotive on a schedule that always made it on time. my parents' lives seemed laborious in comparison with a never-ending track change.

the only way we're going to restore the trust and rebuild that relationship with voters … is actually go and talk to everyday ontarians in their neighbourhoods, in their communities and hear about their concerns.
under trump, the state department has reduced the red tape in terms of increasing the relevance of dcs track. the gains of that were witnessed in the year after trump took office when americans hit their highest peak at 55.66 billion dollars because of these actions. it is a priority for the trump administration to sell more and india emerges as a natural partner. india, after saudi arabia, is the largest importer for arms. why wouldn't they want to tap into this rising economy that is increasingly going to have enough economic heft to spend as much on its defence?

this time, the letters in the sign were altered by hanging tarps over the original two o's ― similar to the way the sign was changed back on jan. 1, 1976, when a cal state northridge student draped curtains over the letters to herald the state's newly relaxed marijuana laws.

during the reconstruction era, a period lasting about a decade after the civil war until 1877, biracial governments came to power in cities across the south. still reeling from defeat of the confederacy, southern democrats often retaliated against this new power structure. on nov. 10, 1898, a mob of white men marched on city hall in wilmington with their pistols and rifles to overthrow the local government and remove black and white political leaders from their posts. they were successful. white supremacists took over. the mob destroyed black-owned businesses, including the town's black newspaper. dozens of black residents ended up dead.

a 2013 supreme court ruling, shelby county v. holder, notably struck down a key section of the voting rights act by allowing states ― particularly jurisdictions with a history of discriminatory practices ― to change their election laws without pre-clearance from the federal government. activists and elected officials have long decried the ruling as enabling voter suppression.
i wish i had a solution, but i truly think that the more we start sharing these stories and listening to and making space for more marginalized groups within the community, the more change we can begin to create.
spending time under belichick will be seen as an overwhelming positive, for the most part. mcdaniels also brings a proven offensive background, which should appeal to a 35-year-old manning. (mcdaniels is just 39 himself.) heck, he might even consider keeping ben mcadoo around as manning's offensive coordinator—that pairing has found great success together.
you want to make sure that the lube you're using is right for your body, so it's important to check the list of ingredients — some could be more harmful than helpful. alcohols (almost anything that ends with -ol) can become drying and irritating over time, and certain sugars and glycerins might make you prone to infections, ingber said.
this lawsuit acknowledges what lt. wildhaber survived in the police department and lets us move forward as a county, county executive sam page said on monday. i think it's important to recognize that this sends a message to everyone in county government and to all of our employers in the st. louis region, that discrimination will not be tolerated.
the magazine largely treated feminist critiques of the issue with similar mockery and disdain. in that same 1989 piece, si reporter frank deford argued that today ... some zealots paint anything sensual with the broad brush of sexism, before using a purported increase in breast augmentation surgeries to prove that if the swimsuit issue became a relic or disappeared altogether, it would only be because women had parroted its aesthetic.

the level of processing is high and the list of ingredients is long. a lot of additives are required to enhance the meat-like qualities of alternatives like those made by beyond meat and impossible foods (because plants can't naturally bleed, per se) and although they may not be overtly harmful, they're not helpful to the nutritional profile, either. in fact, beyond and impossible burgers have comparable saturated fat levels to beef: beyond has 6 grams, impossible 8 grams and beef 7.6 grams. meanwhile, studies have shown a link between eating more processed foods and a higher risk of mortality for middle-aged folks, as well as higher risks for obesity and high cholesterol.

the state's emergency alert protocol has been under scrutiny since the october wildfire disaster in northern california, which left more than 40 people dead. officials in sonoma county — where over half of the fatalities occurred — had decided not to deploy the federal wireless emergency alert system, and some survivors of the 21 blazes later said they were inadequately warned.
in march, trump signed a republican bill rescinding the fair pay and safe workplaces act, an obama-era law that required federal contractors to disclose and then address violations of labor law and worker safety regulations. in august, the trump administration announced it was postponing implementation of the so-called fiduciary rule ― another obama-era legacy ― that requires investment managers to act in the best interests of their clients. it's widely understood that the administration is merely buying time for a more formal rewrite or outright repeal of the regulation.

the idea is similar. identify the times in your life - and in the last week - when you feel you've been particularly productive, achieving more of value to yourself and other people in a few minutes than in many hours of lesser work. what were the common denominators? for achievement islands, you may find it is a few types of activity. yet you may also find it is working with a particular person or people, in a specific place, or at a particular time that is predictable and repetitive. try it now.
at first we were going to call out the magazine publicly, but then we decided to try to solve the problem instead of just expose it. we decided to create a tool that would make the volume of talented women illustrators from all different background out there undeniable. we wanted to make it as easy as possible for magazines, newspapers, advertising agencies and publishers to hire women, and encourage them to hire women of color and queer women and other groups of women they might not otherwise feel they have connections to.

it would send a message that companies can come to canada and spend hundreds of millions of dollars, and years — a decade in this case — walking through a regulatory process in a country that is supposed to represent the rule of law, and then an arbitrary political decision at the end of the process, without any transparency, can suddenly scuttle all of that? he said.

revenge isn't nice. the stuff that she's been through isn't nice. there's a reason that she has been doing something, i suppose, in a recreational way, in an impersonal way. she knows that if she gets close to the real thing, she can't trust herself. it's fucking dark and it's going to get darker. and so as an audience member, what do you do? this is what's exciting about revenge as a genre. you want it, but when you get it, it's not quite what you wanted. and then that's interesting because then we're all complicit, because what do we want? do we want her to kill them? but again, she doesn't do anything. that's what's so frightening and powerful about her. she doesn't do anything to alison. she doesn't do anything to dean walker's daughter.

the thing i found especially valuable was that it made workers think about what they actually do, and what the most important parts of the job are. jarrod haar, professor of human resources management
after the sweeping reagan-era federal tax overhaul in 1986, many states that tied their state income taxes to the federal code changed their laws in 1987, in some cases due to a similar windfall or to align their tax brackets with the federal code. and just like federal tax laws, state codes have changed incrementally over the past three decades, so that neither resemble what they looked like in 1986. but sweeping tax overhauls in the states have been rare since then.

indeed, no woman should fear being harassed (or worse) for the way she presents herself. but in the world of the swimsuit issue, the answer to a very real problem ― that women, no matter how they present themselves, do have to worry about being harassed, belittled, overlooked and assaulted ― is to photograph scantily clad, mostly white, almost exclusively thin women and sell those images to hordes of straight men. the 2016 nod to body positivity was to put plus-size model ashley graham on one of three covers. the 2017 nod to sex positivity was a sexy photo of model nina agdal, wearing bikini bottoms and a very cropped tank top which read a woman doesn't have to be modest to be respected. the 2018 nod to an international reckoning is to give a woman the camera and her subjects four to 10 phrases.
once you've pinpointed what's really motivating your anger, you'll gain insight into your needs that haven't been met: maybe you snapped at a co-worker for asking a simple question, not because you think they're incompetent, but because you're generally feeling overwhelmed with your own work.

one of the best ways to pay down your student loan debt fast is by making more than the minimum payments. of course, just pay more isn't realistic advice for most people. but hear me out on this one: even a few one-off extra payments can have a significant impact on your student loan balance.
we had been spending a lot of time together anyway. we were going out to dinner on our nights without the kids, attending concerts that started too late for my bedtime, calling each other at 3 a.m. after mediocre dates when the pain of our dissolving lives felt too much to bear alone. when she moved in our friendship became quieter. we cooked dinner, watched television, came to know the names of each other's co-workers and employees. when my son's pet mouse escaped in his room, stace and i both jammed ourselves into the cramped space below the bed while my children yelled directions from the doorway.
similarly, the entry of elizabeth warren into the 2020 presidential primaries ― like bernie sanders' effort in 2016 ― moves in the direction of politically mobilizing the increasingly broad social disaffection with capitalism. time will tell whether u.s. conditions make that direction sustainable within a changed democratic party or only outside it.

in addition to the green new deal, candidates must stress that their opponents' inaction on environmental issues hurts american workers and their communities. florida's former gov. rick scott won a senate seat this fall even though his gutting of florida's water management budget by hundreds of millions of dollars likely created the conditions for the unprecedented red tide event that cost florida's tourism economy over $90 million in one summer. his opponent, then-sen. bill nelson, hardly mentioned that scott's recklessness and complete disregard for florida's environment and waterways was a direct blow to small businesses, fisherman and millions of floridians whose livelihoods depend on the health of the ocean. meanwhile, evidence shows that 30-year congressman dana rohrabacher's notorious denial of climate issues potentially cost him his seat in california's 48th congressional district this fall after he routinely ignored the issues plaguing his constituents ― including rampant flooding in orange county's balboa island that has resulted from sea-level rise.
there are other kinds of rage, though, and other uses for it. anger is loaded with information and energy, wrote audre lorde in a 1981 address titled the uses of anger. i have suckled the wolf's lip of anger and i have used it for illumination, laughter, protection, fire in places where there was no light, no food, no sisters, no quarter.

there were the christian flags, like the ones she used to pledge allegiance to in school, waving alongside american flags. the rioters' rhetoric, focused around saving the country, defeating enemies and promoting the will of god, could have come straight out of one of her childhood classrooms, where she said she was taught a distorted version of history with nods to white christian supremacy. last week's insurrectionists could have been her classmates, her teachers, her pastors. she felt a wave of recognition as she watched the pictures on social media.

recall, trump recklessly pulled the u.s. out of trade deals and diplomatic agreements; started a futile and costly trade war with china; and alienated global trading partners. and, of course, he failed to control a public health disaster that's led to the deaths of more than 360,000 americans, increased hunger and poverty, and destroyed untold numbers of businesses. the white house's draconian immigration crackdown, meanwhile, discouraged people who might have come to the u.s. to start a company or further their education from emigrating here. just this week, there was another embarrassment involving chinese companies and the new york stock exchange.

sparks: the soups we deliver to our folks are of the quality of the underground kitchen. there's nothing different than what we'd serve at one of our events. the quality of ingredients is the same organic, beautiful ingredients. we had to scale back a little bit because we found out a lot soups don't fit everybody's tastes. we got a little more basic with it. but we would not do this unless we could do it under the same pretenses we do the underground kitchen. quite frankly, [our cost to make it] may be a little bit more for the quality that we do, but it's not much more than what a food pantry might put out — and it's not filled with chemicals.
each participant was seated in a quiet room and asked to keep one hand on a computer mouse and the other on a small box that occasionally vibrated silently. the participants were instructed to click on the mouse when the box vibrated, when they heard a sound from the speakers in front of them or when both things happened at once. the stimulations were done 180 times each.

food companies spent $11 billion on television ads in 2017, and 80 percent of that, about $8.8 billion, was spent on their unhealthiest offerings ― sugary soda, fast food, candy and unhealthy snacks. what's more, black teens are more than twice as likely as white teens to see commercials for these items, the study found.

enfin, concernant la consommation, seuls 22% des français envisagent de privilégier l'achat en ligne pour éviter les magasins. 14% seulement disent réfléchir à faire des réserves de nourriture face au coronavirus. la preuve ici aussi que les français semblent bien avoir identifié les consignes répétées par les autorités et les médias: pas besoin de faire de stock, aucune pénurie n'est à prévoir pour le moment. reste à voir si les sondés font bien ce qu'ils disent.

in speaking with some of our clients this morning, all of them wondered whether usag will change the position they have taken in court that usag had no duty to warn its member gymnasts even though they knew larry nassar was a molester, he said. until that happens, this move is simply a public relations ploy to save a sinking ship of an organization.
breck is just 21 months old, but he's already been on skis.
the former would signal an egregious miscalculation. the latter puts a lot of faith in a 56-year-old longtime offensive coordinator, whose last head coaching experience came at arizona state (2001-06). should the buccaneers do move koetter up the ladder, it's a calculated gamble. if it doesn't work out, they'll have tossed smith aside for nothing and likely will be back in a similar spot two or three years from now.
it was just over a year ago that president trump declared that haiti, el salvador and africa were shithole countries and that the u.s. should get more people from countries like norway.

so ocasio-cortez, far from showing her craziness, is fully in line with serious economic research, krugman added. republican policy to keep taxes on the wealthy low, on the other hand, rests on research by … well, nobody, he added.
the turnaround was a swift lesson as the white house's wishes run into the reality of the senate. the white house wanted a session crammed into a shorter period to both expedite the trial and shift more of the proceedings into late night, according to a person familiar with the matter but unauthorized to discuss it in public.

nevada is also shaping up to be somewhat of a comeback for biden. after disappointing showings in iowa and new hampshire, where he came in fourth and fifth respectively, biden said his strength would show through when communities of color began casting their votes.
that's why i have a little rule called no phones at the table. it means just what it says. my husband and i are not allowed to have our phones at the table when we're having a meal. this way we can pay attention to each other and have real conversations. crazy, i know. but, it works.
whether it carries any weight, i don't know.
it sort of goes against conventional wisdom to hire an offensive-minded coach when a team's defense is a major issue, but getting the offense humming consistently would fix a lot of what ails cleveland. gase could round out the staff with a heavy defensive influence.
et quand bien même, il suffit de peu pour créer une rupture de stock, comme on a pu le voir en australie où les supermarchés ont été obligés de rationner le papier toilette. une pénurie qui est en partie liée au produit (difficile à stocker), mais surtout à une logique pas si irrationnelle: face à quelques étalages un peu délaissés, il est assez logique de tenir le raisonnement suivant, explique l'économiste australien justin wolfers sur twitter:
the mystery hit me when i was at home one day overanalyzing my face in the mirror and deciding that i looked good enough for a selfie. i probably took about 25 photos and i hated almost every single one. all of a sudden, my nose seemed to be 10 times more crooked than normal, and it was all i could focus on. but i still looked fine in the mirror, which left me wondering why my face didn't quite translate into my phone.

this life is not new to millions of mixed-culture asians growing up across the globe. a quick scouring of subtle asian traits, a popular facebook group for relatable posts on asian culture, yields tons of stories related to asian parenting. many of us have carried this burden with us well into adulthood: we must make our parents proud, we must provide for our families, and most importantly, we cannot fail because they sacrificed so much.
i saw three speakers. one was a young muslim man from jnu (jawaharlal nehru university), who was very outspoken. there was lawyer from patna and there was a muslim woman community leader. i had never seen such an islamised way of talking in india. the way that mubarak was being offered to these women was very openly muslim. i think a lot of muslims in india have realised that it is now or never to create a space where you can be a citizen and not be apologetic about being a muslim citizen. i think the shaheen bagh movement feeds into that. there is an emerging islamophobia which makes it hard for muslims to be heard. this is a moment where muslim hopefully can confront those issues of islamophobia while standing as muslim citizens of india. i see people calling out islamophobia without having to apologise for being muslim.
january 1, 2016 marks the three year anniversary of the day i began making a micro grant, every single day of the year, to social changemakers around the globe. since then, a community of givers, myself included, have joined with the pollination project to make 1317 grants in 60 countries. in the past few weeks, we've made grants to small social change initiatives all over the world. from ajman thrower's oakland-based social change marketing firm that employs and uplifts low income youth of color; to a rooftop garden in green bay wisconsin that supports youth in foster care; these community leaders are finding ways to create resilience in their own backyards.
for me, there are only seven common themes, and they relate to particular friends and activities. walking and talking aloud, thinking about a particular issue, with a friend, accompanied by my dog. playing social tennis. alone, reading and thinking in the sun. playing games such as perudo, the peruvian lie dice game, preferably outdoors at a café or in the sun. having a picnic with friends in the sun, surrounded by natural beauty. writing a book. and - gambling, not online, with friends, at a racetrack. what's the common denominator? the one thing common to all of these, with one exception, is that they are outdoors; and five of the seven are with friends, whom i can easily identify.

the ruling body also backed moves to reshape the annual conference to give more debate time for the rank and file, and less for shadow cabinet ministers. as reported by huffpost uk, neither london mayor sadiq khan nor greater manchester mayor andy burnham will have speaking slots on the platform in brighton. the nec was until this summer finely balanced between pro-corbyn and 'moderate' wings of the party, but it is now set to shift much more in his favour. under a 'compromise' plan first revealed by huffpost uk this month, the proportion of mps and meps needed for a leadership bid would be reduced from the current 15% threshold to 10%. the change in rules - first proposed by the tssa transport union - all but guarantees that corbyn's successor will be from the left, as it lowers the bar for the parliamentary labour party's (plp) veto on candidates. at present, 42 parliamentarians are needed for any new leadership candidate, but if the change gets the go ahead, just 28 nominations will be required. once meps are abolished after brexit in 2019, just 26 mps' nominations will be needed.

tedros adhanom ghebreyesus, who heads the un agency, said the world health organisation (who) is deeply concerned by the alarming levels of spread and severity of the outbreak. he also expressed concern about the alarming levels of inaction and appealed to affected countries to detect, test, treat, isolate, trace and mobilise to prevent the covid-19 outbreak worsening. we cannot say this loudly enough or clearly enough or often enough: all countries can still change the course of this pandemic, he told a briefing in geneva.
so, let's take a leaf out of their successes, and figure out where our genius gene hides deep inside ourselves.
as innovators, we try to think out of the box, to change the way everyone is accustom to do things. finding ways to save time and money for companies eventually will make accessibility a commodity that even mom and pop websites will be able to have for few dollars. this is why we will have to learn and we do every day, from the market, from our clients, their clients as well educate us. our goals are to assure that accessibility will be pushed to the front of the stage, instead of staying invisible, as it is today. amihai miron, ceo of user1st
you have suicides over things like this, when you have terrible economies, he said, adding that the cure has been very tough.
a spokesperson for the national rifle association quickly denounced the proposal, calling it an effort to score political points and arguing that so-called universal background checks will never be universal because criminals do not comply with the law. if the past few decades are any indication, nra opposition to the bill may doom its chances among many republicans.

because there is no public support for a federal european union, many have envisaged alternative ways to fix the euro. the ceo of the european stability mechanism (esm) klaus regling has proposed that euro could be saved by a combination of the banking and capital market union and a rainy day fund. this fund would allegedly be used when asymmetric shocks occur. the fund would be financed jointly by all euro countries. however, because of the persistent differences in competitiveness, its transfers would become permanent, like in the us. only the most competitive members of the eurozone would have sufficient income to finance the fund. any financing through the european central bank (ecb), would need to be covered by european tax-payers later, when it would become evident that weaker countries are unable to pay back their loans and when seigniorage revenues would be unable to cover the losses of the ecb.
loeffler was also seen as more vulnerable than perdue, having survived a bruising november election in which she battled rep. doug collins (r-ga.). the race was an open election, meaning candidates of all parties ran together. while loeffler and collins battled for largely the same voters, warnock emerged relatively unscathed and consolidated the democratic vote.

(a methodology sidenote: the new post/abc and cnn/ssrs polls are also notable for being the first of this shutdown to be conducted using traditional live-interviewer phone calls, rather than cheaper methods such as online surveys. that fact highlights how much the face of political polling has changed since the 1995 shutdown, when pollsters like gallup were conducting multiple surveys a week on the political ramifications of the government's closure. gallup, under new leadership, recently announced it would discontinue almost all 'spot' polls in the u.s. — overnight polls, usually political, of immediate front-page interest.)

pod after pod of spouting whales, the great ones together with the lesser kinds, surge through waters everywhere aripple with living tides of fishes. wheeling multitudes of gannets, kittiwakes, and other such becloud the sky. the stony finger marking the end of the long beach below me is clustered with resting seals. the beach itself flickers with a restless drift of shorebirds. in the bight of the bay, whose bottom is a metropolis of clams, mussels, and lobsters, a concourse of massive heads emerges amongst floating islands of eider ducks. scimitar tusks gleam like a lambent flame.... the vision fails.

the women in our family carry the load when it comes to housework and elder care. we are not the only family entrenched in this division of labor. it is estimated that 66% of informal caregivers are female. also, female caregivers spend as much as 50% more time providing care than male caregivers. there are only grandsons in my family, and this heightens the tension over how to manage mom's care.

sandra: yes. many of our clients have lived in the city or currently live in nyc. there's a refined element there. the look tends to be rooted in a more traditional point of view. it's not as casual and laid-back as i think of the west coast. scale is also very different as east coast spaces tend to be smaller, both due to the value of real estate and the age of the homes. of course, our suburban clients often have larger scale to play with.

hall outlined several new initiatives, including better training for police officers and staff led by outside consultants and a new community outreach program aimed at teaching young people how to recognize and deal with sexual abuse. in november, the department began combing through criminal sexual conduct reports from 2000 to 2018, searching for other mistakes. hall said they have not found any yet.
researchers say this kind of training, deliberately trying to appear more masculine and taking on a different sex role, is just one of the ways gay men pressure each other to attain sexual capital, the equivalent of going to the gym or plucking our eyebrows. the only reason i started working out was so i would seem like a feasible top, martin says. when he first came out, he was convinced that he was too skinny, too effeminate, that bottoms would think he was one of them. so i started faking all this hyper-masculine behavior. my boyfriend noticed recently that i still lower my voice an octave whenever i order drinks. that's a remnant of my first few years out of the closet, when i thought i had to speak in this christian bale batman voice to get dates. grant, a 21-year-old who grew up on long island and now lives in hell's kitchen, says he used to be self-conscious about the way he stood—hands on hips, one leg slightly cocked like a rockette. so, his sophomore year, he started watching his male teachers for their default positions, deliberately standing with his feet wide, his arms at his sides. these masculinity norms exert a toll on everyone, even their perpetrators. feminine gay men are at higher risk of suicide, loneliness and mental illness. masculine gay men, for their part, are more anxious, have more risky sex and use drugs and tobacco with greater frequency.

this is the united states today: president donald trump, who has espoused racist rhetoric since he first announced his candidacy in 2015, lost his reelection after historic turnout and voter mobilization efforts. his refusal to accept the results of a fair and free election, as well as his spread of lies and conspiracy theories about election fraud, emboldened his base to besiege the u.s. capitol building, riot on its steps, fire bullets in its halls and terrorize elected officials.
as the coronavirus changes and travels across the globe, it's getting more and more difficult to isolate countries that are more specifically affected, hajdu said.
some countries like the united states have also been litigating when ict is not accessible for everyone. someone recently asked me a question during #axschat; do you think the us could have made progress without legislation and litigation? my answer was no. i wish that it could have been a different answer but the us made little progress with disability inclusion and accessibility until we legislated it and began to use our legal system to litigate. these legislative and ligation efforts helped other countries because as the us demanded accessibility and inclusion through our legal channels products became more accessible globally. should other countries follow this path? i think each country should decide the best path for their citizens but we must do a better job including persons with disabilities in every aspect of society.

bolton's pronouncements were the first public confirmation from the administration that the pace of the drawdown had changed since trump's announcement in mid-december that u.s. troops are coming back now. trump faced widespread criticism from allies about his decision, including that he was abandoning the kurds in the face of turkish threats. officials said at the time that although many details of the withdrawal had not yet been finalized, they expected american forces to be out by mid-january.
even with ambitious emission reductions, however, numerical models project further oxygen declines during the 21st century, the study warns.
i have highlighted three products here to give my readers a flavor of the tools that are available, but there are other products on the market. i do not endorse one of these tools over the other but believe they can be an important addition to your accessibility efforts. i do recommend that corporations and organizations blend accessibility into the dna of all offerings. these tools appear to be an effective way to assure accessible experiences for clients and employees with disabilities while also reducing risk to an organization while they update their processes, code their websites to be compliant to standards like w3c wcag 2.0, and show that their brand cares about the customer's experience.
two days later, ross told the house ways and means committee, the department of justice, as you know, initiated the request for inclusion of the citizenship question.

after the first women's march, wruble went on to found march on, the broad coalition of sister marches outside washington. asked if she and the women's march inc. leaders have reconciled, said no, but she told yahoo news, historically, all social movements have had rifts and splits, and i don't know why we would expect something different from such a large and broad movement as the women's march movement. when these points of friction come up, it gives us an opportunity for everyone to learn from them. ultimately, it makes the movement stronger, and i have absolutely no concern that the women's march movement isn't going anywhere. it is unstoppable.
jiao yahui, a health commission official, said the disease will continue to develop. it has developed different features compared with the early stage, and the prevention and precautionary measures need to change accordingly.
it would definitely become harder. the americans are approaching india with the attitude that if you are not going to do this deal now then wait till president trump gets re-elected. the americans are saying that then you will be forced to deal with us again and you may not get the terms that we are offering you currently. you can expect trump to get a little harsher and unconstrained on trade because he is not going to have the pressures of re-election.
the supplies ― which trump said will be delivered within 48 hours ― include gloves, medical beds, n95 masks and gowns. the u.s. army corps of engineers will also provide these states additional support to build alternate care sites.

in california, people have been wary for decades, of even such a simple thing as discussing marijuana over the phone. so much for freedom of speech, when the cops can tap a dealer's line and record it to use as evidence. your personal electric bills were open to inspection by the cops as well, to catch grow houses using an inordinate amount of electricity for halogen lights. cops would roll up on houses with heat-vision devices to see which houses were glowing too hot ― another sign of a grow house. growers had had to move inside due to the thousands of flights of helicopters overhead, searching for illegal farms. they even tossed out the federal posse comitatus act when they formed camp, or the campaign against marijuana planting, which was a cooperative effort by local, state, and federal troops. in fact, the heavy-handed efforts and outright legal abuses of camp were largely responsible for california leading the initial legal pushback against the entire war on weed. in 1996, california became the first state in the nation to legalize medicinal marijuana, which was the tipping point down the slippery slope towards full legalization we are traveling on today.
in early december, just as the third wave of the coronavirus was gaining steam across the united states, comedian michael rapaport took to instagram to make a simple, characteristically expletive-laden plea to his followers: if you get covid-19, post about your symptoms.

the legislation includes no funds for state and local governments, and according to economists mark paul and adam hersh, is at least $2.1 trillion short of what the economy needs to return to pre-pandemic health. paul and hersh assume that government spending is about or a little more efficient at boosting economic growth than its direct outlays ― payments are spent on other activity, which in turn encourages more activity.

as the atlantic noted, the new warehouse case is the realization of a major threat to amazon's operations. millions of people across the nation are cloistered inside their homes, many of them relying on the company to provide basic goods. amazon is already struggling to meet demand, and some employees feel they're being unfairly endangered by working in warehouses filled with other workers.
so far, the economic fallout has been ― shockingly ― minimal. the stock market has been unbothered; it's been booming for months, as some companies cash in on the pandemic and the federal reserve keeping the money flowing.

in hindsight, so many signs of his condition were there. william was constantly thirsty for months. we told him to stop drinking so much juice and suggested water. i could sometimes hear him using the bathroom two or three times throughout the night, and he started to have bed-wetting accidents. my husband and i would change the sheets, instruct him not to drink anything an hour before bed and told him to try to get some sleep. there were days where william felt groggy, but i brushed it off as him wanting an excuse to skip school.

trump's own justice department may have complicated what is already a highly improbable effort to upend the ritualistic count jan. 6. it has asked a federal judge to dismiss the last-gasp lawsuit from rep. louie gohmert, r-texas, and a group of republican electors from arizona who are seeking to force pence to step outside mere ceremony and shape the outcome of the vote.
he says seikatsu club has also expanded beyond food into child care and elder care. that's huge as well, given how crucial those services are, especially with the burdens that they often unfairly put on women and also both of those sectors are exploitative and low-pay work, menser says.
barrett's own views on climate science remain opaque. during her contentious confirmation hearings last fall, she repeatedly said she was not a scientist and therefore did not have firm views on warming. she called the issue a very contentious matter of public debate and politically controversial.
there's no denying that women are doing even more of it, as a new study from oxfam, unpaid and underpaid care work and the global inequality crisis, makes very clear. not only is the act of care — for kids, for elderly and sick people and those with disabilities — an essential part of a community, it's also work the organization estimates is worth $10.8 trillion each year.

this healthy take on fruitcake is just as flavorful as the traditional version, despite its lack of butter, sugar and rum (a common ingredient in the classic). the recipe calls for dried cherries, raisins, apricots, figs and dates, but you can use any dried fruits you like. it also includes brewed tea and orange zest, which give the cake a pleasantly bright note.

the restrictions do not prevent residents from going to the grocery store, pharmacy or gas station, and they can still go for walks. public schools throughout the state have already been shut down ― as they have across nearly all 50 states ― and will remain closed through april 7, as well.
he argued it was time to take another look at sugar taxes or follow chile's example of cracking down on unhealthy eating. the country recently instituted strict marketing and labeling laws that make sugar and other unhealthy content abundantly clear.
once a cultural juggernaut and a launchpad for models from kathy ireland to kate upton, the swimsuit issue has become somewhat of an anachronism, albeit still a highly profitable one. best known for its just barely sfw titillation, si has successfully packaged and monetized the male gaze for more than five decades.

and of those countries, the six that recorded gender in their death rates — china, italy, france, germany, iran and south korea — all reported that more men died of the virus than women, even though france and south korea saw higher rates of infected women than men. the deaths in those six countries were between 54 and 71 per cent male.
jayapal has said she hopes a version will get a floor vote, although that seems a long ways off. the committees taking up the proposal initially aren't actually the ones that would write a health care bill. even so, the hearings could represent the most serious attention the concept has received on capitol hill since the late 1940s, when committees took up then-president harry truman's similarly designed, but ill-fated national health insurance proposal.
us president donald trump announced on wednesday that vice president mike pence would lead the white house task force on covid-19, the deadly new coronavirus spreading around the world. but critics are pointing out that pence's track record on health and science isn't exactly reassuring.
you observed that the earliest of the writings of the new testament, including the letters of the apostle paul, say nothing about jesus' birth, virgin or not. you wondered whether the birth narratives might have developed long after the crucifixion-resurrection experience. a lot of biblical scholarship supports your surmise. yet the answer you got only warned that if part of the ancient christian story were deemed a legend, the very fabric of the christian message would come undone. says who? no evidence was supplied.
this year i resolve to convince my clients that design elements on ceilings, whether they be coffering, panelling or even a fresh coat of a colorful paint, are equally as important as the design elements on walls and floors. ceilings are often left white and ignored, but overlooking them can become a true missed design opportunity.

the mainstream media doesn't really know what to make of it all. they run bemused stories which still fall back on stoner humor, or they offer sober assessments of how the new marijuana economy will change things, or they still attempt to warn of the direst of consequences. almost none of these stories hinge on the aspect of sheer liberation, however.
if they are displaying mild symptoms, it may be best to talk to a doctor via telemedicine to avoid exposing other people to the illness you have, whether it is the flu, a common cold or the coronavirus disease, dean said.
the first women's march, in 2017, was a reaction to the election and inauguration of president trump. the following year, it was a push for the polls for the 2018 midterm election. this year, with no upcoming national election, the movement has had to rethink its purpose — amid ongoing controversy over connections between some of its leaders and the anti-semitic, anti-gay nation of islam leader louis farrakhan. some women who have marched before are sitting it out or attending separate rallies unaffiliated with the national organization. thousands of others, though, will be in washington, d.c., on saturday.

is there a cure for the coronavirus?
it can make it a little easier to detach from this view when we think about how things might be if we both were operating from the same biased view. recognizing our own tendency (towards greater risk or greater security) can be very helpful in enabling us to let go of the notion that we are right and they are wrong. it goes without saying that this is easier said than done. this however possible and from our own experience well worth the investment of time, energy, and effort that it requires to develop the inner flexibility and openness that such shifts entail.
at least, in the last months of 2016 the g20 leaders' communique recognised the impact excess capacity has had on the global economy and there's now a chance of focusing on this problem. excess global capacity in steel and other industries is mainly a result of falling demand, rising production and excessive government subsidies.

there's no reason to give the capitol police a blanket, categorical free pass on foia, said frank lomonte, the director of the brechner center for freedom of information. we live in america. we don't have secret police.

the scariest part: the scariest thing about leaving google was the fact that i gave up a good gig, and a salary. i was reporting to the vp of americas marketing, working on some really interesting projects and i loved my co-workers (one of my closest friends still today is someone i met in my first week of google). leaving a well-paying job to bootstrap a company, with no income coming in, is scary. it took me months of discussion and contemplation before actually taking the plunge to start thirdlove.
first of all, i am romantic. witnessing two people who love each other, make the commitment to their partnership, touches me. the loving they express re-awakens love in their guests for their own loved ones. a wedding is a great family occasion.
this was no ordinary protest, either. the insurrectionists showed up with bombs and assault weapons. their plans included not just stopping the certification of an election that was conducted freely and fairly without any evidence of fraud, but to do so by force. even more concerning, the insurrection was planned for a day when both vice president mike pence and speaker of the house nancy pelosi, the first and second people in line for succession to the presidency, were present in the capitol, and there were explicit calls to hang mike pence.
we cut out cable and tried to replace it with just streaming options, then with those plus playstation vue (because they were the only option for live sports). that was a bust because the internet streaming couldn't keep up with the speed of most sports, plus the dvr options were abysmal [which made missing live game broadcasts not an option]. so we went back! we are the proud payers of a directv bill and i'm not even sad about it. ― stephanie bowen earley

installing wheeler as the nation's 15th epa chief is a formality. last month, wheeler became the longest-serving acting administrator in the epa's 48-year history, surpassing bob perciasepe's roughly five-month stint as acting administrator in 2013. acting rules for the epa are vague and have generally gone unchallenged, and some argued wheeler could have remained in his current role for the rest of trump's first term.

in court filings in california and rhode island last year, frederick argued that federal law prevents states from suing shell and other oil companies over climate change. he contended that federal law also provides no remedies for damage due to global warming and that shell could only face climate litigation in the netherlands, where it is headquartered.
listening to music was something we only did at home or in the car - until the walkman. imagined by sony co-founder masaru ibuka and designed by engineer nobutoshi kihara, walkman ushered in the age of personal and portable music listening, to let us listen while we walk, while we work, while we commute and while we exercise. all personal cassette players that followed were referred to as a walkman, regardless of manufacturer, much to sony's chagrin, but the idea of portable audio changed how we find, buy and enjoy our music.
in other words, participation trophies don't last forever. they serve a purpose for younger children, but the workforce entering your organization understands that there are winners and losers in the world. they see it on television every week as they watch their favorite athletic team lose or reality show contestant go home. they experience it in sports, band, or choir as the move from middle school to high school. if they are college graduates, they have been competing their entire life to get into the best school.

painful humiliation. like the older volunteer whose hands were crippled by arthritis. she was told to tie a child's bow and left the room in tears when she couldn't do it.
asked if there were plans to help federal workers who have not gotten paid because of the shutdown, trump claimed without evidence that they are the biggest fan of what we are doing, and said that the safety net is having a strong border.
a democratic senate still would clear an easier path for biden's nominees to key posts, especially on the federal judiciary, and give democrats control of committees and much of the floor action. conversely, a senate led by mcconnell almost certainly would deny biden major legislative victories, as it did late in president barack obama's tenure, by keeping his agenda from even getting up-or-down votes.
this first-ever dvr, invented by tivo founders michael ramsay and jim barton, made it easy to archive and locate hours of recorded shows, pause live tv and time shift our tv viewing. while it would take five years, when cable companies started to incorporate dvr technology into their set-top boxes, to accelerate the demise of the vcr, it was this recorder that triggered the change of how we watched tv.

as for future marches, sarsour said, right now, we can't say that there's going to be a 2020 march. but there is going to be maybe the most important election year of our lifetime in 2020.
so far, despite the claim of trump's campaign manager that the shutdown has boosted the president's numbers, there's little publicly available data to suggest that the shutdown has been politically helpful to anyone. at best, surveys show trump's numbers remaining more or less stagnant. several poll aggregators, meanwhile, have found trump's disapproval rating rising modestly in the new year, albeit remaining well within the narrow range of approval ratings seen in his presidency thus far.
it got so bad that i used to go to the grocery store that was 40 minutes away instead of the one that was 10 minutes away just because i was so afraid to walk down the gay street. the word i hear from paul, from everyone, is re-traumatized. you grow up with this loneliness, accumulating all this baggage, and then you arrive in the castro or chelsea or boystown thinking you'll finally be accepted for who you are. and then you realize that everyone else here has baggage, too. all of a sudden it's not your gayness that gets you rejected. it's your weight, or your income, or your race. the bullied kids of our youth, paul says, grew up and became bullies themselves. gay men in particular are just not very nice to each other, says john, the adventure tour guide. in pop culture, drag queens are known for their takedowns and it's all ha ha ha. but that meanness is almost pathological. all of us were deeply confused or lying to ourselves for a good chunk of our adolescence. but it's not comfortable for us to show that to other people. so we show other people what the world shows us, which is nastiness. every gay man i know carries around a mental portfolio of all the shitty things other gay men have said and done to him. i arrived to a date once and the guy immediately stood up, said i was shorter than i looked in my pictures and left.
what happened in wilmington became an affirmation of white supremacy not just in that one city, but in the south and in the nation as a whole, author laura edwards wrote in democracy betrayed: the wilmington race riot in 1898 and its legacy.
in some ways, though, the most revealing policy changes of trump's first year are the ones that affect the very groups he always claims to champion.
not every change has to be big. there are habits and behaviors that can be modified to help bring about positive outcomes.

and second, for young people especially, it's just so important to get some money saved in retirement accounts. the benefits of compound interests in there is just extraordinary. letting that go, or even foregoing that for even 10 years can really cost a lot of money.
in recent years, most hiring managers highly depended on employee referrals. this hiring metric is not only proven effective, but it's also time-efficient. in 2016, this trend has continued. in fact, employers have even ramped up their referral programs and have extended their referral bonuses externally.

i've only been to shaheen bagh, but i've read a lot about the other places. knowing what is happening in india, and knowing the long and dangerous history of being young, male and muslim in india, it makes total sense. i don't think it's just about minimising the violence that comes down on bodies that resist the state, i think it's also about the realisation that young muslim men are particularly vulnerable. muslim men would be the first to be labelled as terrorists, to be picked to up some kind of mob, and to be disappeared. i think the strategy is one that one sees elsewhere. when young men are vulnerable in a particular kind of way, the women come forward. a friend of mine, who was talking about former yugoslavia and argentina as well, said that when the men were being disappeared, the women would come in front. it is a strategy. it is a protective strategy of the young men.

one last thing: the suggestion that stronger borrower relief is worse for taxpayers is short-sighted at best, dishonest at worst. if the department granted injured students meaningful relief, it would soon have a stronger sense of the enormous costs of allowing bad schools to participate in the federal aid program, and it would remove the worst actors more quickly. i believe that's exactly what bad schools are afraid of. good schools should want a strong borrower defense rule that drives out unscrupulous competitors, the ones who have given the for-profit college industry its bad reputation.

pourquoi n'y a-t-il pas de traitement contre ce coronavirus ? depuis le mois de janvier, les scientifiques dans le monde entier sont lancés dans une course contre la montre: la recherche d'un traitement antiviral efficace contre le nouveau coronavirus. mais attention aux faux traitements qui circulent sur les réseaux sociaux. plusieurs médicaments déjà connus, comme le remdisivir et la chloroquine, ont été testés en urgence. si certains semblent avoir des effets, l'oms rappelle qu'à ce jour, aucun médicament spécifique n'est recommandé pour prévenir ou traiter l'infection par le nouveau coronavirus. dans le cas de la chloroquine, l'ap-hp a lancé une procédure auprès des professionnels de santé dont les résultats sont attendus dans 70 jours. des essais cliniques ont été lancés afin de vérifier l'efficacité d'un traitement, avec un encadrement scientifique rigoureux. ces derniers se développent autour de plusieurs axes: inhibiteurs d'enzymes, antirétroviraux, anticorps monoclonaux... chaque type de médicament recherché s'attaque à un aspect du virus comme expliqué dans la vidéo ci-dessous. de nombreuses molécules sont actuellement testées. une efficacité même partielle, pourrait changer la donne dans les hôpitaux et la lutte contre la maladie. c'est le cas des cardioprotecteurs. ces traitements, s'ils sont approuvés, permettraient de protéger les fonctions cardiaques du patient et d'aider son corps à se battre contre la maladie. certaines études prendront encore des mois avant de donner des résultats. pour en savoir plus sur les traitements en cours de test, cliquez ici.

i first realized my obsession with instagram had ventured into unhealthy territory when i was staging a shot of breakfast in bed at a hotel in bali. most people wake up and order room service with sleep still in their eyes, bed head and a makeup-free face. that is the whole point (and luxury) of getting breakfast in bed ― you don't actually have to get out of bed or make yourself presentable to the world. not for me. i had to shower, put on a full face of makeup, curl my hair and then mess it up a bit so it looked more natural, fluff the blankets and the pillows and set up my tripod. after ordering way more food than i could possibly eat, i painfully posed hundreds of different unnatural ways to achieve the ultimate breakfast goals shot. one hour and 400 photos later, the food was stale, the coffee was cold and i was feeling anything but relaxed.

but it's not just multi-screening that hinders us. research shows that we are often more adept at analogue tasks versus their digital counterparts. a study from princeton university showed that we process information better when writing over typing notes, as the exercise is slower allowing students to digest and better remember the content. another study from the university of stavanger in norway suggests that the recall of a story's plot after using an e-reader such as a kindle is poorer than with traditional books. the researchers suggest that the haptic and tactile feedback of a kindle does not provide the same support for mental reconstruction of a story as a print pocket book does. in other words, the frictionless experience of a kindle is less memorable than the weighty and physical experience of a book.

remove the barriers that create frustration. your business will make your customers feel more important when you show your team that they are important. rediscover and nurture the joy of great work. there are people energized by the opportunity to do great work, and there are those who have jobs. the ones that love producing great work add energy to everything they touch. be one of those people, and if you supervise the work of others, do everything possible to make them feel appreciated. pay attention to the culture every day. your culture is your operation's dna. it is your competitive advantage in a world where products and services are viewed as interchangeable. something that important shouldn't be relegated to an annual review or assigned to a single group as its keeper. it is everyone's responsibility to nurture every day -- starting with you the leader.

in this environment of despair and stagnation, republicans have taken full advantage of the power of rage. trump's campaign and his presidency have sought to shunt american rage outward, blaming other nations all over the globe for the precipitous decline in american fortunes, and straining alliances with bellicose rhetoric. more viscerally, his campaign and those of republicans in the 2018 midterms took advantage of a tried and tested means of eliciting fear and anger: stoking the flames of xenophobia and racism. it sufficed to hold the senate.

the different growth paths are a symptom of a general problem that has haunted currency unions for centuries. competitiveness and productivity develop at a different pace in different countries. over time, this leads to large competitiveness differences among the members of a currency union. these differences do not usually pose a problem during economic booms, because strengthening aggregate demand supports ailing fields of production. however, when a currency union faces an economic downturn or a crisis, falling aggregate demand hits less competitive industries and countries hard and the financing costs of less competitive countries jump. this is an asymmetric shock.

the eighth candle of chanukah comes on new year's eve. as 2016 becomes 2017, let us give thanks for the gifts of life and let us share our abundance. may courage strengthen us and may kindness spring forth with ease. with awareness, may we behold each other and the world and create sacred communities. as we walk with reverence and care, may we discern what is ours to do. and may our lights shine brightly, boldly, clearly, in goodness and in love.
data and new developments on covid come out so rapidly, it can be overwhelming, she said. but people can instantly connect with these anecdotes. they raise awareness of the infection and its potential impacts. they're particularly important for young adults who use social media as one of their sole sources of information and who have been somewhat reckless due to underestimating the risk of the virus.

however, scholars who study religion in america say that many of the ideas present in the publishers' textbooks overlap with rhetoric heard from the rioters last week. christian nationalists argue that the united states was founded as a christian nation and has a special covenant with god, meaning that its citizens must implement a particular vision for this country or they will fall out of favor with god. the textbooks parrot these ideas, said andrew whitehead, associate professor of sociology and director of the association of religion data archives at indiana university-purdue university indianapolis.

i just don't care if my overhauled posting strategy gets me fewer likes and i can't keep up with those other instagrammers. i've finally realized what matters is where i am, who i'm with, and what i can see or learn while we're there together. i don't know what's ahead of me ― where i'll be six weeks or six months from now ― but i'm sure my soul will be happier spending more time on traveling and living than instagramming.

yes, it is safe to use [a shared laundry machine] right now because the virus is killed by washing your clothes over 80 degrees fahrenheit, from what we currently understand, she said. the more challenging issue is going to be the social distancing and contact with potentially contaminated surfaces and people in the laundromat. not the laundry itself.
what's more, i've gotten to the point where i'm nauseated by how fake everything i see on social media is. the very same people who claim they want to be more authentic are the same people who are posting (supposedly) candid photos that, in reality, feature shots that have been aggressively staged and took hours, if not days, to perfect. some influencers have even gone so far as to book sessions at apartments designed specifically to serve as a stylish backdrop for their (absolutely not) carefree, nonchalant photos. nothing about that is authentic.

the climate movement underwent an unprecedented surge since 2018, when united nations scientists warned that governments had a decade to cut planet-heating emissions in half or doom the world to catastrophic, irreversible warming. the findings made clear that politically unpopular schemes to put a price on carbon emissions and incrementally transition from fossil fuels, which had until then dominated the climate policy mainstream, could not alone deliver the economic changes needed.
chris came up with the idea of leveraging online crowdfunding models to solve detroit's blight. when he first described it, no one got it. everyone kept saying that it sounds like kickstarter or gofundme, blauvelt remembers, when he entered a statewide social entrepreneur competition in 2013. but i saw a whole new way to use crowdfunding to flip grant-giving on its head

the imf suggests three explanations for the decline in trade regimes: the slowdown in global economic growth; the halt in trade and investment liberalisation agreements (which started long before the freezing of the trans pacific partnership or the trans atlantic trade and partnership agreements); and the maturity of international production chains that would have exhausted their advantages.
take the friend family from the first episode. husband and father kevin admitted that stressing over mess meant his family often got the worst side of him. that realization was clearly heartbreaking for him. frank and matt from episode 5 felt like their junk was holding them back from maturing individually and as a couple that would make their respective parents proud.

ossoff and warnock shattered fundraising records ― pulling in more than $100 million each in the past two months ― and significantly outraised their gop opponents. yet eight days before the election, the campaign managers for the ossoff and warnock campaigns wrote a joint memo sounding the alarm about the need for more funds. while democrats were largely relying on individual donations and small-dollar contributions, they were being outspent by gop outside groups.

the same can be said for our own lives. there are people that we have relied upon and with whom we have built a long-term relationship. we have truly let them into our lives. however, as the weight of whatever burden you need bared by them increases, that friend gives under the load and breaks away from you in a permanent and irrevocable manner. yes, it hurts but just as leaves come for a reason during a season, branches are there for those life-long lessons that we will take with us long after the branches have broken and been swept away. that is the nature of our organic lives.

with all your spring plans officially cancelled over the global coronavirus pandemic, maybe it's time for you to cuddle up with a good book — as the introverts do, united in spirit but in your own home.
the pandemic should remind us that physical reality is real ― i've been trying to make this point about carbon for years, that chemistry and physics don't negotiate. the microbe makes the same point for biology. and as a corollary, fast action in the face of a crisis helps: south korea had its first case the same day as the u.s. ― and one of those countries then acted swiftly to bend the curve and one didn't. the same, obviously, goes for global warming.
any one in a long-term intimate relationship can attest to the value & absolute necessity of forgiving, letting go of anger & moving on when your partner hurts you.
the community of persons with disabilities has been educating public and private entities for years about the business case and positive return on investment (roi) of inclusion and accessibility. until the us legislated and started litigating over disability inclusion and accessibility we made little to no progress. it is important to note that the united states celebrated the 25th year anniversary of the americans with disabilities act (ada) in 2015. i do not believe we would have seen progress without that legislation and people with disabilities demanding access in the united states via our legal channels.

while most new parents need to focus much of their time, energy and resources on the newborn, it's important to recognize that you need to nurture yourself and your relationship once the baby is a couple of months old. there are many parents who struggle to go out on a date after having children due to financial constraints. it's important for partners to engage with one another as adults with a variety of interests other than their kids in order to keep the erotic energy going. you can have sex while your kids are sleeping, but if all you've been doing night after night is reading stories and cleaning up after dinner, the routine can become old and exhausting. it leaves little time to connect romantically and sensually with your partner.― sari cooper, sex therapist and director of the center for love and sex nyc

it's not uncommon at a sandpit for groups to work until the wee hours of the morning leading up to the final presentations on the last day. the groups at the zapopan sandpit put in the extra late-night thinking needed. but the pressure was on. unlike typical sandpits, where the mentor team morphs into decision makers at the end of the session, this sandpit brought in outside evaluators for a final presentation. the groups had to make the case for the proposals to a panel of judges who had little context for how the projects had developed in just a few days.

the findings offer something of a thought exercise ― and a warning: either jump-start the carbon removal industry with generous government support now, or risk playing desperate triage in the hotter, chaotic decades to come. at the moment, the technology is primarily produced by two companies ― carbon engineering, based in canada, and climeworks, headquartered in switzerland ― that depend on working with major polluters. carbon engineering took money from oil giant occidental petroleum. climeworks struck a deal to supply the coca-cola co., the world's biggest source of plastic pollution, with co₂ for beverage carbonation.

two of the local women struck up a conversation with me, proving once again that what i have cannot be taught. they told stories of a neighboring tavern that had since been shut down after the authorities discovered it was a brothel. i smiled and nodded, and googled the term when i returned home. incidentally, yikes. they went on to describe the proprietor, a woman whose name i can't recall, so i'll make up something dignified. apparently, if you gave old beaver jugs a single dollar, she'd climb a step ladder in an ill-fitting skirt, hoisting her business district skywards and presenting the patronage with a view of the second thing i had to google that night. incidentally, yikes.

instead they seek to crack down on the sort of nonviolent civil disobedience that has shaped much of our nation's greatest political and social victories. the legislation's similarities were no coincidence. as climate change projections grew more dire and the bloody 2016 fight to stop the dakota access pipeline became a new alamo cry for environmentalists, the fossil fuel industry's political allies began promoting state legislation to restrict protests. oklahoma passed the first legislation protecting pipelines as critical infrastructure in 2017. shortly after, the american legislative exchange council, the conservative policy shop funded by big business and right-wing billionaires, drafted a generic bill it called the critical infrastructure protection act.

just to be clear, king's rhetoric cannot be attributed to the rise of trumpism, it goes back to well before donald trump's entry into the 2016 presidential campaign. in august of 2013, king absurdly claimed that for every child of an illegal immigrant who is valedictorian, there's another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds, and they've got calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.

the unfortunate aftermath of being seen as part of a monolith of passive, soft-spoken asian women is that it becomes much more difficult to be taken seriously when we actually want to move up in the ranks. give up! it's too much work to try to get ahead and change structural inequity; just keep working twice as hard as your mediocre male peers to get half as far. it makes for good cardio. it also keeps up that pesky model minority stereotype ― the one that says that asian-americans are inclined to higher levels of socioeconomic success, and therefore no action needs to be taken to reduce the real socioeconomic disparities that exist.

it's been disheartening and demoralizing to see black people (especially black women) trot out the same tired defenses of terrible men. they usually hinge on some sort of persecution theory ― white people are out to get men like kelly, hart and bill cosby. to believe allegations about them, or not forgive them, is to buy into the white man's devious plan. if kevin hart can't use gay slurs and be forgiven, then what about the amy schumers and sarah silvermans of the world? sure, kelly allegedly raped a few girls, but what about woody allen and harvey weinstein?

johnson and duncan smith helped lead the vote leave campaign that triumphed in last year's eu referendum, with a 52% vote for brexit. the former mayor of london is seen by his supporters as the most popular successor to theresa may. but if the analysis is accurate he could be toppled as tory leader and pm in the 2022 general election. nigel dodds, the deputy leader of the democratic unionist party (dup), the conservatives' likely partners propping up may's minority government, is also set to lose his seat. the changes to the westminster boundaries were included in the 2017 tory manifesto, repeating a pledge made by david cameron to reduce the number of commons seats from 650 to 600 and to make constituencies more equal in size. johnson could now join several tory mps who are pushing for the boundary review – due to be completed in 2018 – to be shelved yet again or axed. given that many of the seats facing abolition were in labour areas, it was expected that the changes would net the tories at least 12 seats. but the 2017 labour surge, particularly in london, puts in play several previously solid tory seats once the boundary review includes labour wards to the newly created constituencies. new polls suggest labour is ahead of the tories for the first time in years, but even if corbyn's share of the vote remains the same as in 2017, the study shows seats would fall to the party under the new boundaries.

huffpost first reported last week that frederick, 59, was under consideration for the solicitor general post. he previously served as a clinton-era assistant to the solicitor general from 1996 to 2001 and appeared on the obama administration's short list for the top job in 2008.
an example of this was the reversal of yet another obama-era rule that, for the first time, exposed banks and credit card companies to class action lawsuits by consumers who believed they were victims of fraud. the trump administration and its allies claimed this was an effort to help consumers, because class action lawsuits merely enrich trial lawyers. but, as consumer advocates point out, fear of class action suits and their potentially big awards are precisely what it takes to keep large financial institutions in line.

there were several moments in 2018 when it was difficult to remain hopeful for any sort of meaningful action on climate change. the trump administration has worked tirelessly to impede a transition to a green economy with actions ranging from opening the long-protected arctic national wildlife refuge to drilling, to implementing tariffs on imported solar panels, to the president's own denial that humans are causing unprecedented warming ― despite his own government's comprehensive report stating the opposite.

nolan said he was extremely worried about how higgs' recent covid-19 diagnosis in late december might interact with the lethal injection drug scheduled to be administered on friday. he presented an x-ray to a district court last tuesday showing that higgs has lung damage. according to medical experts who testified on higgs' behalf, he is at a higher risk of consciously experiencing pulmonary edema — which induces terrifying and painful sensations of drowning and suffocation — during the execution.
―trump, democrats and republicans all draw lackluster marks for their handling of the government shutdown, according to a cbs/yougov survey out friday. forty-seven percent say that trump is most to blame, 30 percent that democrats are, 3 percent that republicans are, and 20 percent that all share the blame equally. two-thirds of americans don't think trump should declare a national emergency to pay for a wall if one isn't funded by congress.

a few years ago, i started hearing about tools that could produce an accessibility overlay on a website to ensure access for all. i was skeptical and worried that some technologists and corporations might use these tools as a shortcut and not build accessibility into the dna of their products, sites, tools, and services. my fears were actually realized in a few cases when a few corporations adopted tools that claimed they would make their website accessible and then later learned the websites were not accessible despite the tool.
for instance, in the u.s. the largest retailer of organic food is walmart. as people started to consume organic food and demand organic food, companies competed to provide it, and walmart is the biggest one out there. in many ways, it's empowering to recognize that ultimately the economy reflects our decisions and our choices, and that can be small choices like what milk you buy or major choices of where you choose to work and how we choose to save and invest. that's the power we have as consumers, investors and as voters.
however, beginning in 2018, employees will not be allowed to deduct out-of-pocket work expenses they pay to do their job, simmons said. this deduction, along with other miscellaneous deductions, is suspended through 2025.
when you look at the words that he uses, which are historic dog whistles of white supremacy. when you look at how he reacted to the charlottesville incident, where neo-nazis murdered a woman, versus how he manufactures crises like immigrants seeking legal refuge on our borders, it's — it's night and day, ocasio-cortez continued.
the left and biden are probably united in the sense that bold economic relief, both on humanitarian grounds and political grounds, is going to be key for the success of the administration, a senior aide to a progressive member of congress, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the matter, told huffpost.
being in the same bed at the same time as your partner increases the likelihood of having sexual contact. if you find yourself avoiding going to bed until after your partner is asleep, you may be consciously (or subconsciously) decreasing the odds of having sex. you need to ask yourself some tough questions: why don't i want to be awake in the same bed at the same time as my partner? are there aspects of my sex life that are disappointing or anxiety-provoking? avoiding may feel easier than hurting your partner's feelings, but an honest conversation (first with yourself and then with your partner) may keep you from ending up in a sexless marriage. ― resnick anderson

but secrets get old. and as the pandemic wore into its eighth month, with no end in sight, i no longer took comfort in loving someone to whom the world could not bear witness. witness creates truth. or witness creates proof, which creates fact, and people say that's as close as you can get. as real as it all felt, there was a way in which without being witnessed, our relationship suddenly crossed from a sweet secret to not really real.

all stars brings out all the worst parts of thorgy. she's a mess from the word go this week, questioning why her part as stevie nicks isn't as funny as the others. (having seen the full show: girl, save mariah and julie, none of them were that funny.) in rehearsals with todrick, she imagines herself focused and galvanized, but as ben later points out in a confessional, she spends the whole time subconsciously self-sabotaging. it's honestly distressing to watch a talent like thorgy melt down like this. as a result, her actual performance is kind of a mess. she looks like stevie, but her affects are twitchy and bizarre. her insistence during judging that stevie nicks isn't a gay icon — really, girl? — doesn't help her case.

all of us have stories about not being good enough and narratives about the parts of ourselves that love ones labeled inadequate or a burden. as we are experiencing these heartbreaking moments time and time again, we can't help but believe them to be truths. instead of a person's opinion of you, it becomes a fact. and once that happens, the true torture begins. we begin to criticize ourselves.
your high-conflict ex creates drama to keep you engaged. you know you've taken the bait when you catch yourself yelling, crying, cursing, or sending an invective-laded email. as tempting as it may be to retaliate, responding to your ex's drama with your own drama will just invite more attacks. so stick to the facts when communicating. deflect outbursts with nevertheless, or i understand. you will never truly be divorced until you learn to manage your own emotional reactivity to your ex.

congressional makeup shapes any administration, but perhaps even more so for biden, who spent 36 years in the senate, plus eight as obama's vice president and top congressional liaison. biden leaned on that resume to pitch himself to the country as a consensus builder; he also criticized presidents' increased use of executive action to go around congress and insisted it would be different in his presidency.

this is a delicate balance, and it's worth noting that in the academic and scientific domain, the participants do cooperate, but they also compete aggressively. the group of participants at the zapopan sandpit--perhaps because so many came from the world of social entrepreneurship and economic development--walked the talk when it came to being inclusive. they bonded in their groups and wanted to stay there, resisting even when the mentors--a team of subject guides whose role was to give the group advice--suggested that the groups split up or take their projects in a different direction.

murtaugh: as an icu doctor, he is rarely ever completely off the clock. the amount of work that is required outside of the hospital is huge. the documentation, phone calls with insurance companies, and meetings with patients' families are all part of a patient's care. even when he's not in the hospital, he is often on call, so we have to plan our life as if at any time we may need to stop what we're doing so he can make it into the hospital to manage an emergency.

binge-watching netflix or a movie series. sometimes healthy distractions, like escaping into another world through music and film, can bring relief from stress and anxiety. plus, if we're going to invest time viewing something intense--like the lord of the rings trilogy--then a weekend marathon can allow us to take a deeper dive and transform the experience into a special event. do it right: grab pillows and blankets, make popcorn, order pizzas, and hunker down for the long haul.

the next big challenge will come when supply ramps up, in late winter or early spring, and vaccines become available to a much larger swath of the public. at that point, the upper limit on vaccines will depend less on the amount of vaccine available and more on the ability to deliver it. the current plan is to use existing providers ― not just pharmacies, but also clinics, independent medical practices, and sometimes schools and employers ― and to supplement them with government-managed mass vaccination centers.

i certainly don't see any of these suddenly outspoken republicans denouncing the trump administration's directive to include a citizenship question in the 2020 census for the first time in 70 years at the behest of the disgraced steve bannon. a change that will result in the undercounting of immigrants and minorities.

an often-used response to the how-long question is my whole life, suggesting that a given artwork is the product of years of training, experimentation and intellectual growth, while a more of a straight-on answer might indicate that some works take days, others months. some buyers may associate a longer process with higher value, which may or may not be true. if you must, chuckle inwardly.

so i would dial out to get some meth delivered and check the internet to see if there were any parties happening. it was either that or watch a movie by myself. jeremy is not my only gay friend who's struggling. there's malcolm, who barely leaves the house except for work because his anxiety is so bad. there's jared, whose depression and body dysmorphia have steadily shrunk his social life down to me, the gym and internet hookups. and there was christian, the second guy i ever kissed, who killed himself at 32, two weeks after his boyfriend broke up with him. christian went to a party store, rented a helium tank, started inhaling it, then texted his ex and told him to come over, to make sure he'd find the body. for years i've noticed the divergence between my straight friends and my gay friends. while one half of my social circle has disappeared into relationships, kids and suburbs, the other has struggled through isolation and anxiety, hard drugs and risky sex. none of this fits the narrative i have been told, the one i have told myself. like me, jeremy did not grow up bullied by his peers or rejected by his family. he can't remember ever being called a faggot. he was raised in a west coast suburb by a lesbian mom. she came out to me when i was 12, he says. and told me two sentences later that she knew i was gay. i barely knew at that point.

and sanders benefited from an organized labor movement in nevada that, as in much of the rest of the country, is fiercely divided when it comes to sanders' signature policy of medicare for all. the state's largest local teachers union, the clark county education association, endorsed sanders in part because the union has struggled to protect its health care benefits and is less wary of a transition to a single government plan. nevada's seiu local 1107, which unlike ccea did not endorse in the race, also condemned the culinary union's critical treatment of medicare for all, arguing that pitting union health care plans against medicare for all created a false choice.

when we tell our honest, humble and vulnerable story to others - it attracts them to us like magnets because it draws them to us when we especially add value to their life and show our vulnerable sides. when we begin adding valuable knowledge to people and they learn to trust us - only then will they want to work with us because number one they know we have also gone through some tough spots in life but also because we will be able to provide solutions to their overwhelming situations that will be effective.

what gives me hope is that this traditional bifurcation is starting to break down. people are starting to recognize that if they care about something, if they care about it enough that they donate money to the cause, they vote around the cause, they donate their time, then they should care about it enough that it factors into their economic decisions — where they work, what they buy, how they save and invest. we're still in the early stages with such investment products, but we're getting there.

the #metoo movement emerged as an urgent reckoning around sexual abuse and harassment in the workplace, but it's churned up discussions of issues beyond that ― not only sexual abuse outside the workplace, but also a broader culture of misogyny. those discussions have revolved around the art of abusive and chauvinistic men, and how their visions have defined our culture, often in ways that harmed women. they've also included talk of how white critics have long taken up the air in the room; how they've been empowered to curate an artistic canon by and about them, while people of color, women and other marginalized groups have not.

how to take immediate control of your mental, emotional as henley wrote, if we are the master of our fate and the captain of our soul. this is true because we can control what happens to us next by controlling our words, thoughts and actions. most people give away to their feelings and do things that they have to regret later. most of the unhappiness in the world would have ended if people exercised their birthright of being able to control their mind. getting our spiritual life in the right direction is of utmost importance if we are to have peace of mind and happiness throughout our life.

i realized that i missed my live tv. i bought an hdtv antenna, however the only channel i could get was nbc because i'm not close to the towers. i researched all of the live streaming options including hulu live ($40/month), sling tv ($20, $25 or $40) and directv now ($35). i got free trials for all three. i liked hulu live, however the live user interface took me awhile to get used to. plus it was the most expensive at $40, still for a bunch of channels i don't watch. also it did not have animal planet or tlc, channels that i watch. next i was excited about sling because of the price, however even with sling's $40 option, you don't get all of the major broadcast networks. so my final selection for live streaming tv is directv now (live a little package). it has the best value at $35/month with all of the major broadcast networks plus tlc and animal planet. plus i like the user interface for browsing live tv. it has a nice channel guide similar to cable. the only channel that i don't have live and would like is the own network, but i'm not going to pay an extra $15 a month for the next higher package that includes it. ― angela l. lee

upon returning to the u.s. to begin grade school, i was relieved of the daily questioning i received in japan, but quickly learned that life in america was all work and no play. for christmas one year, my parents gifted me a hooked on phonics program to ensure that no one would mistakenly enroll their daughter in an english as a second language class. a few months later, my mother asked my father for a piano for her birthday so that i could begin music lessons. when we were able to afford a computer, they brought one home -– a clunky, grey nec -– so that i could learn to type well before my peers.
steyer has never held office but is one of the democratic party's biggest donors and fundraisers. he gave heavily to hillary clinton's 2016 campaign and contributed more than $87 million to democratic candidates during that election cycle. he was also a major donor to both of former president barack obama's presidential campaigns and was reportedly floated for various roles in the administration.
the indian government announced on monday that no domestic passenger flight will operate in the country starting wednesday. international flights have already been banned for a week, and the indian railways, often described as the country's lifeline, have also stopped all train services until march 31. many states have also announced strict measures to limit movement within and between their borders. the central government has asked states to strictly enforce the lockdown and take legal action against violations. as of monday, india has 415 active cases of covid-19, and eight people have died so far.
between planning my next shot, picking the outfit i'd wear, getting ready, doing my makeup, staging, taking and editing dozens and dozens of photos, writing the perfect caption, researching hashtags to use, planning the best time to post, and then responding to the comments i received, it literally took me hours to create a single instagram post.
yet only some of the high-profile democrats hoping to challenge trump in 2020 have made the issue a top priority. sanders held a town hall on climate change in december and is preparing legislation on a green new deal. merkley was the first senator to back a green new deal last year. sen. cory booker (d-n.j.) followed soon after, explicitly tying his push for a federal job guarantee to the climate proposal.

the news clip, a brief entry in neil rubin's names & faces column, epitomizes the way many mainstream media publications in the 1990s and early aughts addressed the then-rumored marriage between r. kelly and aaliyah. rubin doesn't express particular concern about the alleged union of a grown man and a girl under the age of legal consent; despite being a journalist, he doesn't attempt to confirm or deny the persistent speculation.

along with an 1.9 percent spike in power sector emissions, increases occurred in the transportation, industry and buildings sectors, according to rhodium. contributing to the overall increase were the growing u.s. economy, a cold start to the year that required additional energy for heating, and the limited progress made in developing decarbonization strategies, the analysis found.
lose the hours spent on pointless meetings, plowing through email or (be honest) gossiping, and most people probably work in the strict sense less than they think. almost half those in the workforce institute study reckoned that, if left uninterrupted, they could complete their job in less than five hours a day.

now that you know your ex is not going to have an aha moment, and you will remain together till death do you part, you must examine your own actions and thought patterns that keep you engaged in a losing battle. you must change the way you relate to your ex, both in the real world, and in your head.
it should be noted, however, that various cultures around the world have different customs when it comes to funerals. in china, for instance, the traditional color of mourning is white, while in thailand widows wear purple while mourning their spouses. and traditions, in general, continue to change. not everyone chooses to mourn in the traditional sense, and some may instead opt for a celebration of life service, which can be less formal.

if you want videos of factory farming animal abuse, veganuary has them, but glover and land designed veganuary to offer more than that. our attitude has always been supportive, says land. not only can you download a vegan starter kit, veganuary participants can download a free vegan celeb recipe booklet. uk restaurant chains are signing on and adding vegan options to their menus. it's all part of veganuary's goal to make vegan more acceptable and accessible, something fun, a challenge perhaps, but a positive one.

for gay people, the effect is magnified by the fact that our minority status is hidden. not only do we have to do all this extra work and answer all these internal questions when we're 12, but we also have to do it without being able to talk to our friends or parents about it. for more stories that stay with you, subscribe to our newsletter. sign up john pachankis, a stress researcher at yale, says the real damage gets done in the five or so years between realizing your sexuality and starting to tell other people. even relatively small stressors in this period have an outsized effect—not because they're directly traumatic, but because we start to expect them. no one has to call you queer for you to adjust your behavior to avoid being called that, salway says. james, now a mostly-out 20-year-old, tells me that in seventh grade, when he was a closeted 12-year-old, a female classmate asked him what he thought about another girl. well, she looks like a man, he said, without thinking, so yeah, maybe i would have sex with her. immediately, he says, he panicked. i was like, did anyone catch that? did they tell anyone else i said it that way? this is how i spent my adolescence, too: being careful, slipping up, stressing out, overcompensating. once, at a water park, one of my middle-school friends caught me staring at him as we waited for a slide. dude, did you just check me out? he said.
mark spitz is a self-described middling talent, one of three survivalist members of a zone one unit sent to clear an area in manhattan after a pandemic has devastated the world. spitz struggles with hallucination brought on by a condition called post apocalyptic stress disorder. his main coping mechanism appears to be learning to adapt to the world as it is now, even if he does have to eat a stand-in for breakfast called morning paste. he's got a gun and a survival pack to deal with the undead who pop up as they search buildings to resettle new york city.

church sexual abuse broke into the open in 2002, when it was discovered that u.s. bishops moved abusers from parish to parish instead of defrocking them. similar scandals were later discovered around the world and tens of millions of dollars have been paid in compensation.
i think one thing this pandemic has taught us is how much we were taking for granted before. the ability to hang out in my favorite coffee shop, take a vacation, hang out with my friends and family members. i never experienced a sense of awe and joy at doing these activities before covid, but i hope when i return to them after the pandemic, it will be with a bit more gratitude and a bit more understanding of how cherished these joy-inducing activities really should be. i think all of us will become a bit more appreciative of the little things we didn't pay attention to before.

new york gov. andrew cuomo (d), who leads the state with the most covid-19 cases in the u.s., issued an urgent plea at his daily press conference, warning that the rate of growth for cases continues to increase and will peak in 14 to 20 days, making it essential that the state strengthen its hospital capacity and obtain much-needed medical supplies.
anyone who has online dated for more than say, one week, knows just how prevalent lying is online. in my online dating journey (as they say on the bachelor), i often met men who were lying about something, whether it was as innocuous as their age by one or two years, or something more important, like their current relationship status. at first it made me mad and then it started to amuse me. it was as if men were having fun making up new, idealized versions of themselves online.

inslee is the second governor to sign the pledge, following newly elected minnesota gov. tim walz (d). california gov. gavin newsom (d), who was sworn in this week, took a similar pledge ― called oil money out ― but the oath was limited to the oil industry in the golden state. but inslee is the third likely contender for the next democratic presidential nomination to take the pledge, after sens. bernie sanders (i-vt.) and jeff merkley (d-ore.).

that makes the prospects for passing democracy reforms, another top progressive priority, seem bleak. democracy reform refers to political process changes ranging from the adoption of public campaign financing and an end to partisan gerrymandering, which house democrats have already approved, to more ambitious goals like bestowing statehood on the district of columbia and puerto rico.

political circumstances are different now. democrats hold the house majority and, as speaker nancy pelosi's office confirmed to the washington post on thursday, at least two committees will hold hearings on medicare for all this year. exactly what those hearings will entail isn't clear ― democratic leaders aren't saying ― but one focus will be a bill that rep. pramila jayapal (d-wash.) plans to introduce in the next few weeks.

mayor of london sadiq khan has warned theresa may to halt planned police cuts in the wake of the finsbury park attack and a terrible few weeks for london. speaking near the site of the latest violent incident that left one person dead and 10 injured, khan made clear his anger at the government's plans to slash budgets further for the metropolitan police. he pointed out that the force had had to cope with the terror attack on westminster bridge, london bridget and now finsbury park. i've been saying for 12 months now my concern about the resources the met police and others have, he said. my message to the government is, the plan you have to make the further cuts of £400m: don't do it. my message to the government is, the plans you have to change the police funding formula so london loses more money: don't do it. my message to the government is, we need to get the right level of funding for a capital city.
one of our most important responsibilities as pride festivals is to put focus on the injustices and oppression that lgbtiq+ persons still suffer in other countries and here at home, west pride president tasso stafilidis told huffpost in an email. by arranging europride we can aim a spotlight on life-critical issues, like transgender people's living situations, shape public opinion and make demands for change and respect.

so go ahead; vent your spleen. give yourself the tiny shred of comfort that comes from claiming your long-simmering, now-validated disdain. take the opportunity to try, once again, to have a real debate about the artistic merit of works like kill bill and manhattan. it's a first step to envisioning a world that isn't just rid of monsters, but that actually offers everyone an equal place in constructing our culture.

just because something is labeled organic, natural or gluten-free doesn't make it the healthier choice by default. all-natural doesn't legally mean anything; food manufacturers and purveyors can slap those words on anything and call it a good day in marketing. this term is not regulated by the fda, which means there are no repercussions to calling food made with artificial ingredients, chemical sweeteners, preservatives, or anything else, natural.

the tax cut is trump's only major legislative accomplishment, but it wasn't supposed to be. he and his congressional partners spent more of the year focusing on health care, as they tried to repeal the affordable care act. the effort fell short, in no small part because gop repeal proposals looked nothing like what trump had promised.

despite all the talk of our chosen families, gay men have fewer close friends than straight people or gay women. in a survey of care-providers at hiv clinics, one respondent told researchers: it's not a question of them not knowing how to save their lives. it's a question of them knowing if their lives are worth saving. i'm not going to pretend to be objective about any of this. i'm a perpetually single gay guy who was raised in a bright blue city by pflag parents. i've never known anyone who died of aids, i've never experienced direct discrimination and i came out of the closet into a world where marriage, a picket fence and a golden retriever were not just feasible, but expected. i've also been in and out of therapy more times than i've downloaded and deleted grindr. marriage equality and the changes in legal status were an improvement for some gay men, says christopher stults, a researcher at new york university who studies the differences in mental health between gay and straight men. but for a lot of other people, it was a letdown. like, we have this legal status, and yet there's still something unfulfilled. this feeling of emptiness, it turns out, is not just an american phenomenon. in the netherlands, where gay marriage has been legal since 2001, gay men remain three times more likely to suffer from a mood disorder than straight men, and 10 times more likely to engage in suicidal self-harm.
i think many destinations become repeat destinations because travelers develop an emotional attachment to these spots through amazing experiences they've had there ― often with family and friends, nancy schretter, managing editor of the family travel network, told huffpost. as the bond grows deeper, vacationers simply can't imagine not coming back.

the political capital that needs to be invested, the intense gathering of allies to push this through congress, just requires an all-out effort, inslee said. that's not going to be done just because somebody now decides they're interested in climate change. it takes someone who's frankly cared about it for years and years.

all this came two years after trump dismantled the pandemic response team that his predecessor barack obama had created within the white house. trump justified that move three weeks ago as a desire to save money — some of the people we cut, they haven't been used for many, many years — and falsely claimed he could hire them all back quickly if needed.

the picture above shows how the monte vettore fault has created a steep high cliff over time. the fault plane goes deep below the surface, to about 10-15km deep. it is at such a depth where large earthquakes generally begin. when a large earthquake occurs, it makes rocks slide vertically on either side of the fault plane. one side, on the left of the picture, is brutally moved upward, and its shallowest part is pulled up from the earth, forming here a 2m high fresh wall (where people stand).
marc perrone, the ufcw's president, told huffpost that the union is working hard to keep up with its members' concerns, as well as those of nonunion workers now highly interested in organizing. for many in the latter category, the pressure of recent weeks has stripped away any sense that they are paid fairly and protected adequately on the job.

many christians, often concerned about compromising their sense of what they believe that jesus would want, have doubled down on their fragile self-image of being holy, pure and sanctified. in their fear of compromising their beliefs about sexuality and gender, they have almost fully compromised one of the core teachings of jesus: to love god and your neighbor as you love yourself.

trump's rally will cap a frantic and financially costly final weekend of campaigning for both parties. president-elect joe biden is set to campaign in atlanta hours before trump, while vice president-elect kamala harris traveled to georgia on sunday afternoon. texas sen. ted cruz campaigned for republicans in atlanta's suburbs, and the cast of hbo's the wire did the same for democrats. republicans continue to hold an advantage in a television and digital advertising war that has topped $100 million, while democrats have continued to fund far larger field operations than the party ran during the general election.
as in the case of covid-19 and climate change, the most vulnerable populations generally suffer the earliest and most damaging setbacks because of where they live, their limited income and economic means, and their lack of access to health care. government response to climate-induced disasters — hurricanes, floods, droughts, heat waves, wildfires, and related events — inherently benefit whites and more affluent households, and leave behind the most vulnerable. long before hurricane katrina devastated the u.s. gulf coast, people of color learned the hard way that waiting for the government to respond can be hazardous to their health.

we not only have the capacity to act, it is morally incumbent that we do so. low-income and minority communities are disproportionately impacted by the adverse impacts of extreme weather. our most vulnerable citizens, such as children and the elderly, are hit hardest by the public health consequences of toxic dumping, untreated brownfields, and air pollution. climate action is not only about protecting our environment and our economy, it is about justice and quality of life for our communities.

in the case of the capitol rioters, the tacky display and subsequent documentation seems to have been the point. they even made civil war merch emblazoned with the date, jan. 6, 2021. they did not worry about being harmed, even as they committed a litany of obvious crimes: breaking into a federal building, threatening violence against elected officials, destroying federal property, attacking police officers and stealing mail. they viewed the capitol police officers not as adversaries in their treasonous mission, but as friendly helpers. when rioters couldn't find sen. chuck schumer's office, they asked a capitol police officer, who tried to direct them there.

great bosses play chess not checkers. think about the difference. in checkers, all the pieces are basically the same. that's a poor model for leadership because nobody wants to feel like a faceless cog in the proverbial wheel. in chess, on the other hand, each piece has a unique role, unique abilities, and unique limitations. unforgettable bosses are like great chess masters. they recognize what's unique about each member of their team. they know their strengths, weaknesses, likes and dislikes, and they use these insights to draw the very best from each individual.
rep. mario diaz-balart (r-fla.) announced wednesday that he has tested positive for covid-19. the republican congressman said he had developed symptoms of illness, including a high fever and headache, on saturday. on wednesday, he got notice he had tested positive for coronavirus. though he has been self-quarantined for several days, he was on the floor of the house voting on friday, where he presumably came in contact with other lawmakers.

there are strong reasons to think republicans will get that wish. in the huffpost/yougov poll, barely more than a third of americans who opposed the tax bill said they were following its progress very closely. just 13 percent of those opponents named it among the two issues most important to them. overall among opponents, the tax bill ranked seventh on a list of 12 issues. health care ranked first, as it has for much of this year. if that doesn't change, the tax bill's unpopularity may not help its opponents electorally in the way obamacare did — and continues to do.
but while many governors and legislators are looking to revamp tax codes in a big way, the temptation is not universal. while most republican governors are at least looking at lowering taxes, some gop legislators say they are hesitant due to uncertainty about revenue forecasts for the new tax law.

i am in college consulting and education in general, so going to college made a lot of sense--i have to practice what i am preaching. but i never intended to go into business when i first decided on a career in teaching. over the years, i have seen tons of tech companies launch products at different schools where i have worked. most were clunky and not teacher or student-friendly. worst of all, they lacked pedagogy, something that is critical for ed tech tools. and then there were the times when firms would send their best and brightest to evaluate the school's finances. most of those folks were fresh from undergrad and had a few years of tutoring at a community center between them. they were making decisions that would impact the entire educational system in the city. they made suggestions that were completely irrelevant to schools, and in most cases, damaging.

as i am moving on with my life and doing things that must be done, i am finding that more and more people are tuning into what i have to say and how i am living my life. there are an ever increasing number of youths and people at higher stations in life who are taking my stands on different issues as the standard. this increasing fame and influence has given me a different perspective on life. while i used to be the center of my universe before, i have made the fundamental principles of life to be the center of my life. according to einstein, insanity is doing the same thing again and again but expecting different results. we must change some aspects of our lives if we are unhappy with the circumstances or people we are attracted to ourselves. if we want something we never had, we must become something that we never were. we'd be very careful about our speech if we knew the power of our words. by the idle words, some men have destroyed themselves and their life that would otherwise could have been one of great enjoyment and pleasure.

maybe accepting that truth is the first step toward dismantling narratives about patriotism, whose dissent is tolerated and the appropriate ways to protest. white terror helped establish this democracy; black americans have tirelessly fought for racial equality and freedom since its inception. any narrative to the contrary is just watering down the truth of our country's legacy.

it's not surprising that a democratic presidential candidate would shy away from a record supporting the iraq invasion. it's a deeply unpopular war and has doomed other candidates with primary voters in the past. it's been, in many ways, the defining litmus test for the party in recent years. and in recent days, sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.), who is among those challenging biden for the democratic presidential nomination, has been going after him for his war vote.

but some jewish participants object to the organizers' association with farrakhan. rabbi jill jacobs, executive director of t'ruah: the rabbinic call for human rights, will not be joining this year's march because it is being held on saturday, the jewish sabbath. as an organization, because we represent rabbis and jewish community members with a range of practices, we, as a rule, don't sponsor any events that happened on shabbat, she says. she added that sabbath observances vary, so for sure among our 2,000-plus rabbis, there are definitely a number of rabbis who will be marching.

after all, rabbi yehuda ben bava, in the second century mishnah, reports of a tarnegol - a rooster of some kind - that was put to death in jerusalem for killing a child. with their dinosaur-like legs, their hawk-like, banded feathers, their buzzard-like necks, and their general attitude of indifference, these birds lent sudden credence to that tale.

the trade deficit between india and the us is less than a tenth of the trade deficit that the us has with china. and still, tensions have increased. it gives you a sense that american apprehensions on this matter, on trade with india, go beyond mere consideration on trade imbalances. it's about duties. from an american point of view, it's about gaining fair access into the indian market.
autopsy reports show that the government's execution protocol, a lethal injection of pentobarbital, may torture as it kills — even in healthy individuals. when used in executions, the drug often causes a condition called pulmonary edema, where fluid enters the lungs while the person is still conscious, creating a painful sensation similar to suffocating or drowning.

being an r. kelly hater in early 2000s chicago was a mighty lonely experience, but the release of a video that featured him engaged in sexual acts with two teenage girls was all the proof i needed to let him go ― though his marriage to aaliyah in 1995 and the stories i heard about him approaching my friends when we were only in middle school should have done the trick.

i don't think anyone wants to see aziz's career ruined or his life ruined or anything like that, but that's where people's minds go, the comic told couric. they go, 'does he deserve this?' and it's really not about that. i think it's about expressing and showing women that that behavior is not ok and not only can you leave, but you need to leave. because then the women who come after you, you're leaving a mark for them too.
the utah-based religion of 16-million members worldwide has tried in the last decade to create a more welcoming environment for lgbtq members, while adhering to its doctrinal opposition of gay marriage. the faith, widely known as the mormon church, teaches that while being gay is not a sin, engaging in same-sex relationships is against god's commandments.
government shutdowns are costly affairs. federal agencies must spend time and energy developing contingency plans in the runup to a closure, then have to make up missed work once the government finally reopens. as the messy situation in national parks has demonstrated, the government's work does not stop just because funds haven't been appropriated for that work. agencies will face a backlog of responsibilities to handle once they are fully operational again.
these are not the kinds of results one would expect with a hard-liner in the white house. but it's a perfectly logical outcome for trump, who campaigned on a border wall to solve a contrived crisis of illegal immigration at a time when unauthorized crossings stood at 45-year lows.

views about who's to blame for the shutdown remain sharply divided along partisan lines. another woman surveyed also said her family members are going unpaid. she described herself as very concerned about the shutdown and held the president and both parties in congress at least somewhat responsible. but as a republican, she also backed trump's desire to hold out for a border wall and believed that he and his congressional allies were working to bring the shutdown to an end.
she had helped organise the first lgbtq pride parade in lucknow. she had recently joined the congress party hoping that it would amplify her voice.
these white terrorists see themselves as the ultimate victims; their insurrection reframed in the delusional qanon collective imagination as a righteous revolution. they are committed to the delusion. even as reports circulated that five people — four trump superfans and a capitol police officer — had died as a result of the mayhem, people were insisting in my instagram dms and comments that no one got hurt, and that antifa was the real problem and that we were all overreacting because this was the first time white people act[ed] out.

international ngos the fringe anti-imperialist narrative asserts that ngos such as amnesty international and human rights watch are all part of the wider conspiracy to promote regime change in syria. vanessa beeley has described amnesty international as pernicious liars and empire's little helpers and prof piers robinson has written how ngos engage in propaganda activities that contain obfuscation and exaggeration. what is ignored is that these very same ngos write extensively on abuses carried out by israel and those that occur in yemen, both causes championed by these activists. the silencing of syrians notably, there are no syrians among this fringe group, and numerous syrian individuals have said that they have been shut down or blocked on social media when they have tried to engage with them. one such person, maher barotchi, lives in sheffield and was forced out of syria by the regime 30 years ago when he discovered he'd been blacklisted whilst studying in the uk. he said: it makes me angry to see people who are supposedly educated supporting assad. you don't expect people to have posts at universities and still... these people... their so-called principles are more important than the suffering and the human rights. these so-called anti-imperialists, anything that's anti-western, even if it's a mass murderer, they will defend them and find excuses for them. how can you be an educated person living in the west, enjoying the freedom of speech which the countries you defend don't have and don't allow?

we talked about the color scheme, which brings me to the wig cassie wears in the final sequence. part of why that wig is so striking is because it's seen on a famous person at the big climax of a galvanizing movie. but it also continues the color story you're telling. we see those pinks and blues within the wig. so did the color scheme come from the wig, or did the wig come from the color scheme?
this is not to say that only white dudes (or all white dudes) are fans of unsavory artists like tarantino or louis c.k. plenty of men have been happy to note that they never liked tarantino anyway, and plenty of women loved louie and manhattan and pulp fiction and have been struggling, in the aftermath of unsavory allegations, to resolve their admiration of the art with the personal crimes of the artists. (personally, i never had the stomach for tarantino films ― blood makes me queasy ― but i grew up on allen's daffy early films and liked a decent amount of louis c.k.'s comedy.)

it is arbitrary and inequitable to punish mr. higgs more severely than the actual killer, higgs' lawyers argued in a clemency petition to trump, urging the outgoing president to commute their client's sentence to life without the possibility of parole. mr. higgs has adjusted exceptionally well to life in prison and has long been a model prisoner. his demonstrated record of positive adjustment makes him particularly well-suited to peacefully live out the remainder of his life in custody.

but does that mean people are inclined to let the republicans off easy? the post/abc survey, which instead ties trump and the congressional gop together, finds them mutually shouldering the blame. and in the huffpost/yougov poll, gop legislators' overall marks on the shutdown are actually worse than either trump's or their democratic counterparts'.

keep a few of these addictive bars handy and you won't be tempted by a vending machine, cookie jar or convenience-store sweet. dried cherries, sesame seeds and walnuts make for a perfect sweet-savory mix and stay bound together with coconut butter and either agave nectar or dark honey (which has a richer flavor than light honey).
christians have always benefited from the cautions implicit in the gospels' teaching of the resurrection as more like a beloved voice than a face. put plainly, the stories say that faith is not about things seen, that seeing is not believing. early on, people urgently needed this message, so of course the churches learned fast which sorts of vessels could hold the holy fire for faith from generation to generation. only stories have that quality. no doctrine, no essay like this, can carry the flame.

as for the wig, in the script i think it just said a colorful wig, and the amazing hair and makeup designers brought a few options. it needed to serve a few purposes. these are guys that she'd been to college with, so she needed to be unrecognized. she needed the makeup to be heavy. she needed the wig to mask her, because even though we've implied in the movie that she looks very different — because [burnham's character] ryan can hardly tell who she is when he first encounters her at the coffee shop — she still needs to be careful, because al barely recognizes her until she says who she is. but also what i didn't want it to be was too neat and tidy. the reason that cassie brings sneakers to walk up the hill and then changes into her red shoes only once she'd gotten to the top is because, if you're making a film that's very stylized, you also need to always keep an eye on those things that do feel a bit bogus, like hair not being out of place if you've walked up a fucking mountain in stilettos. so there's something about that wig that i liked. it was a bit messy. there needed to be that moment because every revenge movie has that moment.

i think the community as a whole perpetuates a sense that desirability itself only comes with a six-pack and chiseled good looks, we see this on every dating app where men will openly and unapologetically write muscular, fit men only or no fats, disguising their fat-phobia and racism as just their preference. and it's so ironic because we're a community that's built on the notion of inclusion and acceptance, but sometimes it feels like belonging comes with a requirement of being white and having a six-pack. and i think one of the worst things about the lgbtq community is that these problematic attitudes are so normalized, and even though so many of us publicly talk about how harmful these attitudes are, they still persist.

when a fault is immature - that is, producing earthquakes for less than a few millions years - its segments are clearly disconnected so that it is mechanically difficult for an earthquake rupture to travel from one segment to the next. but as the fault produces more and more earthquakes over time and hence becomes more mature, its segments connect more and more to each other. when the segment connection is more complete, a new rupture can progress forward more easily along the fault.

black women have been told that the misogyny of rappers must go unchecked. that the largely black and male artists who dominate the genre must be allowed to tell their truths without restriction. we've long understood that the violent, racist nature of law enforcement means that we cannot seek police aid when we are harmed by one of our own men without risking the possibility that he will be harmed by a responding officer. we know that those same officers are unlikely to believe us or show us the sort of empathy befitting a victim. we've also been taught to believe that fast black teen girls are to blame when adult men engage them for sex that they cannot legally consent to have.

loeffler, a former wall street executive, is the richest member of congress, and her husband is the chairman of the new york stock exchange. in april, she came under significant criticism for trading millions of dollars in stocks after receiving a closed-door senate briefing on the coronavirus in january ― before many americans understood the severity of the virus. while loeffler said at the time that she did nothing wrong with the trades, she announced that she and her husband would liquidate their individual stock shares to move on from the distraction. in the runoffs, perdue and loeffler tied themselves closely to president donald trump, putting them at odds with the republican political establishment in their own state. they backed trump's efforts to discredit and overturn the presidential election results in georgia, even as the state's top gop officials ― including the governor and the secretary of state ― stood by the results.

new delhi — on 5 june, 2019, the trump administration removed india from its generalised system of preference program (gsp), a preferential trade agreement for developing countries under which indian goods worth $5.7 billion had gone into the united states duty free. a day after the u.s. president donald trump announced his first official trip to india, his government removed india from a list of developing countries that are given trade benefits on the grounds that india is a member of the g-20. this naturally makes it harder for india to regain its gsp status, a key demand from new delhi in the fraught negotiations with washington.

more than anything else, i am famous in our social circle for being a political junkie. i have watched every presidential debate since i was 3 years old, starting with barack obama's re-election campaign. my favorite news sources are huffpost, npr and msnbc. i am obsessed with rachel maddow. maybe because she grew up in the same bay area city where i was born. i even had a chance to ask my congressman, eric swalwell, at a recent community meeting about the democrats' supreme court strategy. but i think he was more focused on my age instead of my question. by the way, he is 1 of 1,000 democrats thinking about running for president!

luckily, big, chunky sweaters are everywhere in stores right now, as most brands are still stocking their winter collections. soon enough, the stock will change, but that just means you'll probably be able to snag some cozy knits on sale. or, if you're feeling extra crafty, you can try your hand at knitting your own chunky sweater; trendy knitting brands like we are knitters and wool and the gang have plenty of kits available. they don't necessarily come cheap ― though you can also find tons of super affordable and free patterns online ― but considering you could easily spend upward of $100 or even $200 for a big, cozy sweater, making your own doesn't seem so bad.
beto o'rourke is the latest potential 2020 presidential candidate to get behind a green new deal.
a potential dilemma facing the new democratic leadership of the senate will be the future of the filibuster, a senate procedural rule that requires 60 votes to pass significant legislation. the use of the filibuster has been weakened over time ― it no longer comes into play for cabinet appointments and judicial appointments ― but many democrats would like to shelve it completely. others, though, have hesitated to embrace that view.
i have reached the two-year mark of my divorce now, and i can see that something happens to you when spend time alone and do things you never thought you could do, when you carry the impossible. i take out the trash. i sleep alone. i pay the bills. i've attended real estate closings alone. weddings alone. parent conferences alone. soccer games alone with my chair for one. and at first it is all terrifying and depressing, but then you break through that initial moment, and it liberates you from everything that tied you before. i'm doing hard things, but i'm okay. what you want in a partner is a list that begins to change with the first passing seasons of your time by yourself, and the bar creeps a little higher each time.

hasen advocates levelling campaign financing up as well as down. spending limits of $25,000 per election with a two year aggregate cap of $500,000 (and an exemption for media corporations which cover elections), he claims, would neither benefit incumbents nor inhibit competition. a $100 voucher, which every eligible voter could give to a candidate, political party or advocacy support, might even enhance political participation. pointing to decades of experience with campaign finance limits in the united states and from the much stricter systems in great britain and canada, hasen insists that his proposals will not endanger freedom of speech or freedom of the press.

the right answer here is simple. staffing levels need to increase, so too does guard training. this training should not simply be about protecting themselves, but also about deescalating situations. again, personal experience has it that prison guards that are rude, cruel, or just plain old disrespectful are the ones who tend to have authority problems in the housing units and other areas of the prison. for example, an associate warden at fci petersburg was recently assaulted in the cafeteria after insulting an inmate. following her insulting the inmate she was punched and had to beat off her attacker with an umbrella. would a more effective weapon have subdued the attacker faster or more efficiently? yes. but had the associate warden acted in a responsible and professional manner in the first place the attack itself would have been avoided entirely.

it said plans were at an advanced stage to create a group made up of victims of sexual abuse known as the international survivor advisory panel (isap) to offer consultation on abuse prevention from the survivor's perspective.
it is impossible for us to predict what the prevalence of the virus will be in any given country or part of the u.s. at any future date, she said. community transmission is now occurring in the united states, so at some point soon it may be no more risky to leave the country than to stay where you are. some public health experts advocate restricting travel as a means to stop the global spread of the disease, but that is a public health measure not aimed at individual safety.

americans are growing more concerned by the day about the spread of the new coronavirus in the u.s., a new huffpost/yougov poll finds, with the share who say they've been personally affected rising rapidly within the past week. attitudes toward the outbreak and to the government response, however, remain sharply divided along partisan lines.
delta ceo ed bastian says the airline has increased security after capitol insurrection:
a sense of complacency in an organization can be seen and felt. customer comments and requests are discounted or even ignored. decisions seem to take forever. there is a prevailing attitude that says, why do something today that can be put off until tomorrow? a culture that alienates rather than connects: a vibrant culture fosters a strong connection to the organization's vision and values. it is the intangible that gives your operation an edge. organizations suffering from a toxic culture rarely become marketplace heroes.
using the word try gives us a safety net to fail and does not communicate full commitment to ourselves or others, said melissa wolak, a holistic mindset and transformative coach and speaker in boulder, colorado.
the secret to getting starting on a seemingly impossible task is to focus on what you do know how to do at the moment, take things one step at a time and learn as you go.
democratic lawmakers recognized the inadequacy of their efforts back in the spring. house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) began referring to phases of the legislative response ― cares was phase three (congress, it turns out, had actually passed two previous phases of relief so negligible as to have already been forgotten). when the next bill merely topped-up an almost instantly exhausted small business relief program, lawmakers changed phase four to phase three-and-a-half. and when no further relief came from washington for several more months, pelosi stopped talking about phases.
the american health care system is bad. it's too expensive, it's horribly inefficient, and too many people don't have access to care. if bezosbuffettdimoncare can help, that would be a welcome miracle. the wall street journal tellingly compares this initiative to bezos' funding private space flight and elon musk's hyperloop project.
the cdc now urges anyone who has had an allergic reaction to other types of vaccines in the past to consult with their doctor before they consider the covid-19 vaccine. the group also states that anyone with a known allergy to polyethylene glycol (peg) or polysorbate should not get a covid-19 vaccine.

we're not complaining, though. we actually really love cozy sweaters ― if you ask us, the chunkier the knit the better ― and it seems the fashionable folks on instagram do too. we've been seeing tons of our favorite style stars on the photo-sharing app rocking the style, and we also saw plenty of chunky knits on the fall 2018 runways at the likes of vivienne tam, fendi and isabel marant. (can you tell we're a little obsessed?)
of the redemption runways, i most loved kennedy's (a reimagining of her infamous death becomes her look), aja's (which shows how much she's progressed in a year), and ben's (an elegant update). i admire shangela for doing a full snowglobe look for her queen who mopped christmas ru-do, but the execution was somewhat muddled.
stafford dropped $165 to file three lawsuits in russell county general district court. one lawsuit was against the lebanon dmv itself, and two were against specific employees.
it was, for me, a decision of looking at her performance in its entirety, and realizing that if we went in to try to alter it, we inevitably would have to lose some scenes which i thought were scenes that the fans should have ― that people who loved leia would have, he said. i would never have wanted to lose her conversation with luke or her conversation with holdo or the final moment with rey. those are just things that i feel like we deserved to have from leia in this movie, so that included the scenes where she is lying in her chamber unconscious, and [it's] uncomfortable to watch. it's also part of the story.
their first order of business, however, likely will be a bid to pass another covid-19 relief package. biden and democrats have promised to push for $2,000 in direct payments to americans who meet certain economic criteria — a proposal mcconnell systematically blocked as the last congress ended in favor of checks totaling only $600.

my social life has changed in several ways since my son's diagnosis. i cannot call just any babysitter in order to attend social gatherings. my husband and i have to diligently go through our very limited list of friends and family members who aren't terrified of giving my son his insulin medication despite us holding their hands through the process. william's diagnosis means that i don't allow him to go to sleepovers unless the parent is adequately trained to attend to my son's needs.

in fact, this is where some chefs start. executive chef maria grubb of underground dining club and ― until covid-19 forced its closure ― renowned gallo negro in san juan, puerto rico, reminisces, it reminds me of being a kid and watching local chefs on the 12 o'clock cooking segment during summertime … all those clear ramekins with ingredients going into mixing bowls and pots made me smile.
i am thrilled about joining the judiciary committee because i have centered and see an urgent need for democracy reforms in this country. we talk a lot as progressives about big structural changes ― medicare for all, a green new deal, housing as a human right and policies that would reflect that. but none of that stuff is possible unless we root the corrosive influence of money out of our politics. and also, draw congressional districts in a way that will cause members of congress to be responsive to the american people.
i shouldn't even have to post this as you guys should already know where i stand but if you do not pls know i unequivocally repudiate any and all hateful comments against the lgbtq community. actually i'm tired of that label. we all belong to the same community, a shared community called humanity. and today and tomorrow and the next day i will continue to stand with other like minded people who condemn any and all statements and actions that would seek to deny the basic humanity of our fellow brothers and sisters. we cannot sit idly by nor will we speak silently when we are confronted with such violence against members of our community. i am personally beyond exhausted by the ignorance and bigotry living in some people. at times i want to punch and i want to slap a lot of people when i read and hear the shit that comes out their mouthes !!! i will rejoice when folks stop thinking they are god, jesus' assistant, picking and choosing what sins are acceptable in the bible, and using the bible as a whip! we can't afford anymore tearing down of our shared humanity. my advice: if your religion is causing you to spew out words of hate, judge, or look down on others because of who one loves then you need to change it. and fast. if the religion don't make you are more loving or better person, ditch it. but what do i know.

what's needed in 2021 is for nations to take aggressive action toward transformative change that addresses the linked needs of people and nature. in september, 64 world leaders signed the leaders' pledge for nature, committing to reverse biodiversity loss by tackling pollution, putting climate and the environment at the heart of pandemic recovery plans and building sustainable economies. all countries need to take all of the actions within this pledge. the world's nations must also commit to an aggressive agenda for systemic change when they meet at the united nation's biodiversity conference in may.

it was a humbling lesson to learn that in spite of my head full of sex facts, and my uncommon comfort with the topic (i even publicly chronicled my experiences in a memoir, sex in the museum: my unlikely career at new york's most provocative museum), none of it had truly prepared me for the identity navigation i would need to endure once becoming a mother. not only was it a mind, body and soul upheaval, but unexpectedly it was also a confrontation with a societal mirror on maternal sexuality that left me totally perplexed. was i meant to now prove i'm still sexy in spite of being a mother or did sexiness somehow make me maternally inappropriate?
matthew lawrence, a law professor at emory university, argued in the yale journal on regulation this week that biden's administration could even use the law to undo waivers granted to states to enact medicaid work requirements — a policy change that would otherwise need the support of 60 senators.

for months after my tearful phone call to my principal, i was unable to say the word retired. i didn't post it on my social media platforms, and i only told people if it was unavoidable. even now, after more than five months of being home 24/7, i am still reluctant to admit i'm retired.

about a year later, i interviewed him for another magazine and we had pizza at the sbarro's in times square. this was in 1994, at the height of the east coast west / coast rap feuds, and tupac had just been shot a few blocks from where we had pizza. when the meal ended i remember being relieved to get away from puffy because being shot by accident while standing next to diddy is a stupid way to die.

this interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.
and then the other thing was, it felt like [if it has a positive ending] then it is the same as every other movie. you're cheating because you want what we all want, which is for things to be ok. but they're not ok at the end of the movie, and they're not ok still. you don't want to leave that film and think, oh, great, cool. what are we having for dinner? because even if people find it hard to swallow or difficult to stomach or they just don't agree with it or they don't like it, i understand that. but the reason we got such a stellar cast and people like nancy steiner, who's our costume designer, who did twin peaks and the virgin suicides, is because those people came on board because they believed in it. they just completely understood it. i felt in my bones it was right, and so did the other people, but that's not to say that there weren't other people who passed on it because they didn't like that.

if you look into the deal, it's nothing of great substance. it's a lot of chinese declaration to buy more from the americans and nothing more than that. nothing on intellectual property, nothing on theft of intellectual property or forced transfer of technology to chinese counterparts. none of those systemic changes or reforms, but just a lot of commitments. that too is enough for trump to go back to his base and say that he has been productive in term one. i think that's a calculation that we are making as well

some democrats are supporting a bill that would provide backpay for people like howard who work under federal contracts and lost wages because of the shutdown. such a bill has not made it into law in the past. i hope that congress will step up to the plate and pass some kind of bill for the contractors who aren't getting anything, howard said.
likewise, the trump administration shuffled judges to the border in an attempt to rush through the cases of central american families that have shown up in larger numbers in recent years, often requesting asylum ― effectively putting cases guaranteed to be lengthy at the front of the jam-packed docket. but the judges didn't share then-attorney general jeff sessions' enthusiasm for disposing of asylum cases quickly and skeptically. and the backlog in their home jurisdictions grew, too.

her vulnerability to a challenge could speak to the changing nature of the democratic electorate. support for a green new deal unites disparate primary voters from the 2016 election. among new york 4th congressional district voters who picked sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) in 2016, 55 percent said they would support a pro-green new deal candidate, compared to 8 percent who wouldn't. among voters who picked former secretary of state hillary clinton in the 2016 primary, support for a green new deal proponent hit 46 percent, compared to 19 percent who don't.
but letting black men escape accountability isn't some sort of retribution for our ancestors who were murdered over false accusations, or for our peers who languish behind bars for crimes that they did not commit. those of us who really care about justice should focus on creating a world where the race of an abuser will not protect him from punishment, nor ensure that he will be unduly punished.

i can't think of a single, valid reason to use a broker and many compelling reasons why you should avoid them. the most striking one is they don't have to place your interest above their own. they can -- and often do -- sell you investment products that generate the highest fees for themselves and their firm, when less expensive options are available, with higher expected returns. they don't even have to disclose this conflict of interest. you can find more information about this low standard of care brokers are legally obligated to provide here.

does that suggest that the stories were invented? not at all. they didn't invent them, your dialogue partner said. absolutely right -- if invention refers to an inventor with designs and desires to influence the public. across the whole world, no one ever invented a story with power to draw souls into awareness of divine grace. people rather discovered the stories, by the grace of god -- together, in communities, according to their most sublime and practical needs. the origins of the stories are shrouded in mysteries that need no probing (although they can withstand any amount of it) because an open heart and mind receive quite naturally the meaning of a godly story. it has nothing to do with fretting its facts. faith's cares are different. so of course anyone is christian who feels drawn to the light of the story like a wanderer to a candle in a window. on this question, the apostles creed has no vote.

a majority of states will see a revenue increase if they do nothing, but their taxpayers also will pay more. that's because the new federal law eliminated many tax breaks, meaning federal taxes are assessed on more income. the federal tax code, however, tried to help taxpayers out by also increasing the standard deduction, lowering their tax liability. if states use the income line from the federal form as a starting point, but don't adjust the deductions underneath, state residents would pay more.

the board's continued secrecy, not only to the employees they oversee, but also to the public who rightly want full accountability, has irreparably damaged the board's credibility, baker-hytch wrote dec. 20. the only way i can see the public credibility of this organisation being restored is for there to be a brand-new global board of directors and global ceo, none of whom are zacharias family members, and to file form 990s ... for the years they haven't been filed.

the production of in her own words may very well have been a powerful, even life-altering, experience for those involved with it. that's beautiful and special. the fact that it happened within the context of an exploitative and demeaning project isn't a contradiction; that's basically the american story in a nutshell. but to conflate an individual's positive feelings with an empowering end product is counterproductive and shameless, even by the standards of the sports illustrated swimsuit issue.
it went on to ask, so how many big ideas emerge from spills, crashes, failed experiments and blind stabs? thousands of inventors reported that their idea evolved when they were working on an unrelated project -- and often when they weren't even trying to invent anything. this is why we need to know far more about the habits that transform a mistake into a breakthrough.

the federal government is responsible for enforcing immigration law, so no one truly obsessed with deporting people would allow the federal government to shut down because that would further jam up a complex enforcement system that is already backlogged in the federal courts by more than 1 million cases.

the expanded pipeline is to carry diluted bitumen from alberta's oil sands to the british columbia coast for export overseas.
trump's other actions have undermined enforcement, too. within a week of taking office, he signed a sweeping executive order that, among other things, did away with obama-era prosecutorial discretion guidelines that had directed ice to focus its arrests on people with serious criminal records, recent border-crossers or people with previous deportations on their records. the message, which trump's first acting director of ice, thomas homan, repeated often, was clear: no one would be exempt from enforcement of federal law.
however, the target of a $5 trillion economy will take longer than expected by the government, business today pointed out. for india to get to the $5 trillion mark, it needed to grow at 11-12% nominal rate for the next five-years. central statistical office (cso) said in its first advanced estimate released in january that the nominal gdp growth, which includes rate of inflation, is expected to fall to 7.5% in financial year 2019-20, as hindustan times pointed out.

for me it is mainly when writing a new book, when it is going well and flowing spontaneously, when i feel i am taking dictation from an unseen force. but it is also when i make a quick decision on a particular investment that i am sure has high potential upside; and also when i am discussing a new idea (new to me) or project over lunch. books clearly take quite a bit of time to write; but the two other times when i feel i am achieving most can take place in small fragments of time, measured in a few hours or even minutes. and i know when a book is going to sell well, because it is fast and easy to write, and really the ideas come almost automatically.

the first response i'd have offered to your questions is, how would you know? a teacher who gives all the answers and assumes the questioner will take the shape of empty, ignorant vessel disserves both student and himself. a good teacher wants to know how the inquirer is expecting to learn. how does she think one can know of things above? does she want to be told what is so, like a child? is she ready to go higher? am i a christian? you asked. how would you know? who, in your conception of reality, has the right, the power, even the duty to tell you what is so with the things of god?
if trump did back daca, it would still be a sell to democrats in congress. house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) and other leaders have said that deal is no longer on the table, after trump rejected it last year. it would take a substantial amount of trust that trump wouldn't just change his mind and somehow find a way out of daca, perhaps by offering a new executive order to override the legislation.

trump invoked the defense production act, empowering him to order companies to make what the country needs. this raised expectations that a new wave of emergency supplies generally and ventilators in particular could come to the aid of patients and the people looking after them.
more than half of people who leave their jobs do so because of their relationship with their boss. smart companies make certain their managers know how to balance being professional with being human. these are the bosses who celebrate an employee's success, empathize with those going through hard times, and challenge people, even when it hurts. bosses who fail to really care will always have high turnover rates. it's impossible to work for someone eight-plus hours a day when they aren't personally involved and don't care about anything other than your production yield.
the other source of relationship tension is inside you. it is the self-doubt that has developed over a lifetime of compounding experiences of betrayal, abuse, and neglect.

it is connected to gsp because gsp is a preferential trade arrangement only for the developing countries. now, when indian negotiators go back to the table and say that we want gsp back, the americans will say that you are classified as a developed country from now on. that is the american way of negotiating that has increasingly come to the fore under robert lighthizer (united states trade representative). this is classic american conservatism on trade.

there's been a lot of talk along the lines of when this is all over and when things get back to normal. i think, by and large, many people's lives will return to normal eventually. they'll go shopping without their masks and gloves, browse leisurely, and stop to chat in the aisles. they'll return to pre-coronavirus behaviors such as not wiping down surfaces they touch, not using copious amounts of hand sanitizer, and for the most part not thinking much at all about germs.
huffpost spoke with several experts about some of the biggest myths still circulating about the immunizations:

yet i do not expect anything to change. the proud boys have been emboldened by the reception they got in washington on jan. 6, which fell just short of a warm welcome. white extremist groups are openly planning another attack the week of jan. 20 when president-elect joe biden and vice president-elect kamala harris will be sworn in to office, and the fbi has warned of plans for armed protests at all 50 state capitals. across the city, neighbors are urging one another to take down airbnb listings and to remove black lives matter signs and rainbow flags from their windows for fear of being targeted.
i've saved milk for last, even though she's just safe this week, because there's a lot to say about the lactose queen. during the premiere, while trixie, kennedy, and bebe seemed happy to be called safe, milk looked annoyed. this week, she doubles down, whispering angrily to fellow safe queens trixie and aja at the back of the stage after her performance as celine dion registers as neither spectacular nor disappointing with the judges.

there is no european-wide polling data on a political union, but it appears that the support for the eu is diminishing in its core. in a recent survey, 40 percent of finns wanted to leave the eu. also, only 53 percent of dutch are against a new referendum on the eu, which means that 47 percent are either for it or do not know their stand. for permanent income transfers, you would need to change the maastricht treaty and ratify it in each member country or to negotiate several bilateral agreements. there is only a very small likelihood that these would go through, for example, in finland and in the netherlands.

those who resist change are reminiscent of the ex-confederates who, in the years following the civil war, preferred to dream of a south that never was and never could be rather than accept one that was within the reach of all, if they would join together and make it so, historian john hope franklin wrote in the foreword for democracy betrayed in 1998. but many whites in the post-civil war south saw change — any change — as unsettling and dangerous, and they wanted no part of it.
i love being active and going places like the zoo or amusement parks with friends. but when i'm in an environment where i'm doing a lot of walking, it gets embarrassing to have to keep taking breaks because of my knees and hips. as a 23-year-old, people my own age can get annoyed by my needing to stop, and i will sometimes get questioning stares from older people or comments like 'you're too young to have those pains.' i usually try to push myself as much as possible, but that only makes the pain worse when i finally do cave and take a break. – shelby c.

there all many schools of thought about how to start and have a successful year. some say making new year's resolutions is the way to go. others say creating a vision board works best. or perhaps just pick one word for the year and that be your goal and focus. while the ritual of each process is great, the outcome will be no different than waiting on another year if there is no behavior change.

the southern segment of the amatrice-monte vettore fault might have broken today, possibly completing the rupture of the entire system. but the hazard is not over because other faults exist around the amatrice-monte vettore system: in the north, several faults have not ruptured for centuries; in the west, where there are other faults that are likely to be mechanically connected with the amatrice-monte vettore system; and in the south, where the huge gran sasso fault system has not ruptured for centuries.

travis hornsby, founder of student loan planner, suggests creating a refinancing ladder to maximize your savings. the way you do this is start with a payment you can afford pretty easily, say, a 10- or 15-year loan. pay extra when you have extra, and you'll cut down the amount that you owe rapidly, hornsby explained. after a couple of years, you can refinance again to a seven-year loan, often with the same payment but with a lower interest rate. finally, you could refinance one more time to a five-year loan before you finish paying off the entire amount.

there is a long tradition in english of using plural pronouns (such as 'they,' 'their,' or 'them') for a singular character, rather than ascribing gender in a seemingly indeterminate fashion, the site notes. the habit of always using 'he,' 'him,' or 'his' began to be strongly advocated for after 18th century grammarians decided that indefinite pronouns should be singular.

i know some people feel like the timeline is rushed. but honestly, if we poured a basically unlimited amount of money into science, had a disease that was affecting the entire population, and had the whole world working on it all the time, we could probably get treatments and vaccines to market on whole hosts of disease fast. it's a good example of how well science can work when we give it adequate resources and provide government assistance in getting it across the finish line.

you asked whether the resurrection must be taken literally. in no uncertain terms, you were told it must. yet the dialogue did not really probe what you called the easter stories' fuzzy account of jesus' bodily presence. in fact, all but one of the resurrection stories include the detail that the evidence of witness by sight was weak or faulty or irrelevant. this gospel chorus comes on forte. in each story, what brings witnesses to new life in christ is hearing their lord. not seeing. even years after the crucifixion-resurrection, the apostle paul's experience of meeting the christ first blinds him. only then does he hear himself addressed. paul would one day write, faith comes through what is heard.

growing up, i never questioned the impact of my upbringing and carried it with me in stride. it gave me immense pride knowing that the tireless work ethic and focus my parents had instilled in me could inspire my best moments. i thanked them in my high school graduation speech as valedictorian. i gifted my first year-end bonus to my parents entirely in cash, knowing my father would never deposit a check.

people, please, let's come together as individuals and be respectful of our differences. there will never be a perfect scenario for any of us but if we accept that we can disagree, engage in fruitful discourse, and fight our fights with dignity and empathy, we can make our country, and ultimately our lives, better. is it possible that good things might happen during the next administration? only time will tell. but what is possible is that we can, at least, give it a chance.
the complete lack of energy. i understand that it's my fibro. others just see lazy. – michelle p.
sometimes it would be two or three guys in a row. as soon as i closed the door on the last guy, i'd think, that didn't hit the spot, then i'd find another one. it went on like this for years. last thanksgiving, he was back home to visit his parents and felt a compulsive need to have sex because he was so stressed out. when he finally found a guy nearby who was willing to hook up, he ran to his parents' room and started rifling through their drawers to see if they had any viagra. so that was the rock-bottom moment? i ask. that was the third or fourth, yeah, he says. adam's now in a 12-step program for sex addiction. it's been six weeks since he's had sex. before this, the longest he had ever gone was three or four days. there are people who have lots of sex because it's fun, and that's fine. but i kept trying to wring it out like a rag to get something out of it that wasn't in there—social support, or companionship. it was a way of not dealing with my own life. and i kept denying it was a problem because i had always told myself, 'i've come out, i moved to san francisco, i'm done, i did what i had to do as a gay person.'
like his movie, farrelly's speech glossed over the systemic and institutional causes of racism, revealing a simplistic and tone-deaf mentality that felt completely devoid of substance ― and that didn't jibe with the meaningful moments that characterized the earlier parts of sunday's ceremony.
it may provide a false sense of protection and perhaps lead to not incorporating the measures that have been shown to be effective, harry said. face masks are recommended for people who have respiratory infection to prevent droplets from spreading from them.
she had a very, very difficult upbringing in korea: she was an orphan on the streets, living out of trash cans and starving as a 6-year-old. and she was picked up and put in an orphanage. and so i've been able to really make her life better. i provided her with enormous opportunities, and she has sparked to them.

most republicans aren't willing to condone the rioting, but equally few are willing to whole-heartedly condemn its participants. in answering a separate question, 22% of republicans say the actions of those storming the capitol were mostly right, 23% say they were mostly wrong, and a 46% plurality say they went too far, but they have a point.

the consequences of the partial government shutdown are mounting ― for national parks, airports, food inspections, emergency preparations and a host of other services. some 800,000 federal workers missed their first paycheck on friday, prompting fears among many of taking on debt to pay for food, medication, rent and loans.

the real threat to the swimsuit issue may not be that women's protests will bring it down, he wrote. no, the threat is that women will co-opt it. instead of taking offense at the swimsuit models, women may have become more inclined to identify with them and to look like them. … more than 400 women a day get breast enlargements, lifts or reductions, and according to self they tell plastic surgeons that the desire to change — to look more like an si model — is their own, not some man's, idea.
historically at a royal wedding reception, the bride's father would speak on her behalf, and the other speeches are reserved for the groom and the best man, harrison said, adding that markle would be breaking centuries of royal tradition if she gave a speech at her reception.
avoid the temptation to do nothing at all. doing nothing is safe, comfortable, easy and will get you absolutely nowhere. there are very few rewards when you do nothing. the enemy of nothing is saddling up. complacency, average and good enough will have a challenge keeping up with you when you get in the saddle and ride off into the sunset.

it's important that people know that international travel may have exposed them to the novel coronavirus and they may not know, she said.
police departments in states including washington and california, as well as washington, d.c., are investigating social media posts in which their officers reportedly sympathized with rioters, shared conspiracy theories about election fraud or both. the secret service is also looking into facebook posts from a female agent, the washington post reported.

although it may be challenging to find precisely the same covid-19 virus in animals as in humans, discovering closely related viruses might help explain how the disease first jumped from animals and clarify what preventive measures are needed to avoid future epidemics.
not being able to move away from this top heavy approach is a failure. if we had moved away then we wouldn't have been at a stage where a head of state, in this case trump, would be used as a leverage point to say — he is coming next week — do you want to get this deal done or not. if we had progressed on building this relationship on multiple levels, these issues would not play out in the open. these would be settled behind a consultative dialogue that happens behind closed doors.
the scientific community has made it very clear in telling us that climate change is real and is causing devastating harm to our country and the entire planet, sanders said. they have told us in no uncertain terms that if we do not transform our energy system away from fossil fuel, our nation and our planet and the planet we will be leaving our kids and grandchildren may well become unhealthy and even uninhabitable in the not-so-distant future.
if you must increase how much work your talented employees are doing, you'd better increase their status as well. talented employees will take on a bigger workload, but they won't stay if their job suffocates them in the process. raises, promotions, and title-changes are all acceptable ways to increase workload. if you simply increase workload because people are talented, without changing a thing, they will seek another job that gives them what they deserve.

back in 1966 when john denver wrote 'leaving on a jet plane', air travel was so much simpler. here's how old i am. i remember the chad mitchell trio's recording of the song from 1967 and peter, paul and mary's 1970 version. so wish me luck on my cuban adventure and, as the song says, tell me that you'll wait for me...'cause i'm leavin' on a jet plane... oh babe, i hate to go.

the downside is there is a cap on how much you can earn in order to be eligible for a roth ira. the income limit for single filers in 2019 is $122,000–$137,000, depending on the contribution amount. roth ira contribution limits are the same as traditional iras. and despite the benefits, there are a few other reasons why you might want to think twice about contributing to a roth ira.
dry farm wines even makes the claim that its wines are hangover-free, which is impossible, according to the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism, since alcohol is the main cause of hangovers. fitvine wine is less dramatic about what makes it different from conventional wine, but keeps its claims vague.
trump also had little desire to pressure beijing or criticize its president, xi jinping, with whom he wanted to secure cooperation on ending a yearlong trade war before the reelection campaign kicked into high gear. when trump fielded his first question about the virus in davos, he enthusiastically praised xi's response, going well beyond the calibrated risk-reward messaging his aides were encouraging.
mais le chef de l'état ferait mieux de s'habituer à ce genre de salves. car les personnalités élues avec l'étiquette macroniste -et s'étant mis en retrait du parti présidentiel en critiquant son fonctionnement- entonnent désormais le même refrain. nous savons ce que nous devons au président. mais sait-il ce qu'il doit à ceux qui l'ont suivi et porté? seuls comptent les citoyens au final, a réagi dans un tweet la députée du nord jennifer de temmerman, qui avait quitté le groupe lrem courant novembre.
fourth, she met with ethnic leaders and assured them they would have a voice in the government. the offer of a seat at the table was a message that needed to be heard. much still needs to be done to resolve the bloody ethnic conflicts that have gone on for more than 60 years. but inclusiveness signals respect. it opens to door to dialogue. and dialogue opens the way to change. the process is sure to be messy. but the alternative is worse.

my toddler son was once driven to the point of a meltdown when a capitol police officer took his snack cup out of my bag for closer inspection because of its odd shape on the x-ray machine. my toddler's snack was inspected by a capitol police officer for long enough that my son thought he would never get his snack back.

successful brands are 'human brands' in that they evidence evolved human behaviours such as the ability to adapt, simplify, actively listen and speak clearly. as part of this, human brands need to understand where their brand can best connect across the spectrum of human relationships. we needed to move the relationship people have with belvita from more of a low awareness 'casual acquaintance' to a 'friends with benefits' (fwb) relationship – which is still not brand love right now, but more of a benefit-led value exchange. another good example of this relationship type would be easyjet. belvita, with its slow release energy to keep going through the whole morning, seemed like a perfect candidate as an fwb.
our body does so using two primary mechanisms, she explained: by changing our breathing rate ― making it faster to release more carbon dioxide, which is acidic when dissolved in the blood, or slower to maintain co2 levels ― or by releasing bicarbonate from the kidneys if our ph dips or excreting it in the case of excessive alkalinity. diets will also have no tangible impact on our ph levels for the same reasons.

finally, another craze that's been alarming dietitians is going heavier than needed on protein. with keto, paleo and now the carnivore diets flourishing in a world growing more distrustful of carbs, protein has been crowned the new nutritional king. however, not all protein is created equal, which is why the fda requires the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score to be used when declaring protein claims on packaged foods, peacock said. this can be an easy step for manufacturers to miss, making their claims misleading.

adults are constantly telling me how to think and what to say. but mostly what not to say! after my doctors tested my iq to be above the 99.9th percentile in third grade and said my eq (emotional intelligence) was also surprisingly high, everything changed and adults started taking me more seriously ― i finally felt that i was being heard. the tests showed that i was something called profoundly gifted. i was admitted into mensa international, a program for individuals with a high iq, and became a davidson institute young scholar. my parents started getting professional advice in order to learn more about the needs of profoundly-gifted kids, and they moved me to a specialized elementary school. today we live in the san francisco bay area suburb of pleasanton, and i attend both fourth grade and college. i am having an awesome time.

much like was the case with mike pettine in cleveland, the argument to remove smith could have started on defense. that side of the ball was smith's expertise coming in, but tampa bay struggled to grasp his complex system last season and continued to go through the motions at times in year 2. during the season-ending four-game skid, the buccaneers surrendered 29.8 points per game, although the offense's eight combined turnovers certainly contributed to the elevated number.

2016 found me in auto-recovery mode after leaving behind 2015 which was a momentous year of change and first-hand experiences - including dealing with newly involved political players in my homeland greece, spearheading change in a public space that is known to be challenging and rather inflexible (greece and the eu), and negotiating on the side of the greek government vis-à-vis the country's lenders. in so many ways, this was a tough and taxing experience.

in 1955, a milk arsenic poisoning case was linked to the deaths of more than 100 children. soon afterward, in a separate scandal, scientists documented horrific symptoms among people who had eaten seafood in minamata in southern japan. minamata disease, discovered in 1956, was connected to the release of mercury in industrial wastewater from a nearby chemical factory.

that dream never came to pass. even after drafting defensive tackle danny shelton and signing a handful of high-profile free agents, like cornerback tramon williams, the browns never were able to put it together defensively. they entered week 17 ranked 29th in points allowed and dead last against the run.

the downside is that the contribution limits for iras are much lower than for 401(k)s. for 2019, you can contribute a total of $6,000 across all your ira accounts ($7,000 if you're age 50 or older) or your taxable income for the year, whichever is smaller. you're allowed to begin making penalty-free withdrawals when you turn 59½. once you reach 70½, you can no longer contribute and must start making required minimum distributions instead.

promising young woman — currently playing in select theaters and premiering on video-on-demand platforms jan. 15 — ends with cassie dying at the hands of one of those predators, clean-cut al monroe (chris lowell), a classmate who raped cassie's longtime best friend, nina, and effectively drove her to suicide. al will go down for his crimes not because he violated nina but because he murdered cassie and burned her body with the help of his buddy (max greenfield). no one truly suffers for their sexual transgressions, and that's part of the point: rapists often walk free while survivors absorb the resulting trauma. having learned that her charming beau (bo burnham) was also culpable in nina's assault, cassie risks becoming even more of a shell of herself. she is shrewd enough to know that showing up at al's bachelor party to seek retribution might result in her death, but in some ways, cassie had already died years ago alongside nina, who was like a sister to her.
many americans' views about race relations had improved at the time that obama was inaugurated. unfortunately, americans' views of race relations declined after obama came into office. race riots in places such as ferguson, missouri, and baltimore, maryland, greatly escalated racial tensions and worsened strife between minorities and local police. president obama's attempts to resolve these problems often seemed to make the situation worse.
furthermore, it's not yet clear whether the vaccines prevent individuals from spreading the virus to others. right now, data only shows that they're very effective at preventing the person who has received both doses from developing serious symptoms. that means it's possible that a fully vaccinated person might be exposed to to the coronavirus, become infected without any outward symptoms, and then pass the virus along.

a report in cnbc explains how ocasio-cortez's idea is in line with america's economic history. while the top tax rate stood above 90 percent throughout the 1950s, deductions and tax avoidance led to taxes on the rich being not that much higher, according to a 2017 article by the tax foundation.

castro rose to national prominence in 2012 when the then-mayor was selected to give the keynote address at the democratic national convention. he joined the obama administration as the head of hud two years later, giving him a national profile and feeding speculation that he might become the running mate of his party's 2016 presidential nominee.

there's a lot of unpredictability with this chronic condition. each time my child wakes up with a stomachache or dizzy spell, my first response is to check his numbers. at one point, i shook a sleeping william for half an hour because his blood glucose number dipped down to the 30s. the normal blood glucose range is between 70 and 99 when not eating. anything under 50 on the glucose monitor can mean that only a shot of glucagon ― a hormone that could possibly spike william's sugar to an exceptionally high number within minutes ― could keep my son alive.

we learn our baby girl has non-mosaic turner syndrome ― meaning she has only one x chromosome in all of her cells where there should be two. there are a broad range outcomes for these girls if they are born. most women miscarry with no clue their daughter was afflicted (or perhaps was even a daughter). some girls who are born show no signs of having the condition and only find out they have turner syndrome later in life when they themselves have trouble conceiving.
the flagship coronavirus legislation was the cares act, passed in late march with a unanimous senate vote. conventional wisdom in washington regards the law as a smashing success. even the chronically malcontent left has cheered the cares act for temporarily boosting unemployment benefits by $600 a week ― a level that put modest upward pressure on wages, since some workers found themselves better off financially after losing their jobs. generous provisions for big business prevented a financial panic, and though clumsy, the hundreds of billions of dollars allocated to support small businesses did not go to waste.

under the trump policy, announced in january, a state facing increasing medicaid enrollment or higher spending on medical care for enrollees could choose to jettison people from the program or eliminate covered benefits. the alternative would be for the state to increase its own spending to maintain coverage and benefits, which would be significantly challenging because nearly all states must balance their budgets and can't turn to deficit spending. and given that this proposal is designed to appeal to republican state officials, tax increases to finance additional spending would be unlikely.

if the coronavirus spread is as bad as it's been in italy, the election will only be about the competence of the federal response, which to date trump has completely bungled, tyler said. he lacks the knowledge and leadership to offer any useful information. his mostly irrelevant or non-factual statements have only added to confusion, panic and destabilization. trump should not attend press briefings, tweet or issue statements about coronavirus. he should let the professionals do their work keeping americans healthy and safe.

samantha mcculloch, an analyst at the international energy agency, said finding ways to commercialize the technology could offer an important backstop or hedge. but markets have been slow to develop. the biggest commercial use of capture carbon dioxide at present is for enhanced oil recovery ― shooting captured co₂ at high pressures into nearly exhausted oil wells to extract what remains. houston-based occidental has invested heavily in direct air capture in a bid to ultimately reposition itself as a carbon management company that difficult-to-decarbonize industries, such as airlines or cement makers, may someday pay to remove co₂ emissions from the atmosphere.

the congressional review act is a 1996 law that gives congress the power to nullify any major regulations an executive branch agency finalized within the previous 60 days, not counting periods when congress was out of session for three days or longer. republicans used the act, known as the cra, to hack away at obama-era rules; before that it had only been used once, in 2001.

so what are these top three states doing right? there's no single answer and, as with the international data, it's possible some state reporting is incomplete or slow, making it hard to draw definitive conclusions. but a common factor seems to be their approach to nursing homes. most states in the u.s. are relying heavily on cvs and walgreens, which are the official partners of the trump administration's operation warp speed. but because cvs and walgreens don't always have a presence in rural areas, those three states are relying more heavily on other providers to reach nursing homes.

a primary goal of alchemy is to streamline the testing and fixing process. how is this done? when pages are tested, alchemy evaluates each violation instance and recognizes the characteristics of the element that make it unique. elements are tagged with a signature so they can be identified by the tool in the future. when a component is reused on multiple pages, alchemy recognizes that elements match signatures for previously-resolved issues and automatically deploys the resolution, with no additional work by the tester. this means violations need only be reviewed and resolved once and the resolution is applied to all other instances of the same component. learn more at: www.ssbbartgroup.com

the conventional wisdom on negative emissions has so far been to focus on what can be done cheaply while directing government spending toward arresting the growth of emissions by replacing fossil-fueled transport and energy production with zero-carbon alternatives. but reaching those levels of emission removals by 2050 means going through a lot of costly trial-and-error in the next few decades. and though direct air capture requires prodigious amounts of energy to work ― demanding, at the scale modeled in the study, up to 25% of the nation's electricity production ― existing sources of reliable, 24-hour power could render the technology affordable to run at present prices.

some men definitely sexualize you because of the job. there have been plenty of gross comments made both in person and online. the worst part about it is i can't even defend myself in the way i'd like to when in costume, because i'm required to stay in character at all times. one time, when i was aurora, a teenage boy made a nsfw comment about my rear end. my middle finger was itching as i silently walked away from him.

murtaugh: even the mentally tough reach a limit at some point. what i notice more of in russell now is a darker tone of frustration when the hospital is overwhelmed because people are not following masking and social distancing guidelines and the precarity of basic supplies like personal protective equipment and oxygen. it comes from a feeling that the severity of the pandemic and burden on the health care system was largely preventable. there is also more sadness from the increased amount of death he has seen, especially in young, otherwise healthy people that have died alone in the hospital as a result of covid complications.

4. you are compensated and recognized based upon your performance. hard work should be noticed and although it's wonderful to feel like you are a part of the team, nothing beats a pat on the back, genuine gratitude and/or compensation for extra effort. that doesn't mean you should be expecting a bonus every time you burn the midnight oil or chip in to do an extra project. having a winning job means your employer is aware and gives you two thumbs up for a job well done.
i said yes to the fear of being on this stage tonight because i wanted to be here to look out into this audience and witness this moment of change, co-host sandra oh said at the end of her opening monologue with andy samberg. i'm not fooling myself. next year could be different. it probably will be. but right now, this moment is real. trust me, it is real. because i see you, and i see you. all of these faces of change. and now, so will everyone else.

1. is there debt on the balance sheet? if the answer is yes, the value of your business depends on how much. as an every day example, if your house could be sold for $300,000 today but you have a mortgage (debt) of $200,000, your equity interest is only worth $100,000. the same is true for the business.

capitalism's cycles between good and bad times, as well as the inequality it produces through vast gaps in income and wealth, cause conflict and division. and these tensions threaten the whole system, as the recent yellow jackets mass movement in france demonstrates. there, a fuel tax rise sparked weeks of protest across the country as those who live beyond france's wealthy urban centers rejected ― occasionally violently ― yet another rise in their cost of living and demanded growing concessions from french capitalism.

you have to use the apps in smaller cities, says michael moore, a psychologist at yale. they serve the purpose of a gay bar. but the downside is that they put all this prejudice out there. what the apps reinforce, or perhaps simply accelerate, is the adult version of what pachankis calls the best little boy in the world hypothesis. as kids, growing up in the closet makes us more likely to concentrate our self-worth into whatever the outside world wants us to be—good at sports, good at school, whatever. as adults, the social norms in our own community pressure us to concentrate our self-worth even further—into our looks, our masculinity, our sexual performance. but then, even if we manage to compete there, even if we attain whatever masc-dom-top ideal we're looking for, all we've really done is condition ourselves to be devastated when we inevitably lose it. we often live our lives through the eyes of others, says alan downs, a psychologist and the author of the velvet rage, a book about gay men's struggle with shame and social validation. we want to have man after man, more muscles, more status, whatever brings us fleeting validation. then we wake up at 40, exhausted, and we wonder, is that all there is? and then the depression comes.

for example, researchers with the fred hutchinson cancer research center worked out a model of the puget sound region (around seattle) that showed if the two existing covid-19 vaccines do make individuals non-infectious to others, a fourth wave of the virus in that area could be avoided altogether. if the vaccine simply prevents symptoms in the individual who received it, there's likely to be a fourth wave of about 200,000 new infections in 2021.

republicans generally favor reducing government spending and enrollment in safety net programs. but kicking people off benefits is unpopular, so it's politically easier to push reforms that sound bureaucratic and benign. the new policy's block grants, for instance, are an administrative maneuver masking a clear goal: reduced spending and fewer people getting benefits. in the 1990s, the republican congress and democratic president bill clinton converted cash welfare into block grants, resulting in significantly less aid being provided to low-income families.

in a full political union, there would be concentration of economic policy decision making and it would require major structural changes in the eurozone and its member countries. tax and social policies would be unified, labor unions would be dismantled or unified as a european-wide system, a european debt relief system and banking union would be set up. these would ensure the flexibility of wages, prices and labor agreements and guarantee convergence of competitiveness and living standards. this could work, in theory. but, the likelihood of getting all the member states to agree that their wages, debt and living conditions would be negotiated at the european level is extremely small.

the day before new year's eve as i was preparing for our journey home and packing our car at my mother-in-law's house i couldn't help but feel annoyed -- the kids received way too many presents, my husband had not packed his stuff fast enough, the car is dirty, the garage is cold. finally at 9 a.m. when everything and everyone was loaded into the car, i realized through the error message on the dashboard that this car is not going to take us anywhere that day.

there was a room in the basement that i set up as an office, but it turned out that i didn't need a separate room to work, since i was living alone half the time. when my friend stace, who was also in the middle of ending a marriage, needed a place to stay, i cleared out the unused desk and borrowed a bed from my parents to turn my office into a guest room. i had stayed at my parents' house on an air mattress for the better part of a year, and understood stace might need a little time to save up for an apartment of her own while paying off her debts.

dr. gina kwong from vca west los angeles animal hospital suggests taking the time to work on some basic obedience training or learning new tricks. my own dog hates getting wet, so when the weather isn't cooperating, i spend some of our 'walk' time teaching him to 'heel' in the hallway of my apartment building. learning new behaviors is mentally stimulating and will help keep your dog stay engaged and focused. it's a great way to actively spend time with your dog-- a win-win for you and your pet! just remember to keep the training sessions relatively short (about 10-15min), especially if it is learning a new behavior, so that your dog doesn't become too frustrated.

she grew into adulthood with a disconnected sense of her emotions, a tenuous hold on reality, a completely warped view of human relationships, and a split and damaged sense of herself and of her body, concluded katherine porterfield, a clinical psychologist at the bellevue/new york university program for survivors of torture who evaluated montgomery in prison and provided expert testimony for the defense.

because staying healthy involves things like washing your hands and not touching your face, some people may think those who get sick are 'unclean' or irresponsible, he said. people have similar beliefs about those who are overweight or have substance abuse problems.
the report is an in-depth analysis of the parkland shooting in february 2018 that left 17 students and staff members dead. it documents extensive shortcomings in the school's security measures prior to the shooting, and outlines deficiencies in the police response. it offers a searing critique of the school and sheriff department's ability to stymie the bloodshed.
the pushback highlights the legal challenges in prosecuting shell, a globe-spanning corporate empire valued at nearly $140 billion, for planetary harm on a scale that few, if any, lawmakers could have imagined when writing the environmental statutes currently on the books. two of the biggest cases against rival exxon mobil, for example, take a narrower approach, arguing that the company violated state laws in new york and massachusetts by not disclosing relevant information to investors and making deceptive advertising claims about the safety of burning fossil fuels.

trump's tax cut and health care efforts have gotten a ton of attention. but they by no means capture the full extent of his governing agenda ― or the different ways his policies break his promise to american workers.
of course, the issues can be even more pronounced in countries where gender equality isn't front of mind, and as the oxfam report points out, the answers will likely have to come from ordinary people, rather than less affected (and let's face it, more male) politicians. examples include paid leave, investments in child care, challenging sexist legislation, and supporting the care of older adults and people with disabilities — since the unpaid labor women do isn't just about chores and child care, as natalie notes.
as we all celebrate the new year we typically take the time to reflect on the past year and look forward to what the next 12 months holds. with the 'pop, clink, cheers' of new year's eve firmly behind us and the champaign buzz a hazy memory, comes the obligatory and often much dreaded resolutions making. this is where we face the reality of our lives and resolve to do some form of self-improvement, which statistically 88% will fail to keep.

alopecia areata can attack the hair on your head, eyebrows, eyelashes and body. for me, it attacks the hair on my head, brows and lashes. rest assured, though, i have always had full hair on my upper lip. can we not be selective about this hair loss?
israel's small size may also be helping. with fewer than 8 million people living within a relatively thin strip of land, the national government can make and implement policy directly without a lot of delegation to lower-level governments, organizations and officials. that's not really practical in countries with many tens of millions, let alone the 330 million who live in the u.s.

he cut funding for advertising for healthcare.gov and for the groups that assist people with enrollment. he cut off a key set of payments to insurers, prompting some to raise rates and others to abandon markets altogether. and he's given states a green light to change their medicaid programs in ways that will make it harder for poor people, especially those with chronic physical and mental health problems, to get and keep coverage.

and of course, there are microaggressions against people of color. capitol police once told a well-known health care and disability rights activist that she had to take a save medicaid button off of her daughter's wheelchair because it was a political slogan. while rules are strict within the capitol, political slogans on buttons and t-shirts are not just permitted but common. she complied because she did not want to get kicked out, but other advocates noted the disparity in treatment. i'm sure she is not the only person of color to have been treated more harshly than white activists inside the capitol.

the u.s. is one of a select few countries in the world without a national policy that ensures paid sick leave, leaving many low-wage restaurant workers with little choice but to go to work even when they're sick. many are also deterred from seeing the doctor due to being uninsured or having health insurance policies that leave them with expensive bills.

dax shepard believes that if he is in a state that does not have a helmet law he should be 'observing the local culture' and not wear his helmet, she said. this morphs into an even bigger fight and we ended up compromising on if he was on the highway, he had to wear the helmet. but if he was on side streets, he didn't have to wear the helmet.

maryland's largest city, which has been suffering extended heat waves and coastal flooding as a result of warming that's already underway, has asked the supreme court to refer its lawsuit seeking damages back to a state court. lawyers representing the oil giants named in the litigation want the high court to keep the case in federal court, where they expect to more easily fend off the allegations.

the thing is, the job of an awards show host ― in the age of real-time social media criticism, at least ― is a lose-lose gig, and the organizations who run those shows know it. just ask anne hathaway. if you're cutesy, you're labeled a bore by the masses. if you're sarcastic, you're considered too snarky. if you stay silent on politics, you're unwoke. if you're jimmy kimmel, you're just doing it to promote your late-night show.
also, since it's the hot topic right now, the new mrna vaccines were shown to work really well in large studies of about 40,000 participants and have a great safety profile. i had my second dose this week. and aside from some fatigue and some body aches after — which is just the sign of a good immune response — no major adverse side effects.
an unclear picture of how you provide value to your ideal customer leads to lack of clarity in vision and strategy. the result is a business that resembles the world war ii pilot flying over the south pacific who radioed, we're lost, but we're making great time. undisciplined execution : customers reward consistent excellence not occasional brilliance. the businesses experiencing this challenge may need to optimize their processes, increase consistency with their existing process, or both.

and that's why he stood down, cable says of his predecessor. i don't think it was what he said, that did upset quite a lot of people, it was the fact that he basically went missing in the early part of the campaign because he was preoccupied with that problem. he's acknowledged that himself. i spoke out very strongly and made it clear that was absolutely not my view and absolutely not the party's view. but he is a party spokesman i am not proposing to change that.

republicans countered with their own massive ground game, with the national republican senatorial committee hiring 1,000 field organizers. while republican turnout in the runoff also was high, it lagged behind democrats in some crucial conservative areas. but gop operatives said trump's refusal to accept the election results limited their ability to portray the race as an essential check on democratic control of washington.

in 2006, inslee, then one of washington's 10 u.s. representatives, spearheaded an effort to set a renewable portfolio standard in the evergreen state. in 2007, he co-authored a book called apollo's fire: igniting america's clean energy economy, which, as the title implies, laid out a vision for bolstering the renewable-energy and electric-vehicle industries. in 2009, he co-founded the sustainable energy and environment coalition in the house of representatives. later that year, he sponsored the federal cap-and-trade bill known as waxman-markey.
geopolitical competition in global trade agenda-setting among the us, the european union and emerging powers, such as china and india, and increasingly popular protectionism rhetoric in national trade debates also explain the failure or lack of cooperation in the multilateral trading system.

the fallout from yesterday's events caps a four-year decline in the cachet of being american, he said. it further diminishes, reputationally, everything we built up since the second world war.
by parroting such conservative political views under the guise of christianity, the textbooks give those views more legitimacy, making it difficult to distinguish between fact and opinion. while all textbooks, including the secular, cherry-pick narratives and have their biases, these ones fuse a religious worldview with trumpian talking points using anti-media and anti-immigrant rhetoric.

it was a marked change from trump's first impeachment. that december 2019 vote in the house, which made trump only the third president ever impeached, played out along partisan lines. the charges then were that he had used the powers of the office to pressure ukraine to investigate a political foe, joe biden, now the president-elect.
arana: yes, mentorship is very important. i do this with other realtors and i want to do more in the future with seminars. mentors helped me. giving back is important. one out of 20 will do what i say to do. they see the first or second obstacle and they think it's going to be hard. it is. but if you really want it, you'll achieve it.
welcome to 2019. there's a government shutdown going on, and federal employees ― from cafeteria workers to janitors to research scientists ― are cut off from their income for a second week. the resolution of this dispute depends on hundreds of representatives and senators and a recalcitrant, rageful president agreeing on funding for a wall, or perhaps, according to the new york times, on what the definition of a wall even is.
since gabby's shooting, nearly 250,000 lives have been lost to gun violence, and over 800,000 americans have been the victim of gun violence, all the time while congress stood by and did nothing, he said. but today is a new day. today, we have a new speaker, and today we have a new majority. and today, we're going to take decisive action.
that ordering is not what a lot of people would expect, especially when it comes to the top three. the dakotas, in particular, have some of the highest covid-19 death rates in the country, even though they didn't face major outbreaks until relatively late, by which time the american health care system had learned a great deal about how to prevent and treat the disease.
the world, after all, doesn't have to be like this, and our lives don't have to be so cramped and so fearful. all but the very richest of us know that one bad biopsy could shatter any hope of financial security we have. this year we have been ravaged as a country by fire and flood, and such events are set only to escalate, jeopardizing a future for our children and theirs. 113 million americans have a loved one who is incarcerated; every day, 118 of us die of a drug overdose; every day, the ceo of goldman sachs makes $65,000; over 30,000 of us die of gun violence annually; and while we live, most of us are treading water so hard we don't have time to draw breath.

when the relationship system is unbalanced (excessive ballast keeping the risk so low that there's insufficient challenge, play, change or spontaneity) or insufficient grounding which exposes the couple to extreme financial, emotional, physical, or material risks, the system will be disrupted with potentially highly damaging consequences. the challenge in cases where there is any type of a relational imbalance is not to look for an either/or, my way or the highway solution, but rather to identify the needs of the relationship as opposed to focusing on the accommodation of either partner.

so yes, entrepreneurs and business people alike should go to college, and they should learn the ins and outs of the industry they would like to influence. while we can point to some top entrepreneurs who did not complete their college degrees, we know that zuckerberg and jobs did take courses in technology and design at two of the top universities in the world. they are anomalies because they didn't finish and still made a huge impact, but they attempted college and created products based on the information and experiences they gleaned in college.

as nolan feeney explained in a 2014 atlantic article, seeing ourselves in reverse can be a little weird, partly because our faces aren't perfectly symmetrical. certain features or distinctive marks don't line up in photos the same way they do in the mirror, and that can throw us off. to return to my anecdote, i rarely notice the slant in my nose when i look in the mirror, but in photos, the slant goes the opposite direction, so it's always the first thing i see.

this is not to say that there are not real, genuine concerns that we should be having about the ways in which predominantly white institutions influence and orchestrate the persecution of black people in the public eye. it is, after all, overwhelmingly white institutions like the oscars and the grammy and white tastemakers like ellen who have co-signed these men as much as any black people have. this also isn't to play into some narrative that all black people are inherently homophobic or misogynistic (i'm aware that tweets or comments on the shade room, for instance, do not represent the totality of black opinion on this situation). but the conversation around these two stories still forces us to interrogate the ways in which we do and don't show up for one another.

i met a lady about three years ago at a ballet school where my daughter was attending. she came into the lobby and she checked her daughter in. she had a little boy with her and he looked to be about two years old. once her daughter went inside she sat down and exhaled a sigh of relief. almost as if she had the worst day ever. the little boy wanted to come down and play with his toys. as soon as she sat him down he got up and came over to me. she quickly came and got him and apologized. i told her it wasn't a problem. he kept doing it over and over. so finally i decided to get on the floor and play with him. he was a sweetheart and he filled my baby craving fever for that moment. she said to me he is just all over the place today, he won't sit still. guess what i told her? yep, the same thing ms, mary said to me. [talk about paying it forward huh..] it sounded like common sense to her and she even said you're right.

that $8 billion can give overwhelmed state and local authorities the ability to hire extra staff, both for planning and for administering the shots. it would have been great to get the funding months ago, when public health experts and officials were begging for it, warning of precisely the sorts of problems plaguing the u.s. effort now. but the money will still help a lot ― especially because the pace needs to pick up a lot more.
labour ran the former minister extremely close in the 2017 election, slashing his majority to just 2,400. but after the boundary review ids's seat is on course for a labour majority of 1,400. another seat that would see a high profile name removed is tim farron in westmorland and lonsdale, where his narrow majority is set to fall to the tories after the addition of key conservative wards from nearby penrith and the borders. baxter told huffpost uk: the new boundaries look like they will not change the result of the recent election, despite conservative hopes that they could be worth a dozen or more seats to them. under the new boundaries, the recent election would still have given the country a hung parliament, with the conservatives three seats short of an overall majority. individual mps whose seats might change hands as new unfriendly voters are transferred in to them include nigel dodds (the leader of the dup at westminster), tim farron, margaret beckett, iain duncan smith and boris johnson. the initial proposals from the boundary commissions can still be modified before they are finalised and the entire recommendations need to be accepted by parliament before they come into effect. and that is not looking certain at the moment as at least fifty mps wonder nervously if their seats will disappear.

a key reason for the activist left's emphasis on economic recovery funding is its experience with the first two years of the obama administration. progressives blame deficit hawks in the obama white house for blocking economist christina romer from presenting obama with an option for a stimulus package that exceeded $1 trillion ― a figure closer to the size of the hole in the economy than the roughly $800 billion bill obama ultimately settled on.

michael arceneaux's new book, i don't want to die poor, was always going to be relevant ― even before the coronavirus became a pandemic that would forever change the way we look at this nation's failing health care system, disproportionate poverty and crippling burden of student loan debt. but since the world completely turned on its head, forcing us into an indefinite lockdown and causing more than 16 million americans so far to file for unemployment benefits, arceneaux's sharp introspection on that helluva drug called capitalism, the lengths we will go to attain (or pretend to be part of) the middle class, and the financial ruin that can leave behind feels eerily clairvoyant.

we decided to travel to cuba with a group called road scholar. the former name for this organization, back in the days when my parents used it, was elder hostel. our hope is that, because it caters to seniors, road scholar will take good care of us. so far, we have received reams of information, all emphasizing that cuba is basically a third world country. no cell phone service or internet except maybe in our hotel. no handrails and lots of stairs and uneven pavement. no place to buy anything we have forgotten to bring. and if we get hurt or sick, we will need to pay cash for medical care.
i'm really disappointed in the slow deterioration of popular film offerings from the big 3 (hulu, netflix, amazon). i remember when they started up, netflix had an amazing selection. but now it seems like they never have any of the films i'm looking for. i have amazon prime, but any of the movies i really want to see inevitably require that i pay extra to rent them. the number of b and c-grade movies that are on these services is quite remarkable. that's a lot of chaff to pad their offerings. ― susan houston

often, the knowledge to turn a conversation around takes practice. artists who sell directly to the public need two quite separate sets of skills, the first is the technical ability and a conceptual framework to produce the desired work of art, while the second is the capability to put that technique and concept into words and to be a good salesperson. salesmanship is not only concerned with negotiating the terms of a purchase, which assumes that prospective buyers know exactly what they want, but trying to answer the questions that are really being asked. it may help, for instance, to show a booth visitor a sketchbook, so that that person may see how things get started: a little idea becomes a work of art. the question of where an artist gets his or her ideas turns out to be concerned with the mechanics of the artistic.

separatists have been specifically dismayed about equalization payments, where federal funds are transferred between wealthy and less wealthy provinces to help ensure reasonably comparable health care, education and welfare in all regions. opponents of equalization say alberta pays an unfairly large share, and argue that it should be allowed to keep all of its oil revenue.

holidays are supposed to be a time for family, a time of joy and a time for reflection. sadly, they are often a time when people are disappointed. the currier & ives perfect thanksgiving, chanukah or christmas is not a reality for most people. family gatherings are often difficult. you do not pick your relatives and many people can't stand their in-laws. holidays are also a time when people make mistakes. what about one drink too many at that holiday office party? an indiscretion with another man or woman can be problematic. a word that should not be said, a careless email or text message -- the list is endless. with social media, it is so much easier to cross that line than it was a few years ago.
the u.s. now has more than 31,000 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, an increase of more than 10,000 since saturday, according to data compiled by johns hopkins university. at least 390 people across the country have died from covid-19 and over 176 have recovered from it, the university reported.
a bold plan to transition to a green economy will both put americans to work and reduce pollution that keeps millions of the working poor sick and trapped in poverty. kids will miss fewer days of school due to respiratory illness, parents will miss fewer days of work, and working a full-time job will pay a livable wage. and action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is the only way to lower the probability that devastating fires, hurricanes and floods will become even more frequent occurrences. for the kinds of climate-related impacts that we have already endured ― and will continue to ― we need coordinated infrastructure and systems in place to ensure that americans are prepared and protected.

let's start with women. as would be expected, studies including one in 2010 have found that women lie more about their weight. when i met a man for coffee or a drink, i would usually ask how online dating was going for them. and i was surprised how many complaints i heard about women lying about--how shall i put this gracefully?--their body status description. in fact, i heard the same tale so often about a woman with a great headshot and a claim of an average or athletic body build type who turned out to be quite overweight that i wondered if it were the same woman they were all meeting.
8. that i would learn that there is no right or wrong way to feel. my feelings are often complicated and sometimes conflicting. i'll feel overwhelming happiness which then turns to sadness. i'll experience great joy only to be greeted with intense fear. sometimes these feelings change within in the matter of seconds or happen within the same moment. instead of trying to understand my conflicted feelings, i've learned to accept them. you don't have to feel one way or another.

when the disparity first came to light in the '50s and '60s, doctors thought it was a symptom of homosexuality itself, just one of many manifestations of what was, at the time, known as sexual inversion. as the gay rights movement gained steam, though, homosexuality disappeared from the dsm and the explanation shifted to trauma. gay men were being kicked out of their own families, their love lives were illegal. of course they had alarming rates of suicide and depression. that was the idea i had, too, salway says, that gay suicide was a product of a bygone era, or it was concentrated among adolescents who didn't see any other way out. and then he looked at the data. the problem wasn't just suicide, it wasn't just afflicting teenagers and it wasn't just happening in areas stained by homophobia. he found that gay men everywhere, at every age, have higher rates of cardiovascular disease, cancer, incontinence, erectile dysfunction,⁠ allergies and asthma—you name it, we got it. in canada, salway eventually discovered, more gay men were dying from suicide than from aids, and had been for years. (this might be the case in the u.s. too, he says, but no one has bothered to study it.) we see gay men who have never been sexually or physically assaulted with similar post-traumatic stress symptoms to people who have been in combat situations or who have been raped, says alex keuroghlian, a psychiatrist at the fenway institute's center for population research in lgbt health.

in terms of depression, the stereotypes don't necessarily reflect the truth. first, there isn't a lot of historical data on depression or suicide. certainly open conversation about it has been relatively recent, and parents were not as active in seeking help for their child. we do know that suicide rates have gone down since 1990 according to the youth suicide prevention program. that would seem to indicate that if depression rates have gone up, it is being more effectively managed.

that is indeed a story of liberation. it is a story of freedom. the freedom from fear. the freedom to say the word marijuana on the phone without cops showing up to ask you about it. the freedom not to worry about what the mailman sees when you open the front door to sign for a package. the freedom from any paranoia at all, in fact, whether legitimate or imagined. as f.d.r. might have said: the fear itself of possessing marijuana is no longer to be feared.
when sanders introduced his bill last year, the list of 16 democratic co-sponsors included several prospective presidential contenders ― among them, sen. elizabeth warren of massachusetts, who last week launched her exploratory committee for a white house bid. that announcement came one day after sen. kamala harris of california, another likely presidential candidate, reaffirmed her support for medicare for all in a new york times op-ed. and, of course, sanders himself is widely expected to run again.

i think she's in a cycle of self-harm, and i think that is a very similar cycle to the addiction cycle, which is that something has happened that she has not been able to directly look at for a long time. and so she's found an outlet to relieve some of that pain. what you see, particularly at the beginning of the movie, is somebody who has a very controlled, managed way. the build of tension, the build of misery, the build of anger and frustration. the act is her nights out, what she does during them and then the power that that gives her, the control that gives her. you see it the day after the scene with adam brody, with the hot dog and the walk of shame. it's pure power, pure adrenaline. but of course, in any addictive cycle, that high plummets and then it's the self-loathing and the revulsion.

you should subscribe. sign up the researchers i spoke to explained that gay guys inflict this kind of damage on each other for two main reasons. the first, and the one i heard most frequently, is that gay men are shitty to each other because, basically, we're men. the challenges of masculinity get magnified in a community of men, pachankis says. masculinity is precarious. it has to be constantly enacted or defended or collected. we see this in studies: you can threaten masculinity among men and then look at the dumb things they do. they show more aggressive posturing, they start taking financial risks, they want to punch things. this helps explain the pervasive stigma against feminine guys in the gay community. according to dane whicker, a clinical psychologist and researcher at duke, most gay men report that they want to date someone masculine, and that they wished they acted more masculine themselves. maybe that's because, historically, masculine men have been more able to blend into straight society. or maybe it's internalized homophobia: feminine gay men are still stereotyped as bottoms, the receptive partner in anal sex. a two-year longitudinal study found that the longer gay men were out of the closet, the more likely they were to become versatile or tops.

life-saving medical equipment was not stockpiled. travel largely continued unabated. vital public health data from china was not provided or was deemed untrustworthy. a white house riven by rivalries and turnover was slow to act. urgent warnings were ignored by a president consumed by his impeachment trial and intent on protecting a robust economy that he viewed as central to his reelection chances.

no matter how you feel about your former spouse, your children still deserve to love and be loved by their other parent. unless your ex is truly unfit, you need to support your kids' relationship with him. trying to change your ex's parenting style is futile and interfering with the bond between him and your children is unfair to your kids. focus on your own parenting: is there anything you need to change? develop patience? improve time management? set better limits? have fun? stop trying to control your ex, or worrying that your kids love him more, and work on yourself instead.

this exchange, if you can call it that, is just one example of what's happening all over the internet in the conversation surrounding both kevin hart's bizarre redemption arc and revelations concerning r. kelly's abuse of young black girls in the recent lifetime docu-series surviving r. kelly. (to be clear: i'm not equating kevin hart's tweets with r. kelly's history of abuse ― telling harmful jokes is not the same as physically abusing someone. but the ramifications of both men's actions lie on a spectrum.)
contributions made in 2019 to an employee's sep-ira can't exceed 25 percent of compensation or $56,000, whichever is less. the nice thing about the sep-ira is that your contributions to any personal iras don't affect the limits for the sep employer contributions. that means you could max out both plans if you wanted. however, participating in a sep plan could affect your ability to deduct traditional or roth ira contributions, since the irs doesn't allow you to deduct as both employer and employee.

rwe is seeking to increase its access to the region's supply of lignite, or brown coal. this type of coal is mined in giant open pits. brown coal is easier and cheaper to access than other varieties of coal, but it is one of the dirtiest fossil fuels to burn. that means the coal that lies underneath immerath could end up producing billions of tons of carbon emissions over the next few decades.

we have all had to work with annoying team members in business. if you are not their manager, it's tempting to just walk away, tune them out, or react sharply, but these reactions are not appropriate for managers, and are equally ineffective for peers and team mates. remember that annoying doesn't mean non-productive - these may be top performers, with critical business skills.
the biggest change for us was that, for better or worse, once we got married we decided to divide and conquer and make sure each family task was handled by the more adept person. like, i'm really good with bills and budgeting and he's not, so that's my domain, and he doesn't have to worry about it. and he's a terrific cook... meaning i haven't really looked at an oven in five years. i handle our social calendar. he handles anything to do with the car. the plus side is that most things get done quickly and efficiently, with minimal fighting. the down side is that i have no idea how to pump gas anymore. - jillian, married 5 years

however, there is evidence suggesting that having cops in schools can help perpetuate the school-to-prison pipeline ― the cycle in which students, particularly students of color, are pushed out of school and into the criminal justice system when school authorities criminalize student misbehavior. a huffpost investigation found that schools with police officers are significantly more likely to refer their students to law enforcement for incidents involving theft, vandalism and alcohol.

after a streak that lasted more than two centuries, the transfer of power in the united states has not been peaceful this time around. until thursday afternoon, trump failed to concede. he didn't say he'd participate in an orderly transition of power until around 4 a.m. thursday, hours after his supporters stormed the capitol. he's maintained to his millions of his followers that the incoming administration is illegitimate, raising the prospect of more civil unrest in the future.

unique among major law enforcement agencies, the roughly 2,000-officer department that secures congress isn't subject to a transparency law that allows the public to access official records. as a branch of congress, which is excluded from foia, no such law applies to the capitol police. when presented with foia requests, it's common for the agency's counsel to respond simply that it doesn't have to comply. in 2005, congress passed a law that gave the capitol police more latitude to shield records the department deemed sensitive from public disclosure.

second, i believe that some of the correcting we do can be attributed to how we want to be perceived by others. we want others to view us as a great parent. and a lot of what constitutes a great parent is looking at their offspring and judging them by that. but isn't that unrealistic?!?! god made these kids with their own dna and their own characteristics. now don't get me wrong, a lot of who your child will turn out to be will be heavily dependent on the environment that they're raised in and also the things that they're exposed too. but for the most part, they are their own person. so you can't allow for everyone else that is on the outside to dictate whether or not you are a good parent solely based on how your child acts in public. you need to know that you are a good parent because you've taken on the most demanding job with the lowest pay possible. that simple!!!

five years in the making, the proposed national social registry has thus far been described by the indian press as a routine exercise to update the 2011 socio-economic caste census (secc) to prevent the misuse of pro-poor government schemes by ensuring that benefits and entitlements reach the right people. the fact that the ministry of rural development is responsible for the secc has helped further this impression that the secc update is an innocuous bureaucratic task.

there are five other challengers. two of them, coteau and graham, have been quick to point out that delegated conventions often deliver unexpected results.
sure, some of them could've been impoverished former coal miners, as so many pundits have described a certain sect of trump voters. but these people weren't raging over the decline of the carbon-based economy. this was a riot about race and power. if there was economic anxiety, it was spurred by the rioters' false notion that their place in the world is under threat.
running into the comments section of some blog like the shade room that posts hart's ellen apology and goes on and on about how ellen is invited to the cookout because she gave hart a platform for his redemption arc doesn't change the fact that she's essentially forgiving him for comments he made about a community she doesn't even belong to.
meanwhile, republican sen. josh hawley of missouri — who like cruz is believed to be considering a 2024 presidential run — last week became the first senator to say he would support challenging biden's 306-232 electoral college victory when congress meets to accept those results on wednesday.
yet buildings account for about 70 percent of the city's emissions, creating a steep political challenge for a mayor who, to the chagrin of the progressive activists who helped elect him, spent much of his first term wooing real estate developers. in september, de blasio's rollout of a new set of mandates to cut emissions from big buildings faced blunt criticism from the new york city council, which accused the mayor of acting unilaterally and failing to go far enough with the proposed rules.
as we continue to process our pain and suffering, it is my hope that in some way, sharing our impact statements is part of our healing process, raisman wrote.

in march of last year, the census bureau reported that by 2045, white people in america would be the minority, comprising 49.7 percent of the population. a few weeks later, the commerce department announced that for the first time in 70 years, the constitutionally mandated census would include a question about citizenship status. with trump leading the republican party's crusade against minorities, immigrants and the working poor, the decision to tamper with the census sure looks like a clear effort to lower the response rate and undermine the accuracy of the count.
4. the value of the minority interest also depends on what other classes of equity have preference ahead of it.
the aging and ailing general no doubt wanted to test if suu kyi would seek vengeance on him and his family. apparently not. instead, she has invited the military to help rebuild the country. she carefully studied the reconciliation process in places like south africa and czechoslovakia during her years of house arrest. she understands that violence and recrimination usually beget more violence. with power now within her grasp, she has pledged to be merciful to the people who were not.

you are almost certainly better off moving your money into a 401(k) than pulling it into an ira. in addition, the advice given under the 401(k), these are run under the best practices standard, the fiduciary standard. the ira is coming along, but it's still not there yet. the rules have still not been put in place.

losses in maine and north carolina meant democrats needed to sweep two runoff races in georgia to reach the 50 seats required to control congress' upper chamber, with vice president-elect kamala harris breaking ties. their hopes rested on two candidates ― jon ossoff and raphael warnock ― defying historical trends in georgia and mounting a comeback after gop candidates earned more votes in both races in november.
sen. joe manchin, a conservative west virginia democrat, who is due to hold immense veto power as a critical swing vote in a 50-50 senate, told the washington post on friday that he disagrees with biden and senate majority leader chuck schumer's insistence that the senate prioritize $2,000 payments to low- and middle-income households. instead, manchin said, getting people vaccinated should be the first order of business.

higher net worth investors, and those with complex financial issues, will continue to benefit from the services of traditional advisors. be sure the advisor you select is a registered investment advisor (ria). all ria's are required to place your interest ahead of their own and to disclose all actual and potential conflicts of interest. advisors authorized to place client assets in funds managed by dimensional fund advisors are an especially good choice. these advisors rely on sound, academically based principles of investing. you can find a list of these advisors here.
heyman, a democrat, has been a fierce critic of trump, and has emerged as a vocal booster of canada-u.s. relations during the republican president's rocky term in office. he was also the american diplomat who helped broker canada's entry into iraq in 2014 as a u.s. ally in its fight against the spread of the islamic state of iraq and the levant in that country and neighbouring syria.
and the plan was without substance.
americans' level of concern about the coronavirus ― and their willingness to endure widescale preventative measures in response ― are in some cases modestly divided along generational or geographic lines. fifty-nine percent of americans under age 30 say they're at least somewhat concerned about the outbreak's spread, the survey finds, while 73% of those 30 and up say the same. about two-thirds of city dwellers are at least somewhat concerned they or a family member will contract the virus, compared to about half of rural americans who say the same. these divides make a certain amount sense: covid-19 has proved especially deadly to older people, and the disease's first inroads into the u.s. have been concentrated in urban centers.
toronto ― tim hortons and mcdonald's canada are the latest coffee purveyors to stop accepting reusable mugs brought in by customers amid concerns about the novel coronavirus outbreak.

we want to work with the un, bush said, otherwise we will have to act unilaterally. the president also told the group he believed iraq could eventually be a democracy. one leading democratic senator who later voted to authorize the use of force against iraq told the president, i will be with you on condition we level with the american people ― we'll have to say [in iraq] awhile. you're right, bush said. if you can get it done without staying, we'll give you the nobel peace prize, the senator said. i'll support you for president, he added. i don't know whether that will help me or hurt me, bush said to the room's amusement.

milk is a hot, white man out of drag. that does not make the work she does in drag any less artistically valid. but it does mean we have to keep perspective on why she's able to do the drag she does. if, for example, kennedy's drag was half as outré as milk's, she'd be relentlessly blasted by fellow queens and trolls alike. we know this because kennedy gets hate just for doing her drag as-is, much less something so unconventional. milk receives the benefit of the doubt in a way someone less classically handsome (or non-white) would certainly not.
still, it's impossible to disregard the fact that an almost entirely white and male set of tastemakers (not to mention creators and investors) elevated certain male artists to the level of demigods, so above criticism that one's dislike signaled one's own inferior taste rather than the artists' failings. most critics with major platforms have long been white men; the lack of diversity in the ranks has not only stunted the breadth of conversation, but fostered the false sense that white men's concerns are the most pressing, their opinions the most objective, and their viewpoints the most conducive to great art. even when women or people of color dissented, their voices did little or nothing to alter the perceived consensus.
the japanese tidying expert gained widespread popularity in the u.s. back in 2014, when her first book, the life-changing magic of tidying up, was released. it was a hit, becoming a new york times best-seller and purchased by millions of people worldwide. the decluttering guru, as she's been dubbed, is now making headlines once again thanks to her newly released netflix series, aptly titled tidying up with marie kondo.

you may sometimes benefit from a people-pleasing boss' attempts to sway you to their side, but ultimately this manager is a hazard to work for. they believe getting ahead means giving others what they want, even when accountability is needed to maintain trust on a team.
bernhardt played a key behind-the-scenes role in many regulatory rollbacks during zinke's tenure, as mother jones highlighted in an october profile. those efforts include a plan to dismantle obama-era protections for the greater sage grouse, a move that would open up millions of acres of the declining game bird's habitat to energy and mineral development. bernhardt is also leading a charge to revise the endangered species act, one of america's bedrock conservation laws. the proposed changes would make it easier to remove recovered species from the protected list and would change how federal agencies go about designating habitat as critical to the long-term survival of species.

the easiest way to avoid germs, of course, is to just stay home, and as a freelance writer, i'm fortunate to be able to do that more than some people. however, because i am single and live alone, there is still that pesky need to go out and get food. i can't have groceries delivered or get takeout food because thinking about what hands might have touched my food causes anxiety. yes, it's irrational, because plenty of hands have touched everything whether it's delivered or i buy it myself in the store. it doesn't matter; germophobia is not a logical condition and i can't reason with my thoughts or tell myself not to worry.

you can't control your ex, his attorney, or the family court system. but you can control your own actions, so be mindful of your thoughts and choices. set intentions for what you need to do now — file a child support modification or e-mail your ex about therapy for your child — and don't obsess about what will or won't happen. white-knuckling your way to the future will take you out of the present and keep you from enjoying non-divorce-related activities.
i think you'll see democrats continue to push for state and local aid. perhaps the greatest deficiency of the covid-19 relief package that was enacted into law was the absence of direct aid to state and local municipalities.

every day after school, five or six guys would yell faggot! and tell me to go home. they would threaten me and tell me i wasn't allowed to be there. they would grab my hat or glasses and throw them on the ground, or run at me somewhere on the course, push me to the ground and yell in my face.

andrew caballero-reynolds via getty images an oil and gas processing plant in lake charles, louisiana. among the trump-era regulations that a democratic-controlled congress might be able to roll back is the decision to maintain rather than strengthen air quality standards for particulate matter and ozone, two toxic air pollutants emitted from power plants and vehicles.
yet even these revelations failed to turn the tide of public opinion, because, as powell put it, the lives of women, and especially poor or working-class women like the ones kelly preyed on, are simply not valued. the media's reluctance to report on kelly was ultimately the result of a tangled web of racism, rape culture and celebrity obsession that took years of reporting from derogatis and others to untangle.

these are tentpole releases, whose delay will screw up the release calendar of the entire year. how do you establish the cost at this point? if two big releases that had a solo release windoware now forced to come on the same day, it's going to cost both producers massively, trade analyst amul mohan of super cinema, told huffpost india.

buhr: we haven't seen our families in months, which is tough. will's family is on the east coast and it's been over a full year since we've been together with them. mine is in oregon and we saw them briefly when we drove up there to go camping over the summer, but that's already six months ago. we have a very small quaran-team pod of four to five friends that we've seen only outdoors for the last 10 months. we're really hopeful that vaccination will allow everyone to get a little more normal.

in recent years, the nfl has enacted 47 rule changes to protect its players, which is progress; however, none of our three key initiatives are reflected in those changes. these policies ― flag until 14, improved helmet design and hit tracking ― should have been put in place decades ago. we can't keep kicking the can down the road.

i was a 3-year-old preschooler when i corrected my teacher's knowledge of the constitutional requirements to be u.s. president. in kindergarten, i learned that telling my friends that bashar al-assad was using chemical weapons against his own people would cause kids to cry on the playground. my parents received a call from an unhappy principal that day. and telling my third-grade science teacher that her knowledge of gravity lacked depth earned me a spot on her naughty list for the rest of the year.
we worry about balancing work and home life--although i just looked up the average number of hours americans work per week and, having done so, now have no idea what the hell everybody's complaining about. apparently americans work an average of 34.4 hours per week. okay - add five hours a week commuting (including stops for a latte and scone) and we're almost at a 40-hour-work week. but who are these people? where are they? i don't know anyone who works that little!
in the wake of the challenger disaster on january 28, 1986, all gps satellite launches stopped, stalling all commercial development on the system - except for one company. magellan, founded four months after the shuttle explosion by entrepreneur and pilot ed tuck, who wanted a portable device to help him navigate to small airports, and two early gps experts, don rae and norm hunt, went to work instead. in may 1989, the company started shipping this first-ever portable gps receiver, more than three years before any competitors, which established a revolutionary way to get from point a to point b without having to fumble with maps or stop to ask directions.

i have lived in d.c. for over 20 years and have never been afraid of going to protest or just being near one. this was different, in no small part because of the way the rioters seemed to be treated like honored guests, posing for selfies on the senate dais and parading through the halls of the house with the speaker's lectern.
i grew up in a household that treated death as a secret. dead and dying pets were whisked out of the house. when a relative died, my parents would disappear to north adams, massachusetts. i only learned as an adult this is where we had a family burial plot. eventually, i attended funerals, but the details of life-threatening illness were left out.
living in physical bodies, this isn't surprising. despite what mysticism and science tell us to the contrary, despite all that talk in church about the holy spirit and the soul, most of us fully believe we're physical beings dwelling in a physical world. so a belief that contentment and a certain degree of happiness can be achieved through the balance of our physical activities isn't illogical. it's just that it doesn't work.
judd wrote a powerful op-ed for mic about the mob-like harassment she received online. in that piece, she also came forward as a survivor of rape and incest. the public's response? slut-shaming, victim-blaming and even more harassment.

their election will put an end to the block in washington on the $2,000 stimulus check, biden said at an atlanta rally over the weekend with warnock and ossoff. if you send sen. perdue and loeffler back to washington, those checks will never get there. it's just that simple. the power is literally in your hands.
many albertans also noted that the manifesto doesn't reflect their experiences.
yet it was excruciatingly challenging to resist pounding my thumbs on my iphone keyboard every time one of my facebook friends posted some ill-informed and hateful, personal attack on my candidate, or worse yet, on me and my so-called ilk! i used to love facebook. and it was hard not to lose respect for a friend when their relentless venting clouded my thoughts of them, but i didn't.

sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.) stepped into the spotlight during the democratic debate in las vegas earlier this week, grilling her opponents and demonstrating she's still got her fighting spirit. she trained an especially fiery line of questioning on former new york city mayor michael bloomberg, who has decided not to compete in the first four states of the democratic primary. she heads to south carolina without any clear victories to her name.
counseling completely changed my life, something i never thought would be possible. i started going weekly, but after 11 months, i was able to go every other week. i still battle depression and dark thoughts, but i am slowly getting better. i might one day start playing golf again, although i'm probably going to be pretty rusty.
we must investigate to figure out the many flaws in @usagym system, raisman tweeted. we must understand how this happened to make sure it never occurs again. this problem is bigger than penny and nassar. the system has to change so that athletes are safe. enablers need to be held accountable.
in several european countries, green parties are also important. in portugal and luxembourg, green and anti-capitalist socialist parties are components of government coalitions. democracy in all such countries reflects people's demands for freedom to choose among parties with divergent attitudes toward capitalism. in contrast, the u.s. ― the nation that most loudly and routinely proclaims its commitment to democracy ― rigidly restricts its political parties to two that both celebrate capitalism.
i have been in the capitol when disabled protesters were literally dragged out of their wheelchairs and swiftly arrested for protesting after the capitol police deftly blocked the hallway where they had gathered. my children asked why so many people in wheelchairs were handcuffed and guarded so heavily when they would not be able to hurt anyone or run away. i had no answers for them.

great bosses challenge their employees to accomplish things that seem inconceivable at first. instead of setting mundane, incremental goals, they set lofty goals that push people out of their comfort zones. then, good managers do everything in their power to help them succeed. when talented and intelligent people find themselves doing things that are too easy or boring, they seek other jobs that will challenge their intellects.
jarrod haar, professor of human resources management at auckland's university of technology, was given free access to study barnes's staff as they figured out what could be dropped to fit 40-hours work into 32.

i sleep on it. i wander around it, circling it like a fighter trying to take the measure of the man i'm about to go up against. then, i wait. i wait until the inspiration comes. so far, it always has. design is art. it cannot be forced. i'm shy, but once you get me going, i have the loudest laugh in the room.

as the authors note, these dire projections are roughly consistent with recent research from other scientists using different models and assumptions: see here, here, here, and here. and they also dovetail with the findings of california's fourth climate change assessment, released in august. as a result of projected warming, sierra nevada snowpacks will very likely be eradicated below about 6,000 feet elevation and will be much reduced by more than 60% across nearly all of the range, the report found. the fourth national climate assessment, released without fanfare by the trump administration the day after thanksgiving, offered similar warnings about fast-vanishing snowpacks in the west.

sandra: i find the most challenging element to be indecisiveness. i am a professional decision maker, so i find it unsettling when a client is waffling. but, that's the job -- for me to provide enough information and inspiration to engender trust so that we can move forward with decisions. change can be scary and i ask our clients to make changes every single day.

yeremyv expands on this idea, adding that most of the other characters in shrek seem to be from fairy tales or nursery rhymes (three little pigs, three blind mice, muffin man), but donkey doesn't seem to be from a specific story. it'd make sense if you consider that he's a boy-turned-donkey from pinocchio.
if the pandemic does any good at all, it will be to stimulate public demand for a food system that addresses these problems and puts health and public welfare first. let's hope the new administration takes on this challenge and gets busy creating a food system that ends food insecurity, prevents diet-related chronic disease, protects against covid-19, and while we are at it, produces less waste and environmental damage.

hasen understands that getting any changes in campaign financing through congress and the courts won't be easy. his own proposals will almost certainly not command majorities in the house of representatives or the senate - and if they did wouldn't pass muster with the supreme court. and with good reason. hasen deems a constitutional amendment on campaign finances a non-starter, especially when a solid majority of state legislatures are controlled by republicans. an amendment, moreover, could well do more harm than good. the original language recently crafted by senate democrats, for example, seemed to give local, state, and federal legislatures far too much latitude to suppress political speech. a draft put forward by the group move to amend, hasen indicates, did not include a press exemption, raising serious questions about whether a state could stop the new york times or fox news from covering an election. the simplistic amendment proposed from former justice john paul stevens allows reasonable limits on campaign contributions but does not define reasonable.

the federal government has deployed hundreds of tons of supplies from our national stockpiles to locations with the greatest need in order to assist in those areas, trump said during his white house briefing on the federal government's response to the crisis.
when you get the vaccine, because you're just making the immune response to the part of the spike protein — which is the target for preventing infection — your immune response is entirely focused on responding to just that key part of the virus. so you get this really, really strong, really focused response against the right part, iovine said. that's why people who have had covid infection should still benefit from the vaccine.
president donald trump said friday that the southern border with mexico will be be closed to nonessential traffic — restrictions similar to those previously implemented on the country's northern border with canada. the new rules will not impede lawful trade and commerce, including business travel, trump said.
maybe we have seen the writing on the wall that trump is going to come back. so, this is the time that you appease so that trump 2.0 will be a little less aggressive on the trade front. i think that's a calculation that a lot of other countries also made when they gave the trump administration a renegotiated deal, especially china. why would china offer a phase 1 deal at the end of january, a minimal but a symbolic victory?

the most exciting part: when you're about to start a company, the world is rosy. we had a clear idea of what we were going to do and how fun starting a company would be. then, reality hit... very quickly. working out of a small apartment with my husband and no employees, no real product and just an idea was going to be much harder than we thought. the excitement dissipates a bit when you realize what you really have gotten into. no more google, no more organic lunches, chair massages to break up the day, cheery co-workers to grab a drink with after work. just you, your co-founder and a big idea.

but four months later, biden was again portraying himself as a war critic, without any mention of his support for the invasion. and his campaign defended his comments, telling cnn he was referring to how he immediately opposed the specific way we went to war ― without giving diplomacy and the weapons inspectors a chance to succeed, based on hyped intelligence, without sufficient allies and without a plan for the day after ― and the manner in which the war was being carried out.
3 simple & effective ways to make your marriage more loving
high-conflict people aren't reasonable. they only see their side of things. they have intense emotional reactions to minor situations. they lack healthy conflict resolution skills. trying to talk sense into someone like this is like going to the hardware store repeatedly looking for milk — and then getting upset that there's no milk to be found. you will feel much more grounded once you stop expecting a crazy person to act sane.

in a twist, a right-wing commentator seemingly alluded to sanders' words on tuesday. erick erickson, a vocal conservative critic of trump, suggested on twitter that, if gop lawmakers cave to the president's border demands, it is only a matter of time before a progressive president declares climate change a national emergency and uses eminent domain to shutter coal plants, etc.
police officers' apparent involvement in last week's deadly and unlawful insurrection makes clear just how effective the president's onslaught of disinformation has been at radicalizing people — even members of law enforcement — to try to keep him in power by any means necessary. some elements of the nation's police have closely aligned with trump and embraced anti-democratic conspiracy theories over the rule of law, and to anyone monitoring these online groups, that's been clear for a long time.
trump downplayed the seriousness of the virus for six weeks after its rapid spread started raising concerns globally. he falsely claimed it was no worse than the seasonal flu, predicted without any scientific basis that it would disappear on its own come april and accused democrats and the news media of trying to tank the stock market to hurt his reelection chances.

your partner in dialogue suggested that the only historically plausible explanation for the birth of the christian movement is that many hundreds actually saw the risen jesus. that assertion ignores the crucial fact that getting beyond dependency on eye-witness claims was the crisis of the early church, for sooner or later, there were no claims of appearances! unless faith developed deep down, coming only through what was heard, there would be no church at all.
it's important to be aware of and prepare for the circumstances that might sabotage your intentions, increase your vulnerability, and prevent you from making progress. we sometimes hit a fork in the road where the probability of following through on a new year's resolution becomes so low, so we stop and ask ourselves why we are even bothering to do it.

what was missing from early mainstream discussions of the marriage between r. kelly and aaliyah was a black feminist critique of the relationship. instead, critical analysis of kelly's conduct was confined to fan magazines serving mostly black readers. major papers weren't covering allegations of the urban artist's predatory behavior, nor were they exploring how misogynoir, which describes how hatred directed toward black women is influenced by both their race and gender, affected how the story was being framed.
well, the last jedi was released in december 2017, and, as a result, we learned that leia will live on in the franchise, despite fisher's death. there were, however, a few moments in the film that stood out as possible (maybe even unintentional) nods to the actress' passing.

scenes like we had [wednesday] are extremely detrimental to the image of the united states and lead to questions internationally about how strong and how safe u.s. democracy really is, but most leaders are reassured that within a couple weeks, you'll see a transition of power that will bring a new president with more traditional values and less of a dangerous ideology, said gregory daco, chief u.s. economist at oxford economics.

it all starts and ends with aaron rodgers ― the likely league mvp, and for good reason. his 40 touchdown passes are the most in pro football, and during green bay's last six games ― all wins ― the 33-year-old signal caller has amassed 18 touchdowns and zero interceptions. however, it'd be wrong to simply dismiss the pack as a one-dimensional, aerial attacking team.
in order to change the tide, there needs to be balance, as with anything in life. while my kids are allowed to use technology on a daily basis, i usually limit their usage to 15 minute intervals. once the time is up they have to go and do something else that doesn't involve a screen. most of the time they agree, other times i'm mean. i can live with that title if the result is that my kids go out and play or use their imagination instead of gluing their eyes to a screen.

the sandpit is a unique methodology, originally designed to produce innovative ideas to solve scientific problem. these problems require multi-disciplinary attention and expertise, and yet the training that scientists undergo to become experts is becoming ever more specialized and narrow in focus. a u.k. funding agency, the engineering and physical sciences research council, noted this trend more than a decade ago, and set out to help scientists produce collaborative research that's innovative across disciplines.

i also love different 'puzzle toys' to keep my dog distracted. they are interactive toys that you can stuff with your pets favorite treat, says dr. kwong. this is a tool a lot of us have to use anyway when we leave our pooches home for several hours while at work. they become even more crucial when morning and evening walks are hampered due to the weather. they are a great distraction and keep them mentally stimulated. but giving them too many treats, and fewer walks, could lead to weight gain. better yet, dr. kwong says, portion out a part of their daily kibble and make them work for it!

one of my good twitter friends, shola abidoye, has asked me to write a post on these islands. the idea is simple but surprisingly powerful. happiness islands are the times when we are happiest, cut off by warm, gently lapping seas, from the worries and woes of the rest of our lives. they can happen in life now, or for sustained periods in different parts of our life - maybe you were happiest in college, or living with a friend or friends, or doing a particular job. but you can swim to your happiness island at any time if you do the right thing.

• what went wrong: well, the record speaks for itself. take out tennessee's week 1 wins the past two seasons and whisenhunt was a ghastly 1–20. even with a roster in need of significant rebuilding, that's a tough sell in this league. marcus mariota's arrival also could not save whisenhunt, despite whisenhunt's reputation as a bit of a qb guru.

lately, i've been trying to nail down whether social media brings out the worst in people or is a great revealer of the worst in people, or is both. i'm not sure. all i know is that the past few days on the internet have left me in a kind of awe, an awe that is perhaps naive. i just can't believe how many black people don't give a fuck about other black people.

investment choices should be based on more than just your age and the number of working years you have until retirement. many corporate 401(k)s offer you a variety of investment options based on your risk tolerance. the thinking behind most of them is that the closer you are to retirement, the more conservative your risk-taking should be. a good adviser won't just lump you into a plan based on your age, but will also consider your other non-401(k) holdings. balance is everything.
i am sure that my depression will rear its head again in the coming years and i will fall into old patterns from time to time. my marriage will have difficult days ahead; my mother has already begun speculating whether i am pregnant or not, and when the time comes, i will torment myself over what it means to be a good mother. but for now, i share this story because it is worth celebrating a rare moment in which two vastly different asian generations can reach a deep understanding of the love they have for each other. for now, i feel free.

women learn early on that their greatest and primary value lies in their appearance, and whether that appearance is deemed desirable enough by men. the #metoo movement is, in part, about exposing the ways in which women's bodies are objectified and then weaponized against them. si has spent decades making big money off of that objectification, and a handful of artful nudes and big block letters does nothing to counteract that. as the new yorker's alexandra schwartz put it, sports illustrated is simply fighting fire with fire.

a key factor, according to democratic operatives, is anger over the gop's vociferous attacks on warnock, the senior pastor at ebenezer baptist church in atlanta, the onetime pulpit of martin luther king jr. loeffler and republican outside groups have engaged in repeated over-the-top and false slams on warnock, taking his sermons out of context, labeling him a marxist and suggesting he covered up child abuse.

now, i must admit my private shame at having almost passed over my brilliant friend. discouraged by the cover and the title, which to me read more chick lit and less literary magnum opus, i didn't pick up this novel until the fourth and final installment in the series had been published. i finally took heed of the rave reviews and found myself instantly dazzled by ferrante's heartbreakingly honest narrative. this book isn't flashy or presumptuous; it doesn't need to be. the simple beauty of the story, of the unbreakable bond between two young girls joined by circumstance, tenacity, and the turbulence of adolescence, speaks for itself.
no matter how hard we want to, there's one thing we can never do and that's change the past. we can weep, beat our fists against the wall, or eat bags of cookies to assuage the guilt, but it won't make the slightest bit of difference and won't make us feel any better. the past is gone, over, no more.

it was night-time on a weekend and i was dealing with a man with a potential head injury. we were told pre-arrival that he had collapsed or was fitting and was hiv positive. i was treating him in the back of the ambulance and dressing his head wound when i stopped to put on a new pair of gloves. he then took real exception to me wearing gloves. i explained we had been told he was hiv positive and that we treated everybody the same, it was normal procedure. but he grabbed me and started punching me in the head. then he bit my forearm. he'd already been bleeding from his mouth so when he bit me it was blood-on-blood contact. the police arrived and we got an escort but when we got to hospital he refused to give a blood sample. luckily, or unluckily for me, about 20 minutes in he admitted to a nurse 'just be careful, i'm hiv positive. this is why i support this bill, it would be compulsory to give a sample of either saliva or blood. i spent the next year thinking 'i'm going to get the hiv virus'. i had to go on a set of anti-viral medicines and i was very poorly. i was already emotionally injured and these drugs made me physically ill too. my doctor even suggested i take time off. but i'm a bit of a stubborn paramedic, as my wife says. i prefer to say i'm 'independent'.

we now spend 10 hours a day looking at a screen. that's nearly half of our lives spent living in a virtual world. the iphone was released just 10 years ago. our existence has been radically transformed in a relatively short space of time. while it is hard to remember life before computers, research shows that we aren't as effective on screens as we might think. we tested the effects of multi-screening on brand recall and found that when dealing with more than one device at a time, the mental strain decreases our attention and emotional response and eventually leads to cognitive collapse – which means people are looking, but they haven't the mental energy to take more in (all too familiar a feeling in the connected lives we lead.)
the president certainly didn't invent racism. but he's certainly given a voice to it and expanded it and created a platform for those things, ocasio-cortez told 60 minutes correspondent anderson cooper during the segment. when asked if she believes trump is a racist, she replied: yeah. yeah, no question.

the decision to force members to go through metal detectors before they enter the floor is a change of some historical importance. since the beginning of congress, lawmakers have been exempt from the same security protocols that govern the general public.
look at some of the allies that america has — japan, south korea, canada, mexico, the uk. trump has a style of insulting and being brash about things on twitter, but mostly issues with these countries have been solved behind closed doors because their relationships have been institutionalised over 40, 50, 60 years. with institutionalised relationships, a lot of these differences get divided down the political ladder, where empowered cabinet secretaries can make decisions. with india and the u.s., it's a one step forward and two steps back kind of situation.

the risk in business is that most corporations get a lot of conflicting demands ― demands to make a profit, demands to do good for society, demands to be good stewards of the environment ― and when faced with all these conflicting demands (some of them are conflicting at least on a short-term basis), the rational response is hypocrisy. they say one thing to shareholders, they say something else to stakeholders. they'll have an annual report for shareholders and a separate corporate social responsibility report. in one they'll talk about the good things they're doing for the world and in the other they'll talk about dollars and cents and profits.

scholars say textbooks like these, with their alternate versions of history and emphasis on christian national identity, represent one small part of the conditions that lead to events like last week's riot at the u.s. capitol, an episode that was permeated with the symbols of christian nationalism. before storming the capitol, some groups prayed in the name of jesus and asked for divine protection. they flew christian and jesus 2020 flags and pointed to trump's presidency as the will of god. the linkage between christian beliefs and the violent attack on congress has since pushed evangelical leaders to confront their own relationship with trump and their support for the rioters.

week by week, many christians in political power seem to try to one-up the bigotry and oppression of their colleagues. it's the now-proverbial hold-my-beer ideology, with those christians vying to be the most powerful and, by consequence, the most oppressive and violent. the sad reality is that significant elements of christianity in the united states are entrenched in political power, on sundays teaching that jesus loves everybody but then moralizing people out of the gospel that they say is free.

perhaps, the most often heard question is, how long did it take you to make that? on its face, the question is matter-of-fact, but many artists take it as a challenge, as though the person asking wants to know how many dollars per hour you earn, so they can calculate it into wages, said dorothy fagan, an artist in cobbs creek, virginia, or the person wants to make sure he's getting his money's worth. a snide riposte some artists are tempted to make is, well, how much do you make an hour? but artists are more apt to soften the blow or reframe the question. taking the latter approach, one might describe one's method of working, discussing the various steps involved and how ideas form and change during the process. this type of discussion, fagan said, makes a precise determination of how long the painting took impractical.

the truth is that being angry often feels good. it's a release, a molten carapace to put up against the continual indignities of lives lived paycheck-to-paycheck or in the shadow of old age or even merely in the knowledge that others are richer and stronger than you are. it's easy, then, to turn on others who are poorer and weaker, or who are unfamiliar, who can be turned into dangerous specters whose banishment would change your life completely for the better.

identifying this can be a tricky process since many of the agreements that couples make are implicit, unspoken and even unrecognized. we all have our own set points for what we find to be comfortable levels of risk and security in our lives and our relationships. it's not uncommon for a person with a lower threshold for risk to be in a relationship with someone with a relatively higher one. the dynamic tension of such a match can be a source of distress to the couple, depending upon how different each partner's comfort levels are and their respective skill levels in dealing with differences.
