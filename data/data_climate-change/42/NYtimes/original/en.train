With no deal, trade relations between Britain and the European Union would revert to the very basic rules of the World Trade Organization. These entail that neither side is allowed to treat the other more favorably than it treats other trade partners around the globe. If Britain steps out of the union without any bilateral trade deals, a customs regime would have to be installed between Britain and its European neighbors. In the interim, thousands of businesses on both sides, and millions of customers, will be thrown into a costly confusion. At least my insurer has a plan; many other companies are still struggling to find one.\n\nThe old, once-amusing British headline Fog in the Channel — Continent Cut Off could finally come to bear some truth, particularly for Germany's key industry: automakers. Within Europe, Britain is by far their biggest market. Last year auto manufacturers based in Germany exported three times more cars to Britain than they did to China, according to their trade association's data. The auditing firm Deloitte believes that the number of German cars sold to Britain could drop from 800,000 to 550,000 annually, endangering 18,000 German jobs.\n\nThe auto industry is a great example of just how complicated and messy a hard Brexit will be. It's not just that fewer British customers will buy German cars. It's also that well-established, just-in-time supply chains could be destroyed. As The Guardian reported, the crankshaft of a BMW Mini crosses the Channel three times before it becomes part of the finished car: The cast is made in France, then goes to a BMW plant in Warwickshire, where it is drilled, then travels to Munich, where it is set into the engine. The engine finally is shipped back to the Mini plant in Oxford, to be mounted into the car. With a customs regime in place, all those cross-Channel trips will become much more expensive.\n\nBrexiteers claimed that Britain could shake off the union's principle of free movement of people yet somehow maintain the usual level of free trade with the continent. Those were pipe dreams. So were expectations that as the hour of Brexit approached, the European Union would bow to Britain's demands.\n\nDespite the damage Brexit will cause in the remaining 27 countries of the union, they are unflinching in their message to London: This will be painful for both of us, but we can't let you change the rules. Germany, which sells far more cars to the rest of the union than to Britain, has insisted on this hard line throughout the talks. Germany doesn't want to lose British buyers, but it can't afford to undermine the common-market structure that undergirds its sales to the rest of Europe.
Valentine's Day is upon us again. It's a time of candlelit dinners, heart-shaped candy boxes from the drugstore and (depending on your relationship status) watching old romantic comedies while you drink wine by yourself.\n\nIt's a great celebration. But where did it come from? And why do we care about it so much?\n\nPeople have been trying to answer those questions for a long time. The New York Times pondered the day's origin in 1853 but called it one of those mysterious historical or antiquarian problems which are doomed never to be solved.
In the recent past, not speaking Paraguay's native language was no barrier to those seeking to gain or stay in power. When he was dictator, Stroessner never made a single address in Guaraní (although his wife spoke the language and he rewarded rural Guaraní-speakers with land for their loyalty to his regime).\n\nBut now, voters are encouraged to check if candidates speak the language, and those who do not face mockery on social media. The most recent politician to feel the repercussions was Santiago Peña, a close ally of President Horacio Cartes.\n\nIn a result that surprised many, Mr. Peña failed to secure his party's nomination to contest the presidential elections in 2018, losing last month in the primary of the ruling Colorado party to Mario Abdo. One of the reasons for Mr. Peña's downfall was an elitist image painted by his opponents, aided in no small part by his inability to speak Guaraní — something Mr. Abdo did not hesitate to point out during the campaign.\n\nUnder pressure from the electorate, Mr. Peña took a crash course in the language, but it appeared to have done little to sway voters.\n\nIt wasn't like this before, said Maria Gloria Pereira, a policy maker and former head of curriculum at the Ministry of Education. Politicians feel this pressure, because they know now that those that don't speak the language of the people are far from the people.
Mr. McConnell, 76, is the longest-serving Senate Republican leader in history and is a wily tactician. While he is not generally considered vulnerable, his popularity is lagging at home. A poll by Western Kentucky University last spring found that only 30 percent of Kentuckians approve of his job performance. Sticking with Mr. Trump, whose approval ratings top 50 percent in Kentucky, is in his own political interest.\n\nBut if he wants to hang onto his job as majority leader, Mr. McConnell must also be mindful of the political fortunes of Republicans seeking re-election in states won by Mrs. Clinton in 2016 or by Democrats in November. A prolonged government shutdown is the last thing those lawmakers need. And even some Republicans up for re-election in states won by Mr. Trump, like Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, sound uneasy.\n\nA shutdown, in my view, is a no-win proposition, Ms. Capito said, adding that she heard complaints from Transportation Security Administration workers as she was returning to Washington for the start of the new Congress this week. Ms. Capito is the chairwoman of the appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over the Department of Homeland Security; the panel has already passed a bill funding the department, including $1.6 billion for border security including fencing — but with no money for Mr. Trump's wall.\n\nIt is just a lot of unneeded stress on a lot of people, she said of the shutdown.\n\nI would like to see it resolved soon, said Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, who also faces re-election in 2020. She repeated herself for emphasis: I would like to see it resolved soon.\n\nFor Mr. McConnell, the shutdown fight presents a dynamic that is likely to become familiar over the next two years, as House Democrats rush to pass long-sought liberal policies and, in many cases, try to use the chamber to highlight Republicans' opposition to legislative changes they believe are overwhelmingly popular. Mr. McConnell has already been burned once, having negotiated and passed through the Senate a plan to avoid the shutdown in the first place only to have Mr. Trump pull his support at the last minute.\n\nHe faces that reality now on every issue: What's the White House going to do with this? said Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois and Mr. Schumer's No. 2. He predicted that Mr. McConnell's approach — to simply stand in the way so that Mr. Trump is not forced to use his veto pen — would only change if Republican senators up for re-election begin to fear political costs of carrying the president's water.\n\n\n\nSenator John Cornyn of Texas, Mr. McConnell's former No. 2, compared Mr. McConnell's task to threading a needle. Mr. McConnell's former chief of staff, Josh Holmes, said it was considerably more simple than that.
This is a global problem, and it still isn't being taken seriously\n\nMorrison is right about one thing — the only solution is global action, writes Ross Gittins, the economics editor of The Sydney Morning Herald, Australia's oldest newspaper. While Mr. Morrison certainly deserves blame, Mr. Gittins says, nothing Australia could have done by itself would have prevented the current devastation, since the country accounts for only 1.3 percent of global emissions.\n\nAll the big, rich economies — particularly the Americans, less so the Europeans — must share the blame for the continuing rise in average temperatures, he writes.\n\nEven the biggest developing economies — China and India, particularly — could have done more to reduce the intensity of their emissions (emissions per dollar of G.D.P.) without abandoning their efforts to raise their living standards.\n\nIf in the past year (or the past decade) the world began to understand how dangerous climate change is, it certainly didn't act like it, Elizabeth Kolbert, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Sixth Extinction, writes in The New Yorker. In the past 10 years, she says, more carbon dioxide was emitted than in all of human history up to the election of John F. Kennedy.\n\nReally waking up, and not just dreaming to ourselves that things will be O.K., has become urgent — beyond urgent, she writes. She paraphrases fire officials in the Australian state of Victoria: The world is in danger, and we need to act immediately to survive.\n\n[Related: This apocalyptic Australian summer is our Sandy Hook moment.]\n\n'Adaptation means change, and change is hard'\n\nCutting carbon emissions is no longer enough, according to David Bowman, a professor of fire science at the University of Tasmania. We still have to decarbonize but now we also have to adapt, he writes in The Conversation.\n\nOne adaptation Australians could make, he suggests, is shifting the traditional vacation season — during which schools have their summer break — to cooler months, so that families aren't heading into the country's forests and national parks at the peak of fire season.\n\nRearranging the calendar around risk may meet resistance, he writes, but it could reduce the strain on firefighters and make mass evacuations easier.\n\nCalifornia could learn something from Australia's fire warning system, writes Diana Leonard in The Washington Post. After the disastrous Black Saturday fires of 2009, which killed 173 people, the country developed a more sophisticated, national warning protocol, which the chief executive of the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Center in Melbourne believes has saved lives.\n\nThe National Weather Service provides something of a similar function for tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in the United States, but in California fire evacuation orders are issued by local law enforcement, a system that hasn't always kept pace with the most extreme blazes. A more centralized system, like the one in Australia, could allow the public to access information about the location and spread of a dangerous fire in real time, Ms. Leonard writes.\n\n'Climate change is not the only man-made reason'\n\nAustralia has an arson problem, writes Paul Read in The Australian Financial Review. A senior lecturer at the School of Psychological Sciences at Monash University, Mr. Read notes that as much as 50 percent of Australia's wildfires are potentially set deliberately. The New South Wales Police Force announced on Monday that it had charged 24 people in connection with bush fire arson.\n\nIf we are to prevent bush fires and save lives, property and wildlife, we will also need to find solutions for the other more complex human dimensions of the causes of conflagrations like the ones we are now witnessing, he writes.
As the sun rose this morning on a new year, bleary-eyed people across the United States poured out their half-drunk champagne bottles, gathered up their empty beer cans and turned to Twitter to share their resolution with the world.\n\nDry January has begun.\n\nFor those experimenting with temporary sobriety, there is pride in abstention. These droughts are self-imposed and finite — and come with social media bragging rights. But the last time we entered a decade known as the '20s, Americans were staring down the barrel of a government-mandated dry spell, with no end in sight. For those who partook of the hard stuff, this first dry January was greeted not with determination and #goals but with denial and despair.\n\nProhibition is most closely associated with the 1920s, but its seeds were planted a century earlier, when the national temperance movement began decrying alcohol as the root cause of societal evils including laziness, promiscuity and poverty. Eliminate the drink, they said, and Americans will be a happier, healthier and more prosperous people.\n\nThe movement gained traction around the turn of the century, in large part thanks to women's groups who saw temperance as a way to combat domestic violence. On Jan. 16, 1919 — more than a year before women could vote nationwide — the teetotalers achieved their ultimate goal: The Eighteenth Amendment, prohibiting the manufacture, sale or transportation of intoxicating liquors anywhere within the United States, was ratified.
But after leading American Samoa to its first victory and narrowly missing out on advancement to the next round of the 2014 Word Cup qualification, Rongen had an epiphany.\n\nI've become a romantic — I'm all for it, he said of expansion. Still, the Oceania confederation, of which American Samoa is a member, currently does not have an automatic place in the World Cup; it is guaranteed only a playoff spot. In 2014, that went to New Zealand, but it was trounced by Mexico in an intercontinental playoff, leaving Oceania unrepresented in Brazil.\n\nThe game is the people's game, the world's game, Rongen said. Smaller countries, they deserve an opportunity to belong, or maybe not to belong. There will be a few games we might need a mercy rule. That is the beauty of the game.\n\nAn expanded World Cup is likely to have the biggest impact in Asia. It is the world's most populous continent, with 47 member associations and two of the biggest underdeveloped soccer markets in the world, China and India, which have a combined population of over two billion people. China has qualified for the World Cup finals once, in 2002; India, despite recent multimillion-dollar investments in a nascent domestic league, has never taken part.\n\nAsia currently has only four guaranteed World Cup berths, plus an intercontinental playoff spot.\n\nYou can look at a 32-team tournament and say it is not inclusive, Stephen Constantine, the coach of India's national team, said. It is maybe overdue in terms of expansion.
Covid-19: Virus Has Recently Infected 1 in 50 in England Scientists are studying whether Moderna's vaccine supply can be doubled by cutting doses in half. Germany will extend its national lockdown.\n\nThe virus has recently infected one in 50 people in England, officials say. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 0:42 - 0:00 transcript Britain Scrambles to Battle the Virus Speaking at a news conference, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain said that 1.3 million people had already been vaccinated, and that he hoped that the most vulnerable could be protected by the vaccine within about six weeks. I can tell you that this afternoon — with Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca combined — as of this afternoon, we've now vaccinated over 1.1 million people in England and over 1.3 million across the U.K. Then we think that by the middle of February, when a very considerable portion of the most vulnerable groups will have been vaccinated, or so we hope and believe, that's the top four of the J.C.V.I. cohorts, then, you know, there really is the prospect of beginning the relaxation. Speaking at a news conference, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain said that 1.3 million people had already been vaccinated, and that he hoped that the most vulnerable could be protected by the vaccine within about six weeks. Credit Credit... Andrew Testa for The New York Times As England re-entered lockdown on Tuesday, new figures showed that one in 50 people had recently been infected with the virus, and officials warned that some restrictions on daily life could still be needed next winter. Speaking at a news conference, Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised to focus government efforts on rolling out its strained mass vaccination program intended to prevent a surge in infections of a highly transmissible variant of the virus from overwhelming the health service. With more than a million confirmed cases in the week ending Jan. 2, or 2 percent of England's population, Britain is in a race against time to distribute vaccines. Mr. Johnson was speaking on a day when the government said more than 60,000 new cases were recorded for the first time. Standing alongside him, Professor Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, said that the number of daily deaths, now averaging around 530, was expected to rise and that if people did not observe a lockdown order to stay at home, the risk was extraordinarily high. He also warned that Britons might face some restrictions well into the future. We might have to bring a few in, in the next winter for example — that is possible — because winter will benefit the virus, Professor Whitty said. Mr. Johnson said that 1.3 million people had already been vaccinated and that he hoped that the most vulnerable, a group including the elderly and numbering around 13 million, could be protected by the vaccine within about six weeks, turning the tide in the battle against the virus. We in government are now using every second of this lockdown to put that invisible shield around the elderly and the vulnerable in the form of vaccinations, he said. Mr. Johnson said that England would be locked down until inoculations reached the four most vulnerable groups: residents in nursing homes and those who care for them, everyone over the age of 70, all frontline health and social care workers, and everyone who is clinically extremely vulnerable. If we succeed in vaccinating all those groups, we will have removed huge numbers of people from the path of the virus, he said. That goal, he added, could be achieved by the middle of February. But to do that, the pace of vaccinations will need to increase drastically. The four groups that the prime minister cited include 13.9 million people in England, according to Nadhim Zahawi, the minister overseeing the vaccine effort. Since the campaign started on Dec. 8, fewer than 800,000 people in England had been vaccinated as of Dec. 27, the last date when data was available. But with the introduction on Monday of the first doses of a vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca — shots that are easier to transport and do not need to be stored at very cold temperatures — British officials said that the campaign could now be ramped up. To meet Mr. Johnson's target, some two million doses need to be given every week. Mr. Johnson also said he was planning a new system to ensure that those traveling to Britain had a negative coronavirus test before arrival. But he was forced to defend himself against charges that he moved too slowly to order the lockdown, and showed poor judgment by insisting over the weekend that many schools in England should reopen after the winter holiday on Monday — only to reverse that decision on Monday night.

Etienne Laurent/EPA, via Shutterstock Officials in California have painted an increasingly catastrophic picture of the state's Covid-19 crisis over the past several days, precisely what they had warned was coming, as the state faces an oxygen shortage. California has deployed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the California Emergency Medical Services Authority to deliver and refill oxygen tanks. In Los Angeles County, emergency workers have been told to conserve oxygen and administer the minimum amount of oxygen to keep patients' oxygen saturation level at or just above 90 percent. (A level in the low 90s or below is a concern for people with Covid-19.) Officials in the most populous U.S. county have said a person is being infected every six seconds in the county and one in five residents currently tested was infected with Covid-19. Your bubble is not as safe as you think it is, the department tweeted. Gov. Gavin Newsom has warned that the worst was somehow yet to come: a surge on top of a surge driven by post-holiday infections. As of Tuesday evening, 4,374 people with Covid-19 had died in the preceding two weeks, compared with 3,202 in the two weeks before that. In some cases, there will be nowhere for the victims of that surge to go. Health authorities in Los Angeles County have directed ambulance crews not to transport some cardiac arrest patients whose survival is unlikely. At some hospitals, patients are being lined up outside while workers try to find bed space. California was already short on hospital beds before the pandemic, and I.C.U. capacity in a large swath of the state has been nonexistent for weeks. The surge in Southern California has been so severe that industry groups themselves have called for film and television production, which had been allowed to continue even after outdoor dining was banned, to pause. SAG-AFTRA, the union representing 160,000 industry workers, was joined by groups representing producers and advertisers in calling for an in-person production halt on Sunday. Their statement noted that even if workers do not contract the virus, they are still at risk of injury from stunts, equipment failures, or falls. With few if any hospital beds available, it is hard to understand how a worker injured on set is supposed to seek treatment, said David White, SAG-AFTRA's national executive director. The Grammy Awards, one of the entertainment industry's biggest nights, were postponed on Tuesday from Jan. 31 to March 14. A statement from the Recording Academy, which presents the awards, and CBS, its longtime broadcast partner, cited the deteriorating situation in Los Angeles.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSecond doses have begun for the earliest U.S. vaccine recipients. Sandra Lindsay received her second dose of the Covid-19 Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine on Monday, three weeks after the first dose. Credit... Shannon Stapleton/Reuters After Sandra Lindsay became the first person in the United States to receive a Covid-19 vaccination outside a clinical trial, something unexpected happened: She acquired a fan club. Half a dozen inspired youngsters in Lee, N.H., ranging in age from 8 to 12, each sent Ms. Lindsay a letter praising her for leading the way. I would like to thank you for taking the first vaccine in the U.S.A., 12-year-old Finley wrote. I have had a hard time in this era. What you did was incredibly brave. He added, You helped everyone who was unsure, and you gave hope to those who are lonely and felt unsafe. On Monday, Ms. Lindsay, 52, the director of critical care nursing at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in Queens, was in the vanguard again. The requisite 21 days had passed, so it was time for her, and hundreds of other health care workers and long-term care patients at the head of the line, to receive the second half of the two-dose Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. By the end of the day, 118,304 people in the city had gotten a first dose of coronavirus vaccinations, and 756 had gotten a second, according to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Across the country, other early recipients were getting shot No. 2 as well. Nearly all states have made getting health care workers and nursing home residents immunized a top priority. But the effort, now three weeks old, has been slower than many governors and public health officials hoped. The federal government has shipped more than 15 million vaccine doses to states, but only 4.5 million people have received them so far. There are 21 million health care workers nationwide, and three million residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. Dr. Mark P. Jarrett, chief quality officer for Northwell Health, which operates Long Island Jewish, 22 other hospitals and 800 ambulatory care sites in the New York metropolitan area, said his organization has vaccinated about 27,000 employees with either the Pfizer or the Moderna vaccines. The Moderna recipients will get their second shot after 28 days. The two-stage nature of the vaccines will affect how fast the vaccination program progresses, Dr. Jarrett noted. I would expect that general public inoculations could start in late February, and it will take a long time to complete, he said. You're talking about millions of people, and they have to come back for second shots. Ms. Lindsay said on Tuesday that she had experienced no side effects from the vaccine, and that she was touched by the children's letters, which left her very, very emotional. She said she had been sure since the early days of the pandemic that she would get vaccinated as soon as she could: Given my experiences on the front lines, and seeing the hard work of my colleagues and the suffering and death of patients, I knew back then that when it was developed, I wanted to take the vaccine. But even with the two shots now safely in her arm, she still worries about going to work. I have been a nurse for more than 26 years, and I've never been more scared than I am right now, even with the vaccine, because this virus is so erratic, unpredictable and does not discriminate, she said. You never know what you are walking into.\n\nThe W.H.O. criticizes China for not letting its experts into the country. Lining up for Covid-19 testing outside a Beijing hospital on Tuesday. The Beijing area has reported new cases in recent days. Credit... Greg Baker/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The World Health Organization has criticized China for not authorizing a team of international experts to enter the country to investigate the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, a highly anticipated trip that has been months in the making. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O.'s director general, said at a Tuesday news conference that two members of the U.N. agency's 10-person team were already in transit to China when they were informed that the necessary visa permissions had not yet been granted. The team had been expected to go to Wuhan, the city where the virus first emerged. Dr. Tedros, who has been criticized for praising China despite the country's early mishandling of the outbreak, said he was very disappointed by the news and was in touch with senior Chinese officials to resolve the issue. Michael Ryan, the head of the emergencies program at the W.H.O., said that one of the experts in transit had already returned home, while the other was staying in a third country awaiting further instructions. The rest of the team, consisting of experts from the Netherlands, Japan, the United States and elsewhere, had not yet left for China when news of the visa delays came through. Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a regularly scheduled briefing on Wednesday that the government was doing its best to resolve the issue but that the question of the virus investigation is very complicated. It appeared to be the latest example of China's efforts to stymie an independent investigation into the origins of the virus, which has infected more than 86 million people and killed 1.8 million around the world since the initial outbreak in Wuhan more than a year ago. The W.H.O. has discussed sending an investigative team to Wuhan since last January, but the Chinese government has delayed those plans while promoting flimsy theories that the outbreak started outside of China. Last summer, two W.H.O. experts were allowed into China to negotiate the terms of the investigation, but they did not go to Wuhan. The Chinese government has yet to release crucial information about its own internal investigations into the virus's origins, including data from animal samples taken in and around Wuhan. Most scientists say the virus probably jumped to humans from an animal, probably a bat. They say that solving the mystery of its origin is critical to preventing future pandemics and helping to develop vaccines and treatments. In the absence of more solid information, numerous conspiracy theories about the virus have flourished. China has largely, but not entirely, subdued the virus within its borders. In Hebei Province near Beijing, a small flare-up in infections led the local authorities to declare wartime mode this week. After Hebei reported 63 new cases in a day, officials in Shijiazhuang, the provincial capital, on Wednesday imposed tougher travel controls, barred gatherings and moved elementary and middle schools to online learning. The W.H.O.'s criticism of China marks a rare public fissure in what has otherwise been a close relationship. For months, the W.H.O. has publicly praised China for its response to the coronavirus, in the hope that such a soft-handed approach would yield crucial access and information. Critics say that in doing so, the organization allowed the Chinese government to whitewash its mistakes and portray itself as a transparent and cooperative global partner in the pandemic response. Some have expressed concern that by now, the inquiry has become so politicized it is unlikely to yield concrete findings. But one thing is almost certain: If and when the W.H.O. team does arrive in China, another delay is expected. Like all other Chinese citizens and foreign visitors, the investigators will be required to quarantine for 14 days.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nF.D.A. is questioning the accuracy of a coronavirus test Congress is using. Curative's walk-up kiosk testing site for Covid-19 in Seattle on Saturday. Credit... Ted S. Warren/Associated Press The Food and Drug Administration has raised concerns about the accuracy of a coronavirus test used by lawmakers, congressional staff and reporters, potentially muddling the already fraught effort to stem the spread of the virus on Capitol Hill. In a notice published on Monday, the F.D.A. warned of the risk of false results, particularly false negative results, with the Curative SARS-Cov-2 test, which in the Capitol is a self-administered nasal swab and typically produces a result within 12 hours. The warning outlined multiple risks to a patient with a false negative result, including delayed or lack of supportive treatment, lack of monitoring of infected individuals and their household or other close contacts for symptoms resulting in increased risk of spread of Covid-19 within the community. Curative's test is based around a laboratory technique called polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R. — typically considered the gold standard of coronavirus diagnostics. P.C.R.-based tests carry a reputation for high accuracy, making the problems with Curative's product somewhat unusual. Other tests, such as rapid antigen tests, which can run in just minutes, are typically more prone to returning incorrect results. The F.D.A. notice did not specify the rate at which Curative's test was delivering false negatives. It did, however, note that samples that come from nasal swabs and oral fluid specimens should only be taken from people with Covid-19 symptoms. We have been working with the agency to address their concerns and these limitations, and we will continue to work interactively with F.D.A. through the Emergency Use Authorization process, said Amy VandenBerg, a senior vice president of Curative. After months without testing on Capitol Hill, Curative has been providing the tests to hundreds of lawmakers and staff who work in the building since at least November. The testing was implemented in part to help lawmakers who travel across the country twice a week comply with Washington's quarantine requirements after travel. Dr. Brian P. Monahan, Congress's attending physician, acknowledged the warning about the test in a memo, which was first obtained by Politico, but wrote that it was the most accurate available and that all tests carry the risk of a false result. This is not unique to this test, Dr. Monahan wrote. It is a problem for all the coronavirus tests. We expect to have additional information in the coming days from the FDA and our expert consultants with regard to any concerns about the ongoing use of this test for the Capitol community. The warning about the tests, which are used by several lawmakers, aides and reporters, on days when Congress is in session, comes as lawmakers are still struggling to implement coronavirus protocols and prevent the virus from spreading through their ranks. Congressional leaders initially resisted providing testing in the Capitol despite the amount of traveling lawmakers do to vote in person because of a nationwide shortage and concerns about appearing to jump the line. Representative Kay Granger, Republican of Texas, reported a positive test after spending time on the House floor Sunday for the swearing-in of the 117th Congress, where hundreds of lawmakers had to vote in person. It is unclear whether any lawmakers are quarantining as a result of that exposure. Emily Cochrane and\n\nAdvisers to the W.H.O. recommend sticking with Pfizer's timetable for vaccine doses, with some exceptions. A worker preparing Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine doses at the Arizona State Fairgrounds in Phoenix on Monday. Credit... Adriana Zehbrauskas for The New York Times A group of international experts advising the World Health Organization has recommended that the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine be administered as recommended by its manufacturer, in two doses given three to four weeks apart. However, it concluded that countries that have limited supplies of the vaccine and are concerned about the level of transmission of the virus could delay the second dose for up to six weeks. That delay would help maximize the number of individuals benefiting from a first dose, the group's chairman, Dr. Alejandro Cravioto, said at a news conference on Tuesday. We have to be a bit open to these types of decisions that countries need to make according to their own epidemiological situations, he added. The decision followed what Katherine O'Brien, director of the W.H.O.'s Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals, referred to as a very robust discussion about the trade-offs between risks, including the risk that the vaccine may not work as well as anticipated if it is not given in the way it was tested. The group, known as the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization, also recommended that the vaccine be given only in situations where health workers are able to treat rare severe allergic reactions, known as anaphylaxis. How the Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine Works Two shots can prime the immune system to fight the coronavirus. The experts also concluded that while there is not yet enough safety data to be able to recommend the Pfizer vaccine for pregnant women, there are situations where the benefit of vaccination of a pregnant woman outweighs the potential risks, such as health workers at high risk of exposure, Dr. Cravioto said. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last month authorized the Pfizer vaccine for emergency use for individuals 16 and older, including pregnant women. Though the vaccine was not tested in pregnant women or in those who were breastfeeding, some experts said the virus itself poses greater risks to pregnant women than the new vaccine, and noted that vaccines have been given to pregnant women for decades and have been overwhelmingly safe. Dr. Cravioto also said that the vaccine should be offered regardless of whether a person has previously been infected by the virus. However, in situations of limited vaccine supply, people whose infections have been documented may choose to delay getting vaccinated until close to six months after their infections, in order to make the vaccine more available to others. At the news conference, the W.H.O.'s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also revealed that a separate team of international experts who were expected to go to Wuhan, China this week to conduct a long-awaited investigation into the origins of the pandemic had been delayed; two of the members had already departed their home countries. Today we learned Chinese officials have not yet finalized the necessary permissions for the team's arrival in China, he said. I'm very disappointed with this news. He added that he had been in contact about the matter with senior Chinese officials who assured him, he said, that the country is speeding up internal procedures for the earliest possible deployment.\n\nU.S. ROUNDUP Many Chicago teachers stay home to protest school reopening plans, and other news from around the U.S. Chicago has been wrestling for months over plans to reopen its public schools, including Frederic Chopin Elementary on the city's West Side. Credit... Taylor Glascock for The New York Times Just over half of the teachers who were expected to report to school buildings in Chicago on Monday, as the first step in the district's reopening plan, did not show up, the district said on Tuesday. The absences were part of a long-running clash between teachers and administrators that is complicating the district's efforts to resume in-classroom instruction for the first time since March 2020. Chicago Public Schools, the nation's third largest district with some 340,000 students, is planning to welcome prekindergarten students and some special education students back to schools next week, followed by kindergarten through eighth-grade students on Feb. 1. The students' families can choose to have them return or to continue with remote learning; about 37 percent have chosen to return. The district's plan has run into relentless opposition from the Chicago Teachers Union, which argues that virus transmission remains too high in many neighborhoods and that the district's safety measures are inadequate. A majority of the City Council signed a letter opposing the plan and demanding that the district negotiate with the union over the conditions for reopening. The district, which is under the control of Mayor Lori Lightfoot, indicated on Tuesday that it was determined to press forward with its reopening plans. The district's chief executive, Janice K. Jackson, said that overall, some 60 percent of school-based employees — including teachers and paraprofessionals — who were expected to return to schools on Monday did so, which is significant, she said, considering the fact that they were pressured by the union not to return. For comparison, she said, about 83 percent of employees reported for work in the first two days following winter break last year, which is what we typically expect around this time. In other news from around the country: The Mississippi Department of Corrections has reported that 108 people died in its prisons in 2020, a toll that was significantly higher than a year earlier. But as of Monday, the department had not disclosed whether any of those deaths were caused by the coronavirus, though more than 1,400 inmates have been infected since the pandemic's start, according to state data.\n\nWorkers in meat processing plants in Nebraska are prioritized in the state's vaccine distribution.

David Richard/Associated Press Cleveland Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski, two other coaches and two players tested positive for Covid-19, the team said on Tuesday, putting the team's championship aspirations in doubt. All five people will miss the Browns matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday night, Cleveland's first postseason game in nearly two decades. Special teams coordinator Mike Priefer will take over as head coach in Stefanski's absence. The N.F.L. said there was no change to the status of the game, and the league and team continue to conduct standard contact tracing to identify any possible high-risk close contacts. Stefanski and the other coaches and players must be isolated from the team for a minimum of 10 days. If any players or personnel are found to have had close contact with them, they would need to remain apart from the team for five days, after which they would be eligible to return to the team and play in the game. Offensive lineman Joel Bitonio is one of the two players who tested positive. Bitonio has been with the Browns his entire seven-year career, which has included the 2016 and 2017 seasons, when the team went 1-15 and 0-16. Stefanski gave Bitonio, the longest tenured player on the team, the game ball after Sunday's win. Now Bitonio will miss his first chance to play in a postseason game. During their 24-22 victory on Sunday over the Steelers, the Browns had six players on the Covid-19 reserve list who had either tested positive or had close contact with someone who had. The previous week, the Browns had played without any of their best wide receivers because of an outbreak on the team. The number of N.F.L. players, coaches and staff who tested positive picked up noticeably starting in November as the virus raged through communities around the country. In the week that ended Jan. 2, the N.F.L. said there were 34 new confirmed positive tests among players and 36 new confirmed positives among other personnel. The 70 combined cases was up from 58 positive tests the week before and 45 cases the week before that.\n\nGLOBAL ROUNDUP Merkel announces an extension of the lockdown in Germany, and other news from around the world. Video Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany announced on Tuesday that the country would extend the nationwide lockdown until the end of January amid the surge of coronavirus cases and the fear that the more contagious variant of the virus could spread. Credit Credit... Lena Mucha for The New York Times Chancellor Angela Merkel and state governors in Germany agreed on Tuesday to extend the nationwide lockdown by three weeks, until at least the end of January, and to tighten restrictions amid high rates of coronavirus cases and deaths and the fear that a more contagious variant of the virus could spread in Germany. The measures we have adopted today are drastic, Ms. Merkel said in a news conference after the meeting. They are not just a continuation of what we did before Christmas. Given the situation, they are tougher. Under the extended lockdown rules, members of a household cannot meet more than one person from another household, and cultural sites and all but essential shops are closed. Schools and child care centers are also closed, though some school buildings remain open for children whose parents cannot supervise them at home. Ms. Merkel and the governors also agreed to limit movement to 15 kilometers from home for people living in areas in which there are more than 200 new infections a week per 100,000 people. It is the first such rule in effect across Germany since the pandemic began. After the failure of lighter lockdown measures in November — under which both schools and most shops had remained open — the German authorities had set stricter rules in mid-December. Those restrictions, which were set to expire Jan. 10, cut short the pre-Christmas shopping period, discouraged family gatherings over the festive season and curtailed celebrations for New Year's Eve. In a recent YouGov poll, two thirds of German respondents said that they approved of an extension to the lockdown. About 24 percent also said that they thought the restrictions should be tightened, according to the poll, commissioned by the German news service DPA. On Monday, the health authorities in Germany registered 11,897 new infections and 944 deaths. According to a New York Times database, there were 17,526 new infections per day on average during the last seven days, comparable to the number of daily infections registered at the beginning of November, when authorities started the lockdown.

Ronen Zvulun/Reuters JERUSALEM — The Israeli government announced on Tuesday that it would tighten its lockdown as coronavirus cases in the country have climbed rapidly over the past week. In late December, Israel entered into its third nationwide lockdown, but much of the public has since flouted restrictions, prompting health experts to call for tougher enforcement. The government still has not published a comprehensive list of the newest restrictions, but cabinet ministers confirmed that it decided to shutter schools except for those that provide special education and serve youth at risk. In a short joint statement, the prime minister's office and the Health Ministry said the new measures would take effect on Friday and would remain in place for two weeks. They also said that access to flights abroad would be limited. The government still needs to formally approve the measures, but it is expected to do so in the coming 24 hours. In addition, Israel's Parliament, the Knesset, is required to vote on the restrictions. A controversial law passed in July, however, allows them to come into effect before it deliberates on the matter. Earlier on Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cited the new, highly transmissible variant of the virus that was first identified in the United Kingdom as a reason why Israel needed to stiffen its lockdown. We are at the height of a global pandemic that is spreading at record levels with the British mutation, Mr. Netanyahu said in a recorded statement. It arrived in Israel and it will claim many lives. As of Sunday, there were 30 known cases of the variant in Israel, the Health Ministry said. Israel has averaged 5,841 virus cases per day over the past week — a significantly higher number than the preceding seven days, according to a New York Times database.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGLOBAL ROUNDUP Is the vaccine halal? Muslims in Indonesia await the answer. An employee in December at the Global Halal Center near Jakarta, Indonesia, where the coronavirus vaccine made by the Chinese company Sinovac was analyzed. Credit... Ulet Ifansasti for The New York Times The one-sentence letter didn't say much. The coronavirus vaccine was manufactured free of porcine materials, Sinovac, the Chinese vaccine maker, wrote to Indonesia's state-owned vaccine manufacturer in July. While the letter was promising, Indonesian clerics needed more details. A vaccine laced with the smallest amount of pork DNA could dissuade some followers of Islam from inoculation in Indonesia, the country with the world's largest Muslim population. Sinovac took months to provide more information, which came only this week. The Chinese company's delayed response has been yet another challenge in Indonesia's already fragile vaccine rollout. With the highest number of coronavirus infections in Southeast Asia, the country is eager to drum up support for its goal of inoculating 181.5 million adults within 15 months. But looming questions about the safety of the Sinovac vaccine and whether it is halal, or allowed under Islam, are complicating the government's efforts. There shouldn't be any concern about whether this vaccine is halal or not halal, President Joko Widodo has said. We are in an emergency situation because of the Covid pandemic. Indonesia has recorded nearly 800,000 infections and more than 23,000 deaths, staggering numbers in a region where virus cases have remained relatively low. Inoculations are set to begin with health workers, soldiers and police officers in the coming weeks, once the health authorities are satisfied that the Sinovac vaccine is safe and effective. Islamic authorities in other countries where Muslims make up a sizable share of the population, including Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates, have already ruled that coronavirus vaccines are permissible, even if they contain pork gelatin, which is used to stabilize many inoculations. The Ulema Council, an influential group of Muslim clerics that decides which products are halal in Indonesia, is expected to issue a decree, or fatwa, authorizing the use of the Sinovac vaccine in the coming weeks. But the nature of its findings could affect how widely it is accepted in Indonesia, especially among the country's many conservative Muslims. In other developments across the world: A senior official in Singapore said on Monday that the country's police force could legally use data from the government's coronavirus contact-tracing program for criminal investigations.

Blue for The New York Times When the coronavirus began spreading through New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo ordered state-run hospitals to stop suing patients over unpaid medical bills, and almost all of the major private hospitals in the state voluntarily followed suit by suspending their claims. But Northwell Health, which is the state's largest health system and is run by one of Mr. Cuomo's closest allies, sued more than 2,500 patients last year, records show. The lawsuits each sought an average of $1,700 in unpaid bills, plus large interest payments. They hit teachers, construction workers, grocery store employees and others, including some who had lost work in the pandemic or gotten sick themselves. My salary was cut in half. I'm now working only two days a week. And now I have to deal with this, said Carlos Castillo, a hotel worker in New York City who was sued for $4,043 after being hospitalized with a seizure at Long Island Jewish Medical Center, which is part of the Northwell system. Mr. Castillo, 37, said he was worried the hospital would seize his paychecks and leave him unable to pay rent. After a New York Times article was published Tuesday morning about the lawsuits, Northwell abruptly announced it would stop suing patients during the pandemic and would rescind all legal claims it filed in 2020. The Northwell system brings in about $12.5 billion in annual revenue and received $1.2 billion in emergency funding through the stimulus package in the federal CARES Act last year. It has sued over unpaid bills as small as $700, records show. Northwell's chief executive officer, Michael Dowling, was the state health director and deputy secretary to former Gov. Mario Cuomo, the current governor's late father, and he is a close friend to the younger Mr. Cuomo. During the pandemic, Mr. Dowling has served as the governor's closest ally in the hospital industry. Both men wrote books this year, and Mr. Cuomo wrote a blurb promoting Mr. Dowling's writing. A Northwell spokeswoman declined to say whether Mr. Dowling had discussed the lawsuits with Mr. Cuomo. A spokesman for the governor did not respond to requests for comment. Richard Miller, Northwell's chief business strategy officer, defended the cases, saying Northwell had the right to collect what it was owed. He said that Northwell has a financial-assistance program for low-income patients that is more generous than required by the government, and he said the system sues only employed patients that it believes have the ability to pay and who do not respond to outreach attempts. Elisabeth Benjamin, vice president of health initiatives at the Community Service Society, a nonprofit that advocates anti-poverty policies, criticized hospitals for suing patients during the pandemic. She said that a few hundred dollars may not mean much to a hospital chain but can be a significant burden for a low-income patient. It means someone is going hungry, Ms. Benjamin said. It means a kid is not getting a winter coat.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter rumors flared that Trump may be heading to Scotland on Jan. 19, the country's leader says he will not be allowed in. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon delivered a statement at Holyrood, Edinburgh, announcing that Scotland will be placed in lockdown on Monday. Sturgeon said President Trump is not welcome to visit Scotland during lockdown. Credit... Pool photo by Andrew Milligan President Trump has not said where he plans to go after leaving the White House on Jan. 20. But the leader of Scotland made clear on Tuesday that Mr. Trump is not welcome in her country. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's first minister, said that under newly imposed virus restrictions, which prohibit all but essential travel, a visit by the president to one of his Scottish golf resorts, Trump Turnberry, would not be acceptable. Rumors that Mr. Trump would head for Scotland flared after a Scottish paper reported that an American military version of a Boeing 757 — sometimes used by Mr. Trump — was scheduled to land at a nearby airport on Jan. 19, the day before Joseph R. Biden Jr. is to be sworn in as president. We are not allowing people to come into Scotland, Ms. Sturgeon told reporters in Edinburgh, and that would apply to him just as it applies to anybody else — and coming in to play golf is not what I would consider to be an essential purpose. A plain-spoken politician, Ms. Sturgeon said she did not know what Mr. Trump's travel plans were, but that she hoped his immediate plan was to exit the White House. On Monday, she imposed a lockdown on Scotland, which, like England, is battling a surge in coronavirus cases because of a rapidly spreading new variant. Under the new rules, people are required to stay at home and to work from there, where possible. Places of worship have been closed, and schools will operate by remote learning. Scotland has frequently moved faster and further than England to impose restrictions during the pandemic. The White House initially declined to comment on the report, first published in Scotland's Sunday Post paper, but later denied it. This is not accurate, the press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, said on Tuesday. President Trump has no plans to travel to Scotland. Two White House officials said that while there's been almost no concrete discussion of what Mr. Trump will do on Jan. 20 because he is so focused on trying to overturn the election results, they do not believe he is considering Scotland. Mr. Trump has owned the Trump Turnberry resort since 2014 and has long thought of it as an escape. In November 2016, according to Anthony Scaramucci, the former White House communications director, he had planned on flying to the resort if, as he then expected, he lost the presidential race to Hillary Clinton.

Solis/Associated Press The Mississippi Department of Corrections has reported that 108 people died in its prisons in 2020, a toll that was significantly higher than a year earlier. But as of Monday, the department had not disclosed whether any of those deaths were caused by the coronavirus, though more than 1,400 inmates have been infected since the pandemic's start, according to state data. Grace Fisher, a spokeswoman for the prison system, did not respond to email and phone inquiries about how the state prison system determines, records and makes public the causes of inmate deaths. A spokeswoman for Gov. Tate Reeves did not respond to an email and phone call seeking comment. Many states report Covid-19 cases and deaths in online dashboards. Others report them in news releases or when requested. Mississippi's prison system has touted its handling of the virus, saying in a news release in December that its prisons remain among the safest in the nation from the Covid-19 virus. Burl Cain, the state's prison commissioner, said in May that the prison system had successfully managed the virus by restricting inmate transfers, suspending family visits and using increased cleaning and disinfection practices. Advocates of greater transparency from prison authorities say it is unclear whether Mississippi's prisons are opting not to disclose coronavirus deaths or if officials are uncertain of a full count because deaths are not being fully investigated. Cliff Johnson, the director of the University of Mississippi School of Law's MacArthur Justice Center — which filed a Freedom of Information request to obtain the number of prison deaths — said the lack of information about the causes of prison deaths represented a public safety threat. All but three states have reported Covid-19 deaths in their prison systems. Vermont has recorded no prisoner deaths from the virus, a representative for that system said. Wyoming has not disclosed any deaths. But Mississippi's prison system is far larger, with about 16,350 inmates, compared with just 3,200 in Wyoming and Vermont combined. In New Jersey, whose prisons house about 15,000 inmates, at least 53 have died from Covid-19, according to state data. The rate of coronavirus testing in Mississippi's prisons is among the lowest in the nation. Since the pandemic began, only one in five prisoners has been tested, according to state records.\n\nVaccination drives are off to slow starts around the world. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain watches as Jennifer Dumasi receives a dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in London's Chase Farm Hospital on Monday. Credit... Pool photo by Stefan Rousseau As England enters a strict new national lockdown and other European nations extend restrictions to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus, political leaders have pointed to the promise of mass vaccination campaigns to bring an end to the suffering. But in the race to beat the virus, the virus is still way out in front. Around the world, inoculation efforts in many countries are rolling out slower than promised, even as the count of new infections soars and record numbers flood hospitals, placing a double burden on health care providers who have also been tasked with leading the vaccination push. And a more contagious variant spreading widely in England and detected in dozens of other countries threatens to give the virus an even greater advantage. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that England would be locked down until inoculations reached the four most vulnerable groups: residents in nursing homes and those who care for them, everyone over the age of 70, all frontline health and social care workers, and everyone who is clinically extremely vulnerable. If we succeed in vaccinating all those groups, we will have removed huge numbers of people from the path of the virus, he said. That goal, he added, could be achieved by the middle of February. But to do that, the pace of vaccinations will need to increase drastically. The four groups that the prime minister cited include 13.9 million people in England, according to Nadhim Zahawi, the minister overseeing the vaccine effort. Since the campaign started on Dec. 8, fewer than 800,000 people in England had been vaccinated as of Dec. 27, the last date when data was available. But with the introduction on Monday of the first doses of a vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca — shots that are easier to transport and do not need to be stored at very cold temperatures — British officials said that the campaign could now be ramped up. To meet Mr. Johnson's target, some two million doses need to be given every week. According to Mr. Johnson, England is outpacing many countries in the European Union, where vaccination campaigns did not kick off until just before Christmas. Data from 19 of the bloc's 27 member states, including France, Germany and Italy, show that about 500,000 vaccinations have been carried out so far. In Germany, where the government was poised to extend lockdown measures through January, nearly 265,000 people received a first shot as the nationwide drive entered its second week, according to health officials. At the moment, Germany and other European Union countries are relying on the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine, which requires another booster shot weeks later to reach full efficacy. England has decided to delay that second shot and other countries are exploring doing the same. The Italian government said that as of Monday, 151,606 people had been vaccinated. A majority, 134,255, were health care professionals. The vaccination drives in Germany and Italy are moving much faster than in France, where only about 500 people received the vaccine during the previous week. And the campaign in the United States, the world's leader in new infections, is off to a much slower start than promised. About 4.5 million people in the United States have received a dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, far short of the goal that federal officials set to give at least 20 million their first shots before the end of December. The small number of vaccine recipients is particularly striking in New York City, where roughly 110,000 people — in a city of more than eight million — have received the first of two doses necessary to help prevent serious cases of the disease. That is about a quarter of the total number received by the city.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story
When Anne sees Stephen mired in marital and intellectual doldrums, she encourages him to have an affair with their beautiful friend Diana (Mikaela Izquierdo). Stephen is persuaded, Diana is willing, and everything's just dandy until it isn't.\n\nYours Unfaithfully is both a daring play and a highly conventional one. Under the polished direction of Jonathan Bank, and in the hands of a fine team of designers, its arguments remain provocative, while its structure feels familiar, its tone decorous. Maybe that only makes it more unusual. It's a bit like a sex farce with real sorrow instead of slammed doors, and something like a drawing room comedy with moral conundrums peeking out beneath the cushions. It is often very funny; it is also very nearly a tragedy.\n\nUltimately, the play's insistence on the sanctity of open marriage, a stance that apparently reflected Mr. Malleson's own beliefs and practices, isn't all that persuasive. If the central claim, that to live effectively you must walk the line between a great slope of complacence on one side and rather a mess-up of promiscuity on the other, sounds reasonably plausible in the moment, that is a credit to the dapper Mr. von Essen. Does the road to moral enlightenment and matrimonial contentment absolutely lead into the beds of selected others? Is there really no other way? Separate vacations, maybe?\n\nBut what is extraordinary about Mr. Malleson is his ability to create characters who are capable of feeling several things at once, or who don't really know what they're feeling at all. Both Stephen and Anne seem genuinely surprised that their hearts and minds aren't as orderly as they had believed. (Ms. Gray is especially adroit at rendering these intricate emotional shadings.)
In the past, a handful of basic precepts defined how the N.B.A. and the shoe-company nation-states dependent on its stars marketed themselves: Big cities beat small ones. The biggest men are harder to market than their closer-to-normal-size teammates. The more television exposure, the better. Winning matters. Also important is relatability, or the connection between player and consumer, which usually involves the player's personal biography. Larry Bird was the Hick From French Lick, in Indiana; LeBron James might as well have just walked off a factory line, so completely defined is he by his Rust Belt Ohio roots.\n\nThose old imperatives have never exerted much of a hold over a new, enlightened generation of N.B.A. fans. Ten years ago, the influential basketball blog FreeDarko coined the term liberated fandom. What FreeDarko celebrated were the quirks and oddities of specific N.B.A. players rather than winning seasons or huge marketing campaigns or even geography. (Disclosure: I wrote a few posts for FreeDarko.) Since then, more N.B.A. fans have detached themselves from tribal ties to local teams. And while the franchises and shoe companies that make up the N.B.A. economy haven't completely caught up with the online buzz generated by the league's most dedicated fans, they have begun to prepare for what feels like inevitable change. Antetokounmpo and fellow young unicorns like Kristaps Porzingis of the Knicks and Joel Embiid of the Sixers — their taxonomic I.D., co-opted from Silicon Valley, refers to a singular talent without antecedent — will go a long way toward determining whether the pro-basketball industrial complex can make as much money appealing to liberated fans as to their hidebound, local-market counterparts.\n\nThe size of the market doesn't really matter anymore, Dustin Godsey, the Milwaukee Bucks' chief marketing officer, told me, referring to a team's location. You can be a superstar anywhere.\n\nWhen the team drafted Antetokounmpo three years ago, he was unknown, born in Greece to Nigerian parents. The Bucks didn't bother putting him on billboards as the face of the franchise. Instead, Milwaukee became the first team, according to Godsey, to provide instant in-game highlights on social media, most of which featured Antetokounmpo streaking up the court and making moves that hinted at his absurd potential. In the three seasons that followed, Milwaukee never finished with a winning record. Antetokounmpo did not make an All-Star Game — that should change this year, his fourth, because he has been averaging something like 24 points, 9 rebounds and 6 assists — but video views through Bucks social feeds tripled over the last year. Online streaming of local games doubled. In response, Godsey's team changed its strategy: Antetokounmpo now appears on billboards in Wisconsin, in TV ads, at events. Whether he has earned this superstar treatment is of no account — he looks good in seven-second video clips.
Granted, it's a strange way to run a subway.\n\nAfter three years of planning, and of anxiety for thousands of Brooklyn residents, a plan to shut the L train tunnel under the East River in April for 15 months of repairs jerked to a halt on Thursday. Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that outside engineering experts, taking a fresh look at the tunnel, had come up with a way to make the repairs without immiserating commuters. Only night and weekend service would be disrupted or delayed, he said.\n\nThe news was greeted with great relief by many, skepticism by some, and the word duh by still others, who, while perhaps not experts on mass transit, found themselves wondering why such a seemingly obvious idea hadn't surfaced much earlier.\n\nWhy, some asked, was the governor getting involved so late? Why hadn't the Metropolitan Transportation Authority considered this innovative technique years ago? How could the M.T.A. have any credibility with its long-suffering customers after this?\n\nThese are good questions, maybe less about the new proposal than about the system as a whole, which, apparently, requires a bolt out of the blue, or Albany, to shake things up. To respond to them in reverse order: Did the M.T.A. have much credibility to begin with? Is it any surprise that it hadn't considered a simpler alternative given its record of delays and fiascos? And does it make any difference why Mr. Cuomo got involved so late if it turns out that he has now come up with a better solution?
The phrase Jacksonian belongs to the foreign policy scholar Walter Russell Mead, part of a famous typology in which he divides American foreign policy tendencies into four worldviews: Hamiltonian, Wilsonian, Jacksonian and Jeffersonian. The worldviews are simplifications (intended to be suggestive and evocative, in Mead's words), and they inevitably frustrate many scholars; nonetheless, they remain a useful way of thinking about how, in our imperial era, American foreign policy tends to work.\n\nThe Hamiltonians are the business-minded internationalists, cold-eyed and stability-oriented and wary of wars that seem idealistic rather than self-interested. The Wilsonians are the idealists, whether neoconservative or liberal-humanitarian, who regard the United States military as a force for spreading democracy and protecting human rights. Most foreign policy elites belong to one of these two groups, both political parties include both tendencies in their upper echelons, and most recent presidencies have been defined by internal conflicts between the two.\n\nBut far more American voters are either Jacksonians or Jeffersonians. The Jeffersonian impulse, more common on the left than on the right, is toward a come home, America retreat from empire that regards global hegemony as a corrupting folly and America's wars as mostly unwise and unjust. (No blood for oil is the defining Jeffersonian attitude toward all our Middle Eastern misadventures.) The Jacksonian tendency, more common on the right than on the left, is toward a pugilistic nationalism that's wary of all international entanglements but ready for war whenever threats arise. (More rubble, less trouble is the essential Jacksonian credo.) Since neither tendency has that much purchase in the imperial capital, it's a safe bet that at any given moment in Washington, D.C., elites in both political parties will be trying to mobilize Jacksonian or Jeffersonian sentiment to achieve Hamiltonian or Wilsonian ends.\n\nBut when elites of both persuasions preside over too many calamities, you can get Jeffersonians and Jacksonians as important presidential contenders in their own right — think of George McGovern and George Wallace when the Vietnam War went bad. And when one party's elite loses control of the electoral process entirely, it turns out that you can get an actual Jacksonian in the White House.\n\nYes, not everything Trump has done fits Mead's paradigm — but a great deal of what makes him different from previous presidents is plainly Jacksonian. A Hamiltonian wouldn't have saber-rattled so wildly against North Korea; a Wilsonian wouldn't be so subsequently eager for a deal with such an odious regime. A Hamiltonian wouldn't be as eager for an extended trade war with China; a Wilsonian would speak out more clearly against Beijing's human rights abuses instead of just treating them as one more bargaining chip. Trump's bureaucracy-impeded attempts to pull out of Syria and Afghanistan are patently Jacksonian; likewise his disdain for his predecessor's negotiations on climate change. His eagerness to pardon war criminals and threaten war crimes, meanwhile, are Jacksonianism at its worst.

Congresswoman Tlaib was elected to shake up Washington, not continue the status quo, her office said in a statement standing by her remarks even as President Trump was denouncing them, and her, on national television.\n\nIn case it wasn't already clear, the insurgent freshmen who promised bold and uncompromising action, uninterested in and unbowed by the strictures of the status quo, are showing no signs of wavering. They appear determined to push their party to the left, even as more experienced lawmakers fear that their antics and programs could divide the party and empower Republicans.\n\nI think some lessons will be learned pretty quickly around here, Representative Dina Titus, Democrat of Nevada and a former professor of political science, said after Ms. Tlaib's profane outburst. You don't want to hand the gun for the other side to shoot you with.\n\nThe 2019 freshmen are hardly the first incoming class to come in swinging. The Watergate babies of 1975 came in with a mandate to clean up government. Newt Gingrich's Republican Revolutionaries of 1995 and the Tea Party class of 2011 believed they had a mandate for conservative change; what they lacked in realism, they made up for in moxie.\n\nThis new class has deeper ideological divisions, but its liberal wing is in the spotlight, thanks to the iPhone video-Instagram generation that powered its ascent. Its reach, as of yet, has gone only so far, though. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who took pains to welcome the freshmen and praise their victories, must also attend to the demands of more moderate lawmakers whose victories in Republican districts sealed the party's majority — and whose re-elections are necessary to keep it.
Soon after news spread of Mr. Bowie's death on Jan. 10, two days after his 69th birthday and the release of his album Blackstar, fans started a makeshift memorial outside the SoHo apartment where he had lived with his wife, Iman, since 1999, joined the following year by their daughter, Lexi. Mr. Bowie and Iman purchased their first city home in 1992, a ninth-floor apartment at the Essex House Hotel on Central Park South, which they sold in 2002.\n\nJust as each and every one of us found something unique in David's music, we welcome everyone's celebration of his life as they see fit, Mr. Bowie's family wrote in a statement.\n\nShould you be looking for a way to honor the musician in the city he called home, there is no shortage of activities to partake in, many of which Mr. Bowie enjoyed doing himself.
Pentagon rules out strikes on Iran's cultural sites\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper acknowledged on Monday that attacking antiquities in Iran would be a war crime, after President Trump said such places would be legitimate targets if the conflict with Tehran escalated.\n\nMr. Trump, warning Iran against retaliating for the U.S. strike that killed a top Iranian general, said over the weekend: They're allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we're not allowed to touch their cultural site? It doesn't work that way.\n\nMr. Trump's advisers have denied he actually made a threat, even as his comments generated international condemnation (including from one of our art critics).\n\nBackground: The U.S. is a signatory to a 1954 international agreement to protect cultural property in armed conflict. Iran is home to 22 sites designated by the United Nations as culturally important, including the ruins of Persepolis, the capital of an ancient empire.
The targeted killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani and four others in a precision strike by an MQ-9 Reaper drone at Baghdad International Airport was an impressive display of American military prowess. And it liquidated a destabilizing figure: The general was the commander of the Quds Force, which is responsible for Iran's covert and extraterritorial military operations. In the scheme of things, he had it coming. Yet killing him made little strategic sense for the United States. In some ways, the most significant thing about his death is what it shows about the breakdown of American foreign policymaking.\n\nPresident Trump ordered the strike directly, prompted by the death of an American contractor on Dec. 27 in a rocket attack by Kataib Hezbollah, an Iranian-sponsored Iraqi Shia militia. Mr. Trump did not bother to consult congressional leaders. As with his other displays of martial fiat, his immediate impulse was probably to shock the liberal domestic audience, vicariously make himself feel tough, and assert raw executive power by going around the normal channels of decision making.\n\nPresidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama had considered taking out General Suleimani but rejected it — not for lack of nerve, but for fear of undue escalation and an unnecessary war with Iran. The fundamental facts on the ground have not changed, and in the kind of robust interagency, national security decision-making process that the National Security Council staff is supposed to supervise, such concerns would have been systematically raised, dissected and discussed, and a consensus reached to inform presidential action. No such process seems to have occurred here.\n\nThe Pentagon has claimed, facilely, that General Suleimani was hit because the Revolutionary Guard was planning attacks on American targets in the region. But in a proper interagency review, the intelligence community could have pointed out that decapitation is a patently unreliable means of pre-emption — particularly when the organization in question is the Revolutionary Guard, an integral part of a well-honed security state with considerable depth of command talent.
Fazle Abed, who started a temporary relief effort for refugees in Bangladesh that became one of the largest nongovernmental organizations in the world, died on Dec. 20 in a hospital in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. He was 83.\n\nHis daughter, Tamara Abed, said the cause was complications of glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer.\n\nMr. Abed founded what was originally known as the Bangladesh Rehabilitation Assistance Committee in 1972, and is now known simply as BRAC, to help refugees returning to their homeland after the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971.\n\nToday it has around 90,000 employees in 11 countries and aids more than 100 million people in gaining access to health care, education and microfinancing to start businesses.
The wisdom of those moves is debatable, of course. The Mets are paying the minimum salary for Gonzalez, a first baseman, instead of bidding for Eric Hosmer, the Keith Hernandez clone who slid his way into Flushing infamy by helping the Kansas City Royals win the 2015 World Series. Hosmer signed for eight years and $144 million with the San Diego Padres, who are ready to jump-start their rebuild.\n\nLuckily for the Mets, the Padres play in the National League West. So do the San Francisco Giants, who have added Evan Longoria and Andrew McCutchen since slumping to 98 losses last year. The other three N.L. West teams — the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Colorado Rockies — look strong again after reaching the playoffs.\n\nThe Mets are also lucky not to play in the N.L. Central. The Cubs are a powerhouse, and the two winning teams below them — the Milwaukee Brewers and the St. Louis Cardinals — both made several strong additions.\n\nAnd then we have the N.L. East, where the Mets reside. Their address gives them hope. Consider the analysis of Bryce Harper, the Washington Nationals' star right fielder, when asked about the division on Monday. Harper said the usual clichés — one game at a time, kids — and then summarized his division rivals like this:\n\nThe Mets are tough. The Braves are good. Philly, Miami, whatever.\n\nThe Braves are not good until proven otherwise; they went 72-90 last season and have made no obvious improvements. Philly, Miami, whatever? That about sums it up.\n\nThe Phillies did add to their bullpen, and gave a three-year, $60 million contract to Carlos Santana, the former Indians first baseman. They also got a clubhouse visit this week from Jason Kelce, whose powers of inspiration will never be questioned after his rousing speech at the Eagles' Super Bowl parade.

Battered by a wave of coronavirus infections and deaths, local jails and state prison systems around the United States have resorted to a drastic strategy to keep the virus at bay: Shutting down completely and transferring their inmates elsewhere.\n\nFrom California to Missouri to Pennsylvania, state and local officials say that so many guards have fallen ill with the virus and are unable to work that abruptly closing some correctional facilities is the only way to maintain community security and prisoner safety.\n\nExperts say the fallout is easy to predict: The jails and prisons that stay open will probably become even more crowded, unsanitary and disease-ridden, and the transfers are likely to help the virus proliferate both inside and outside the walls.\n\nMovement of people is dangerous, said Lauren Brinkley-Rubinstein, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, who has been tracking coronavirus cases in correctional settings. We've got really good examples of overcrowding equals more infection and greater risk of outbreak. We've got lots of evidence that even transferring people from one facility to the next is very dangerous.
Nearly two years into his presidency and more than six months after his historic summit meeting with Kim Jong-un of North Korea, President Trump finds himself essentially back where he was at the beginning in achieving the ambitious goal of getting Mr. Kim to relinquish his nuclear arsenal.\n\nThat was the essential message of Mr. Kim's annual New Year's televised speech, where he reiterated that international sanctions must be lifted before North Korea will give up a single weapon, dismantle a single missile site or stop producing nuclear material.\n\nThe list of recent North Korean demands was a clear indicator of how the summit meeting in Singapore last June altered the optics of the relationship more than the reality. Those demands were very familiar from past confrontations: that all joint military training between the United States and South Korea be stopped, that American nuclear and military capability within easy reach of the North be withdrawn, and that a peace treaty ending the Korean War be completed.\n\nIt's fair to say that not much has changed, although we now have more clarity regarding North Korea's bottom line,'' Evans J.R. Revere, a veteran American diplomat and former president of the Korea Society, wrote in an email.
The first time I met Jerry Brown, he was judging the Dutch oven cook-off contest at the Colusa Western Days festival. Sixteen teams had set up outdoor ovens on the fairgrounds to compete for the best main dish, side, bread and dessert, cooked over open fires in cast iron pots. The governor of California and his wife, Anne, judged as a team, as they do almost everything.\n\nHe had been drawn to the fair in the spring of 2015 not for the food but the community: He was spending weekends in rural Colusa County, an hour northwest of Sacramento, on an isolated ranch that had been in his family since 1878.\n\nDespite his aversion to selfies, the governor mingled comfortably at the cook-off, introducing children to his famous corgi, Sutter, and greeting the town's retired doctor, who had started his practice in 1949 with a loan from Mr. Brown's great-uncle. Then the governor headed to his nearby spread, still known as the Mountain House. The governor and Anne stayed in a small cabin, without water or electricity, off the grid.\n\nI had come to Colusa to see the ancestral Brown homestead and to fathom its appeal for a man who could live anywhere and chose to reinhabitate an area where rattlesnakes outnumbered people. In the course of a long conversation that afternoon, I began to appreciate why the land held such sway, and to think about how its history and that of the family offered a way to tell the history of California. Over time, I came to see Jerry Brown's decision to build a future rooted in his past as key to understanding the man who ends his remarkable political career today, having served as California's youngest governor in modern times, its oldest and its longest-tenured.
New Year's resolutions starter pack\n\nNew Year's resolutions can be difficult to keep. Most people abandon theirs by February, studies show. So here's some advice if you're determined to set — and meet — a goal in 2021.\n\nMake it specific and realistic. Resolutions tend to be too big without any thought about whether they are practical or even possible, says our colleague Tara Parker-Pope. Resolving to exercise more is vague, but resolving to add five or 10 minutes to each workout is measurable.\n\nIf you find yourself recycling a goal from years past, consider why it didn't stick. The resolution 'I'm going to lose weight' doesn't address the underlying issue of why your diet isn't as healthful as you want it to be, Tara says. Maybe the resolution should be: 'I'm going to stop buying packaged snack foods and snack on fruits and vegetables instead.'\n\nGo easy on yourself. If the thought of setting ambitious resolutions feels overwhelming, downsize them into smaller but still satisfying goals. It's still important to celebrate that you're working toward making a positive change, writes The Times's Christina Caron.
I've heard a number of conflicting things on this topic; is removing or waxing all pubic hair entirely from the vagina healthy, unhealthy, or something in between?\n\n— Marie\n\nShort take\n\nRemoving pubic hair is a cosmetic choice that may have health consequences for some women.\n\nTell me more\n\nBefore we get started we need to get one fact straight — pubic hair is on your vulva (the outside, where your clothes touch your skin) not your vagina, which is internal or at the vaginal opening (think of the places you touch when reaching inside for a rogue tampon).\n\nPubic hair serves several biological purposes. It is a physical barrier protecting the skin; it traps discharge, dirt and debris; it also traps moisture, helping the vulvar skin maintain a higher moisture content relative to skin elsewhere on your body. As each pubic hair is attached to a nerve, tugging during sex may also increase sexual stimulation. Pubic hair may also have a role in dispersal of normal odors.\n\nPubic hair removal is common — approximately 80 percent of women ages 18 to 65 report they remove some or all of their pubic hair.
Ms. Monson's dancing partner is Mauriah Kraker, a graduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Ms. Monson is on the faculty there, splitting her time between New York and Illinois, where she started outdoor rehearsals a year ago.\n\nMs. Monson wants to hold on to the feeling of being outdoors, but also to give it a concrete base. It's researching the basics of the physics of sight and sound and movement, she said in an interview at the Chocolate Factory in Long Island City, Queens. I've had to question a lot of my own assumptions about what development is or what composition is, and this piece has let me resist some of my patterns and just let something emerge out of the way we're working together.\n\nIt was through those morning rehearsals that she and her collaborators began to shape their experiences into a production that doesn't recreate dawn, but offers a different sense of time and place. It's in the title: When something's bent, Ms. Monson said, it creates a tension. It's like being a pervert, she said with a smile. Not straight. A friction against what's obvious.\n\nHere are edited excepts from the interview with Ms. Monson and several of her collaborators.\n\nCould you describe what you and your collaborators do on the prairie?
As evidence for that, Mr. Neiss pointed to the dozen or so companies that tried to raise money on the uFunding site, without the disclosures required by law. None of the companies raised more than a few hundred dollars before uFunding was shut down.\n\nBut the crowd did not manage to catch the problems with Ascenergy, a company in Nevada that raised $5 million on crowdfunding sites with a promise of creating an oil and gas business. The company used a less discussed provision of the Jobs Act that allowed it to raise more than $1 million from more sophisticated investors.\n\nWhen the S.E.C. shut down Ascenergy in 2015, the agency said the company did not appear to have any of the expertise or contacts in the oil industry that it had claimed in its online material.\n\nBy the time Ascenergy was stopped, the company had already spent most of the millions of dollars it collected from 90 or so investors. Much of it was used for the personal expenses of its founder, paying for fast-food restaurants, Apple stores and iTunes, dietary supplements and personal care products, the S.E.C. said.\n\nA lawyer for Ascenergy did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMr. Feit, whose site had rejected Ascenergy, said that he was less worried about outright frauds and more concerned about companies that were unlikely to ever pay off and that were not giving investors enough information to judge them.\n\nMr. Feit has been particularly worried about companies that have assigned themselves sky-high valuations that will make it hard for investors to ever make their money back. In several cases, companies that he rejected because of their high valuations have shown up on other sites with the same valuations.\n\nMr. Feit and Mr. Tyrrell have been leading an effort through the Crowdfund Intermediary Regulatory Advocates to create a set of industry standards that all crowdfunding sites will adhere to when they vet potential investments, which will include a consideration of valuations and compliance.
Our guide to pop and rock shows and the best of live jazz.\n\nPop\n\nALLISON CRUTCHFIELD AND THE FIZZ at Monty Hall (Feb. 6, 8:30 p.m.). The songwriter Allison Crutchfield broke out five years ago as the frontwoman of the ragtag indie-punk outfit Swearin', but she is now coming into her own as an accomplished solo artist. Ms. Crutchfield's debut album, Tourist in This Town, released last week, represents a stunning creative leap forward, and her immaculately arranged indie pop evokes alt-rock songwriting greats like Liz Phair and Kristin Hersh.\n\nmontyhall.ticketfly.com\n\nBOB MOULD at City Winery (Feb. 9-10, 8 p.m.). For Mr. Mould, it's all about the buzz of an electric guitar. Since he formed the iconoclastic punk and hard-core band Hüsker Dü in the late 1970s, this songwriter has pioneered a deafening style of rock 'n' roll that's had a profound influence on countless bands that have come since. Mr. Mould, who released the excellent solo album Patch the Sky last year, will deliver a career-spanning set list with nothing more than his trusted six string. And following the death of the actress Mary Tyler Moore in January, expect Mr. Mould, who came of age in Minneapolis, to revisit Hüsker Dü's celebrated cover of Love Is All Around, the theme song to The Mary Tyler Moore Show.\n\n212-608-0555, citywinery.com\n\nNOSAJ THING at Good Room (Feb. 3, 10 p.m.). As a teenager growing up in Los Angeles, Jason Chung, the mastermind of Nosaj Thing, was inspired by the hip-hop production of Dr. Dre. He has since become a go-to producer for M.C.s like Chance the Rapper, Kendrick Lamar and Future. But Mr. Chung is also compelling as a solo artist, and his material, including the intoxicating 2015 album Fated, shows off his ability to weave diverse sonic ideas (woozy beats, sped-up vocal samples, glitchy synthesizers) into sublime and strange sonic tapestries.\n\n718-349-2373, goodroombk.com\n\nOKKERVIL RIVER at Jazz at Lincoln Center (Feb. 3, 8:30 p.m.). As part of its continuing American Songbook series, Lincoln Center is giving established artists a chance to perform their material in an intimate setting. Okkervil River is at once a fitting and a curious choice to include: For the last decade, the band's chief songwriter, Will Sheff, has proved to be one of indie rock's most vivid storytellers. But he is in the midst of a creative rebirth: Away, his group's sprawling 2016 album, features an entirely new lineup of backing musicians and it deftly chronicles Mr. Sheff's wrestling with his anxieties as an artist, best heard on the track Okkervil River R.I.P.\n\n212-721-6500, lincolncenter.org
Nicole Kidman's string of award-show victories continued on Sunday when she won a Screen Actors Guild Award for her role in HBO's Big Little Lies. She had already won an Emmy and a Golden Globe for the part.\n\nA sniffly Ms. Kidman, who said she was fighting the flu, used her speech at the SAG-Aftra ceremony to champion shows and films that include prominent roles for women beyond 40 years old, urging studios and financiers to continue supporting age diversity for female actors.\n\nI'm incredibly grateful. To receive this at this stage of my life is extraordinary — and at this time in the industry, when these things are going on, and for this role. I would like to acknowledge the other actresses in this category: Reese Witherspoon, Laura Dern — my girlfriends, first and foremost, but my beyond-talented acting partners — I share this with you. And also I want to say, Susan Sarandon and Jessica Lange, I revere you, I've watched you, and I've learned from you. And there's others: Meryl Streep, Jane Fonda, Judy Davis, Isabelle Huppert, Shirley MacLaine, Judi Dench. The list is so long and I'd love to say so many more names, but I can't right now. But I want to thank you all for your trailblazing performances you've given over your career.\n\nAnd how wonderful it is that our careers today can go beyond 40 years old. Because 20 years ago, we were pretty washed up by this stage in our lives. So, that's not the case now. We've proven — and these actresses and so many more are proving — that we are potent and powerful and viable. I just beg that the industry stays behind us, because our stories are finally being told. It's only the beginning. And I'm so proud to be a part of a community that is instigating this change. But I implore the writers, directors, studios and financiers to put passion and money behind our stories. We have proven that we can do this — we can continue to do this, but only with the support of this industry and that money and passion.
Prices for replacement windows vary, depending on the size, material and features, but standard aluminum windows generally range from about $750 to more than $2,000 per unit installed. Wood windows cost about twice as much. Just be aware that if you decide to proceed in a building that would otherwise be responsible for the windows, they're your windows, and you're now responsible for them, Mr. Saft said, including repair and maintenance.\n\nBuilding Standards\n\nTo begin the process, in almost every co-op or condo, you'll have to get approval from the board, said Paul R. Gottsegen, the president of Halstead Management, which manages about 250 buildings in the city. The building wants to keep a uniformity to its appearance, he said, so if an individual owner replaces their windows, they will have to conform to all the other windows.\n\nMany buildings have window replacement plans in place already, which help facilitate the process by providing detailed specifications of what's required, said Hope Dana, a principal of Platt Dana Architects in Manhattan, who advised checking with the managing agent to see if such a document exists. However, many buildings in New York, even high-end co-ops, do not have approved window plans, she said. It really depends on the building, how many renovations they've had, and how organized they are.\n\nThe plans may include details on window size, configuration, material and color, as well as installation requirements such as panning and caulking, and even preferred manufacturers.\n\nLandmarks\n\nIf your building has been designated a landmark or is in a historic district, your new windows will also have to be approved by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. This really impacts the aesthetic and the window configuration you can use, as well as the timing of a project, said Ross Adler, the principal of Adler Windows, which specializes in replacements for New York buildings. A regular window replacement project can take three months from start to finish; a typical landmark window project could take six months.\n\nOne way to speed up the process, he said, is to ensure the replacement windows meet all the commission's key criteria, so it can issue what is known as a staff-level permit, often within a couple of months, as opposed to a permit that requires commission approval.
The president's direct appeal to the American people, and his planned trip to the border on Thursday, are meant to pressure Congress to approve $5.7 billion in funding for a border wall. Yet Mr. Trump privately acknowledged earlier Tuesday that the speech would change little.\n\nDemocratic leaders then gave their own televised address, criticizing the president for asking taxpayers to pay for a wall he had long said Mexico would fund.\n\nWatch: The president's speech and the Democratic response by Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer. (Or read the full transcripts.)\n\nFact check: We verified claims by Mr. Trump and the Democrats.\n\nThe Daily: On today's episode, two Times reporters discuss the president's address.
Good Tuesday morning. (Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up here.)\n\nCould venture capitalists make student debt obsolete?\n\nSilicon Valley is captivated by a new concept that could eliminate student debt, Andrew writes in his column.\n\nStudents were saddled with $1.5 trillion in debt last year, a record high. An idea called Income Share Agreements has been talked about for years as a way to alleviate that burden. Under this system, tuition is free, but students agree to pay back a percentage of their income for several years if they get good jobs after graduation.\n\nLambda School, an online learning start-up founded in 2017 with the backing of Y Combinator, has $30 million in funding today from venture capitalists to make the concept a reality.\n\nAndrew writes:\n\nThe investments will be used to turn Lambda, which has focused on subjects like coding and data science, into a multidisciplinary school offering half-year programs in professions where there is significant hiring demand, like nursing and cybersecurity. It's an expansion that could be a precursor to Lambda becoming a full-scale university.\n\nThe Lambda model is being closely watched. It's meant to treat students as investments rather than cash cows — and potentially lift their crippling debt load.
On Friday, a senior New York police official apologized for sowing doubt in 1994 about the account of a woman who was raped in Prospect Park. Following is the statement the woman issued on Friday, shortly before the police official, John J. Miller, sent her his apology.\n\nThe arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice. — the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., quoting Theodore Parker\n\nI'm grateful to Detective Andrea Sorrentino, who worked tirelessly on my case back in 1994, and to Detective Sarah Mathers who solved it 23 years later. I'm grateful that someone believed the four women James Webb raped after he raped me, and that he was finally brought to justice. I'm extremely grateful that James Webb is not eligible for parole until 2070.\n\nImmediately after I was raped, the policemen who responded drove me around the park, stopping and questioning black men who looked nothing like the description I had given them. When I told them that as a black woman that made me uncomfortable, that it made me feel unsafe, they were visibly angry. I also wrote a statement that my friends and colleagues read aloud that weekend at a rally protesting violence against lesbians in Park Slope. I guess that made someone at 1 Police Plaza very angry. To see in print that police sources had called me a liar had a silencing effect on me, to say the least. I paid a terrible, terrible price for my #MeToo.
BUENOS AIRES — Argentines are not used to seeing powerful people in handcuffs.\n\nYet in recent months at least five prominent former officials, including a vice president and a former planning minister, have been taken into custody to await trial on corruption charges. Several allies from the private sector who stand accused of misappropriating public funds have also been locked up.\n\nThe detentions come as President Mauricio Macri has vowed to upend Argentina's culture of impunity in graft cases by reforming the penal code, making government contracting more transparent and carefully tracking the assets of public servants.\n\nBut his government is not exactly claiming credit for the crackdown underway, which so far has netted only political opponents, leading to accusations that Mr. Macri is using the judicial system to neutralize the opposition.\n\nNever in the history of Argentina have we had as many important people detained, the justice minister, Germán Garavano, said in an interview. The question we have to ask ourselves as we look to the future is whether this represents a change, a profound reform or merely a reaction to a public outcry right now. We'll get that answer in a few years.
That disquiet became more real in September with the nearby opening of the $5 billion SoFi Stadium.\n\nThey're competing with a new stadium here in Los Angeles, said Bill Thomson, a former mayor and member of the Rose Bowl Operating Company board, whose law firm drafted the city's trademark protections. If they don't enforce the mark now, somebody else can come along and use it, too, and it will be the beginning of the end for the exclusive rights for the mark.\n\nSuch sentiment often finds a more receptive audience in Pasadena than in many other California communities. Preservation maintains a strong ethos with century-old Craftsman homes diligently conserved and more than 100 tree species protected.\n\nPasadena is a city with a very high self-awareness, said Wayne Hunt, a graphic designer who teaches at the city's ArtCenter College of Design. Every time we move a tree, you need to have a meeting.\n\nAnd the football stadium, set in a ravine, is much more than that as an exercise and recreation hub. Even people who don't like football love the Rose Bowl as a place, Hunt said.\n\nThe Rose Bowl Game is one of the few sporting events — the Kentucky Derby and the Indianapolis 500 are among others — whose identity is tied to a place, Hunt said. That connection has value the way a brand like Red Cross or Apple goes beyond even a well-recognized logo. But it is fragile.\n\nThat's why you wouldn't move the Rose Parade to Oklahoma City, he said.\n\nThe value of the mark, which helps the Rose Bowl Game draw more viewers than any other non-playoff game, is not just considerable to Pasadena. It explains why the College Football Playoff and ESPN, which pays upward of $80 million for the broadcast rights, pushed for the Rose Bowl name to stay attached to the game this year.\n\nWe recognize that long-term relationships are important, and the long-term view has to be more important than the short-term view, said David Eads, the executive director of the Tournament of Roses. Our relationship with the College Football Playoff and ESPN is important.
For instance, when I flip past a television cop show, all of which now seem to feature male-female partners (meant to signal gender progress), I notice the male cop is invariably wearing a suit and the female cop is often busting out of a tank top. I suppose I could read this as a display of sexual confidence and toughness rather than a billboard for sexual availability, but the mandatory brandishing of breasts does seem to offset any gains in social power. Either way, she must be freezing.\n\nThe convergence between the sexed-up wardrobe onscreen and the sexed-up treatment of women offscreen seems both obvious and the great verboten subject. Seth MacFarlane was widely denounced for his painfully truth-telling (and name-naming) musical number, We Saw Your Boobs, at the 2013 Academy Awards — considerable umbrage was taken. But isn't it a curious fact that so many directors manage to portray the complexity of their male characters with so much less of the actor's anatomy displayed?\n\nDemands for sexual pay-to-play by a rutting producer holding all the career cards may be horrific. It may well be criminal if force is involved (or perhaps not: Quid pro quo requests aren't actually a crime, only a violation of civil employment law). But it's not exactly a departure. In a system already rigged for sexual manipulation, what's most notable about Harvey Weinstein is that he tried to rig it even more, traversing the distance between expectation, insistence and (some allege) force with such alacrity that his targets couldn't even think.\n\nSome say women commodifying our sexuality on our own terms is a form of empowerment. It's a subject of continuing feminist debate, from Madonna's heyday to sex workers' unions. For my part, I wonder about the practical problems of transactional sex: How do you enforce the terms of the deal on an uneven playing field? Even in cases where women yielded to quid pro quo demands — and maybe a better term for this is decision rather than choice — it's not clear that Mr. Weinstein actually came through with the goods. Wow, who would have thought such a stand-up guy couldn't be trusted?\n\nTraditionally, women are socialized to be sexually strategic; men not to take no for an answer. Feminism has tried to rewrite that narrative, but the culture remains saturated with images that normalize it, that make women's sexuality our selling point. It's not like any of this is hidden. Consider the armies of young women tottering around the nightclub district of any American city in camisoles and stilettos every weekend night of the year even in the dead of winter (aren't they freezing?) because that's what sexiness looks like onscreen, and maybe some form of reward will follow.\n\nThere's no overestimating the importance #MeToo has had in forcing cultural change on industries and institutions across the country. It's exciting to see that momentum start to transform the screen images that shape the larger culture too: Women playing down the come-hither thing, more offbeat-looking women, a few chunky women (and not just in comedy specials). Now how about those window-dressing roles too — or maybe calling a close to the era of women as window dressing altogether?\n\nMr. Weinstein may be our most flagrant monster at the moment. But what if the whole system is abhorrent? The basic acceptance of gender inequality is, to me, the subtext of his trial. It also happens to be the question our courts are least equipped to deal with.
It's much harder to tell the difference when they're babies, says Darcy Perrault, an architect from Seattle who runs a Facebook group for parents of identical twins. She and her husband, Alex, have a 12-year-old son and identical twin girls a year younger. Perrault considered bringing a permanent marker to the hospital when the girls were born. If we really couldn't tell them apart, she says, we'd write initials on the bottom of their feet. Tagging turned out to be unnecessary; the couple identified the girls based on their weights and slight variations in ear shape.\n\nDistinguishing identical naked newborns is a particular challenge, especially once they're no longer wearing hospital anklets. Parents often resort to nail polish on a single toe. Don't paint a baby's fingernails, because they're going to suck on their hands, Perrault says.\n\nColor-code the children's clothing, opting for readily available colors. The Perraults chose red and pink tones for Scarlett and purples and blues for Ember after orange turned out to be too hard to find. Don't bathe them together until you can easily tell them apart nude. Try always to change diapers and feed identical twins one after the other so you don't lose track of who is soiled or clean, hungry or fed. By 8, Ember and Scarlett had settled on distinct haircuts, but the Perraults know families who pushed divergent hairstyles much earlier. Once twins go to school, name tags on backpacks can help.\n\nThe more you're around identical twins, the easier it becomes to differentiate them. Some people have a harder time, Perrault says. One elementary-school teacher couldn't separate Ember and Scarlett even after a full school year (parents often choose to have identical twins in different classes for this reason). Be proactive, Perrault says. That might mean pointing out characteristics to teachers, coaches or camp counselors. When the girls were younger, Alex let teachers know about a kind of squinty grimace that Ember made and Scarlett didn't. That's a pretty subtle difference when I think about it now, he says. Don't exoticize identical twins; make the effort to see and treat them as the individual humans they are. It's OK to mess up as long as you keep trying. In photos, even our kids can't really tell who's who, Darcy Perrault says.
Susan Zirinsky, the longtime producer of 48 Hours on CBS, will succeed David Rhodes as the president of the network's news division in March, the company said Sunday night.\n\nThe surprising announcement was the latest major personnel change for CBS, which also forced out Leslie Moonves, the company's longtime chief executive, in September after multiple accusations of sexual misconduct.\n\nThe news division, which has struggled in the ratings, has weathered significant upheaval in the last year. Charlie Rose, the anchor of the morning show, was fired in November 2017 after multiple women accused him of sexual misconduct. Jeff Fager, the longtime executive producer of 60 Minutes, was fired by Mr. Rhodes in September after he threatened a reporter and colleague looking into allegations of sexual harassment against him. And Ryan Kadro, the executive producer of CBS This Morning, announced last month that he was departing.\n\nMr. Rhodes' contract was set to expire early this year but his departure was not expected within the ranks of the news division. In fact, over the last few months, he has been weighing who should replace Mr. Fager at 60 Minutes. Ms. Zirinsky was the leading candidate for the position. Now, as the first woman to lead CBS News, she will decide who will take over the program.
On the 60th anniversary of the Cuban revolution, which the ruling Communist Party celebrated on Tuesday, the island nation is stable, having overcome such existential threats as the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 and a half-century of diplomatic isolation and withering economic sanctions imposed by the United States.\n\nCuba has also weathered the collapse of the Soviet Union, its main Cold War benefactor, and a slew of traumatic internal ructions including the Mariel boatlift in 1980 and the Cuban raft exodus in 1994. Last but not least, Cuba has managed its first major political transitions, following the death in 2016 of its defining leader, Fidel Castro; the presidential retirement, last year, of his younger brother, Raúl Castro; and Raúl's succession in office by Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez, a 58-year-old Communist Party loyalist.\n\nFor the first time since 1959, in other words, Cuba is ruled by someone other than a Castro, and it has handled the transition without the drama or bloodshed that many other revolutionary states have experienced after the death of their patriarchs.
The case is certain to inject the divisive politics of abortion into the 2020 presidential race. President Trump ran and won in 2016 partly on a promise to nominate Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe, and June Medical is the court's first case on abortion since Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh, both appointed by Mr. Trump, joined the court.\n\nThe sheer number of those signing the brief suggests the importance that Republicans place on restricting abortion rights and telegraphing to their core supporters that they are serious about doing so. The signers include the top three House Republicans — Representatives Kevin McCarthy of California, Steve Scalise of Louisiana and Liz Cheney of Wyoming — and the No. 2 Senate Republican, John Thune of South Dakota.\n\nBut Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, did not sign. Nor did several Republicans facing challenging re-election contests in politically competitive states, including Senators Susan Collins of Maine, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Martha McSally of Arizona. The two Democrats who signed, Representatives Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota and Daniel Lipinski of Illinois, are both from the party's conservative wing. Mr. Peterson broke with Democrats last month in voting against impeaching Mr. Trump, and Mr. Lipinski's stance against abortion rights has prompted internal strife within the party.\n\nThe brief was drafted by Americans United for Life, an anti-abortion-rights group. Katie Glenn, a lawyer for the organization, said that when the court took the case, members of Congress wanted to weigh in. But, she said, they are aware that overturning Roe would be a huge leap, even for a court that is moving to the right.\n\nNo one is going into this case with an expectation that Roe v. Wade will be overturned, Ms. Glenn said. However, the court has the opportunity to reconsider the precedent that has gotten us to where we're at, and that's all that the members of Congress were seeking to point out, that it is the court's prerogative to assess the jurisprudence that got us here.
Germany has long been a leading player in the old economy. Were this 1980, we would call it a titan of industry. And its biggest industry, by far, is cars. Germany makes some of the world's most popular vehicles, not to mention some of the finest. (Let's forget Dieselgate).\n\nBut this is no longer 1980, and the car industry isn't what it used to be. Across the globe, automakers are preparing for rapid change. There will be new sources of fuel — electric cars are becoming more and more popular — as well as new ways to drive, including, of course, cars that drive themselves.\n\nImage\n\nThen there's the question of ownership. Today, most cars spend most of their day parked. Car-sharing services like Uber argue that thanks to technology, each car can become more productive — and if that happens, we'd probably need far fewer cars.
Democrats Win One Senate Seat in Georgia; Second Race Too Close to Call With control of the Senate at stake, the Rev. Raphael Warnock's victory put Democrats one step closer to securing a majority. President Trump falsely claimed that the vice president has the power to reject electors when the Electoral College vote is certified on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nWarnock beats Loeffler in Georgia Senate race. The Rev. Raphael Warnock at a campaign event in Columbus, Ga., last month. Credit... Audra Melton for The New York Times ATLANTA — Democrats moved a major step closer to capturing control of the Senate on Wednesday morning as Georgia voters elected the Rev. Raphael Warnock, the pastor at the storied Ebenezer Baptist Church, in a hard-fought runoff contest that became roiled by President Trump's false claims of voter fraud in the state. Mr. Warnock's victory over the Republican incumbent, Kelly Loeffler, was called by The Associated Press early Wednesday. It represented a landmark breakthrough for African-Americans in politics as well as for Georgia: He became the first Black Democrat elected to the Senate from the South. For Democrats to take the Senate, which is crucial to enacting President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s first-term agenda, they also need to win Georgia's other Senate runoff held on Tuesday. With an estimated 98 percent of votes counted in that race as of 4 a.m. Wednesday, the Republican candidate, David Perdue, trailed his Democratic rival, Jon Ossoff, by 12,806 votes. Turnout in rural, overwhelmingly white counties where Republicans needed a strong showing was lagging without Mr. Trump on the ballot, and many of Georgia's heavily Black localities saw turnout levels that neared those of the presidential race in November. While Mr. Warnock's win was a major gain for his party — he is the first Democrat to be elected to the Senate from Georgia since 2000 — both political parties remained on edge over the unresolved Ossoff-Perdue race and its implications for the next two years in American politics. Whichever party wins that race will control the Senate, with Republicans counting on Mr. Perdue to prevail and give them the ability to constrain Mr. Biden's policy ambitions. Ms. Loeffler had rebranded herself as a hard-line Trump loyalist to fend off a challenge from the right in the first round of voting. In recent weeks, she continued to embrace the president, even using an election-eve rally with Mr. Trump in northwest Georgia to proudly declare that she would oppose certifying his loss to Mr. Biden when Congress meets on Wednesday. Mr. Warnock and Mr. Ossoff ran as a virtual package deal, as did the two Republicans, often appearing at events together and crafting similar messages about the stark consequences for the nation if the other side won. Republicans used much of the runoff to focus on Mr. Warnock's sermons, a line of attack that appeared to mobilize African-American voters, especially in more conservative rural Georgia where the church is a pillar of many communities. Mr. Trump's refusal to acknowledge his defeat also robbed Ms. Loeffler of what might have been her best argument in what is still a slightly right-leaning state — that she would be a check on the liberal excesses in a government fully controlled by Democrats. Even before polls closed on Tuesday, senior Republican campaign officials were pinning the blame on the president, noting that their polling testified to the power of the check-and-balance argument the party was unable to make because of Mr. Trump's denial.

Raphael Warnock, the first Black Democrat elected to the Senate from the South, promised Georgia voters early Wednesday that he would work on their behalf while staying true to his roots. We were told that we couldn't win this election, said Mr. Warnock, who was declared the victor over the Republican incumbent, Kelly Loeffler, shortly after making his remarks. But tonight, we proved that with hope, hard work and the people by our side, anything is possible. Mr. Warnock, the 51- year-old pastor at the storied Ebenezer Baptist Church, marveled at his experience compared to that of his mother, who he said used to pick somebody else's cotton as a teenager. But the other day, because this is America, the 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else's cotton went to the polls and picked her youngest son to be a United States senator, he said. Mr. Warnock grew up in a housing project in Savannah, Ga., where he was the 11th of 12 siblings. Both his parents were pastors. He gave his own first sermon at the age of 11 and, after graduating from Morehouse College, went on to Union Theological Seminary in New York, where he also worked as a youth minister at the Abyssinian Baptist Church, where another preacher-turned-politician, Adam Clayton Powell Jr., once led. For more than 15 years, he has spoken from Ebenezer Baptist Church, once the home of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., preaching about politics from the church pulpit. He has said some of his sermons are designed to make people uncomfortable, urging Black churches to be more accepting of gay people and criticizing them for being shamefully slow to focus on gender inequality. In his book, The Divided Mind of the Black Church, he criticized white churches for being participants in slavery, segregation and other manifestations of white supremacy. Mr. Warnock, speaking before dawn on Wednesday, told voters that he was honored by the faith they had shown in him. May my story be an inspiration to some young person who is trying to grasp and grab hold of the American dream.

Voters enter the Tabernacle of Praise Church International in McDonough, Ga. Credit... Audra Melton for The New York Times With control of the U.S. Senate at stake, more than four million Georgians cast ballots in Tuesday's runoff contests, surpassing the number of votes cast in the state during the 2016 presidential race, state election officials said. More than three million of those votes were cast early or by absentee ballot, with more than 1.2 million people turning out at the polls on Tuesday, Gabriel Sterling, a top election official in Georgia, said during a news conference late on Tuesday night. Mr. Sterling said that the Election Day voter turnout was more than we anticipated and that the counting was expected to continue into Wednesday. Brad Raffensperger, Georgia's secretary of state, told CNN late on Tuesday night that about 200,000 votes were still waiting be counted. As was the case in the November election, election officials said, the votes waiting to be counted came from DeKalb and Fulton counties in Metro Atlanta, as well as other areas that favored Democrats. The surge in turnout capped a two-month heated runoff in a swing state that had long favored Republicans but where the changing electorate, particularly in the suburbs, helped Democrats make momentous strides. A prelude came in November, when President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. became the first Democrat to win Georgia since Bill Clinton in 1992. Democrats needed to win both runoffs to take control of the Senate, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris poised to act as the tiebreaker. The runoffs became nationalized races, with Republicans and Democrats making them the most expensive Senate races in history and President Trump stumping in the state on the eve of the election.

Marc Levy/Associated Press The effort by congressional Republicans to deny the presidential results found an echo in the Pennsylvania legislature on Tuesday, when Republicans voted not to seat a Democratic lawmaker who was elected in November and to remove the lieutenant governor, also a Democrat, as the presiding officer of the State Senate. On a typically ceremonial day of swearing in members, Pennsylvania's Senate majority refused to seat Senator Jim Brewster, whose narrow victory was officially certified but is being challenged in court. In a contentious, chaotic session, Republicans also voted to remove Lt. Gov. John Fetterman as the Senate president and to replace him with the top Republican in the chamber. The lieutenant governor refused at first to leave the rostrum, and for several minutes both he and the Republican voted into his place tried to recognize motions from the floor. Eventually, Mr. Fetterman stepped away. I was escorted out, Mr. Fetterman said in an interview minutes later. This was a corruption of the fundamental democratic franchise in our state. He said Mr. Brewster's win in November was certified by the secretary of the commonwealth and compared the state Republicans' actions to President Trump's efforts to subvert the outcome of his race. Mr. Brewster, who has represented a region outside Pittsburgh for a decade, defeated Nicole Ziccarelli, a Republican, by 69 votes. She is challenging the results in federal court. At issue are several hundred mail ballots that did not have a handwritten date on their outer envelopes. Ms. Ziccarelli lost a challenge in state court. Jake Corman, the president pro tem of the State Senate and a Republican, told reporters on Monday that his party believed it had to wait for the outcome of the legal challenge before filling the seat. Our goal is to get it right, not get it fast, he said. But Democrats characterized it as a naked power grab. This idea of having one party decide who is the real victor is a dangerous precedent we're seeing played out on the national stage, Mr. Fetterman said. Jennifer Kocher, a spokeswoman for the Senate Republicans, accused Democrats of creating chaos. Today, the order and decorum of the Senate were hijacked by Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and members of the Senate Democrat caucus, who failed to adhere to Senate rules, she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTrump's fraud claims could hurt Georgia's Republican candidates. Georgia Republicans have been concerned that President Trump's efforts to undermine the election process will depress turnout in the runoffs. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times The elections in Georgia won't just determine the fate of the two Senate seats there and the balance of power on Capitol Hill. It will also reveal the extent to which President Trump has disrupted and damaged his own party. For the past several weeks, Mr. Trump has instigated and intensified a battle in the Georgia Republican universe as he has sought to overturn his loss in the state and blame Republican leaders there for not helping him. In response, the state's Republicans have turned on one another, taking sides for or against the president as he continues in his obstinate — some say unlawful — effort to overturn the election results in Georgia, where he lost by nearly 12,000 votes. The outcome of these Senate runoffs will show, on one level, how Republican voters have reacted to Mr. Trump's quest to upend what he has falsely called a rigged election. If Republicans ultimately do not turn out in large numbers, the blame will fall at least partly on the president for his efforts to raise doubts about the fairness of the election process. The extent to which Mr. Trump is willing to go in that effort became fully apparent on Saturday, when he called Brad Raffensperger, Georgia's Republican secretary of state and a Republican, urging him to find votes and recalculate the results of the state's presidential contest in his favor, ignoring the official finding, already certified by the governor, that he had lost. It was the culmination of efforts to overturn the election that began nearly two months ago. At every turn, Mr. Raffensperger and other Georgia election officials have debunked the conspiracy theories about voter fraud pushed by the president and his allies. Nonetheless, Mr. Trump renewed his attacks again Tuesday night, baselessly claiming in a tweet that a a big 'voter dump' against the Republican candidates was forthcoming. The short-term effect of Mr. Trump's pressure campaign will become evident as the votes are counted in the runoffs pitting David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, the two Republicans fighting to keep their Senate seats, against two Democrats, Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock. For Republicans in the state, the concern all along has been that Mr. Trump's effort to undermine the election process will depress turnout in the runoffs, partly because he has stoked beliefs that the system itself is rigged and cannot be trusted. Bill Crane, a Georgia political operative and commentator, said the president's tactics, as well as the work of activists in the state who have claimed the general election was rigged, were tamping down Republican turnout. Georgia is still conflicted about whether we should vote at all, Mr. Crane said. Data from early voting showed that the turnout in the runoff election was depressed in heavily Republican areas of the state, though analysts say that Republicans tend to favor voting on Election Day while Democrats are more likely to cast their ballots early.\n\n'I need their votes,' Biden says of Georgia's Democratic Senate candidates.

Biden Jr. on Tuesday urged Georgians to vote and expressed continued optimism about unifying the nation, even as some Republicans in Congress push to overturn his election. In an interview on WVEE-FM, an Atlanta radio station, Mr. Biden made a case for the importance of electing the Democratic candidates, Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock, in the runoff elections on Tuesday for Georgia's Senate seats. I need their votes in the Senate, Mr. Biden said. He said he was feeling really optimistic about today, and he made a simple request to Georgia residents: Vote, vote, vote. Mr. Biden also made a pitch for Mr. Ossoff and Mr. Warnock in an interview with WFXE-FM in Columbus, Ga., declaring, So much is at stake. The president-elect spoke a day after traveling to Atlanta for a drive-in rally with the two Democratic candidates. If both candidates win, their party will gain control of the Senate, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris as a tiebreaking vote. In the WVEE interview, Mr. Biden said their election would allow for the passage of $2,000 stimulus checks, and he suggested that the two Democrats could help provide support for his administration's efforts to distribute the Covid-19 vaccine. Mr. Biden said he envisioned establishing thousands of federally run and federally supported community vaccination centers of various sizes across the country in locations like high school gyms and N.F.L. stadiums. And Mr. Biden, who ran for president with a message of bringing the country together and working with both parties, stuck to that theme despite plans among some Republicans in Congress to object to certifying the Electoral College results on Wednesday. There are enough really decent Republicans — you're seeing them step up now in the United States Senate — who don't want to be part of this Trump Republican Party, Mr. Biden said, citing Senator Mitt Romney of Utah as one example. There's a whole bunch of them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nVoters endured a January chill as they headed to the polls for Georgia's highly consequential runoffs. Volunteers handed out snacks and beverages to voters in Atlanta on Tuesday. Credit... Lynsey Weatherspoon for The New York Times ATLANTA — Georgia's Election Day voters braved a bracing January chill on Tuesday, arriving at polling places to make their choices in two Senate runoff races that are among the most consequential in recent American history. In liberal-leaning Atlanta, Whitney Leonard, 24, walked out of the West Hunter Street Baptist Church in a precinct in the West End neighborhood. Ms. Leonard said she voted for the Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock. But she said she was not beholden to the party. Ms. Leonard said she felt that President Trump had proved himself immature and erratic, and she believed that Democrats taking control of the Senate was crucial to undoing the damage he had caused. Before the presidential election in November, Ms. Leonard had never voted. Now, Ms. Leonard, who was previously incarcerated, said she was going to vote whenever the opportunity presented itself. You don't know how much of a privilege it is to vote until it's been taken away from you, she said. In Dalton, the northwest city where Mr. Trump held a rally on Monday night, a steady flow of Georgians poured into Dalton State College to vote. Northwest Georgia is a conservative stronghold, and Republicans knew their task was to overcome strong statewide Democratic turnout in early voting and absentee ballots. By Tuesday, Mr. Trump's message to Republicans to get out and vote appeared to resonate. Turnout is high, said Lane Lewis, 44, as he waited to enter the precinct. You can tell because there's never a line. The reliance on Election Day turnout is a risky proposition for Republicans, who must contend with Georgia's changing population and growing urban areas that increasingly vote Democratic. It was also a forced choice — considering much of the Republican base is echoing Mr. Trump's concerns about voter fraud in the presidential election — when it comes to absentee voting, and many have expressed similarly unfounded doubts about the Senate races. Mr. Lewis said he waited until Election Day to vote because he trusted it would be counted then. He also said he believed Ms. Loeffler and Mr. Perdue would benefit from Republicans like him, who hold conservative values but have sometimes been put off by Mr. Trump's language. When asked if he thought Mr. Biden won Georgia in November, Mr. Lewis said, I have doubts. Some have described their voting choices as a desire for balance or an aversion to having one party controlling two houses of government. Joy Phenix, 55, voted for gridlock. They need a backstop, she said outside a polling place in the affluent Atlanta suburbs in east Cobb County, where a modest line of voters shuffled through all morning. Ms. Phenix said she voted for Mr. Perdue and Ms. Loeffler, but that if Mr. Trump had been elected, she would have voted for the Democrats. Jasmine Knapp, a 30-year-old Dalton resident, said she was ready for the flood of campaign texts and television advertisements to end. Ms. Knapp, who declined to say who she supported, described herself as a conservative who voted Republican, but said she had not agreed with how some, like Mr. Trump, had claimed the election in November was rigged. You always hear every election cycle that this vote matters more than anything, she said, but that feels true this time. Richard Fausset, Sean Keenan , Astead W.

Credit... Kenny Holston for The New York Times The local authorities in Washington are cautioning residents to avoid potentially violent agitators who are expected to gather downtown on Wednesday to amplify President Trump's false claims of voter fraud in the general election in November. Chief Robert J. Contee III of the Metropolitan Police Department said the police had received information that people intended to show up to the demonstrations armed, a violation of local firearm laws. Mr. Trump is expected to appear at the rally on Wednesday and has encouraged his supporters to travel to Washington for the event. Some of Mr. Trump's allies, including the conspiracy theorist and conservative radio host Alex Jones and some associates who recently received a pardon from the president, spoke to hundreds of people who crowded into the city's Freedom Plaza on Tuesday, one day before Congress begins the formal counting of the Electoral College votes. A spokeswoman for the Eighty Percent Coalition, which was publicizing the event on Tuesday, did not return requests for comment. Tensions already began to escalate on Tuesday night, with some of Mr. Trump's supporters clashing with police near Black Lives Matter Plaza, videos of the confrontation showed. The police used pepper spray to repel some of the demonstrators. On Monday, Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys, a far-right group that has supported Mr. Trump's efforts to overturn the election results, was arrested on charges of destruction of property stemming from an episode in downtown Washington last month. Mr. Tarrio pleaded not guilty and was released by Judge Jonathan Pittman of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. But he was ordered to stay out of Washington until his hearing this summer and faces arrest if he tries to stay for the pro-Trump protests. A lawyer for Mr. Tarrio did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Protest organizations and the groups they represent have shown an alarming affinity for violence. Sadly, they have not been shy about suggesting the need for violence, Marc Elrich, the executive of Montgomery County, Md., said in a statement warning residents to avoid potential clashes between supporters of Mr. Trump and counterprotesters. There is talk of disrupting the counting of votes in Congress, which would require extreme actions. Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington on Monday requested support from the Army National Guard for the rallies. About 340 National Guard troops are expected to be present for the rallies, and Customs and Border Protection has also placed tactical teams on standby to help protect federal property. We will not allow people to incite violence, intimidate our residents or cause destruction in our city, Ms. Bowser said at a news conference on Monday. We're asking D.C. residents and people who live in the region to avoid confrontations with anybody who's looking for a fight. There were a number of violent clashes last month between supporters of Mr. Trump and counterprotesters in Washington, where four people were stabbed.

Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, plans to object to the certification of Arizona's Democratic electors, according to a person familiar with his plans. And Senator Kelly Loeffler, Republican of Georgia, intends to object to the electors from her state, according to a person familiar with her thinking. Mr. Cruz, a possible 2024 presidential candidate, is among 11 senators who have said in recent days that they will challenge the Electoral College results unless Congress agrees to create an independent commission to audit the results. But his earlier statements had been vague as to whether he would lodge a formal objection himself. His plan to object was first reported by The Washington Post. His decision to do so, along with Ms. Loeffler's, ensures that the House and the Senate will formally debate whether to overturn the results in at least three states, prolonging what is normally a brief, ceremonial session and forcing at least three votes on whether to overturn Mr. Biden's victory. Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, plans to object to Pennsylvania's electors, and other Republican senators could still join the mix. House Republicans are preparing to object to the electors from another three states — Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin — but under law, they can force a debate and vote on their challenges only if a senator agrees to join them. None are expected to be successful. But by objecting, Mr. Cruz and the other Republicans are ensuring that Mr. Trump will get one final stand in Congress to argue his baseless claims of widespread election fraud. Senate Republican leaders fear it will fracture the party. The person familiar with Mr. Cruz's thinking, who requested anonymity, said Mr. Cruz was seeking not to overturn the election but to draw attention to his idea of forming an election audit commission. There is little chance that will happen, and every state has already certified the results after verifying their accuracy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTrump replaces the top federal prosecutor in Atlanta, who quit abruptly. Bobby Christine, right, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Georgia, will also serve as the acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District. Credit... Sean Rayford/Getty Images President Trump ordered a U.S. attorney in southern Georgia to serve simultaneously as the top federal prosecutor in Atlanta, the Justice Department announced on Tuesday, a day after the official previously in the Atlanta post left abruptly after Mr. Trump pressed Georgia elections officials on unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud there. The acting U.S. attorney, Bobby Christine, announced his role in a news release, saying that he would serve, effective immediately, as U.S. attorney in both the Southern and Northern Districts of Georgia. On January 4, 2021, by written order of the President, Bobby was named Acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, the news release said. Mr. Trump nominated Mr. Christine and his predecessor in Atlanta, Byung Pak, to serve as U.S. attorneys in 2017. Mr. Pak said in a short email to his office on Monday that he was resigning immediately because of unforeseen circumstances, and his spokesman gave no further explanation. A spokesman for the Justice Department in Washington did not respond to an email seeking comment on whether the acting attorney general, Jeffrey A. Rosen, had asked Mr. Pak to leave or Mr. Christine to oversee the Atlanta office. Mr. Pak said in a news release that he had sought to be thoughtful and consistent, and to provide justice for my fellow citizens in a fair, effective and efficient manner during his tenure, and he thanked Mr. Trump for the opportunity to serve. People who have spoken with Mr. Pak said that they had expected his departure and that he had been looking for other work. But Mr. Pak's decision to leave on the same day he announced his departure took people in the department by surprise. On his weekend phone call with Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, Mr. Trump complained about the quality of the investigation into claims of voter fraud in the state, especially in Fulton County, which includes Atlanta. You have your never-Trumper U.S. attorney there, he said. While Mr. Trump did not criticize Mr. Pak by name, and he was not the only U.S. attorney in Georgia, the president has lately become focused on the specious claim that poll workers in Fulton County manipulated the vote count.
ATLANTA — Invigorated by a surge in voter turnout in November that delivered a victory in Georgia for a Democratic presidential candidate for the first time in her life, and forced runoffs in two high-profile, high-stakes Senate races, Patricia Granda-Malaver got to work.\n\nMs. Granda-Malaver, 22, began working on phone banks and walking up to strangers, whether at her dentist's office or the grocery store, asking whether they were registered to vote. She saw Georgia was changing and she wanted a diverse coalition of young voters to be the ones driving that change.\n\nKeeping up that momentum is something we're really aware of, she said of herself and other young voters who have spent the last two months focused on participation in Tuesday's runoff races. The contests pit Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, both Republicans, against Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock, both Democrats, in races that will determine which party controls the Senate.\n\nAs hundreds of millions of dollars have been pumped into Georgia, few groups have been as vigorously pursued as young voters.
Quarantine clapping became a nightly ritual in many parts of the United States and around the world as a collective thanks to health care workers. It was both a show of community and a show of gratitude. The experience was what sociologists call collective effervescence, which happens when people simultaneously come together and take part in a group ritual.\n\nClapping for essential workers had the effect of both unifying and energizing the group for action toward a common cause, such as persevering through the pandemic, said Joshua W. Brown, professor in the department of psychological and brain sciences at Indiana University Bloomington. Group expressions of gratitude can be empowering for both those expressing it and those receiving it.\n\nPerhaps you showed gratitude in other ways. Did you offer larger tips than usual to delivery and restaurant workers? Did you find yourself saying a heartfelt thank you to the grocery and pharmacy workers at checkout? When things got tough at home, did you remind yourself and your children of all the things for which you felt grateful? I adopted a regular gratitude hand-washing ritual, thinking of 10 things to be grateful for — one for every finger I washed.\n\nWhy it matters: Numerous studies show that people who have a daily gratitude practice, in which they consciously count their blessings, tend to be happier, have lower stress levels, sleep better and are less likely to experience depression. In one study, researchers recruited 300 adults, most of them college students seeking mental health counseling. All the volunteers received counseling, but one group added a writing exercise focused on bad experiences, while another group wrote a letter of gratitude to another person each week for three weeks. A month later, those who wrote gratitude letters reported significantly better mental health. And the effect appears to last. Three months later the researchers scanned the brains of students while they completed a different gratitude exercise. The students who had written gratitude letters earlier in the study showed greater activation in a part of the brain called the medial prefrontal cortex, believed to be related to both reward and higher-level cognition.\n\nTake the Gratitude Challenge\n\nThis week, try one or more of these simple gratitude exercises.\n\nStart small. Send an appreciative email or text, thank a service worker or tell your children, your spouse or a friend how they have made your life better. A great way to develop more gratitude would be regular small steps — an extra email or note of appreciation to a colleague, or an extra in-person thank-you, and a focus on how rewarding it is to brighten someone's day with appreciation, Dr. Brown said.
JAKARTA, Indonesia — Flash floods killed at least 43 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, the authorities said on Friday, after the city's most intense period of rainfall since record keeping began more than 20 years ago.\n\nOn Tuesday, parts of the city recorded more than a foot of rain, according to the country's Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency. The rain persisted on Wednesday and more was predicted this week for the metro area, one of Asia's largest urban districts and home to more than 30 million people.
A pharmacist who was arrested on charges that he intentionally sabotaged more than 500 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine at a Wisconsin hospital was an admitted conspiracy theorist who believed the vaccine could harm people and change their DNA, according to the police in Grafton, Wis., where the man was employed.\n\nThe police said Steven Brandenburg, 46, who worked the night shift at the Aurora Medical Center in Grafton had twice removed a box of vials of the Moderna vaccine from the refrigerator for periods of 12 hours, rendering them useless.\n\nBrandenburg admitted to doing this intentionally, knowing that it would diminish the effects of the vaccine, the police said.\n\nThe attempt to destroy precious doses of the vaccine came over the holidays as the state worked to administer vaccines quickly to frontline health care workers. As of Saturday, the state had received 159,800 doses of vaccines and had administered 64,657, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Although the Moderna product is sometimes described as a genetic vaccine, it does not alter a person's genes in any way.
Teddy Roosevelt wore Brooks Brothers to his inauguration. So, too, did Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Ulysses S. Grant. Forty of the 45 United States presidents have patronized America's oldest maker of men's wear, the most famous among them surely Abraham Lincoln, who was dressed in a custom-made Brooks Brothers wool coat for his inauguration in 1865 to a second presidential term.\n\n[Brooks Brothers files for bankruptcy.]\n\nDouble-breasted with trim tape outlining hem, lapel and a small ticket pocket, that coat had a lightly padded lining that was embroidered with an eagle motif and a motto. Had history played out differently, we would have little cause to remember what seems like a singularly Lincoln-esque detail about this simple garment: One Country, One Destiny stitched inside, to be worn against his narrow frame and known only to a few besides Lincoln's tailor and the Great Emancipator himself. But, of course, it was that same Brooks Brothers coat that Lincoln selected one month later for an outing to Ford's Theater, where he was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth.\n\nHere, amid the splendor of a gallery inside the Palazzo Vecchio, a replica of Lincoln's coat hangs in a small vitrine, part of a modest exhibition culled from the Brooks Brothers extensive archive and brought to Florence to kick off a yearlong celebration of the brand's 200th anniversary.
Brock Purdy was a good enough high school quarterback to attract attention through the fall from several well regarded, if not top-tier, college programs.\n\nDuring his senior season at Perry High School outside Phoenix, Purdy received scholarship offers from New Mexico State and U.N.L.V., which compete in so-called Group of Five conferences — in the same Football Bowl Subdivision as the major powers, but a rung below power leagues like the Southeastern Conference and the Big Ten. In December, Boise State, the most successful Group of Five team of the past decade, asked Purdy to become a Bronco next fall.\n\nBut when college football's inaugural early signing period — the first chance for players to sign binding letters of intent — opened on Dec. 20 and slammed shut two days later, Purdy held off on making his choice. Instead, he pushed back his decision to the traditional February national signing day, on Wednesday.\n\nHe was really excited about the Boise State offer, Purdy's father, Shawn, said. But, he added, Brock is a very, very patient kid.
BOSTON — The Hasty Pudding Theatricals, an irreverent Harvard theater troupe that has not cast women since it began staging productions in 1844, announced on Thursday that, for the very first time, it would encourage women to audition this year.\n\nThe Hasty Pudding Theatricals is proud to announce that going forward, casting will be open to performers of all genders, the group's producers, Hannah Needle and Annie McCreery, said in an email.\n\nThe producers did not immediately specify a reason for the shift, but it comes amid several years of debate over the fate of the university's single-gender organizations, and amid a wider cultural reckoning over sexual harassment and the treatment of women in the workplace, including in Hollywood.\n\nThe announcement, which was first reported on Thursday by The Harvard Crimson, came as the group presented the actress Mila Kunis, who has been a vocal critic of gender discrimination in the workplace, with its annual Woman of the Year award, an event during which the honoree is regaled with a parade and then roasted.
Exercise may change the composition and activity of the trillions of microbes in our guts in ways that could improve our health and metabolisms over time, a new study finds.\n\nThe results provide novel insights into how exercise can affect even those portions of our bodies that seem uninvolved in workouts, perhaps providing another nudge to stick with our exercise resolutions this year.\n\nI think we all have heard by now that each of us contains a pulsating little universe of bacteria within our guts. This microbiome includes countless different species of microbes in varying proportions that interact, compete and busily release various substances that are implicated in weight control, inflammation, immune responses and many other aspects of health throughout our bodies.\n\nIn broad terms, our microbiomes tend to be relatively stable, most studies show. But our microbiomes can change as our lifestyles do. Diet clearly affects the makeup of a person's microbiome, as do illness, certain drugs, how much we weigh and other factors.
DES MOINES — Allison Kipp is all in for Senator Elizabeth Warren's presidential campaign, but she was the exception.\n\nBen Miller, a 21-year-old student at Iowa State University, said he wants to vote for an economic populist, and if Senator Bernie Sanders runs again it will be a tough choice between him and Ms. Warren. Charles Miller, Ben's father, said he expects to vote for Ms. Warren, but is also intrigued by a Democrat who could be described as her ideological opposite: Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York.\n\nAs Democrats, we haven't seen a big field like this in a long time, said the elder Mr. Miller, a 47-year-old resident of Ankeny, Iowa. And as long as they keep it positive, as long as there's no personal attacks and they just share their views, it's going to be a good thing.\n\nI'm ready to be convinced.\n\nSuch is the mood of Iowa Democrats, who are currently feeling somewhat spoiled after a visit by Ms. Warren this weekend — more than a year before a single vote is cast in the state's caucuses — unofficially kicked off the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. The party's 2016 primary was defined by rigid and bitter lanes of Hillary Clinton and Mr. Sanders, but as the 2020 nomination process begins, the state's voters are giddy at the prospect of a crowded field that could feature more than a dozen candidates across the ideological spectrum.
The biographical video from Senator David Perdue's first campaign, in 2014, celebrated a narrative arc that many fellow Georgians either related to or have aspired to: the story of a humble boy from rural America whose hard work catapulted him into a global business career, navigating free markets and faraway lands, all the while gathering stores of wisdom and wealth.\n\nThe embrace of global commerce has been a hallmark of modern Georgia, showcased in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, dissected by the novelist Tom Wolfe and promoted by, among others, Mr. Perdue's Nafta-loving cousin, Sonny Perdue, governor from 2003 to 2011. Three years later, in his maiden run for office, David Perdue would boast of his international experience as a consultant and chief executive while speaking to a gathering of Republicans in Bibb County, close to his middle Georgia hometown.\n\nThere's only one candidate in this race that's ever lived outside the United States, Mr. Perdue said. How can you bring value to a debate about the economy unless you have any understanding about the free-enterprise system and what it takes to compete in the global economy?\n\nNow, facing one of a pair of Jan. 5 runoff elections in Georgia that will determine control of the Senate, Mr. Perdue has continued to make his global business experience the essence of his brand. But that has highlighted the contradictions that emerge — in his career and in his character, but also in his party and his region — as he embraces the populist, America-first strains of Trumpism.
CHICAGO — For Jeff Glass, there have been so many stops during his existence as a hockey vagabond, so many different jerseys that he has worn, so many teams he has tended goal for from Binghamton to Belarus and plenty of other outposts in between, and so many moments when it would have been easy for him to quit.\n\nThere was the 38-game stretch in Siberia — where, to the best of Glass's recollection, snow fell for 45 straight days. He played for the Kontinental Hockey League's Sibir Novosibirsk then, and he found himself so far in the middle of nowhere that, as he put it, all there was was hockey.\n\nNow, after 13 years of wandering, Glass realizes that each step played a meaningful role in his finding his way to his N.H.L. debut last month as a 32-year-old rookie with the Chicago Blackhawks.\n\nWith his 42-save effort in Chicago's 4-3 overtime victory against the Oilers in Edmonton on Dec. 29, Glass — at 32 years, 40 days old — became the second-oldest goaltender in the N.H.L.'s expansion era to notch a victory in his debut, behind Rob Zepp (34 years, 106 days), who won in net for the Philadelphia Flyers in 2014, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.
By 1969, André Harvey had been a writer and a teacher, but he could not envision continuing happily in either career. Then, on a yearlong trip abroad with his wife, Bobbie, he peered into an art gallery in Vallauris, France, and was struck by the abstract welded sculptures in the window.\n\nSculpture, he told his wife on the spot, was what he wanted to do.\n\nBut he had no artistic training. So he persuaded the gallery owner to teach him welding, and with his wife helping to make pottery in the gallery's nearby studio, they were paid in meals.\n\nAfter Mr. Harvey returned to the United States, his education continued. He learned mold-making while working, without pay, for the noted sculptor Charles Parks in Delaware.\n\nThe tutelage paid off. Mr. Harvey became a masterly sculptor of intricately detailed, realistic bronze figures whose works were exhibited by Tiffany & Company in its Fifth Avenue flagship store, have been collected by museums, and were purchased by Henry Fonda, Jamie Wyeth, Barry Manilow and Danielle Steel.
THE AFTERLIVES\n\nBy Thomas Pierce\n\n384 pp. Riverhead Books. $27.\n\nIn Thomas Pierce's warm and inventive debut novel, The Afterlives, reality is slippery, time is out of joint and profound disorientation is a feature of daily existence. In other words, pretty much how the world feels to a lot of us right now.\n\nThe narrator, Jim Byrd, is a 33-year-old loan officer who's already leading a liminal existence when the book opens. He's just woken up after a cardiac arrest that left him clinically dead for several minutes, with no memory of the other side: No lights, no tunnels, no angels. The doctors install in his chest a high-tech defibrillator called the HeartNet, whose accompanying smartphone app chimes whenever the device restarts his heart — a digital bell that tolls for him — and then send him home to Shula, N.C.\n\nPierce renders Jim's hometown with a gloss of Phildickian satire. There is a boutique virus one can have injected into one's eyes to change their color, condoms that turn green when they detect disease and free-range holograms, all of which make Jim wonder if he's been brought back to life on the wrong planet. When he runs into Annie, his high school sweetheart who has moved back to town with her 12-year-old daughter, he confesses, Sometimes I feel like maybe I've had a brain injury and didn't realize it.\n\nImage\n\nThose holograms aren't the only ghostly presences in the novel. Annie's a recent widow, and her dead husband is never far out of mind as Jim and Annie fall in love and eventually marry. And then one day Jim hears a tape of a disembodied voice recorded in a nearby house, which leads to more supernatural experiences, including one that involves Jim's conspiracy-loving father. Jim begins following the writings of Sally Zinker, a physicist whose daisy theory — a lovely bit of rubber science that Pierce previously used in a story from his fine collection, Hall of Small Mammals — may explain the apparitions. At any given moment, Zinker explains, the universe only 93 percent existed. You only 93 percent existed.
LONDON — Get on with it.\n\nWith those words late in a major speech on Tuesday, Prime Minister Theresa May charted Britain's course toward a clean break with the European Union and expressed her fondest hope: that the time for division and discord is over.\n\nHer much-anticipated speech outlined what promised to be a hugely complex, drawn-out negotiation, and it defined the broad objectives, but not the details, of British withdrawal. The United Kingdom is leaving the European Union, and my job is to get the right deal for Britain as we do, she said.\n\nWith the address, Mrs. May began the jockeying that will lead to a break after more than four decades of tight integration, and define Britain's relations with its neighbors for decades to come.\n\nShe confirmed that Britain is determined to regain control of migration from the European Union and rejected the supremacy of the European Court of Justice. That stance is anathema to the European Union, which has made the free movement of people — as well as goods, capital and services — a bedrock principle and which relies on the court to arbitrate.
To the Editor:\n\nRe American Jews and Israeli Jews Break Up, by Jonathan Weisman (news analysis, Sunday Review, Jan. 6):\n\nWe would do well to consider the theology of the Zionist Martin Buber. In the relationship Buber calls I-thou, parties remain concerned with each other's fears and hopes while maintaining the right to advance their self-defined interests.\n\nLiberal American Jews (I am one) cannot expect the Israeli government to abandon political alliances it deems necessary for survival, negotiate a two-state solution and support equal rights for non-Orthodox Jews just because we want it. Nor can the Israeli government suppose that liberal American Jews will forsake our moral assumptions and defend Israeli policies those principles impel us to challenge.\n\nAmerican Jews and Israeli Jews need each other and must support each other. But we cannot govern for each other, and we remain fully within our rights to critique each other.\n\nThere are times we don't like those we love. Yet Buber reminds us that with patience and effort, the I-thou can be re-established, as it can be between American Jews and Israeli Jews. Governments change. External crises arise, overriding the luxury of internal disputes. Mr. Weisman's Great Schism is far from inevitable.
Republicans have also divided over supporting the president's determination to make one last and futile attempt to overturn the 2020 election results in Congress next week.\n\nSenator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, typically a strong ally of the president, took to the Senate floor on Friday to encourage his colleagues to override Mr. Trump's veto, calling the passage of the bill the most significant vote lawmakers take.\n\nThis year especially so, in light of all of the disruptions and problems that we've had, Mr. Inhofe said.\n\nThe main disruption Mr. Inhofe was referring to was the president. Making good on a monthslong series of threats, the president vetoed the bipartisan legislation last week, citing a shifting list of reasons, including his objection to a provision directing the military to strip the names of Confederate leaders from bases. He also demanded that the bill include the repeal of what is known as Section 230, a legal shield for social media companies that he has tangled with. Republicans and Democrats alike have said that the repeal, a significant legislative change, is irrelevant to a bill that dictates military policy.\n\nMr. Trump took to Twitter on Friday shortly after the vote to register his anger at Republican lawmakers' unwillingness to meet his demands.
I feel like each day is a little like being caught in a batter's box without knowing when or where the balls are coming from, and that can be both exhilarating and exhausting. Technology certainly helps.\n\nMy phone is pretty much everything. It's kind of its own command center, and I can do almost everything on it except edit. For stories, I still need my laptop. Most of the reporters know that if they get a call from me at an odd hour, it usually means they're on their way to something awful, but the reason we can do what we do is that they are total pros. Nobody ever just hangs up and goes back to sleep.\n\nIn these cases, our job is to help them produce the best journalism possible in difficult situations and make sure they stay safe, too. I'm in awe of the reporters on National who are relentless and often put themselves in danger while covering tough stories with compassion. Unfortunately, we've done enough of them now that we kind of know what to do.\n\nRecently, we had a ton of breaking news out of California, where the majority of my reporters are based. The combination of the shooting in Thousand Oaks and the wildfires was a good example of having to be really nimble. One of our California reporters, Jenny Medina, called me in what was the middle of her night to say she and a bunch of F.B.I. agents who were in Thousand Oaks after the shooting had been forced to evacuate their hotel because of the fires. You can never predict what's next, so you just have to be ready to switch gears and work with what you have.\n\nIn breaking news, I rely on Twitter and Dataminr , which monitors Twitter for newsworthy patterns, to keep track of developments. We're also paying attention to police scanners, local television and all forms of social media and trying to break and confirm our own scoops, too. The trick is being careful and fast at the same time. A lot of bad information gets out in the immediate aftermath, and you never want to get it wrong.

Raphael Warnock at a campaign event in Columbus, Ga., last month. He promised to help lead a more robust response to the coronavirus pandemic and to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Credit... Audra Melton for The New York Times Democrats moved a major step closer to capturing control of the Senate early Wednesday as the Rev. Raphael Warnock, the pastor at the storied Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, won his hard-fought runoff election in Georgia. Mr. Warnock's victory over the Republican incumbent, Senator Kelly Loeffler, represented a landmark breakthrough for African-Americans in politics as well as for Georgia: He is the first Black Democrat elected to the Senate from the South. For Democrats to take the Senate, which is crucial to enacting President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s first-term agenda, they will also need to win Georgia's other Senate runoff. Votes are still being counted in that race between the Republican candidate, David Perdue, and his Democratic rival, Jon Ossoff, with Mr. Ossoff appearing to hold a narrow edge. Turnout in rural, overwhelmingly white counties where Republicans needed a strong showing appeared to lag without Mr. Trump on the ballot, and many of Georgia's heavily Black localities had turnout levels that neared those of the presidential race in November. While Mr. Warnock's success was a major gain for his party — he is the first Democrat to be elected to the Senate from Georgia since 2000 — both political parties remain on edge over the unresolved Ossoff-Perdue race and its implications for the next two years in American politics. Whichever party wins that race will control the Senate. After Mr. Biden's triumph in November, Mr. Warnock's victory provides yet another comeuppance for the Trumpist politics that have come to define the Republican Party over the past four years. Ms. Loeffler had rebranded herself as a hard-line Trump loyalist to fend off a challenge from the right in the first round of voting. In recent weeks, she continued to embrace the president, even using an election-eve rally with Mr. Trump in Northwest Georgia to proudly declare that she would oppose certifying his loss to Mr. Biden when Congress meets on Wednesday. Mr. Warnock and Mr. Ossoff ran as a virtual package deal, as did the two Republicans, with each pair often appearing at events together and crafting similar messages about the stark consequences for the nation if the other side won. Republicans used much of the runoff to focus on Mr. Warnock's sermons, a line of attack that appeared to mobilize African-American voters, especially in more conservative rural Georgia, where the church is a pillar of many communities.

He was leading his Republican opponent, Senator Kelly Loeffler. Credit... Lynsey Weatherspoon for The New York Times Nearly declaring victory in remarks from his Atlanta home, the Rev. Raphael Warnock said he was going to the Senate to work for all of Georgia. Seated in front of a placard that read Thank you, Georgia, Mr. Warnock invoked the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., one of his predecessors as pastor of the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, and thanked his supporters for what he didn't quite describe as a victory during a five-minute speech. We were told we couldn't win this election, he said. Tonight, we proved that with hope, hard work and the people by our side, anything is possible. Mr. Warnock's Republican opponent, Senator Kelly Loeffler, refused to concede, telling supporters: This is a game of inches. We're going to win this election. But Mr. Warnock was ahead with 97 percent of estimated votes counted, and the remaining votes are overwhelmingly in Democratic areas. Mr. Warnock spoke of the pride he felt after his mother, who raised 12 children, cast a vote for him in Georgia's Senate runoffs. The other day, because this is America, he said, the 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else's cotton went to the polls and picked her youngest son to be a United States senator. Mr. Warnock, who maintains a 35,000-vote lead over Ms. Loeffler, implied that the results of Georgia's Senate races — both leaning toward Democrats — would lead to a new day in American politics. It's dark right now, but morning comes, he said. Scripture tells us that weeping may endure for the night, but joy comes in the morning.

After losing her race for governor in 2018, she has led voter registration efforts in Georgia. Credit... Elijah Nouvelage/Reuters As Democrats flipped both of Georgia's Senate seats from the incumbent Republicans, credit flowed to one person broadly acknowledged as being most responsible for Georgia's new status as a Democratic state: Stacey Abrams. Ms. Abrams, the former minority leader of the Georgia state House, has spent a decade building a Democratic political infrastructure in the state, first with her New Georgia Project and now with Fair Fight, the voting rights organization she founded in the wake of her losing campaign for governor in 2018. Late Tuesday night, Ms. Abrams praised the thousands of organizers, volunteers, canvassers & tireless groups who helped rebuild the state's Democratic Party from the rump it was when she became the state House minority leader in 2011. With new votes joining the tally, we are on a strong path. But even while we wait for more, let's celebrate the extraordinary organizers, volunteers, canvassers & tireless groups that haven't stopped going since Nov. Across our state, we roared. A few miles to go...but well done! — Stacey Abrams (@staceyabrams) January 6, 2021 While Ms. Abrams is widely expected to run for governor again in 2022, she is at the moment one of the most influential American politicians not in elected office. It was her political infrastructure and strategy of increasing turnout among the state's Black, Latino and Asian voters that laid the groundwork for both President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s victory in November and the Democrats' performance in the Senate races.Ms. Abrams was not alone in Georgia, of course: Numerous other Black women have led a decades-long organizing effort to transform the state's electorate. We weren't surprised that Georgia turned blue, because we've been working on it for over 15 years, Deborah Scott, the founder of Georgia Stand Up, said after Mr. Biden's victory in the general election. It's been an uphill battle, said Felicia Davis, a longtime organizer in Clayton County. Because here, we're not just women, we're Southern women. And we're not just Southern women, we're Southern Black women. Still, Ms. Abrams was the most visible face at the forefront of the turnout push. And when it came time to cut a TV ad urging Georgians to confirm the status of their absentee ballots — voters have until Friday to cure absentee ballots that contain minor errors — she appeared in the ad reminding them how to do so. Don't wait, she said. Your vote has the power to determine the future of Georgia and our country. It's time to make certain your voice is heard.

He is likely to move ahead of Mr. Perdue as more ballots are counted.

(There was, briefly, some confusion when a county official told CNN that the number was 117,000; a top state election official, Gabriel Sterling, subsequently confirmed that the county official had accidentally transposed the 1 and the 7.) In addition to the roughly 19,000 early votes now remaining, Mr. Sterling said DeKalb County still had about 12,000 election day votes left to count. He also said there were roughly 7,000 early votes left in Coffee County, which is heavily Republican. Beyond that, DeKalb County and Fulton County — which includes large parts of Atlanta and, like DeKalb, is heavily Democratic — still need to count mail-in ballots that they received on Tuesday. Statewide, about 95 percent of all votes have been counted, and most of the remaining 5 percent are in Democratic areas, making both Mr. Warnock and Mr. Ossoff favorites to win their races. On the question of when the count will be complete, Mr. Sterling said that lunchtime on Wednesday was a rational estimate given the situation we've seen right now, and praised the election officials working late into the night amid the vitriol and false charges of voter fraud advanced by President Trump and his supporters. These thousands of election workers have been working diligently for a free and fair election for the people of Georgia, Mr. Sterling said.

Audra Melton for The New York Times A surge in turnout from Georgia's Black voters has powered the fortunes of the Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, putting the Democrats within reach of flipping two Senate seats and winning control of the chamber. Predominantly Black counties across rural Georgia have had turnout for Mr. Warnock and Mr. Ossoff that nearly matched the Nov. 3 general election and margins that exceeded what President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. received when he defeated President Trump in the state. In Calhoun County, which is 61 percent Black and where most ballots had been counted late Tuesday, Mr. Warnock was ahead by 19 percentage points out of 2,031 votes cast and Mr. Ossoff had an edge of 18 points, compared with Mr. Biden's 15 percent margin out of 2,198 votes in November. In Clay, Macon, Randolph and Washington Counties, all small, rural, predominantly Black counties, Mr. Ossoff and Mr. Warnock won larger margins than Mr. Biden did with turnout that nearly reached the November figures — an extraordinary feat given the nature of the runoffs. Some of Georgia's largest counties in metropolitan Atlanta, which is home to the state's largest concentration of Black voters, have yet to report a majority of their votes, though they are expected to soon. Data from TargetSmart, a Democratic political data firm, found that nearly 50,000 Black Georgians had cast early ballots in the Senate runoffs after not voting in the Nov. 3 general election. Scores of grass-roots organizations worked to turn out Black voters in the lead-up to the runoffs, and on a campaign swing last weekend, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris targeted Black neighborhoods where early-voting turnout had been soft. The Black vote delivered the U.S. Senate for Democrats, said Tom Bonier, the chief executive of TargetSmart.

Ben Gray/Associated Press The Democrats now appear favored to prevail in both of their Senate races in Georgia, and therefore are the favorites to take control of the U.S. Senate. The two Republican candidates hold small leads in the vote count, and still have a chance to hold onto those advantages, but most of the remaining vote is in Democratic-leaning areas. The largest block of remaining ballots is the in-person vote in DeKalb County, a heavily Democratic area that includes part of Atlanta. Over all, the two Democratic candidates are favored to win the remaining vote by around nine percentage points, according to Upshot estimates. Democrats benefited from strong turnout among Black voters, who are on track to represent a much larger share of the electorate than they did in the general election, based on the turnout by precinct and early voting data. With 5 percent of the vote left to count, the Rev. Raphael Warnock's projected lead over Senator Kelly Loeffler is larger than Jon Ossoff's projected lead over David Perdue. It's hard to say when either race will be called. The Ossoff-Perdue call might have to wait until late absentee and provisional ballots are counted.

Doug Mills/The New York Times [Read more on the history Raphael Warnock is chasing.] Democrats were growing increasingly optimistic on Tuesday night that their candidates could prevail in Georgia's Senate races — particularly the Rev. Raphael Warnock, who appeared to be performing slightly more strongly than Jon Ossoff, the party's other contender. If Mr. Warnock were to succeed, it would be a fitting culmination to an election cycle in which, hours after Joseph R. Biden Jr. was declared the president-elect, he told Black voters in his victory speech, You've always had my back, and I'll have yours. It would also be a generational breakthrough for Southern Black Democrats. Mr. Warnock, 51, the pastor who took the pulpit at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once preached, has spoken on the campaign trail about his life experiences as a Black man born and raised in the South. He is running for office in a state where people in predominantly Black neighborhoods waited in disproportionately long lines to vote last year, and where one study found that more than 80 percent of the residents hospitalized for coronavirus in the state were Black — vestiges of systemic racism in the democratic and health care systems. Political power in the former Jim Crow South, where few Black Americans have been elected to statewide office, is inextricably linked to race. And Mr. Warnock's place in the political universe is distinct from the election of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, or Northerners like former President Barack Obama, previously a senator from Illinois, and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey. Together, Mr. Warnock and Mr. Ossoff have the chance to expand Mr. Biden's legislative agenda. But Mr. Warnock alone was seeking to overcome a barrier reinforced in the South over and over again, crystallized in a saying that become popular during the civil rights movement: The South doesn't care how close a Negro gets, just so he doesn't get too high. On Tuesday, Black Democrats in Georgia said such history was not lost on them. Neither was how long it took the party to seriously pursue the possibility of success in Georgia. It took Democrats forever to invest in Georgia, said Frazier Lively, a 71-year-old who lives in Macon and attended a recent rally.

Erik S Lesser/EPA, via Shutterstock Gabriel Sterling, a Republican election official in Georgia who has forcefully condemned President Trump's efforts to overturn the results of the presidential election there, said Tuesday evening that if Republicans lost the two Senate runoffs — a real possibility based on early results — it would be Mr. Trump's fault. The blame would fall squarely on the shoulders of President Trump and his actions since Nov. 3, Mr. Sterling said on CNN. Asked what he would tell Mr. Trump if he were watching the interview, Mr. Sterling said: Mr. President, you've already lost the state of Georgia. The thing now is, no matter what you say, you can't undermine the people of Georgia's integrity to know their voting system works and their vote is going to count. Just a day earlier, on Monday, Mr. Sterling had made an emotional plea to Georgians not to let the president's false claims of election fraud deter them from participating in the runoff elections, which will determine which party controls the Senate and how much President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. is able to accomplish. And he was far from the only Republican official with that concern. In a news conference after his CNN appearance, Mr. Sterling said that 64 of Georgia's 159 counties had fully reported their results, with the largest number of uncounted votes remaining in DeKalb County, a Democratic stronghold.

Lynsey Weatherspoon for The New York Times All eyes were on mail-in ballots when general election results were tallied in November. And now, with control of the Senate hinging on two runoff elections in Georgia, it is no surprise that mail-in ballots are getting attention again. Here is what we know about when they will be counted: Mail-in ballots could not be counted before the polls closed, even if they arrived before election day. But many ballots have already been processed, meaning envelope signatures and addresses have been verified, though the tallying of the votes themselves only began Tuesday night. Of course, it is hard to say how long it will take for all of the mail-in ballots to be counted. First, some mail-in ballots may not have been received yet. Although most Georgians had to get their ballots in by the time the polls closed at 7 p.m. Eastern, military and overseas voters have three additional days for their ballots to be received, as long as they mailed them by Tuesday. Second, some counties will count their mail-in ballots faster than others. So when will all the mail-in ballots actually be counted? Only time will tell.

Audra Melton for The New York Times While both Georgia Senate races are still much too close to call, there is some positive news for Democrats in the early returns. First, it appears that the Democratic candidates — Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock — are doing better in some individual counties than benchmarks set in November. In Fulton County, the most populous county in the state and a crucial Democratic area that includes Atlanta, Mr. Warnock appears to be winning a slightly higher percentage of the vote than President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. did when he beat President Trump. And in Macon County, also heavily Democratic, both Mr. Warnock and Mr. Ossoff appear to have outperformed Mr. Biden. Washington County, in eastern Georgia, appears to have voted for Mr. Ossoff after voting narrowly for his Republican opponent, Senator David Perdue, in November. (Mr. Warnock finished ahead of his Republican opponent, Senator Kelly Loeffler, in Washington County in November, but that race was so crowded with candidates that it's hard to directly compare it to the runoff.) Second, it was clear heading into Tuesday that Democrats had built up a strong advantage in early and mail-in voting, meaning Republicans needed excellent turnout on election day — and there are indications that they may not have gotten it. In some rural, heavily Republican counties, it appears that turnout is less than 90 percent of what it was in November, whereas turnout in DeKalb County, Macon County and potentially other Democratic areas is expected to be more than 90 percent of what it was in November. None of this is definitive. Only about half of the vote has been counted so far, and the second half could be more favorable to the Republicans. But as of halftime, they haven't gotten a lot of good news. Read more\n\nJan. 5, 2021, 8:06 p.m. ET Jan. 5, 2021, 8:06 p.m. ET Georgia's future voters got to witness a high-stakes election.

Erin Schaff/The New York Times The elections on Tuesday in Georgia are set to reveal the extent to which President Trump has disrupted and damaged his own party. For the last several weeks, Mr. Trump has instigated and intensified a battle royal within the Georgia Republican universe as he has sought to overturn his loss there and pin blame on the state's G.O.P. leaders for not helping him. In response, the state's Republicans have turned on one another, taking sides for or against Mr. Trump as he continues in his obstinate — some say unlawful — effort to overturn the election results in Georgia, where he lost by nearly 12,000 votes. The outcome of these Senate elections will show, on one level, how Republican voters have reacted to Mr. Trump's quest to upend what he has falsely called a rigged election. If Republican turnout is strong on Tuesday and lifts the party's candidates to victory, it may be another sign of Mr. Trump's ability to energize the G.O.P. base. But if Republicans do not ultimately turn out in large numbers, the blame will fall at least partly on Mr. Trump for his efforts to raise doubts about the fairness of the state's election process. For Republicans in the state, the concern all along has been that Mr. Trump's effort to undermine the election process will depress turnout, partly because he has stoked beliefs that the system itself cannot be trusted. Charles S. Bullock III, a professor of political science at the University of Georgia, said Mr. Trump's phone call Saturday pressuring Georgia's secretary of state to overturn the presidential election results there could also turn some of the president's former supporters against the Republican candidates. They may say, 'This has gone too far. I can't vote against Trump, but I can vote against his surrogates,' Mr. Bullock said in an interview on Monday.

A small handful of precincts received court-ordered brief extensions because of problems earlier in the day. We're expecting votes to be counted somewhat faster than they were in November, because a new rule required Georgia election officials to begin processing early mail-in ballots at least a week before election day. This means that, while officials weren't allowed to count anything before the polls closed, they should have already finished a great deal of the work of opening envelopes, verifying signatures and so forth. Because of this, it is possible — but not guaranteed! — that we'll know who won tonight. That said, be very cautious about interpreting early results. Because votes cast before Tuesday are expected to be disproportionately Democratic and votes cast on election day are expected to be disproportionately Republican, a candidate who appears to be significantly behind at the beginning of the night could very well catch up by the end.

A federal judge in Los Angeles said this week that he was inclined to give final approval to the University of Southern California's $215 million class-action settlement with former patients of Dr. George Tyndall, the campus gynecologist accused of sexual misconduct involving hundreds of patients during his decades-long tenure.\n\nThe judge, Stephen V. Wilson of United States District Court, said in court on Monday that he was inclined to accept the settlement, which would clear the way for the university to start writing checks to more than 18,000 women who saw Dr. Tyndall during their time at the university, according to lawyers involved in the case.\n\nUnder the terms of the settlement, each woman would be guaranteed a $2,500 payment, whether or not she had alleged abuse. Women who allege the worst abuse and would be willing to be screened by a psychologist could be eligible for payments of up to $250,000.\n\nThe university said in a statement that it was pleased with the court's decision. This settlement provides respectful and confidential relief to Tyndall patients at the student health center and formalizes a broad array of campus reforms, the statement said.

Why is this idea gaining traction now? Partly, it's because of how the investment landscape has changed over the past couple of decades. There are only about half as many public companies in the United States today as there were in the late 1990s. And promising start-ups are tending to stay private longer, with elite investors capturing even more of the biggest gains.\n\nThere are reasons companies decide to stay private — including the more relaxed rules they face compared with public companies, which are required to make disclosures intended to allow investors to judge their value.\n\nThat lack of disclosure is just one of the reasons consumer advocates and others are wary of the idea. They also point to high fees associated with private investment funds, and the slim chances that smaller investors have at gaining early access to the next Google or Facebook.\n\nAnd in the end, it might not even be worth the trouble. Over all, the performance of private funds doesn't look much better than your standard mutual fund.\n\nPrivate equity funds returned 13.3 percent in 2018 and 11.6 percent for the past 10 years ending in September 2018, after fees, according to PitchBook's most recent private markets benchmark data. Investors who held mutual funds that specialized in small and midsize companies earned returns of 14.3 percent in 2018 and 9.4 percent over the same 10-year period.\n\nBut the spread between the best and worst performing private equity funds was much wider than for standard mutual funds: The top 25 percent performing private equity funds earned at least 16.2 percent over that 10-year period, while the bottom quartile returned at least 5.2 percent (the bottom 10 percent had negative returns). In the mutual fund world, the worst and best funds ranged from 9.8 percent (for the bottom 25 percent) to 12.2 percent (for the top 25 percent).\n\nThe S.E.C. acknowledged that it didn't have a full picture of how investors fared in private investments, which are also called exempt offerings.

If it cannot fulfill this basic responsibility of governance, there will be time for recrimination and change.
The new gun court, designed to resolve many illegal gun cases within six months, will deal with only gun possession cases — not those in which a person has been accused of opening fire in the street, officials said. Most of those charged with gun possession are young men, many of whom have never been arrested. In the current system, where young men arrested with guns are mixed with other criminal matters, many are given low bail or released on their own recognizance, a fact that has frustrated police officials who say officers are repeatedly arresting the same young men with guns.\n\nIt is not the first time the city has embarked on a dedicated court to try gun cases. A decade ago, also in Brooklyn, officials established a so-called gun court. At the time, judges were disallowing guns as evidence in many possession cases after determining that police officers did not have probable cause for their arrests or reasonable suspicion for the searches that turned up weapons. Different judges often gave sentences of less than a year.\n\nThe special court with a dedicated judge began hearing cases in 2003. But by 2009, the volume of cases had grown with the swelling of stop-and-frisk encounters, and a state law change increased the minimum sentence for possession of a loaded weapon, resulting in fewer plea deals. The special court ended in Brooklyn that year.\n\nA 2005 study by the New York City Criminal Justice Agency found that in the Brooklyn program's first year, it achieved the goal of speeding up cases and increasing the length of sentences. But the program also saw a decline in indictments and a rise in the number of cases dismissed in the early stages.\n\nDismissals increased partly because prosecutors in the program began taking a harder look at the evidence and determining themselves which cases would survive judicial scrutiny, officials said. Just over half of the gun possession cases brought citywide in 2014 resulted in a conviction, officials said. A third were dismissed, and in 10 percent of cases, district attorneys declined to prosecute. The big challenge on these gun cases is that the officer has to be able to articulate at a hearing how they were able to find this weapon, one law enforcement official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the plan before the announcement. Often the weapons are concealed in someone's jacket, coat, waistband, and they have to articulate what their basis was for the approach. A lot of these cases fall on the search.\n\nThe new court program will not affect the existing gun diversion programs in Brooklyn, which apply to a small number of gang-affiliated young men who are arrested with weapons but do not have a criminal record.\n\nWhen gun cases result in prison sentences, the police intend to broadcast each instance through social media as a form of deterrence.\n\nWe will get away from this notion that some gun cases are mere possession cases, said Richard M. Aborn, president of the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City, who helped to spearhead the new approach. When somebody makes a decision to pick up a gun, that's like a pre-murder case.
GREENBURGH, N.Y. — Jeff Hornacek and Phil Jackson sat on a bench alongside the court at the Knicks' practice complex Tuesday afternoon, some 15 hours after the team's season had reached its low point in a humiliating loss at home to the woeful Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nThe two men talked, and they definitely had plenty to discuss, with the Knicks' season increasingly looking like a full-fledged fiasco.\n\nBut Jackson, the Knicks' president, was not about to give reporters who cover the team any insight into the conversation he and Hornacek, the team's coach, were having. Jackson had not spoken with the local news media since September, and he did not on Tuesday, either, instead quickly departing after his conversation with Hornacek had ended.\n\nStill, hours later, Jackson did weigh in, with a comment on Twitter that could be viewed only as yet another attack on Carmelo Anthony, his star player but one whom Jackson seems intent on shipping elsewhere by the Feb. 23 trading deadline, even though Anthony has a no-trade clause in his contract.
Most important, the act prevents changing the core terms of a bond — principal, interest rate and maturity date — without the consent of each bondholder. Only a restructuring under the bankruptcy code can change those.\n\nBut it was historically thought that if an exchange offer did not touch the core terms of the bond, there was no issue under the T.I.A., even if the result might be to leave the bondholder very nervous about the company's ability to pay off the old bonds according to their terms.\n\nFor example, a bondholder who held out in an exchange offer funded with senior debt might worry that the company would be no more able to pay that senior debt than it was able to pay the old bonds according to their terms. If the company ends up in bankruptcy, the old bondholders will get paid only if the secured creditors are paid in full first, so maybe the exchange offer has actually affected the core terms of the debt instrument in a way that the T.I.A. sought to prohibit.\n\nUntil recent years, that sort of argument was widely rejected by courts. But then a few trial courts in New York began to suggest that some extreme moves done in connection with exchange offers might raise a valid claim under the T.I.A.\n\nThis week, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the federal appeals court that covers New York, among other states, put an end to that idea.\n\nThe case involved a company that could not file for bankruptcy without destroying its business. So instead it adopted a very aggressive out-of-court restructuring plan. The company had both secured and unsecured debt outstanding and was teetering on the brink of breaching its obligations under the former.\n\nThe company and a large number of its creditors came up with a plan to sell all of the company's assets to a new subsidiary. Those who consented to the plan would receive new securities in the new subsidiary. Shades are here of the old railroad receiverships, where the assets of the Short Line Railroad Inc. would be sold to Shortline Railway Inc., with only those who agreed to the deal getting to participate in the new company.
[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]\n\nThe first phase of what was to be a sweeping plan to provide half-priced subway and bus rides to the poorest New Yorkers arrived on Friday, a few days late and many people short.\n\nIf the plan had been presented last year as a major change in the lives of those struggling to make ends meet in New York City, the reality, announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio and Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, is far less than anticipated: Only 30,000 New Yorkers — those who already receive cash assistance from the city and are employed — will be eligible for the cards starting this month.\n\nThe pool of eligible New Yorkers would expand in April to about 130,000 people who receive federal food stamps and are working, Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Johnson said — still a far cry from the 800,000 New Yorkers estimated by advocates to live below the federal poverty line of $25,000 a year for a family of four.\n\nThe city has no mechanism for people to apply for the discounts; only those who receive cash benefits or food stamps can get the half-priced MetroCards.
More than 20 years ago, the dancer Arcell Cabuag peeked into a studio at Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and fell in love. It wasn't romantic love, but a rarer kind — dance love. Without knowing exactly what he was looking at, he had found his choreographer: Ronald K. Brown.\n\nMr. Brown's choreography blends modern dance with African traditions, like West African and Afro-Cuban dance, to create a mix both earthy and spiritual. Beginning Feb. 6 at the Joyce Theater, Mr. Brown will pay homage to Mr. Cabuag's 20th anniversary as a member of his company, Evidence, by creating a new duet featuring the two of them, Den of Dreams.\n\nMr. Cabuag, now 43, was a scholarship student at Ailey from California when he discovered Mr. Brown, 51, at the Ailey studios, then on 61st Street in Manhattan. When he found out that Mr. Brown would be holding auditions for a workshop with advanced students, he was hopeful until he learned that he didn't qualify to audition.\n\nAt that time, Mr. Cabuag was still trying to catch up. He caught the dance bug late, during his senior year of high school in San Jose, and had more experience in jazz and tap than in modern dance. He was trapped in ballet class when Mr. Brown's audition happened.
In estuaries off the coast of Georgia, the water is so murky that if you were to dive in, you couldn't see your hand in front of your face. There, blue crabs feast on mud crabs, oysters, fish and more.\n\nYou may eagerly approach these hand-sized arthropods when they're cracked into pieces and doused in butter. But in muddy water, tiny mud crabs, no bigger than the tip of your thumb, steer clear of the hungry blue crab predators. In this crab-eat-crab world, they can't see their enemies coming — but they can smell them.\n\nChemicals in blue crab urine are scented death messages to mud crabs. The language is different, but the warning is clear: Hide, or be eaten.\n\nBlue crabs probably don't want to send out the message, but they can't help it. We all have to pee, said Julia Kubanek, a marine chemical ecologist at Georgia Institute of Technology.
Jake Gyllenhaal did not land a Golden Globe nomination for his lead performance in Stronger, in which he played Jeff Bauman, the real-life young man who lost the lower half of his legs in the Boston Marathon bombing. But the actor is still in contention for an Oscar nomination. Rather than tracing the familiar arc of the hero's journey, the film plumbs Mr. Bauman's ambivalence about being noisily celebrated as a patriot after the atrocity.\n\nMr. Gyllenhaal, 37, said that he and Mr. Bauman, who turned 31 this month, grew extremely close on the movie. He has a light, Mr. Gyllenhaal said during a chat with me late last year at his production offices in SoHo, which featured a hefty supply of addictive chocolate chip cookies and the amiable presence of Mr. Gyllenhaal's German shepherd, Atticus. Here are edited excerpts from the interview.\n\nPatriots Day was another film about the Boston bombing, and made around the same time as Stronger. But it was more about getting the bad guys, and yours is questioning the idea that just surviving this automatically makes you a hero. Did you worry that the films had too much overlap?\n\nAll of us focus on the spectacle of a horrific event, and then also the people who've committed a crime. And it's about getting justice served. And something about Jeff, his story wasn't about the conventional idea of the triumph of the human spirit; it was about the struggle with that idea, which I was fascinated by. We all live in a world where resolution is what we desire. This didn't really give you that. All of his problems still remain. I believe in changing — I have deep hope. But I don't think we can dismiss our complications for that.
Joe Shadid, 30, is a music and content specialist for Reverb.com in Chicago.\n\nWhat is Reverb.com, and what do you do there?\n\nWe're an online marketplace where people buy and sell guitars, drums and other music gear.\n\nI appear in our YouTube videos, demonstrating music instruments and gear, giving guitar lessons and discussing music theory. I also teach users how to replicate or change artists' tones. In other videos, I interview musicians, usually about one of their songs or their gear. The music industry can be tough, and for a musician like me, this is a good way to earn a steady paycheck and stay close to my art.\n\nWhen did you know you wanted to be a musician?\n\nMy brother and I loved music as kids. When I was about 9, we'd sneak across a busy road to buy albums at a music store on the other side. One night I was listening to I've Just Seen a Face way past my bedtime when a switch turned in my brain. I ran into my parents' bedroom and asked for a guitar, and they told me to go to bed. Santa brought one that Christmas, and I've played it every day since.\n\nHow did you get this job?\n\nIn 2015, a family friend working here asked me to demonstrate a guitar pedal on a video. I was hesitant about appearing on YouTube until I realized what I could do. I love sharing, talking about and exploring the language of music. No one knows everything; there are endless things to discover.
Two days before Christmas, Mott Street, right in the heart of Chinatown, was filled with lights overnight. Residents woke up to 250 violet, pink, orange and gold lanterns hanging above the street. Local artists had painted whimsical designs and auspicious characters onto them: fu, for good fortune; he, for peace. Other characters stood for love, happiness, wealth and longevity.\n\nIt is a neighborhood that could use some cheer, said Max Davidson from Admerasia, an advertising agency that focuses on Asian-American entrepreneurs. Even in January, he said, referring to the early days of the coronavirus pandemic and the xenophobia that Chinatown suffered, a lot of the local businesses were reporting a 50 to 70 percent revenue drop. Since then there has been little improvement.\n\nThe lanterns are here to stay, at least into the new year. Light Up Chinatown is a grass-roots initiative that is kept going by donations, and so far, the group has raised almost $32,000. The actor Will Smith even gave $10,000, in conjunction with the nonprofit Asian Americans for Equality, after hearing about the project. Light Up Chinatown hopes ultimately to raise $47,000 to make more blocks look just as appealing (Bayard Street between Mott and Bowery is next).\n\nThe idea for the lanterns came from Patrick Mock, 26, who was born and raised in Chinatown and is the manager of 46 Mott Bakery.
LONDON — At the ports and terminals on Britain's southeastern coast, a new era began on Friday morning without much fuss. Ferries and trains that carry goods to France from Dover and Folkestone were running on time, and drivers snaked their trucks into the port unencumbered by congestion.\n\nTo all appearances, little may have changed on Jan. 1, the country's first day outside the European Union's single market and customs union. It was, after all, a public holiday and not much business was taking place.\n\nBut for the first time in over 25 years, goods traveling between Britain and the European Union will no longer move freely and customs checks will be enforced for goods entering the bloc.\n\nA trade deal, signed into law in Britain in the early hours of Thursday, less than 24 hours before it took effect, means the country and the European Union will trade goods without tariffs. Businesses, however, will still face significant changes that they had been urged to prepare for even during the lockdowns, closures and other social restrictions that the government has introduced to contain a surging coronavirus pandemic.
Making Friends Over 40\n\nI never see my old friends anymore. Neither does my wife. The extended punk-rock family of our youth is long gone. We've all drifted apart physically and emotionally. Our jobs changed. Our responsibilities changed. We changed. Making friends over 40 is hard. There isn't much to bond over. The new connections we do form are tenuous, easily disrupted by the slightest inconvenience. Are relationships transactional? Do we simply have little left to offer? My wife and I feel alone, but at least are alone together. We cling to each other more tightly each year, hoping the other is enough. — Daniel Lee Perea
President Trump, in an hourlong telephone call with Georgia's Republican secretary of state, repeated a number of false and misleading claims about election results in the state that have been circulating on social media. Here's a fact check.\n\nWhat Mr. Trump Said\n\nThen it was stuffed with votes. They weren't in an official voter box, they were in what looked to be suitcases or trunks, suitcases but they weren't in voter boxes. The minimum number it could be because we watched it and they watched it certified in slow motion instant replay if you can believe it, but it had slow motion and it was magnified many times over, and the minimum it was 18,000 ballots, all for Biden.\n\nFalse. Mr. Trump was most likely referring to debunked claims that a water leak at a vote counting location in Fulton County forced an evacuation and made it possible for trunks full of ballots to be rolled in. Election officials have said and surveillance videos show that this did not happen.\n\nA water leak caused a delay for about two hours in vote counting at the State Farm Arena, but no ballots or equipment were damaged. Georgia's chief election investigator, Frances Watson, testified that a review of the entire security footage revealed that there were no mystery ballots that were brought in from an unknown location and hidden under tables.
While the tone may be somber at times, there is also much to celebrate. SJ Norman, an Australian artist of Wiradjuri and Wonnaruah heritage, said in an email that the opportunity to gather in New York feels like an honoring of the continued existence of our peoples in the big city, as well as the dynamism and globalism of our peoples, which is absolutely vast.\n\nFar from merely checking boxes, the Dialogues grew out of a wariness similar to Ms. Miguel's about diversity, or a related hope: to build lasting institutional support for Indigenous performing arts worldwide. This is about a deep cultural shift, deep cultural change, Ms. Johnson said. We are very adamant that this is not about just putting your name on something, not about doing the least amount of work.\n\nA Native Alaskan artist of Yupik ancestry, Ms. Johnson has been working tirelessly to counter what she calls the perceived invisibility of Indigenous performing artists, particularly in the United States. Funding for Indigenous performance is more robust in Australia and Canada, and said Ms. Johnson said that in her home country she has often found herself wondering: Where are the Indigenous works? How do we bring this work forward?\n\nMr. Gantner, who grew up in Melbourne, Australia, and lives in New York, has observed similar disparities. Here it's kind of stuck into a corner of folk or community practice, or traditional or ritualistic, he said. In Australia and elsewhere in the world, it's not; it's understood as a dynamic contemporary expression of a culture.\n\nOne approach to bringing the United States up to speed is an ambitious pilot program, the Global First Nations Performance Network, which will be in development during this year's Dialogues. (Planning sessions are closed to the public.) The envisioned network will include 15 institutions from Canada, Australia and the United States — with the potential to expand to other countries — all dedicated to commissioning and presenting works by Indigenous artists.
The vice president welcomes the efforts of members of the House and Senate to use the authority they have under the law to raise objections and bring forward evidence before the Congress and the American people on Jan. 6, he said.\n\nThe statement, which frustrated senators who say Mr. Trump is trying to thwart democracy, helped to mollify the president, according to one person close to him.\n\nBut it was not enough to squash the belief of many Trump supporters — and the president himself — that the vice president could still somehow help overturn the results.\n\nTwo people briefed on the discussions said Mr. Trump had directly pressed Mr. Pence to find an alternative to certifying Mr. Biden's win, such as preventing him from having 270 electoral votes and letting the election be thrown to the House to decide.\n\nIn Georgia on Monday night at a rally for Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, Mr. Trump openly pressured the vice president, saying, I hope Mike Pence comes through for us, I have to tell you. He added, Of course, if he doesn't come through, I won't like him as much, before saying that he really likes Mr. Pence.\n\nOn Monday, after Mr. Pence returned from Georgia, the vice president and Mr. Trump were expected to hear a last-minute pitch at the White House from John Eastman, another Trump lawyer. Mr. Pence also met with Senate parliamentarians for hours on Sunday to prepare himself and the president for what he would say while on the Senate floor.\n\nThe fact that Mr. Pence's role is almost entirely scripted by those parliamentarians is not expected to ease a rare moment of tension between himself and the president, who has come to believe Mr. Pence's role will be akin to that of chief justice, an arbiter who plays a role in the outcome. In reality, it will be more akin to the presenter opening the Academy Award envelope and reading the name of the movie that won Best Picture, with no say in determining the winner.
MIAMI — Golden State Coach Steve Kerr said he wished players had taken their voting for the N.B.A. All-Star Game more seriously, calling it a mockery that nearly 300 players in the league wound up on at least one ballot.\n\nPlayers had a say in deciding starters for next month's game in New Orleans, with their selections accounting for 25 percent of a given player's total score in the balloting. Fan and media votes were also part of the process of selecting starters, and N.B.A. coaches vote this week for the reserves to be revealed Thursday.\n\nI am very disappointed in the players, Kerr, who will coach the Western Conference in the game, said before the Warriors' 105-102 loss at Miami on Monday night. They've asked for a vote and a lot of them just made a mockery of it. I don't know what the point is.\n\nNearly 100 players got only one vote from either themselves or N.B.A. peers in the All-Star balloting, including Mo Williams — who hasn't played a single second this season. The N.B.A. said 324 players participated in the voting.
SAN DIEGO — Ben S. Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chair, said on Saturday that the types of extraordinary steps the Fed employed to help pull the economy out of the Great Recession should make up for the central bank's limited room to cut interest rates in the event of another downturn — but that is contingent on a big if.\n\nAs long as the neutral interest rate — the setting at which Fed policy neither stokes nor slows growth — remains from 2 percent to 3 percent counting inflation, the Fed should be able to rely on tactics like snapping up bonds and promising to keep rates low in the event of another recession. But the neutral rate has been creeping lower for decades, dragged down by powerful and slow-moving forces like population aging. Should it continue to fall, the tricks Mr. Bernanke and his Fed used to coax the economy back from the brink in the 2007 to 2009 recession might prove insufficient.\n\nIn that case, a moderate increase in the inflation target or significantly greater reliance on active fiscal policy for economic stabilization, might become necessary, Mr. Bernanke said in a speech delivered in San Diego at the economics profession's biggest annual meeting.\n\nThe Fed currently targets 2 percent annual inflation, a level it believes is low enough to allow for comfort and confidence on Main Street while leaving the central bank enough room to cut rates, which incorporate price changes, in a downturn. That target is meant to be symmetric, meaning that the Fed is equally unhappy if prices run below or above 2 percent.
I started an internal video blog, Shoes Off with Sheryl. I named it that because I hate shoes. If I'm in a meeting, my shoes are probably off under the table. As silly as that sounds, that's who I am, and the day that I have to change who I am to do my job will be the day I really don't want to do it anymore. I've watched so many people lose sight of their personal reality because they felt they had to act or look a certain part.\n\nThis isn't a dress rehearsal. We get one shot at this, and I really do live that way. I had a really tough medical situation about six years ago. I had a brain tumor. So you don't know what tomorrow will bring.\n\nYou have to ask yourself, if you really had only 10 days to live, would you be doing what you're doing? We make choices, and I choose to be happy, and I think that resonates through the organization.\n\nAny feedback you've received over the years about your management style?\n\nAll the time. I'm really curious, and so I ask a lot of questions. I never go into people's business because I don't trust them, but because I want to understand and grow. Sometimes I can be too curious. There's always one more question. Sheryl always has one more question, people say.\n\nAnd so I've had to find the right parameters and make sure they know I'm available but I'm not in their way.\n\nHow do you hire?\n\nIf it's a senior executive, I almost always do it in a restaurant because it's the one time you really can understand the way people interact with others. It gives me so much insight, and I've made some really good decisions with folks with impressive résumés who just didn't know how to do that. Their natural tendencies might not have been to be polite.\n\nI'll ask about how they define success, personally and professionally. Understanding somebody's humility really speaks volumes about their leadership. I'm looking for a blend of leadership and business acumen, and that comes out in very real ways when you're talking to somebody about how they live their life, their family, the things they've accomplished, the things they do outside of work and what really gives them energy and pride.
In 1919, the director of the U.S. Bureau of Mines offered a dire warning for the future. Within the next two to five years the oil fields of this country will reach their maximum production, and from that time on we will face an ever-increasing decline.\n\nNearly a century later, in July 2010, The Guardian ran a story with an ominous headline: Lloyd's adds its voice to dire 'peak oil' warnings. Citing a report by the storied London insurer, the newspaper warned that businesses were underestimating catastrophic consequences of declining oil, including oil at $200 a barrel by 2013, a global supply crunch, and overall economic chaos.\n\nI thought of these predictions on seeing the recent news that the United States is on the eve of breaking a 47-year production record by lifting more than 10 million barrels of crude a day. That's roughly twice what the U.S. produced just a decade ago, and may even put us on track to overtake Saudi Arabia and even Russia as the world's leading oil producer. As for global production, it rose by some 11 percent just since the Lloyd's report, and by almost 200 percent since 1965.\n\nCall it yet another case of Apocalypse Not. In his fascinating new book, The Wizard and the Prophet, Charles C. Mann notes that President Roosevelt — Teddy, not Franklin — called the imminent exhaustion of fossil fuels and other natural resources the weightiest problem now before the nation. Prior to that, Mann adds, there were expert forecasts that the world would soon run out of coal. Later on, the world became fixated on the fear of running out of food in the face of explosive population growth.
Nothing in a one-term president's powers keeps the executive from nominating Supreme Court justices, signing life-changing legislation, vetoing terrible bills or renewing the United States' role as a global citizen in the existential fight against climate change.\n\nOpinion Debate What should the Biden administration prioritize? Mitt Romney writes that the right answer to human rights violations is an economic and diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Olympics that would still allow American athletes to participate.\n\nwrites that the right answer to human rights violations is an economic and diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Olympics that would still allow American athletes to participate. Steven Greenhouse writes that if the president wants to follow through on pro-union campaign promises, there are many pro-labor things Mr. Biden can do even without Congress.\n\nwrites that if the president wants to follow through on pro-union campaign promises, there are many pro-labor things Mr. Biden can do even without Congress. Chye-Ching Huang argues that one of the best ways for the president to pay for ambitious policies and help honest taxpayers is to restore the funding the I.R.S. needs to effectively battle tax cheats.\n\nargues that one of the best ways for the president to pay for ambitious policies and help honest taxpayers is to restore the funding the I.R.S. needs to effectively battle tax cheats. Enrique Krauze writes that Biden, in working with his Mexican counterpart President López Obrador, can promote a moderate approach that might be of great benefit to the U.S.-Mexico relationship and to Mexicans.\n\nBy executive order, a one-term president can keep poisons out of rivers, forbid family separation at the border and restore the honor of the military code of justice. He can order his Justice Department to back efforts in court to ensure that people with pre-existing medical conditions are not dumped by their insurance companies. He can welcome science, civility and culture back into the White House. He can protect children from lunatics who now have easy access to military-style weapons.\n\nAnd all the while, people can look to a younger and farsighted vice president as the logical next step. Perhaps the quickest way to get a President Stacey Abrams or President Pete Buttigieg is to first elect a President Biden.\n\nVoters are exhausted by the vulgarian in chief. They want a day, a week even, when their president doesn't lie to them, shout at them or call members of his own party or federal law enforcement human scum. They want their children to come out from hiding when the president appears.\n\nTrump is retro in the worst ways, far beyond his hatred of energy-efficient light bulbs, windmills and new appliances. He's also a remarkably lazy old man. His mornings are consumed by tweeting and bathing in the Dear Leader affirmation of Fox News. He spent one in five days last year at a golf course, and he has made 236 visits over all to golf clubs since he took office, costing taxpayers $115 million.\n\nBiden's support has not wavered, especially among people of color and disaffected whites — a coalition no other candidate can match. Once the nominating process gets past the white and unrepresentative states of Iowa and New Hampshire, the new America will show its power: States representing one-third of the United States population will vote on Super Tuesday, March 3. Biden is well positioned.\n\nBiden's closest rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, will be 79 by Election Day. He still has a lot of steam left in the engine. But the engine smells too much like 19th-century socialism, a failed economic system repackaged under Sanders's slogan of a political revolution.
Yet she still emerged as one of the debate's winners, and she is enjoying a burst of new attention. She raised more than twice as much money, $11.4 million, in the fourth quarter of 2019 than the third quarter. When I ask top Democrats which candidate has the best chance of beating Trump, Klobuchar is often their answer. If party leaders still chose nominees, she might now be the favorite.\n\nIn that way, she reminds me of another Midwestern senator who once seemed too ordinary to be president: Harry Truman. In the summer of 1944, an even more perilous time for global democracy than now, Democratic Party grandees chose Truman as vice president with the belief that he would soon be president, given Franklin Roosevelt's declining health.\n\nTruman was (as Klobuchar is) a loyal Democrat with populist leanings whom many Republicans, both senators and voters, nonetheless felt some affection for. He had a folksy manner and heartland accent. He was also a long shot for the nomination when the process began. The analogy extends to Klobuchar's best-known weakness: Truman had a temper, too.\n\nOf course, Klobuchar needs to win over millions of primary voters, not just hundreds of convention delegates, which is why she remains an underdog. But the path is the same one that her campaign had always seen: Do well enough in Iowa, which is next door to her home state of Minnesota, and then in New Hampshire to be one of the final two or three candidates standing.
The chef and television personality Tom Colicchio, who has become something of a prototype for the politically active chef, is leaving Food Policy Action, the organization he helped found in 2012.\n\nHe announced his departure from the group's board on Thursday on Instagram and Twitter, saying his resignation was effective immediately.\n\nThe split appears to be a result of what might best be described as creative differences. In an interview on Friday, Mr. Colicchio said he was frustrated with the core work of the organization, which analyzes food policy and lobbies for broad changes to encourage the production of more affordable, healthier and ethically produced food, as well as economic help for workers.\n\nI think lobbying efforts around food aren't going to work, and I'd rather spend my time trying to change Congress instead of shouting into the void, he said. Heading into the midterms, I'd rather spend my time getting better people elected.
On Monday, Facebook announced a new policy to ban artificial intelligence-generated deepfakes as well as videos edited or synthesized … in ways that aren't apparent to an average person. In theory that sounds like a welcome effort to curb disinformation.\n\nBut the new policy won't, for example, cover subtly edited videos like last year's slowed down viral Nancy Pelosi clip. And politicians and their ads remain off limits to Facebook's third-party fact checkers. A company spokesman told me Tuesday that if Facebook determines a politician has shared manipulated media in an ad, Facebook will remove it. But, as far as I can tell, bogus content — even outright lies — is still allowed, as long as it isn't manipulated by artificial intelligence.\n\nAnd the company left a big loophole: Facebook will not censor political speech if it is in the public interest to see it. If a politician posts organic content that violates our manipulated media policy, we would evaluate it by weighing the public interest value against the risk of harm. Our newsworthy policy applies to all content on Facebook, not just content posted by politicians, the spokesman wrote in an email.\n\nIn an effort to assuage the public on political disinformation, Facebook has only muddied the waters. Would Facebook allow distribution of a deepfaked video if it were shared by the president as rationale for the bombing of Iran? Such a hypothetical post would certainly be newsworthy, though such a video would be a clear violation of Facebook's rules. What if the president shared a less manipulated shallowfake video, like the Pelosi video, of a potential 2020 opponent? These are, admittedly, edge cases, but when it comes to foreign policy, national security and election integrity, edge cases are often the highest profile and consequential.
MOUNT VERNON, Wash. — He injected extra fat into already well-marbled roasts, with a grin and an ever-present glass of wine. He laughed uproariously at his own jokes, and told Americans that cooking at home did not have to be particularly sophisticated or difficult (Julia Child, the only other major TV chef of his era, had pretty much staked out that turf anyway) to be wild, and wildly fun.\n\nBut always, Graham Kerr leapt. Decades before Emeril Lagasse shouted Bam! in administering a pinch of cayenne or garlic, Mr. Kerr defined the television cook as a man of energy and constant motion — The Galloping Gourmet, as his show's title put it.\n\nStarting in 1969, in front of a live audience (another pioneering step, long before the Food Network arrived) Mr. Kerr lassoed America into the 1970s with the novel concept that watching someone cook was, first and foremost, entertaining.\n\nHe was hunky and British and funny, and in that heyday of the sexual revolution, he could titillate audiences with a one-liner about circumcision while peeling a cucumber. The media christened him the high priest of hedonism.
In my past assessments, TurboTax has sometimes lagged H&R Block in the area of technical help on confusing tax questions — in particular, I'd found its live help harder to use.\n\nI had a question this year about logging in a contribution to an individual retirement account for a self-employed person. I was working online on my tablet and chose the option of receiving a telephone call from an expert. I got a message saying I'd hear back within five minutes. A gentleman from TurboTax called within two. He suggested that I return to my desktop computer and search SEP Accounts to find the jump link, which would take me to the place where I should enter the information. That solved my problem.\n\nH&R Block\n\nIf TurboTax closed the help gap this year, Block reciprocated by beating TurboTax on the transfer of last year's return. As with TurboTax, I couldn't upload the prior year's tax file. But Block gave me the option of uploading a PDF, and that worked. The program also vacuumed up our wage and investment information.\n\nHow Has the Pandemic Changed Your Taxes? Will stimulus payments be taxed? Nope. The so-called economic impact payments are not treated as income. In fact, they're technically an advance on a tax credit, known as the Recovery Rebate Credit. The payments could indirectly affect what you pay in state income taxes in a handful of states, where federal tax is deductible against state taxable income, as our colleague Ann Carrns wrote. Read more. Are my unemployment benefits taxable? Mostly. Unemployment insurance is generally subject to federal as well as state income tax, though there are exceptions (Nine states don't impose their own income taxes, and another six exempt unemployment payments from taxation, according to the Tax Foundation). But you won't owe so-called payroll taxes, which pay for Social Security and Medicare. The new relief bill will make the first $10,200 of benefits tax-free if your income is less than $150,000. This applies to 2020 only. (If you've already filed your taxes, watch for I.R.S. guidance.) Unlike paychecks from an employer, taxes for unemployment aren't automatically withheld. Recipients must opt in — and even when they do, federal taxes are withheld only at a flat rate of 10 percent of benefits. While the new tax break will provide a cushion, some people could still owe the I.R.S. or certain states money. Read more. I worked from home this year. Can I take the home office deduction? Probably not, unless you're self-employed, an independent contractor or a gig worker. The tax law overhaul of late 2019 eliminated the home office deduction for employees from 2018 through 2025. Employees who receive a paycheck or a W-2 exclusively from an employer are not eligible for the deduction, even if they are currently working from home, the I.R.S. said. Read more. How does the family leave credit work? Self-employed people can take paid caregiving leave if their child's school is closed or their usual child care provider is unavailable because of the outbreak. This works similarly to the smaller sick leave credit — 67 percent of average daily earnings (for either 2020 or 2019), up to $200 a day. But the caregiving leave can be taken for 50 days. Read more. Have rules changed on charitable giving? Yes. This year, you can deduct up to $300 for charitable contributions, even if you use the standard deduction. Previously, only people who itemized could claim these deductions. Donations must be made in cash (for these purposes, this includes check, credit card or debit card), and can't include securities, household items or other property. For 2021, the deduction limit will double to $600 for joint filers. Rules for itemizers became more generous as well. The limit on charitable donations has been suspended, so individuals can contribute up to 100 percent of their adjusted gross income, up from 60 percent. But these donations must be made to public charities in cash; the old rules apply to contributions made to donor-advised funds, for example. Both provisions are available through 2021. Read more.\n\nAs in the past, I found Block's explanations the clearest; that's where Block's long history in the tax-return preparation business — it also runs a chain of about 12,000 retail outlets — shines through. The guidance prompted me to include legal expenses I'd incurred to incorporate in 2016. I'd neglected to log those into TurboTax. Once, it even managed to amuse me, warning against trying to deduct expenses for a facility, like a yacht or hunting lodge, that's mainly recreational. Do people with yachts do their own taxes?\n\nBut Block's tax sophistication can sometimes stupefy. The program gave me four options for a depreciation method for my new desktop Mac. I went with the default, having no idea what the terms GDS vs. ADS or regular vs. straight-line meant. The software suggested that I take the GDS (General Depreciation System) regular method, which gives the quickest write-off. (Note to the I.R.S.: It wasn't me!)\n\nLater, the program also asked, How are you feeling about your taxes? I assumed that the possible answers would be (a) anxious, (b) annoyed or (c) on the verge of casting my laptop into Boston Harbor (yes, I live nearby). Instead, it offered anodyne choices, including I need help. I opted for that, and the program then offered Best of Both for $79.99.\n\nWith this service, a Block tax professional will review your completed returns. You can select the person, even seeing a picture. I picked Amy Brown, in nearby Acton, Mass., and learned that her hobbies included knitting and beekeeping. It felt like Block had merged with Match.com. Maybe that'll be next year's new service: have your taxes reviewed over cocktails or coffee.
Los Angeles | $1.4 Million\n\nA 1922 Spanish-Colonial revival house with two bedrooms and two bathrooms, on a 0.09-acre lot\n\nOnce the vacation retreat of the actor Lionel Barrymore, this single-story house sits on a hillside in Laurel Canyon, about three miles northwest of Hollywood and 10 miles northwest of Downtown Los Angeles.

The city is awake. Across the length of its five boroughs, a vast stream of humanity will move. This was what a New Yorker's commute looked like in 1961. — can be seen the daily miracle that is the New York City transit system. But that was then. And this is now. [screaming] Stand clear of the closing doors, please. Subway riders demanding an end to their commuting nightmare. So fed up with all the delays and cancellations that they are suing the M.T.A. The New York subway now has the worst on-time performance of any major rapid transit system in the world. And commuters are pissed. This woman's commute has gotten so bad, she's considering leaving a job she really likes. No. I got a new job. This rabbi was sent into a panic when his train stalled just before Shabbat. And then there's this guy, who was stuck underground for so long, commuters sang to pass the time. ... Gonna make me lose my mind up in here ... It's been two hours. They ended up making a Facebook group. They're still in touch. Yeah. The mornings where every single line is delayed — It was like cruel or arbitrary. But it really wasn't that long ago that New Yorkers would laugh at other city subway systems. Four lines in Boston, two in L.A.? That's cute. In New York our trains run 24/7. We have 665 miles of track, 472 stations, 27 subway lines, and almost six million riders every single day. Does it really have to be this way? Also, has it always been this bad? Turns out the M.T.A. has recovered from a transit crisis before. Ladies and gentlemen, we are being held momentarily by the train's dispatcher. These were the trains in the 1970s. Poor maintenance, high crime and widespread graffiti. It was kind of scary. And that's Jim. He's been reporting on the subway since before I was born. He wrote the book about the subway, literally. In the '70s, it was really, really bad. Maintenance really had suffered. So officials poured money into the system, and it improved. [cheering] They are working on it. They're doing the best they can. They're fixing the tracks. Well, they're fixing the track. They put in a new escalator downstairs. They improve it in the '80s. Today we got better equipment, better parts and better tools. In the '90s it gets to be the best it's ever been. The 1990s were the golden era of subway functionality. So if you want to prove to someone that New York has it all, just show them your MetroCard Gold. New York's governor at the time, George Pataki, called it a transit renaissance. But then, that city that has it all started taking the system for granted, starting with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Cut down the size of city government. Just a year into his first term, the mayor cut the city's contribution to the M.T.A.'s budget by millions of dollars. Then, Governor Pataki followed Giuliani's lead. And so began a trend of mayors and governors diverting part of their budgets away from the M.T.A. and toward their own priorities. And then blaming one another for the problems that followed. Right. So while the city and state contributions got smaller and smaller and smaller, subway ridership went up, and so did the fares. But fares still weren't enough to make up for the budget cuts. So a group of Wall Street executives came to the M.T.A. with a deal. [cash register ringing] These Wall Street execs, they went to the head of the M.T.A., also known as the governor, and said, give us your debt. We'll pay you cash. Pay us back later. Pataki agreed to the deal to refinance the M.T.A.'s debt. Basically, they used the Amex to pay off the MasterCard. And these bankers, many of whom were donors to Governor Pataki's campaign, walked away with $85 million in commissions and fees. And that debt lives on today — ... finally reaches its destination. — even if some of the equipment we're still paying for does not. Great habitat enhancement for fish and shellfish. Then — It was a fiscal crisis globally. That was a really big turning point for the M.T.A. Maintenance was withdrawn. You're checking the cars less frequently, you're repairing the cars less frequently, then they're going to break down more frequently. So basically — The trains became slightly less reliable. But there were millions of dollars draining from the M.T.A.'s budget that could have been used for maintenance. So what happened was — This summer Governor Cuomo's administration forced the M.T.A. to bail out some upstate ski resorts after an unusually warm winter. So we set out to try and find out if there were a lot of other examples of the M.T.A. being forced by the state to spend money on things that had nothing to do with the subway. And we found out about these bond issuance fees. Bond issuance fees may sound a little boring. So I hired a busker to write a song about it. Let me put it this way — the M.T.A. brings in a lot of money. The state has used that money as a piggy bank for other priorities. The next stop is Fulton Street. Fulton Street was the pet project of a guy named Sheldon Silver. He wanted Fulton Street to be the Grand Central Station of downtown Manhattan. So construction started, the years went by, and the day of the grand opening arrived. Oh, that's way over budget. At this point, the M.T.A. board wants to scale things back. And one of the board members — Nancy Shevell, wife of Paul McCartney, said, we're not building cathedrals here. But the next day, Sheldon Silver demanded — You're going to build this thing the way it was originally supposed to be built, or else I'm going to veto your capital budget. So the M.T.A. complied. A billion and a half dollars on one station. It didn't get an extra subway car, an extra foot of track, nothing. Did I say it was in his district? Fulton Street was just one example. These politicians really wanted to be able to have a big project they could champion, mosaics and artwork and everything is brand new. Clean, shiny subway stations. This is exciting, right? I did this for you. Here is my gift to you. Yeah. And I feel good about that. Of course you should. You can't really do that with replacing some ancient subway signal system that people don't even know exists. No one wants to talk about the signals. I don't think I understand how the signals even work. And neither did I. So I watched a documentary released by the M.T.A. to learn more. People know that the system is old, but I don't think they realize just how old it is. It's not just the architecture that's 100 years old. It's a lot of the basic technology as well. We never really know where the train is. Um — Yeah. The workers don't actually know where the trains are exactly, precisely, on the tracks. They know what section they are in. So they have to keep them a safe distance apart as they go through the system. You can't just go to Best Buy and pick up something to replace this 1930s piece of equipment. New signals would mean more trains running more efficiently and closer together. But it's been two decades since the M.T.A. first began its push to upgrade its signals. And so far, they've completed just one line. If you don't focus on the core needs of the system, bad things can happen. So the trains were not as well taken care of, the signal system deteriorated, and there was very little margin for error. And then that margin gets even smaller with Hurricane Sandy. The worst disaster in the history of the subway system. So this is the part of the story where all of those bad decisions of the past really start wreaking havoc. The M.T.A. is openly violating its own safety directives. A tunnel wall in Brooklyn collapses onto the track. We just boarded the rescue train. There have been 22 derailments. Overcrowding is definitely a problem, but the M.T.A. can't blame everything on overcrowding. The issue is there's not one person to blame. There's been a lot of back and forth between the governor and the mayor. Blame everybody who has been in power in New York in the past 25 years. A train careens off the tracks in Harlem, injuring 34 people. And in summer of 2017, the waiting and crowding and derailments reach a breaking point. And at long last, Governor Cuomo declares a state of emergency. I mean there is some light at the end of the tunnel. No pun intended. I actually did not intend that pun. There are some signs that politicians are now taking the maintenance of the subway system seriously. Elected leaders are finally expected to come out with a plan to pay for the M.T.A. And I think there's a consensus they can't just rely on debt anymore. I believe in you, subway. But you've got to get it together. We want to do this. We need to do this. We will do this. I think delay is, in a messed up way, our way to bring people together. There's no New York City without the subways. I regard it as the great public commons of New York. Yeah, it's good. Nice meeting all of you. They ride together. And in this journey can be seen the daily miracle that is the New York City transit system, upon which the very existence of the city and its people, depend.
WASHINGTON — Facebook says it will ban videos that are heavily manipulated by artificial intelligence, the latest in a string of changes by the company to combat the flow of false information on its site.\n\nA company executive said in a blog post late Monday that the social network would remove videos, often called deepfakes, that artificial intelligence has altered in ways that would likely mislead someone into thinking that a subject of the video said words that they did not actually say. The videos will also be banned in ads.\n\nThe policy will have a limited effect on slowing the spread of false videos, since the vast majority are edited in more traditional ways: cutting out context or changing the order of words. The policy will not extend to those videos, or to parody or satire, said the executive, Monika Bickert.\n\nMs. Bickert said all videos posted would still be subject to Facebook's system for fact-checking potentially deceptive content. Content that is found to be factually incorrect appears less prominently on the site's news feed and is labeled false.
PHILADELPHIA — Blanka Zizka, the artistic director of the Wilma Theater here, had reached a breaking point.\n\nAbout seven years ago, she was putting on a new play featuring actors from New York, Los Angeles and Philadelphia, and the room was filled with egos and fears, Ms. Zizka said. It felt all too familiar: starting a production trying to get the fear out of people.\n\nIt takes a long time to build trust, explained Ms. Zizka, who defected from Czechoslovakia in 1976 with her husband, Jiri, and joined the fledgling Wilma three years later. That sense of discontinuity was really painful. I thought, if that's what theater means in the United States, I don't want to do it. One possibility was to retire, and the other was to change things.\n\nMs. Zizka did not retire — she went rogue.\n\nThe Wilma now has a three-year-old resident acting company and welcomes shows whose daring aesthetics depart from the factory-setting naturalism of most American stages, especially regional ones.
Former farmworker, Immokalee, Fla.\n\nI worked on and off over the years. I worked for the last full season here, including during the pandemic. I started in August of 2019 in planting, then I worked all the way to the end of harvest, around May or June last year.\n\nIt's a long day, it's very challenging work. We would be picking, for example, cucumbers in the morning and tomatoes in the afternoon and they're both very heavy work. My fingers would hurt by the end of the day. It hurts your back and makes your lungs ache to work that hard. I would sometimes come home and would just cry.\n\nWe were working long days, but they put a lot of protections in place. Lipman Family Farms were a part of the Fair Food program, and followed the procedures.\n\nWe would clean all of the tables with Clorox or bleach and make sure that everyone was washing their hands well. Thank God no one I know got sick. I wasn't too afraid of the pandemic because of the precautions that the company was taking. They hired people specifically to clean the buses every day.\n\nIn the beginning of the pandemic, we knew that if we didn't do this work, prices could go way up. We knew that when there aren't people to pick the food, it could have a much bigger impact on everything else.\n\nOur work is important, but the phrase essential worker is a title that we were given. We should have been not just thanked, but given real support. Especially in the beginning, when everything ran out in the stores. They had big gallons of sanitizer at work, and I brought a little bit home to keep our house clean.\n\nIf what we're doing is so important, I thought we would be paid extra. All we got from the government was the one Covid check.\n\nI found another job in landscaping, which is a bit lighter. But I believe that field work is incredibly important. It's not just a tomato. Behind every vegetable is this long process.\n\nThe most beautiful thing is knowing all of the other workers, chatting with them, learning about their lives and their experiences. Many have left their families in order to put food on the table. I would try to encourage them and say, Don't worry, paisano.
ESPN reported Sunday night that the Wolves, though, are determined to keep the coaching and personnel roles separate in the future, meaning Hoiberg — or anyone else they hire — would have to choose one or the other.\n\nThibodeau's dismissal leaves San Antonio's Gregg Popovich as the only coach in the 30-team N.B.A. who also holds personnel power as team president. But even Popovich does not operate in that manner, delegating virtually all of his personnel power to the team president, R. C. Buford.\n\nThe Timberwolves ended a 13-year playoff drought last season by posting a 47-35 record, with Butler and the young center Karl-Anthony Towns emerging as All-Stars.\n\nButler, however, rebuffed Minnesota's offer of a contract extension in July in the first hint of his discontent. He ultimately asked for a trade days before the start of training camp in September — despite a long association with Thibodeau dating to their days in Chicago.\n\nButler maintained that he had made his desire to leave Minnesota in free agency clear to the Wolves for months. But Thibodeau and his general manager, Scott Layden, did not begin to seek trades for Butler until training camp was underway and ultimately dealt him to Philadelphia on Nov. 12 for a package headlined by Dario Saric and Robert Covington. The team was 4-9 at the time.\n\nI said let's let it go and see how things worked and I think now, we've gone up through halfway through the season and I don't think we're where we thought we would be or where we think we should be, Taylor told The Minneapolis Star-Tribune.\n\nI'm just looking at the results. The results are that I don't think we should've lost against Phoenix or Detroit or New Orleans or Atlanta. Maybe one of those games. We just lost against a bunch of teams that we're a better team.
Julián Castro, the former housing secretary whose progressive presidential candidacy did not make significant inroads with Democratic voters but earned plaudits from the party's left wing, has endorsed Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, offering a possible lift for her candidacy less than one month before the Iowa caucuses.\n\nMr. Castro announced his endorsement on Monday morning, just days after he ended his own bid for the White House. In a statement, Mr. Castro cast Ms. Warren as the logical extension of his campaign's social-justice-driven message, which seeks to correct inequities through targeted policy proposals. He will campaign with Ms. Warren this week, joining her Tuesday night at a rally at Kings Theatre in Brooklyn.

The Justice Department has notified New York State officials that it may sue the state over what it says are widespread failures to comply with a provision of federal voter registration law that requires state drivers' license applications to double as applications for voter registration, according to a letter obtained by The New York Times.\n\nIn the letter, dated Jan. 6, the Justice Department lays out how the state's Department of Motor Vehicles violates the law. The lapses deprive numerous New Yorkers of important voter registration opportunities required under federal law, according to the letter, which was signed by Vanita Gupta, the head of the civil rights division at the Justice Department.\n\nAt D.M.V. offices throughout the state, a Justice Department investigation found, drivers' license applications do not also serve as voter registration forms unless applicants request it, and the option is sometimes closed even to those who make a request.\n\nThe letter said that even among D.M.V. offices that allow voter registration, some do not pass registration forms to election officials in the time required by law. That finding echoes those described by the office of the state attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, in a report on voting issues surrounding the 2016 presidential primary.
Live Updates: Ohio State Routs Clemson, Will Meet Alabama for National Title Image Justin Fields threw six touchdowns for Ohio State. Credit... Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images Ohio State will meet Alabama in the national championship game on Jan. 11 after both teams won their College Football Playoff semifinals on Friday night. Top-ranked Alabama, the Southeastern Conference champion, was the first to reach the title game with a 31-14 rout of No. 4 Notre Dame in the Rose Bowl. No. 3 seed Ohio State followed with a 49-28 upset of No. 2 Clemson in the Sugar Bowl, behind a masterful performance from quarterback Justin Fields.\n\nJan. 2, 2021, 12:03 a.m. ET Jan. 2, 2021, 12:03 a.m. ET Ohio State crushed Clemson and will play Alabama for the national title. Justin Fields took a big hit, then quickly threw a big touchdown to allow Ohio State to extend its lead to 28-14. Credit... Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images Third-ranked Ohio State — dented this season by the coronavirus pandemic and maligned for a shortened schedule and a shaky pass defense — ousted No. 2 Clemson from the College Football Playoff on Friday night, routing the Tigers, 49-28, in the Sugar Bowl and vaulting into the national championship game. The Buckeyes (7-0) will meet No. 1 Alabama, the winner of Friday's Rose Bowl against Notre Dame, on Jan. 11. The Tigers, who reached and lost last season's title game, will be left to consider how, for the second time in a year, their ambitions collapsed under the lights of the Superdome in New Orleans. Clemson's night began with promise as quarterback Trevor Lawrence led an eight-play, 82-yard drive for a touchdown. Ohio State's night started with a three-and-out. The Buckeyes, though, scored touchdowns on each of their ensuing five possessions, a dazzling, dizzying display of passing and rushing might. By the time the clock mercifully expired, after Clemson's drives stalled and their comeback efforts fizzled, the Big Ten champion Buckeyes had 639 yards of offense, including 254 on the ground. Ohio State quarterback Justin Fields, seemingly setting aside an injury from a hit that led the officials to disqualify a star Clemson defender, threw for 385 yards, including six touchdowns. He completed all but six of his 28 passes. But Clemson, its offensive coordinator absent because he had tested positive for the coronavirus, had strikingly severe struggles on both sides of the ball. Lawrence, who is widely anticipated to become the No. 1 selection in the 2021 N.F.L. draft, lost for only the second time in his career as a starter. He threw for 400 yards with two touchdowns and an interception. Travis Etienne, who holds the Atlantic Coast Conference's record for career rushing yards, added 32 to his tally on Friday but fell short in his effort to reach 5,000 rushing yards during his four seasons at Clemson. Indeed, the numbers that Clemson's stars logged were nowhere near enough against an Ohio State offense whose potency went mostly unchecked. The win propelled Ohio State into the title game for the first time since the 2014 season, when the playoff era debuted and the Buckeyes won the championship. They had been left out ever since, with every national title game featuring Alabama, Clemson or both. For its part, Alabama (12-0) had little difficulty dispatching No. 4 Notre Dame in the Rose Bowl, which was played in Texas because of public health restrictions connected to the pandemic. Alabama prevailed, 31-14, with its quarterback, Mac Jones, completing 83 percent of his passes. DeVonta Smith, the Crimson Tide's top receiver and, along with Jones, a finalist for the Heisman Trophy, had 130 receiving yards and caught three touchdowns. And Najee Harris, a running back, logged 125 rushing yards. Read more\n\nJan. 1, 2021, 11:17 p.m. ET Jan. 1, 2021, 11:17 p.m. ET Justin Fields has thrown more touchdowns than incompletions. It's ugly for Clemson and stunning for Justin Fields. Despite an injury earlier in the Sugar Bowl, Fields just fired off a 45-yard pass to Jameson Williams for his sixth touchdown throw of Friday night. He's passed for 385 yards and, having completed 22 of 26 throws, has more touchdowns than incompletions. The score is 49-21, Ohio State, as the Sugar Bowl starting quarterback who didn't make this season's Heisman finalist cut seizes his moment in New Orleans.

An interception at the beginning of the third quarter allowed Clemson to be the first to put points up in a nine-play, 80-yard drive, culminating in a touchdown catch by Cornell Powell. But that strong start was overshadowed by a 56-yard touchdown throw by Justin Fields, caught by wide receiver Chris Olave. Then a fumble by Trevor Lawrence — which slipped through his fingers and took a little while to sort out on the field — followed by a sack on Fields, which had him limping for a second, both metaphorically summed up the game so far. Ohio State is up 42-21 going into the final quarter. Read more\n\nJan. 1, 2021, 10:51 p.m. ET Jan. 1, 2021, 10:51 p.m. ET Ohio State strikes again, pushing its lead back to 21 points.

Butch Dill/Associated Press On second thought, maybe Clemson should find the panic button (or push it again). Not long after Clemson dodged a calamity on an Ohio State possession, Buckeyes quarterback Justin Fields threw a 56-yard pass to hit Chris Olave in the end zone. The throw propelled Ohio State's total yardage for Friday night past 500 yards, with 329 of them through the air. Clemson has 281 yards on the night.

Or maybe the Tigers did, and it quickly worked. With Ohio State on the verge of scoring early in the third quarter, Mike Jones Jr. intercepted Justin Fields's tipped pass in the end zone, extinguishing a drive that had moments earlier appeared poised to give the Buckeyes a 28-point lead. But with Clemson still down by 21, Trevor Lawrence, one of the modern game's finer quarterbacks, stood behind his offensive line, seemingly as unfazed as ever, and got to work. He started with a 13-yard slant pass to E.J. Williams, a freshman wide receiver. Then a pass to Amari Rodgers for a nine-yard gain. Brannon Spector reached midfield when he caught an eight-yard pass. And so on. Ultimately, on the ninth play of the drive, Cornell Powell rumbled into the end zone, his left hand gripping the ball and extending it over the goal line. 35-21, Ohio State. Clemson, though, has a bit of life with less than eight minutes to play in the third quarter.

Quarterback Trevor Lawrence rushed in the first touchdown for Clemson. Credit... Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images Justin Fields threw four touchdown passes; Trevor Lawrence rushed for one. While Lawrence has not had as much time with the ball, Fields seems lucky to still be playing. Despite differences on the field tonight, the story of these two quarterbacks is actually quite similar. Fields went to Harrison High School in Kennesaw, Ga., about a half-hour drive away from where Lawrence played in Cartersville. While Lawrence set himself apart at an early age — 3,042 yards and 26 touchdowns as a starting quarterback in his freshman year — Fields was slower to bloom. We have kind of been matched up for years going back to high school, Lawrence said this week. I haven't really seen it as that. We're just out here. We're friends and we have a good relationship. Going into the second half of the Sugar Bowl, Ohio State is up, 35-14. Lawrence and Fields trained with the same private coach in high school. In 2017, Lawrence broke Georgia's record for passing yards and passing touchdowns, set by Deshaun Watson, who also went to Clemson. In two years as a starter for Harrison, Fields had 4,187 passing yards, 41 passing touchdowns, 2,096 rushing yards and 28 rushing touchdowns. Both of them were five-star recruits going into college, with Lawrence signing to Clemson and Fields committing to Georgia. Lawrence found his footing fast while Fields transferred to Ohio State in 2019. The two quarterbacks faced off once more in the Fiesta Bowl, which Clemson won over Ohio State, 29-23. It is pretty self-explanatory that that game hurt us a lot last year, Fields said this week. So, that has kind of been our whole motivation this offseason. Lawrence has lost one game in his Clemson career — the national championship game against Louisiana State last season (he was out with the coronavirus when Clemson lost to Notre Dame earlier this season). Fields, during his tenure at Ohio State, has only lost to Clemson. Last year, Fields was up for the Heisman Trophy but lost to Joe Burrow. This year, Lawrence has a shot though is up against some stiff competition, especially from two Alabama players. Both Fields and Lawrence are considered likely to go in the top five of the 2021 N.F.L. draft — with Lawrence perhaps at No. 1 to the Jacksonville Jaguars and Fields to follow.

Clemson linebacker James Skalski was ejected in the first half for hitting Ohio State quarterback Justin Fields with the crown of his helmet. Credit... Butch Dill/Associated Press Clemson, ordinarily sharp in virtually every way on the football field, is in trouble in New Orleans. Yes, it's only halftime. Yes, Trevor Lawrence is a quarterback whose offense can work rapid wonders. But the scoreboard says Ohio State is in front, 35-14, and a 21-point deficit to the third-ranked Buckeyes is hardly the scenario that the Tigers wanted. And they've lost a crucial defender, James Skalski, to targeting. So with Ohio State leading at the intermission, here are a few quick takeaways. All eyes on Justin Fields: The Ohio State quarterback struggled off the field in the wake of the hit that led to Skalski's disqualification and retreated to a medical tent. He returned to the game, but his availability and condition in the second half could prove important if Clemson resurrects its offense and poses a significant threat. At halftime, Fields was 16-for-18 with his passes and had thrown for 223 yards. The Buckeyes also have a highlight-reel worthy running game: Ohio State ran for 171 yards in the first half. In the whole of the Big Ten championship, they put together 399 rushing yards, 305 of them in the second half. Trey Sermon is doing most of the running work so far in the Sugar Bowl, having rushed for 121 yards and a touchdown. He's averaging about seven yards a carry. Clemson doesn't (at least tonight): The Tigers recorded only 44 rushing yards in the first half. They've averaged 164 a game this season. Ugly drives for Clemson: Three possessions ended in three-and-outs. Clemson's total yardage tonight: 201 yards. Ohio State has already rolled up 394 and is set to get the ball to start the second half. One note of consolation for Clemson: The Tigers were down to Ohio State in the 2019 Fiesta Bowl before pulling off a victory that vaulted them into the national championship game.

Soon after, the officials issued a targeting call against James Skalski, a 240-pound linebacker from Sharpsburg, Ga. Skalski was disqualified from the game and C.J. Stroud, a true freshman, took a snap for Ohio State. Then Fields returned and threw a nine-yard pass for a touchdown. 28-14, Ohio State.

All it took was a 17-yard pass from Justin Fields to Jeremy Ruckert, a junior tight end. Early in the second quarter, it's clear that the Buckeyes are settling in at the Superdome: Since their opening possession, when they went three-and-out, they have finished the rest of their drives with touchdowns. Fields did plenty of the work on the most recent drive for Ohio State, passing for 45 yards but also rushing for 17. It took just over four minutes for Ohio State to go 84 yards.

Early verdict: The Sugar Bowl will not be a rerun of Friday's Rose Bowl. Clemson and Ohio State have been playing for less than 14 minutes in New Orleans. They're tied at 14 apiece. For College Football Playoff context, Alabama and Notre Dame combined for 45 points across 60 minutes in Texas, where the Rose Bowl was played because of public health restrictions in California. It was always a safe bet that we'd see plenty of scoring in the Sugar Bowl — what else would you expect with Justin Fields and Trevor Lawrence starting at quarterback? — but these drives are efficient. (When Ohio State and Clemson met last season, Clemson prevailed 29-23.) In the first quarter of Friday's game, Clemson's scoring drives took fewer than three minutes each. Ohio State proved even speedier with one touchdown, taking 72 seconds to score. By the standards of this game, the Buckeyes languished their way to a second touchdown, taking nearly three and a half minutes. And it's been feast or famine so far for both teams: They've either scored touchdowns or gone three-and-out.

Clemson running back Travis Etienne could hit 5,000 yards rushing if he has an average day at the Sugar Bowl. Credit... Gerald Herbert/Associated Press Travis Etienne is nothing short of decorated. No surprise he ran in a touchdown for Clemson with 5:01 left in the first quarter. Clemson is up, 14-7. Etienne holds the Football Bowl Subdivision record for the most games with a touchdown (46) and the Atlantic Coast Conference record for total rushing touchdowns and overall touchdowns (70 rushing TDs, 78 total). He is also one of 12 players in F.B.S. history with 4,000 receiving yards and 1,000 rushing yards in a career. He has rushed for 4,929 yards at Clemson, including 9 yards at the Sugar Bowl. He needs 71 yards to become the first to run for 5,000 yards in A.C.C. history — a mark he could hit if he matches his season average tonight. (Tony Dorsett rushed for 6,526 yards in the 1970s for the University of Pittsburgh, but the university did not join the A.C.C. until 2011.) Prior to Friday's game, Etienne had rushed for 882 yards this season, with 13 rushing touchdowns in 11 games. He is a Doak Walker Award finalist. Raised in Jennings, La., Etienne has family watching in person at the Superdome in New Orleans, he said this week. With Covid and the pandemic and everything going on, I'm very grateful that they're going to be able to see me play in the Superdome, he said. The last time he played at the Superdome was last season, when Clemson lost the national championship to Louisiana State. This is his chance to make it right, he said. At this point I am kind of tired of talking about what I'm going to do with it, he said of the opportunity. I'm just grateful for it. I'm just ready to get to that point and just going to try to make it right. I'm just ready for the game. He graduated with a degree in sports communication this month and is expected to be picked early in the 2021 N.F.L. draft.

Ohio State's quarterback, who said that he likely sprained his thumb in the Big Ten Conference championship, connected with running back Trey Sermon on a long pass and then Sermon had another long run for the Buckeyes' first touchdown of the night.

Clemson Coach Dabo Swinney ranked Ohio State No. 11 in the most recent Amway Coaches Poll. Credit... Chris Graythen/Getty Images Dabo Swinney has infuriated plenty of people this year. He complained about Florida State canceling a game against Clemson because of coronavirus issues. He objected to the N.C.A.A. making Election Day a mandatory off-day. And so on. So it was only fitting that Clemson's coach would rank Ohio State, the No. 3 team in the playoff field, as No. 11 in the most recent Amway Coaches Poll. I didn't rank anybody who didn't play nine games or more in the top 10, Swinney said this week. Nobody. And then after that, I said, OK, anybody who played at all, that's how I will rank that group. And that's why they were 11. Swinney, of course, added all the appropriate caveats: that Ohio State was good enough to win the title, that the Buckeyes have a wonderful program, that it's nothing personal, that it's not gamesmanship. It's not that they're not good enough, Swinney said. I just don't think it's right that three teams have to play 13 games to be the champion and one team has to play eight. And he confessed he knew he'd be the poster child for that perspective, which is hardly an isolated one. I could probably run for governor in Michigan and might have a good chance, Swinney said, but probably not very popular in Ohio.

Ohio State Coach Ryan Day said this week that Clemson Defensive Coordinator Brent Venables seems to always know exactly what the other team is doing in terms of the plays that they're running. Why that is, I don't really know. But I can tell you that he's been doing it for a long time, Day added. Ohio State, unable to play more than six games this year because of coronavirus issues, has had to practice a variety of strategies for advancing the ball. This is going to be a stressful game because of all the stress that Clemson brings with their different looks, different formations, different fronts, coverages, pressures, twists, blitzes, said Kevin Wilson, Ohio State's offensive coordinator. Clemson's defense is ranked sixth overall in the Football Bowl Subdivision. Ohio State's is 34th. The Buckeyes defense lost top players in Chase Young and Jeff Okudah to the 2020 draft. This year, they have given up an average of 358 yards per game. But Tony Elliott, Clemson's offensive coordinator, expected Ohio State's best. Once they diagnose, they know their drop spots, their reading routes, Elliott said this week. A lot of this stuff is very similar to last year, with a difference — only difference is just the names and the faces. Elliott was not able to come to the Sugar Bowl because he tested positive for the coronavirus, Head Coach Dabo Swinney said Wednesday.

Ohio State quarterback Justin Fields did not play well the last time his team played Clemson. Credit... John Bazemore/Associated Press Justin Fields threw more interceptions than touchdowns the last time his Ohio State Buckeyes met Clemson. He's still one of the best quarterbacks in the college game, and although Ohio State struggled against Northwestern in the Big Ten championship game, a crucial wide receiver, Chris Olave, is back and could make life a lot easier for the team from Columbus. Brent Venables, Clemson's defensive coordinator, couldn't say enough good things about both players. Of Fields, who has passed for more than 5,000 yards in a college career that spanned Georgia and Ohio State: Can do it all. Can run. Can throw with precision. Run with strength and play with great poise. He's a great leader, very natural. Got an incredible skill set. Great presence in the pocket. And he's, without question, their leader on offense, so everything goes through him. Of Olave, a favored receiver for Fields: Can take the top off the defense, very savvy. Really understands the ball and can make all the competitive plays. He's got speed, length, size, toughness, savviness. Olave, of course, might not be the only issue for Clemson. Garrett Wilson leads the team with 621 receiving yards this season, and the tailback Trey Sermon averages 8 yards a carry. Read more\n\nLoad new posts
Women in Hollywood might have stepped to the fore in 2018, advocating for their rights and pressing for equal treatment and better representation, but new research finds that they are making little headway securing key positions in top films.\n\nWomen made up just 8 percent of directors on the top 250 films at the domestic box office last year, down from 11 percent the year before, according to a new report from the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University. The 2018 figure also represents a dip from 1998, when women made up 9 percent of directors on that year's top films.\n\nSmall gains were made in other key behind-the-scenes positions, the study found. Women accounted for a greater percentage of producers, executive producers, writers and editors, compared with that number in 2017. The biggest increases were seen in the number of editors (21 percent were women, compared with 16 percent the previous year) and writers (16 percent, up from 11 percent in 2017). Still, the 2018 figures represented just single-digit gains from 1998.\n\nA mere one percent of 2018's top films featured 10 or more women in the crucial behind-the-scenes roles. Those rare projects included Colette, starring Keira Knightley, which was directed by Wash Westmoreland but involved women as writers, producers and more. The study found that a quarter of the top films had either no women in key production jobs, or just one.
How do you create a trail map?\n\nFirst I go up in a plane or helicopter to get aerial photographs, or I get aerial photographs supplied by the mountain. Then I produce a black-and-white sketch from those photographs that show the mountain trails and its structures. I even draw in the shadows. Then I transfer it onto an illustration board and add in the color and details with watercolors. I like to show the mountain at the time of day when the shadows are just catching the snow. That way you can actually see the surface of the slopes.\n\nHave you ever messed up?\n\nOnce I had to go back and change the direction of the shadows. It was a cloudy day when they took the photos, and there was no Google Earth to check, so I had the shadows running the wrong way. It taught me to really be sure of where the sun is, even if it isn't showing up in my photographs. I go to great extremes to make sure the map is correct. Sometimes I ski the mountain, and the resort personnel, who know these mountains like the back of their hands, look it over.\n\nWhat is it like to be in the air taking photos of the ski areas?\n\nIt's a real thrill to fly so close to the mountain and to get a view that many don't get to see. One of my most enjoyable flights was at Grand Targhee in Wyoming [above]. It was a perfect day, no wind at all and nice sun, and the plane we took had windows from the knees down so you could look down. We were so close to the Grand Tetons that I remember looking at a snow bank and thinking, If I jumped out of this plane, I bet I'd live.

212-708-9400, moma.org\n\nMILLENNIUM: LOWER MANHATTAN IN THE 1990S' at the Skyscraper Museum (through April). This plucky Battery Park institution transports us back to the years of Rudy Giuliani, Lauryn Hill and 128-kilobit modems to reveal the enduring urban legacy of a decade bookended by recession and terror. In the wake of the 1987 stock-market crash, landlords in the financial district rezoned their old skyscrapers for residential occupancy, and more than 20 towers were landmarked, including the ornate Standard Oil building at 26 Broadway and the home of Delmonico's at 56 Beaver Street. Battery Park City flowered; yuppies priced out of Tribeca came down to Wall Street; a new Guggenheim, designed by a fresh-out-of-Bilbao Frank Gehry, nearly arose by South Street Seaport. From this distance the 1990s can seem almost like a golden age, not least given that, 16 years after 9/11, construction at the underwhelming new World Trade Center is still not finished.

With 133 drawings by the beyond-famous artist on loan from some 50 front-rank collections, this show is a curatorial coup and an art historical tour de force: a panoptic view of a titanic career as recorded in the most fragile of media: paper, chalk and ink. And it demands that you be fully present. Drawing is more than a graphic experience; it's a textural one, about the pressure of crayon and pen on a page; the subliminal fade and focus of lines; the weave and shadow-creating swells of surfaces. These are effects that can't be captured by a smartphone.\n\n(Holland Cotter)\n\n212-535-7710, metmuseum.org\n\n'THE VIETNAM WAR: 1945-1975' at the New-York Historical Society (through April 22).

With transgender rights in the news, this big group show on the concepts of trans and queer in art is ideally timed. A difficulty is that queer, and to some extent trans, are hard to capture, institutionally. They don't sit still. Trans is defined by the idea that the boundaries of gender (and race, and class) are porous, and that crossings in any direction are negotiable. Queer is even more category-averse. It's not so much a personal identity as a political impulse, a strategy for thwarting assimilation and sowing constructive chaos. Still, some excellent artists are on hand to tackle the subjects, which venture into trans-species territory with the artist Nayland Blake's bearlike fursona named Gnomen.
In deciding to eliminate General Suleimani, Mr. Trump and his team argue they were acting in self-defense to thwart imminent attacks on Americans in Iraq and the region. This may be true, as General Suleimani was a ruthless murderer and terrorist with much American blood on his hands. Unfortunately, it's hard to place confidence in the representations of an administration that lies almost daily about matters large and small and, even in this critical instance, failed to brief, much less consult, bipartisan leaders in Congress.\n\nSecond, even if the killing of General Suleimani is justified by self-defense, it doesn't make it strategically wise. Given the demonstrably haphazard and shortsighted nature of the Trump administration's national security decision-making process (including calling off strikes against Iran 10 minutes before impact, inviting the Taliban to Camp David and abandoning the Kurds), it's doubtful the administration spent much time gaming out the second and third order consequences of their action or preparing to protect American military and diplomatic personnel in the region.\n\nTo assess the fallout of killing General Suleimani, we must understand that the Iranian regime cannot survive internal dissent or sustain its powerful position in the region if it backs down from this provocation. For Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a strong response is essential. For the United States, the question is: What form will it take and how quickly will it come? One thing is clear: Americans are not safer, as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo argued on Fox News the morning after. Rather, American citizens are at greater risk of attack across a far wider battlefield than before.\n\nStart with Iraq. The State Department has warned American citizens not to travel there. Iranian-backed militias have attacked United States and allied installations, and can continue to do so around the country. The government in Baghdad has declared the killing a violation of the terms of the American military presence in Iraq. We will face mounting pressure to withdraw our military and diplomatic personnel from the country. If we leave, the United States will suffer a major strategic defeat: Iran will justifiably claim victory, and the gains of the fight against ISIS will be lost as the terrorist group rebuilds.\n\nThere is no hope now to revive, much less strengthen, the Iran nuclear deal, and we must expect Iran will accelerate its efforts to revive its nuclear program without constraint.
Want this email in your inbox each morning? Sign up here.\n\nTensions, and oil prices, rise after U.S. move against Iran\n\nAmerica's killing of Iran's top security and intelligence commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, this morning has sharply escalated tensions between Washington and Tehran. And markets are taking notice.\n\nU.S. officials said General Suleimani had been hit in a drone strike at Baghdad International Airport. He was the architect of nearly every significant operation by Iranian intelligence and military forces over the past two decades, the NYT notes. (Here's a smart long read on his importance.)\n\nCritics of the killing worry that it will cause huge trouble for the U.S. and allies like Israel, including putting America closer to war with Iran. Managing the trouble this strike seems likely to produce will further weaken the United States and entangle it in peripheral conflicts disconnected from U.S. security, said Daniel Davis, a senior fellow at Defense Priorities, a think tank in Washington.\n\nHow the markets are looking:\n\n• Oil prices were up 4 percent after news of the strike emerged, with Brent crude reaching nearly $70 a barrel.
But she and other European researchers have demonstrated that people with dementia can significantly improve their ability to do the tasks they've opted to tackle, their chosen priorities. Those improvements persist over months, perhaps up to a year, even as participants' cognition declines in other ways.\n\nThey want to be enabled to manage their lives, said Dr. Clare. It gives hope that they can handle everyday challenges.\n\nThis approach may represent the future for the growing number of older adults around the world with dementia. Trials of drugs to prevent or treat dementia have failed over and over. Even if some future treatment demonstrated effectiveness, millions of people and their stressed family caregivers need help now.\n\nWe can't wait another 20 years for some magic pill, said Laura Gitlin, dean of the College of Nursing and Health Professions at Drexel University. She has developed something called the Tailored Activity Program (T.A.P.), somewhat similar to cognitive rehab, which also brings occupational therapists into people's homes.\n\nWe're trying to lay the scientific basis for nonpharmacological approaches, Dr. Gitlin said. These studies signal that they can have powerful effects on peoples' lives.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, for instance, a government-supported trial involving 475 people with early-stage dementia found that after cognitive rehab, most participants attained their goals, while those in a control group did not, and they maintained improvement at three months and at nine months. (The study has not yet been published; Dr. Clare presented the results at a conference last year.)
[Follow our live score and game tracker of Alabama vs Ohio State.]\n\nSet aside, for just a moment, the coronavirus pandemic and all of the disruptions it dealt to the college football season — the week-to-week teetering, the postponements, the cancellations, the thousands of virus cases and the contact traces. Now consider the two teams that have ascended to a championship whose very staging will long be debated.\n\nThere is top-ranked Alabama, its front-runner status over the last dozen or so years so consistent that its presence in the title mix is as reassuringly familiar as it is mind numbing. And there is No. 3 Ohio State, the scarlet-and-gray power that upset mighty Clemson on Friday night and, despite the brash politicking that helped clear its path to the College Football Playoff, has sometimes wound up acting like some sort of 2020 upstart.\n\nThese are two programs that have been lifted and scarred through the years by expectation and ambition. Two programs with divergent paths through the pandemic to the game on Jan. 11 in Miami Gardens, Fla. But, in the end, two programs that got college football to precisely where mostly everyone figured a 2020 season, if it happened at all, would end: a final bout between blue bloods.\n\nOther ideas, like a playoff berth for Cincinnati, a Group of Five school, proved to be only notions, not probable outcomes. The central short-term dispute left to settle, then, is whether an Alabama team that grinded through a Southeastern Conference schedule and rolled to 12-0 with a Rose Bowl victory is better and more battle ready than an Ohio State team that played just six Big Ten games, including the league championship, and a semifinal and could be seen as fresh-legged, woefully inexperienced or both.
Adam and Brenda Elberg of Melville, N.Y., are not planning to move to nearby Dix Hills until later this year — their new house there is still under construction. But they've already gotten to know some of the other people moving in to their new neighborhood, Mr. Elberg said, meeting them during visits to the building site.\n\nNow he sees his future neighbors at school functions — the blue-ribbon Half Hollow Hills Central School District serves Melville and Dix Hills as well as a number of other communities. They are all young families with kids, said Mr. Elberg, 46, a father of four and an owner of Professional Physical Therapy, a chain of 63 offices.\n\nThe Elbergs are among the first 10 buyers at Oak Hill Estates, a development of 23 houses, starting at nearly $2 million, being built on one-acre lots on the former Dix Hills Golf Club public course. The Elbergs' six-bedroom five-and-a-half-bath house cost $2.24 million, not including upgrades.
They showed up in Mardi Gras headdresses, fedoras and tutus paired with combat boots. They drummed on darbukas, djembes and congas. And many of the performers at Sunday's GlobalFest also brought grievances with them along with their costumes and instruments: against occupation, the erasure of indigenous voices, walls.\n\nGlobalFest, which took over the Copacabana nightclub near Times Square for the first time this year, is an annual showcase of music from all corners of the earth. This year 12 acts performed overlapping sets on three stages in what proved a joyful and often raucous celebration of diversity and culture's uncanny knack for slipping through borders and stretching out roots underneath walls.\n\nAs such, the festival is an inherent act of defiance against any attempt to cement hierarchies.\n\nAt the same time, it complicates the notion of identity politics by demonstrating the composite nature of style. While the musicians' art was always fueled by tradition, their distinct sounds were almost invariably shaped by the clash — or serendipitous kiss — of difference.
The Headlines After Dark\n\nOvernight emails from the New York Times newsroom tell the story of a relentless year.\n\nImage Credit... Ashley Gilbertson for The New York Times\n\nIntroduction\n\nSui-Lee Wee and Donald McNeil gave us the breaking news that researchers in China have identified a new virus that is behind a mysterious pneumonialike illness that has caused a panic in the central Chinese region. 'There's no evidence that the virus, a coronavirus, is readily spread by humans, and it has not been tied to any deaths,' they write. 'But health officials in China and internationally are watching it carefully, as it comes from the same region where the deadly SARS epidemic broke out in the early 2000s.'\n\nSo reads a paragraph in an email sent on Jan. 9, 2020, at 2:08 a.m. The author of the email was Steve Kenny, the senior editor for nights at The New York Times; Sui-Lee Wee and Donald G. McNeil Jr. are Times reporters.\n\nFive nights a week, Mr. Kenny sends an email to many editors and reporters in New York and all over the world that recaps the news and prepares the dayside for the day ahead. The subject line of the email reads: Late note. Save for the occasional holiday flourish, it opens in nearly identical fashion each night: Good morning, all.\n\nThe time stamps are a catalog of the small hours: 1:14 a.m., 3:37 a.m., 4:12 a.m., 2:34 a.m. The emails are written and sent when a great many of us are in bed, dreaming, falling asleep or fallen asleep or trying to. Maybe we are cursing that late-afternoon cup of coffee, maybe beckoned to the bedroom of a panicky child, maybe just trying to calm a restive mind.\n\nThese emails are little chronicles of the world as it unfolds. They recount, in unadorned sentences largely free of affect, what happened on any given day. Some of these events will be forgotten. Many, especially this tumultuous year, will linger and scar.\n\nMr. Kenny also gives credit to the myriad reporters and editors responsible for the articles he mentions. Several of the bylines would be familiar to avid Times readers; the editors those reporters filed to and fought with and thanked likely are not. The list of names not only acknowledges the many people who produce The Times, it also serves as a testament to the hugeness of the world and the number of observers it takes to record, faithfully, the news.\n\nIt is, of course, impossible to sum up a year — this one, more than most. It was grim and it was sobering and it was, at its heart, unbelievable. Any one of the major stories of the past 12 months would have riveted us. Any one of them felt like the story of a lifetime. The coronavirus pandemic. The killing of George Floyd and the protests and raw reckoning that followed. The wildfires that turned Western skies red with fury and razed whole towns. A deeply divisive presidential election and the bitter efforts to undo it.\n\nHere, in the collection of lightly edited emails that follow, are the very beginnings of those stories. 1:36 a.m., 4:14 a.m., 5:22 a.m. Time of third-shifters and insomniacs.\n\nThe notes recorded the deaths of so many, from Covid-19 and other illnesses and acts of violence. The emails document, frequently with just a few words, the work of firefighters and doctors and school cafeteria cooks — or, more often, the harrowing work they were about to face.\n\nStrangely enough, in a year that yielded one blaring headline after the next, there is no single headline to encompass what we have just lived through. Instead, there are notes, sent late, and there are vivid photographs. Make of them what you will, for 2020 — the same shorthand for clear vision — had, at once, the sheer weight of history and the intimacy that reminds us of what it means to be alive.\n\n— Ethan Hauser
Our guide to new art shows — and some that will be closing soon.\n\n'MAX BECKMANN IN NEW YORK' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Feb. 20). In the last two years of his life, the great German Expressionist Max Beckmann lived in New York.

RICHMOND, N ew South Wales — I thought I would come to Australia and learn to surf. Instead, I learned to walk.\n\nMore precisely, I lumbered, jogged, waddled and generally humiliated my way around a track as I tried — and failed — to keep up with the world's most exceptional race walker.\n\nThat walker, Heather Lee, is 92 years old. She holds five world records and eight Australian ones for racewalking. She is the New South Wales Senior Australian of the Year. And she has big plans for 2019 — namely, breaking her own best times — so she does not kid around when it comes to working out.\n\nMs. Lee trains at least three days a week. Wednesdays are reserved for interval training with her coach, Liz de Vries. I never know what horrors she has in store for me, Ms. Lee said. But I'm turning back the clock as far as speed's concerned.
Good morning.\n\n(Here's the sign-up, if you don't already get California Today by email.)\n\nAs tensions continued to escalate between the U.S. and Iran over the weekend following the killing of Iran's top security and intelligence commander by an American military strike, worries about a draft rose among young people and antiwar protesters demonstrated in the streets in cities across the country.\n\n[Read the latest updates on Iran and the U.S.]\n\nThat includes in San Francisco, where protesters marched down Market Street, and in San Jose, where The Mercury News reported that hundreds of Bay Area residents — a mix of college students, Chicano Brown Berets and other activists — gathered in front of City Hall on Saturday.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported that at least 200 people held signs bearing messages like No War or sanctions on Iran … and chanted No More War, as they marched through downtown.\n\nAs my colleague Jose Del Real reported, Southern California is home to the largest Iranian community outside of Iran. And in the heart of the enclave known as Tehrangeles, near U.C.L.A., feelings were mixed.
In a hospital in Minnesota, Carrol Amrich's mother was dying.\n\nIn Pueblo, Colo., a thousand miles away, Ms. Amrich was frantically trying to get there in time to say goodbye.\n\nHolding a United Airlines ticket purchased for her by her landlord, she probably would have. But minutes before departure, already buckled into her seat, she was ordered to leave the plane. The gate agent told her that her reservation had been canceled. Traveler Help Desk, the online agency that sold the ticket, had rescinded it because the landlord made a change directly through United — even though United had assured the landlord that it was not a problem to do so.\n\nUnable to fly, Ms. Amrich drove through the night, not stopping even to use the bathroom. Her sister, in the hospital room, held a phone to their mother's ear, and Ms. Amrich begged her to hold on.\n\nShe was still driving when her cellphone rang again. Her mother was dead.\n\nI cried the whole way from Pueblo, Ms. Amrich said in a phone interview on Jan. 18, two days after her mother died. I've been awake for two days. I haven't had anything to eat in two days.
It's been an eventful week for Wardell Jackson, an officer for the Capitol Police in Jackson, Miss. On Monday, he was fired from his job. On Wednesday, he was told he could return — after he waits out a weeklong suspension without pay.\n\nHe found himself in this predicament after a confrontation he had on Saturday with several people who were waving the official Mississippi state flag — the only one in the United States that includes a likeness of the Confederate battle flag.\n\nOfficer Jackson, 57, was on duty outside the new civil rights museum in downtown Jackson when he encountered a group of people lining up to participate in the annual Dixie National Livestock Show and Rodeo parade. They were marching in support of the state flag, but some participants displayed Confederate battle flags.\n\nA few marchers tried to take photographs with their flags in front of the sign behind the museum, but Officer Jackson urged them to move away. A verbal argument broke out.
Rosenda Monteros, a Mexican actress remembered for her turn as one of the few women in John Sturges's classic western The Magnificent Seven, died on Dec. 29 at her home in Mexico.\n\nA spokeswoman for her family, who is also a representative for the National Theater Company of Mexico, said the cause was pelvic cancer. The spokeswoman said Ms. Monteros was 86, although according to Spanish-language news media accounts and other sources she was 83.\n\nMs. Monteros, a successful actress in Mexican theater, films and television for more than five decades, played a small but important part in The Magnificent Seven, the 1960 remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1954 film Seven Samurai. In the Hollywood version, seven gunslingers are hired by local farmers to defend their Mexican village from bandits.\n\nThe movie had an all-star cast, with Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, Horst Buchholz, Robert Vaughn, Brad Dexter and James Coburn as the seven gunmen and Eli Wallach as the leader of the bandits. The film featured a stirring and now instantly recognizable theme, composed by Elmer Bernstein.
A senior administration official said a severe but unspecified threat against the embassy was the reason that Mr. Trump made the decision to kill General Suleimani.\n\nYet no major attack against the sprawling and heavily-fortified diplomatic compound in Baghdad's Green Zone is imminent, even though Mr. Pompeo has asserted that repeatedly, said the official, who discussed administration deliberations only on the condition of anonymity. Some Pentagon officials had said earlier that there was no intelligence revealing any unusual threats.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Pompeo did not repeat his assertions that the United States had intelligence about an imminent attack and instead pointed to recent violent episodes.\n\nIf you're looking for imminence, you need look no further than the days that led up to the strike that was taken against Suleimani, Mr. Pompeo said, apparently referring to the rocket attack by an Iranian-backed militia that killed an American interpreter, Nawres Hamid, in Iraq on Dec. 27. The Americans then carried out airstrikes that killed 25 militiamen, which led to protests by mostly Iranian-backed militiamen inside the American Embassy compound in Baghdad.\n\nAmerican officials say that over the last two months, there have been 11 attacks by Iran-backed militias on bases in Iraq where American service members, diplomats and contractors work.\n\nCritics say Mr. Pompeo, the only surviving member of the president's original foreign policy team, is a chief architect of the rising tensions between the United States and Iran.\n\nAs Mr. Trump's first C.I.A. director, he created a special center to deal with Iran, appointing as its head Michael D'Andrea, a veteran officer and convert to Islam known as the Dark Prince, who oversaw the hunt for Osama bin Laden and the drone strike campaign in the Middle East and Central Asia.
RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazilians signaled a desire for a radical shift in the country's course when they elected the far-right lawmaker Jair Bolsonaro as their next president in October.\n\nIt didn't take long for profound changes to start taking hold.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to Mr. Bolsonaro's swearing-in on Tuesday, his embrace of a conservative movement that rejects discussion of gender or sexual orientation in schools thrust classrooms to the front lines of culture wars.\n\nUnder his direction, Brazil pulled out of hosting the 2019 United Nations summit meeting on climate change and began backtracking from its role as a global exemplar of environmentally sustainable development.\n\nAnd on the foreign policy front, Mr. Bolsonaro courted the United States and picked a fight with Cuba, which responded by rescinding a program that had sent Cuban doctors to remote corners of Brazil since 2013.
PASADENA, Calif. — In mid-August, after prolonged vacillation, Southern California Coach Clay Helton declared the junior Max Browne his starting quarterback. Browne, once a top-ranked recruit, had waited his turn behind Cody Kessler, and the decision generated minimal dissent among Trojans fans.\n\nThree games into the season, Helton changed his mind. Out went Browne, and in came the freshman Sam Darnold. U.S.C. went on a tear, closing out its regular-season schedule with eight consecutive wins.\n\nDarnold tacked an exclamation point onto an improbable debut season on Monday by guiding U.S.C. (10-3) to a pulsating 52-49 Rose Bowl win over Penn State (11-3).\n\nPossessing uncommon mobility for a 6-foot-4 passer and an array of receivers with sprinter speed and flypaper hands, Darnold threw for 453 yards and five touchdowns, including three to Deontay Burnett, in a back-and-forth game that will be remembered as one of the best iterations in the bowl's 103-year history.
SAN FRANCISCO — Since the 2016 election, when Russian trolls and a tsunami of misinformation turned social media into a partisan battlefield, Facebook has wrestled with the role it played in President Trump's victory.\n\nNow, according to a memo obtained by The New York Times, a longtime Facebook executive has told employees that the company had a moral duty not to tilt the scales against Mr. Trump as he seeks re-election.\n\nOn Dec. 30, Andrew Bosworth, the head of Facebook's virtual and augmented reality division, wrote on his internal Facebook page that, as a liberal, he found himself wanting to use the social network's powerful platform against Mr. Trump. But citing the Lord of the Rings franchise and the philosopher John Rawls, Mr. Bosworth said that doing so would eventually backfire.\n\nI find myself desperately wanting to pull any lever at my disposal to avoid the same result, he wrote. So what stays my hand? I find myself thinking of the Lord of the Rings at this moment.
Women have also gained a critical mass in Congress, able to shape the debate over abortion rights, since a quota law first reserved a third of legislative seats for them in the 1990s, and was later expanded to require parity.\n\nIn this latest vote, and victory, legislators framed abortion rights as a matter of social justice and of public health — dozens of women die a year seeking abortions, according to Argentina's Access to Safe Abortion Network.\n\nLawmakers who changed their votes this time around to support legalization acknowledged that such framing had a big effect.\n\nWe're going through a shift in paradigm, and this change is led by the feminist and environmental fights, said Silvina García Larraburu, a senator from the southern Rio Negro province who voted against legalization in 2018 but for it this time. Beyond my personal position, of my beliefs, we are faced with a problem that requires a public health approach.\n\nThat framing also made the effort politically palatable for President Alberto Fernández, a leftist law professor elected in 2019, to make legalizing abortion a campaign promise and an early legislative priority.\n\nIn Argentina, safe abortion exists for those who can pay for it, said Vilma Ibarra, the president's legal and technical secretary, who drafted the bill. Those who can't must go through very difficult conditions.\n\nArgentine feminists took up the cause of abortion rights as far back as the 1980s, but the issue found little political traction at a time when democracy itself seemed fragile in the aftermath of the military dictatorship, and when religious conservatism had a heavy hold on public debate.

NASA Blue Marble imagery\n\nThe crack in Larsen C now reaches over 100 miles in length, and some parts of it are as wide as two miles. The tip of the rift is currently only about 20 miles from reaching the other end of the ice shelf.\n\nOnce the crack reaches all the way across the ice shelf, the break will create one of the largest icebergs ever recorded, according to Project Midas, a research team that has been monitoring the rift since 2014. Because of the amount of stress the crack is placing on the remaining 20 miles of the shelf, the team expects the break soon.\n\n50 MILES Thin sea ice Ice shelf 820 FEET DEEP 900 FEET Rift seen from space Sentinel-1 SAR imagery | Captured Jan. 27 Photo by John Sonntag | Captured Nov. 10 50 MILES Thin sea ice Ice shelf 820 FEET DEEP 900 FEET Rift seen from space Sentinel-1 SAR imagery | Captured Jan. 27 Photo by John Sonntag | Captured Nov. 10 Rift seen from space 50 MILES Ice shelf 820 FEET DEEP Thin sea ice Sentinel-1 SAR imagery | Captured Jan. 27 900 FEET Photo by John Sonntag | Captured Nov. 10 Rift seen from space 50 MILES Ice shelf 820 FEET DEEP Thin sea ice Sentinel-1 SAR imagery | Captured Jan. 27 900 FEET Photo by John Sonntag | Captured Nov. 10\n\nThe iceberg is likely to break free within the next few months, said Adrian J. Luckman of Swansea University in Wales, who is a lead researcher for Project Midas. The rift tip has moved from one region of likely softer ice to another, which explains its step-wise progress.\n\nThe time-lapse image below shows the rift gradually widening from late 2014 to January of this year.\n\nCurrent rift extent Area of detail\n\nSentinel-1 SAR imagery\n\nIce shelves, which form through runoff from glaciers, float in water and provide structural support to the glaciers that rest on land. When an ice shelf collapses, the glaciers behind it can accelerate toward the ocean. Higher temperatures in the region are also helping to further the ice shelf's retreat.\n\nIf the ice shelf breaks at the crack, Larsen C will be at its smallest size ever recorded.\n\nThat would also leave the ice front much closer to the ice shelf's compressive arch, a line that scientists say is critical for structural support. If the front retreats past that line, scientists say, the northernmost part of the shelf could collapse within months. It could also significantly change the landscape of the Antarctic peninsula.\n\nAt that point in time, the glaciers will react, said Eric J. Rignot, a glaciologist, professor at University of California Irvine and a senior scientist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. If the ice shelf breaks apart, it will remove a buttressing force on the glaciers that flow into it. The glaciers will feel less resistance to flow, effectively removing a cork in front of them.\n\nThe crack reaches all the way to the bottom of the ice shelf.\n\nThe crack in Larsen C is a third of a mile deep, down to the floor of the ice shelf.\n\nShelf front Area of detail Current rift extent 0 miles wide 0.1 0.2 0.3 1.8 2.0 The maximum width of the rift is about 2 miles Top of the ice shelf 190 feet above sea level Floating ice The depth of the rift is about 1,750 feet Water below the ice shelf Shelf front Area of detail Current rift extent 0 miles wide 0.1 0.2 1.8 2.0 0.3 The maximum width of the rift is about 2 miles Top of the ice shelf 190 feet above sea level Floating ice The depth of the rift is about 1,750 feet Water below the ice shelf Shelf front Area of detail Current rift extent 0 miles wide 0.3 0.1 0.2 1.8 2.0 The maximum width of the rift is about 2 miles Top of the ice shelf 190 feet above sea level Floating ice The depth of the rift is about 1,750 feet Water below the ice shelf\n\nScientists fear that two crucial anchor points will be lost as the shelf retreats.\n\nAccording to Dr. Rignot, the stability of the whole ice shelf is threatened.\n\nYou have these two anchors on the side of Larsen C that play a critical role in holding the ice shelf where it is, he said. If the shelf is getting thinner, it will be more breakable and it will lose contact with the ice rises.\n\nLow shelf support High Bawden Ice Rise If the shelf front disconnects from the ice rises, a rapid retreat will be triggered. Gipps Ice Rise Current rift extent Larsen C Ice Shelf High Low shelf support Bawden Ice Rise If the shelf front disconnects from the ice rises, a rapid retreat will be triggered. Gipps Ice Rise Current rift extent Larsen C Ice Shelf Low shelf support High Bawden Ice Rise If the shelf front disconnects from the ice rises, a rapid retreat will be triggered. Current rift extent Gipps Ice Rise Larsen C Ice Shelf\n\nIce rises are islands that are overriden by the ice shelf, allowing them to shoulder more support of the shelf. Scientists have yet to determine the extent of thinning around the Bawden and Gipps ice rises, though Dr. Rignot noted that the Bawden ice rise was a much more vulnerable anchor.\n\nWe're not even sure how it's hanging on there, he said. But if you take away Bawden, the whole shelf will feel it.\n\nThe collapse of the Larsen C ice shelf may not sharply affect global sea level rise, but the collapse of other vulnerable ice shelves will.\n\nThe Larsen A and B ice shelves disintegrated in 1995 and 2002, though both were drastically smaller than Larsen C. Neither contributed significantly to global sea level rise, however, because they were already floating above water, and the glaciers behind them did not contain a substantial volume of ice.
A basketball star took a sabbatical to help free a man she believed was wrongly convicted. Residents of a neighborhood in Mobile, Ala., sought to raise the sunken Clotilda, the last slave ship to reach the United States, as a way of reconnecting with their ancestors. Chinese railroad workers were finally recognized for the pivotal role they played in the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad.\n\nAt a time when disinformation, hate crimes, inequality and white supremacy seem to be on the rise, stories like these helped amplify the voices of the unheard and raise awareness about efforts across the country to curb the rising tide of racial injustice. They were stories about bravery and celebrating difference. They were stories that provided a little dose of optimism.\n\nIf you have a story that gives you hope as you head into 2020, email it to us at racerelated@nytimes.com.
Next up from the winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature: More oldies.\n\nBob Dylan announced on Tuesday that his new album, Triplicate, will be a three-disc set comprising 30 more standards, extending the theme of his last two albums, Shadows in the Night (2015) and Fallen Angels (2016). The collection, to be released by Columbia Records on March 31, includes classics from the golden age of American songwriting like Stormy Weather, Sentimental Journey, I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plans, September of My Years and The Best Is Yet to Come. As with Mr. Dylan's previous two albums, many of the songs are closely associated with Frank Sinatra.\n\nIt also includes Hoagy Carmichael's Stardust, the title track from Willie Nelson's 1978 album of standards, which Mr. Dylan told AARP The Magazine in 2015 first gave him the idea to pursue such a project. Triplicate is divided into three thematic segments of 10 songs each: 'Til the Sun Goes Down, Devil Dolls and Comin' Home Late. Mr. Dylan is the producer, listed under his pseudonym Jack Frost.\n\nMr. Dylan was chosen last year as the winner of the Nobel in Literature, but did not attend the awards ceremony in December. The Swedish Academy, the group that bestows the award, said only that Mr. Dylan had told them he had pre-existing commitments.
The Trump administration had said 20 million people would be vaccinated by the end of 2020. The figure was closer to four million.\n\nWe are at a pace right now to deliver vaccines in L.A. over five years, instead of over half a year, Mr. Garcetti said on the CBS program Face the Nation. He criticized the Trump administration for not planning ahead by training more medical workers to administer the vaccine, and for not giving enough assistance to state and local governments.\n\nThe federal government can't tell the local governments and state governments to do something and not give us aid, he said.\n\nCongress passed a stimulus package on Dec. 27 that will provide $9 billion toward vaccination costs, on top of $340 million that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sent to the states in September and December. But the new funds will arrive long after local health departments — already overburdened with mass testing and contact tracing efforts — had to begin planning for and administering vaccines.
All this, and peak fire season is only just beginning.\n\nAs I write, a state of emergency has been declared in New South Wales and a state of disaster in Victoria, mass evacuations are taking place, a humanitarian catastrophe is feared, and towns up and down the east coast are surrounded by fires, all transport and most communication links cut, their fate unknown.\n\nAn email that the retired engineer Ian Mitchell sent to friends on New Year's Day from the small northern Victoria community of Gipsy Point speaks for countless Australians at this moment of catastrophe:\n\nAll\n\nwe and most of Gipsy Point houses still here as of now. We have 16 people in Gipsy pt.\n\nNo power, no phone no chance of anyone arriving for 4 days as all roads blocked. Only satellite email is working We have 2 bigger boats and might be able to get supplies 'esp fuel at Coota.\n\nWe need more able people to defend the town as we are in for bad heat from Friday again. Tucks area will be a problem from today, but trees down on all tracks, and no one to fight it.\n\nWe are tired, but ok.\n\nBut we are here in 2020!\n\nLove\n\nUs\n\nThe bookstore in the fire-ravaged village of Cobargo, New South Wales, has a new sign outside: Post-Apocalyptic Fiction has been moved to Current Affairs.\n\nAnd yet, incredibly, the response of Australia's leaders to this unprecedented national crisis has been not to defend their country but to defend the fossil fuel industry, a big donor to both major parties — as if they were willing the country to its doom. While the fires were exploding in mid-December, the leader of the opposition Labor Party went on a tour of coal mining communities expressing his unequivocal support for coal exports. The prime minister, the conservative Scott Morrison, went on vacation to Hawaii.
Today's announcement is a great step for the future prosperity of the entire metropolitan region, Tom Wright, the president of the Regional Plan Association, an urban policy group, said in a statement. We are pleased to see a comprehensive plan that encompasses not only the station itself, but also the district surrounding it.\n\nBut some urban planners said the plan was not bold enough and focusing on Midtown Manhattan as a nexus of commuter rail service fails to recognize shifting commuter patterns in New York.\n\nInvesting heavily in the new Penn Station terminal is hindering the development of other parts of the city, said Jim Venturi, an urban planner and founder of ReThink NYC, a transportation design firm.\n\nMr. Venturi believes a better plan would be to redesign existing tracks and to widen platforms, rather than construct new tracks, to allow trains to cross midtown for other areas of the city. A New Jersey Transit train, for instance, could travel through Penn Station all the way to Long Island City in Queens.\n\nThe current plan is a really an out-of-date way of seeing the city, he said.\n\nState officials have said that having commuter trains cross into parts of New York is a possibility in the future and have also emphasized the importance of suburban trains connecting to subway lines in existing stations.\n\nTo build the additional tracks, Mr. Cuomo said the state would seek to acquire property south of Penn Station, parts of which are owned by Amtrak and the Archdiocese of New York. The process of acquiring the property and the planning for the expansion is expected to take around two years before construction can begin, state officials said.\n\nMr. Cuomo said he was also exploring converting the Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden, which sits atop the train hub, into a new entrance to the station, increasing access and bringing more light into the terminal.
Iran expanded its stockpile of low enriched uranium beyond the nuclear deal's limit of 300 kilograms, conducted research that could enable it to build more advanced centrifuges, exceeded the previous limits on the level of enrichment, and started operating centrifuges in a hardened bunker near the city of Qom — but it stopped short of exiting the agreement entirely.\n\nAll of these steps have been reversible, since the Iranians hoped they would either force President Trump to accept a new deal that would lift the American sanctions on Iran — he seemed to consider that seriously when he came close to meeting with President Hassan Rouhani of Iran last September — or get European leaders to provide financial compensation. Now any such deal seems impossible.\n\nThe resumption of previously frozen Iranian nuclear activities — uranium enrichment to the more dangerous level of 20 percent, a significant step toward weapons-grade levels, or resuming construction on the plutonium-producing heavy water reactor could dramatically reduce the time necessary for Iran to acquire the material needed to build a nuclear weapon. The nuclear deal's restrictions, now abandoned, had established a threshold of at least a year.\n\nIran's nuclear expansion would force the Trump administration to either accept the risk that Tehran acquires a nuclear weapons capability — an ironic outcome of leaving the allegedly bad nuclear deal — or it will have to conduct military strikes to prevent it and initiate the conflict it claims it wants to avoid.\n\nIranian leaders understand that a dash for a bomb would provoke international opposition and garner support for military strikes. Tehran is likely to take incremental steps and raise the bar for an American response.\n\nUnder the nuclear deal, it would have been many years before Iran could increase enrichment, the size of its uranium stockpile or the number of its centrifuges. By destroying a deal that it claimed did not last long enough or impose enough restrictions on Iran's nuclear program, the Trump administration has created a situation in which Iran may soon end up with no nuclear restrictions at all.\n\nSome Americans may see Iran's nuclear expansion as an opportunity to take military action against the Iranian regime. When he was a member of Congress, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo argued the United States could destroy the Iranian nuclear capacity with under 2,000 sorties and it was not an insurmountable task.
If the Knicks had hoped that Sunday afternoon's game against the San Antonio Spurs would be a return to a semblance of normalcy, that notion did not last long.\n\nInstead, with less than four minutes gone in the first quarter, the Knicks' owner, James L. Dolan, who has been in the middle of the most recent chaos, sat down at his usual courtside seat at Madison Square Garden. But rather than just sitting with his chief spokesman, Barry Watkins, as usual, Dolan was flanked by two former Knicks stars — Bernard King and Latrell Sprewell — with another alumnus, Larry Johnson, just one seat away.\n\nThat Sprewell, of all people, was alongside Dolan seemed both curious and calculating. He had a dramatic falling out with the Knicks and Dolan after he was traded in 2003, including an obscenity-laced tirade directed at Dolan on his first visit back to the Garden as a visiting player.\n\nNow 46 and retired, he had not been back to the Garden in more than a dozen years, but there he was on Sunday. As were King and Johnson, and a number of other Knicks from the past.

Happy New Year! After a year punctuated by a pandemic and unemployment, cities around the world are celebrating 2020's end. Credit Credit... Matthew Abbott for The New York Times Every year on Dec. 31, the approach of midnight finds us drawing a line in time. The way we do this varies — we eat black-eyed peas, or fling open the windows, or run into an icy ocean — but the idea is always the same. On this night, we put something behind us and seal it off, so it is part of the past. And then we try to begin again. It is difficult to imagine any year when our need of this ritual has been greater. Many of us have lost those dearest to us, and absorbed those losses in isolation. Livelihoods have been wiped away like vapor from a window. And yet, without the fireworks, the giddiness of crowds, we have never been so constrained in our rituals. That does not mean we are not celebrating. Inside lighted rooms, we raised glasses to the people who sacrificed for us, to the triumphant performance of our health care workers, and to a thousand small kindnesses already receding from memory. Yeah, yeah, the end of a year may be an illusion, just a way to trick ourselves into keeping going. But we made it.\n\nEmbracing the theme of 2020, people keep their gatherings small.

Emily Kask for The New York Times In the grip of a pandemic that has disrupted lives, the economy and even milestones, many Americans eschewed the customary trappings of New Year's Eve festivities for subdued observances, much as they have spent much of 2020 — away from loved ones, in virtual settings or alone. Replaced were the soirees of previous years, the prix fixe dinner seatings, open bars and streets crowded with revelers. Times Square was empty, a most jarring image of how so much has changed since the last ball drop. In another Manhattan — Manhattan Beach, Calif. — Kara Maeda and her two roommates said they were content to spend a low-key night at home, drinking White Claw and eating sushi. They said the past year had changed their perspective and priorities. This year, Ms. Maeda said, we really slowed down and think about what really matters. Ms. Maeda, 26, a marketing analyst, said she was eager to turn the page of the calendar. We were like, bye. See you never, she said. It's definitely good riddance, 2020. In New Orleans, April Lee Fields, an artist who dabbles in witchcraft, gathered with four friends. She said they planned to draw tarot cards and livestream spoken-word poetry and songs, along with making a fire to burn away things they wanted to rid themselves of. You can call it witchcraft if you want or just being a conscious human being, she said. Ms. Fields, 33, said she would never take everyday things for granted again after the pandemic, from air travel to large gatherings. I value my independence, she said. With a pandemic, that's put a restriction on that. Ms. Fields said that earlier on Thursday she spoke to relatives and friends in England on Zoom. But some New Year's Eve traditions were not broken, like when a friend asked her if they were getting dressed up. I was like, mate, we just spent a year in our pajamas, Ms. Fields said. We're going to dress up. In Denver, Alison Stine, a novelist and journalist who moved from Ohio in August, shared a similar mantra. I put on makeup for the first time in a long time, Ms. Stine said. Earlier in the evening, Ms. Stine helped organize a Zoom call to celebrate the birthday of her son, Henry, who turned 10 on Thursday. It's been really hard moving in a pandemic, especially for him to make friends, Ms. Stine said. It's really hard to meet new people over the computer. Ms. Stine, 42, said her son wore a funny hat and played the video game Among Us with his friends. Later in the night, they planned to light sparklers and eat takeout sushi, her son's favorite. That's what we have right now, she said, these small moments.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nConfetti falls on a deserted Times Square as New York forges ahead. Few people were allowed into the annual New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square. Credit... Johnny Milano for The New York Times The minute before midnight in Times Square was almost unrecognizable as New York City closed out one of the most difficult and wrenching years in its history. This time there were dozens — not hundreds of thousands — of voices counting down from 10 seconds. Confetti still rained down, but the multicolored strips landed primarily on the pavement rather than people's shoulders. Instead of a steady rumble of cheers and screams, there were infrequent cries of happiness amid the booms of fireworks. But the muted celebration did not ruin the palpable excitement of visitors in the area. Alexis Hurley of Hell's Kitchen grew emotional on a nearby street as midnight approached. This has honestly been the worst year of my life and a lot of my friends' lives, Ms. Hurley said. It's just this relief and hope that things will get better. In the hour before 2021 started on the East Coast, Pitbull, Jennifer Lopez and Andra Day were announced to the stage at Times Square to relative silence. Outside a nearby hotel where performances could be spotted on a digital screen, small clusters of about 70 people total were gathered to catch a glimpse of the acts. Beth Calve, 60, and her daughter, Lily, were among the crowd and debating whether to brace for the frigid temperatures until the ball dropped. They ultimately chose to stay. In a typical year, Ms. Calve said, the two would be building gingerbread houses and playing games at their home in New Jersey. But this time, because of the smaller crowds, they decided to spend the evening near Times Square. (The two had tried to persuade officers to let them past the entrance to no avail.) I just want Covid to finally be over, she said. I don't even know what else I'm hoping for. It's just that. Blocks from Times Square, streets were filled with energy as New Yorkers and tourists carried silver and gold balloons. A crowd around one saxophone player threw sparklers onto the ground; farther down the street, people danced to Raise Your Glass by Pink. The end of a year as dark as 2020 merited a celebration.\n\nNo Rose Parade: Southern California laments the loss of a tradition.

Michael Owen Baker/Associated Press For just about every New Year's Day since 1958, Carla Hall has situated herself on a patch of asphalt in front of a car dealership in downtown Pasadena, Calif. To a 10-year-old girl, it was the perfect spot to watch the majesty unfold — the artistry she calls it, of the floats and the marching bands, the beauty queens and horses. All that love that goes into it, Ms. Hall, 72, said this week, tearing up at the memories. I'm going to start crying, sorry. In a small gesture of defiance in the face of trying times, she will be there this year, too, wearing her mask, and marking her spot, as usual, with chalk and tape. Of course, there will be no Rose Parade, a Southern California institution that began in 1890. It was canceled months ago, just like everything else. But now its absence is finally here, to officially enter the ledger of things lost to the coronavirus pandemic. Even the superlatives that have attached themselves to the parade (America's New Year Celebration) and the accompanying football game (The Granddaddy of Them All) don't seem to fully capture what the day has meant to Ms. Hall: family, community, tradition, something to rely on. For Ms. Hall, a substitute teacher who has not worked since March, who has lost friends to the coronavirus, and who has seen two of her grandchildren catch the virus and recover, the loss of the parade feels like a metaphor for grief itself. See you at the Rose Parade, is what everyone said to everyone, every year. The only other time the parade was canceled was during World War II, amid fears that the West Coast could be attacked by Japan. Even on New Year's Day in 1919, with an influenza pandemic raging out of control but overshadowed by World War I, the parade went on, as unwise as that was. As a placeholder in the parade's long history, there will be a television special this year — filmed in recent weeks in strict accordance with virus protocols — for which Ms. Hall was interviewed. The Rose Bowl football game was moved to Arlington, Texas. Robert B. Miller, who has volunteered for the Tournament of Roses Association for almost 40 years, and was named president in 2020, said the association would donate money it would have used to host the parade to food banks and organizations working to close the gap in access to broadband between rich and poor schools. My priorities have always been my family, my work and the Tournament of Roses, said Mr. Miller, who will be on the sideline in Texas for the Rose Bowl, dressed in his traditional red sports jacket. He said he hoped the television special would serve as a means to help people process what's happening, be grateful for what they have and where they are going and know that the world will return to something much more akin to what we all experienced before.\n\nEurope roundup A locked-down Europe bids a subdued good riddance to an awful year. Brandenburg Gate shortly after fireworks exploded to usher in the new year. Credit... Pool photo by John Macdougall To ring out a year the world wishes had been an illusion, the biggest event in Paris really was one. It is called, perhaps optimistically, Welcome to the Other Side. From within a virtual Notre-Dame Cathedral — a resurrected, reimagined version of the fire-gutted treasure — the city livestreamed a computer-generated concert and light show, with no one actually inside the cavernous landmark, and no crowd outside. Most people now living have never seen a year that Europe, like much of the world, was so eager to bid good riddance to — or so unable to send off with any fanfare. Vaccines are the first real rays of hope, but the coronavirus still reigns unchecked, a new variant is stoking new fears, and much of the continent is under some form of lockdown. Concerts? Canceled. Crowds and parties? Banned. Staying out all night? Don't even think about it. Across Europe, where Covid-19 has killed almost 600,000 people, cities and nations sent the message that the only acceptable place to spend New Year's Eve was at home, and they tried to arrange enough spectacle broadcast or online to keep people there.

So please leave the parties for later in the year. In a televised address from the Élysée Palace, President Emmanuel Macron of France — recovering from his own bout of the virus — said that the year 2020 ends as it unfolded: with efforts and restrictions. In Berlin , the traditional TV broadcast from the Brandenburg Gate went off without fireworks or live spectators. It is one of 56 popular New Year's Eve spots around the city that the authorities were closing overnight in the hopes of dissuading outdoor gatherings, which are prohibited. Indoor get-togethers were limited to five adults from no more than two households. The sale of private fireworks, a tradition for the holiday Germans call Sylvester because it is the feast day of St. Sylvester, was banned — though some went off, anyway. It is necessary that this be the probably quietest New Year's Eve that Germany can remember, said Jens Spahn, the country's health minister.\n\nInstead of its annual outdoor live concert, Rome substituted a celebration streamed online, with a range of performances, and a hard-to-describe event, part concert, part light show and part stargazing, titled How to Hear the Universe in a Spider/Web. With Italy under a 10 p.m. curfew and the traditional New Year's Eve fireworks banned, President Sergio Mattarella said in his annual address that the pandemic had changed the country, sharpening the fragilities of the past, aggravating old inequalities and generating new ones.\n\nIn Geneva , fireworks around Lake Geneva (also known as Lac Leman) at the heart of the city were canceled, and bars and restaurants were closed, though restrictions on private gatherings were eased from five to 10 people. Many residents of the quiet city had departed for Swiss ski resorts that remained open — much to the chagrin of neighboring European countries who have opted to shutter their slopes to prevent the further spread of coronavirus cases.\n\nIn London , Big Ben, largely silent in recent years as its clock tower underwent renovations, rang 12 times at midnight, one of the few standout moments in a country where major celebrations were canceled. For most Britons, getting together with anyone outside their own households was forbidden, a rule backed up by a fine of up to 1,000 pounds, or more than $1,300.\n\nMadrid eased its curfew for the night from midnight to 1:30 a.m., which would usually count as early for a night out in Spain, but the traditional gathering in the Puerta del Sol square was canceled. People were told to stay at home as much as possible, eating the traditional New Year's Eve grapes while watching events on TV, and gathering in groups of no more than six.\n\nAnd in Paris, the only people roaming the Champs-Élysées — where just a year ago, some 300,000 people assembled for a huge fireworks display — were some of the 100,000 police officers deployed around the country to prevent crowds from gathering. City officials urged people to watch the virtual Notre-Dame concert by the electronic music artist Jean-Michel Jarre, an event bridging the ancient and the modern, the old year and the new, the pandemic and the hope that it will end. It would be a message of hope and a tribute to Notre-Dame, which is weakened, Mr. Jarre told French media, like all of us. Constant Méheut, Christopher F.

Patrick Semansky/Associated Press The glittering, black-tie New Year's Eve celebration at the president's Mar-a-Lago resort had in previous years been one of the highlights of the social season in Palm Beach, Fla. People paid hundreds of dollars for tickets. Celebrities including Sylvester Stallone, Rod Stewart and Woody Allen attended. Guests feasted on caviar and drank Champagne. But this year, the bash didn't even include President Trump. He had planned to attend, but without explanation left the resort town on Thursday morning to return to Washington. The streets around Mar-a-Lago were quiet at 8 p.m. Gone were the dozens of police officers present whenever the president is. Gone was the barricade that blocks the town's main road, creating traffic jams. Gone were the Trump supporters who cheer him on from across the Intracoastal Waterway in West Palm Beach. The town of Palm Beach has imposed a 1 a.m. curfew, limiting New Year's Eve festivities, and Mar-a-Lago officials declined to comment about the evening gala's attendance, menu or entertainment. But as a full moon shone above the resort, guests drove through the front and back gates in luxury cars. Men wore tuxedos, the women gowns, and some masks.\n\nAsia and pacific roundup Celebrations in China are limited by the pandemic, except in Wuhan. Slide 1 of 8 1 / 8 Auckland, New Zealand Credit...

Yet there was one notable exception: Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in December 2019. The central Chinese city that spent the beginning of 2020 closed off to the world under harsh lockdowns went ahead with boisterous festivities, including a concert by the city's philharmonic orchestra; a discussion by the famed talk-show host Luo Zhenyu; a light show along the Yangtze River, which runs through Wuhan; and a cyberpunk electronic music festival. Shanghai Disneyland had said it was going ahead with fireworks, but Beijing and Guangzhou canceled annual light shows.

Matthew Abbott for The New York Times The small Pacific island nation of Samoa became one of the first places in the world to welcome the new year, 19 hours ahead of the Eastern United States. On the nearby island of Tonga , an overnight curfew that has been in place since March as part of the country's coronavirus response was temporarily lifted for the night. Tonga is one of the few countries that has recorded no coronavirus cases, but gatherings are still limited and residents are required to socially distance.\n\nThe annual fireworks display at Sydney Harbor Bridge in Australia , which normally attracts over a million people, was mainly seen on TV or online, as the government limited access to the area. Outside the Sydney Opera House, musicians performed to an empty venue, livestreamed around the country.\n\nUnlike most of the world, celebrations in New Zealand looked a lot like those of years past. People in Auckland came together at beachside neighborhoods to gaze at the midnight fireworks display bursting over the harbor. Friends convened for toasts and barbecued at holiday homes. Signs of the pandemic were few as masks were optional — and rarely worn.\n\nIn Japan , worshipers traditionally flood into shrines and temples on New Year's Eve to welcome the new year. But in an effort to limit crowds, the gates at the popular Meiji Shrine in Tokyo were closed at 4 p.m. on Thursday.\n\nIn some of the biggest cities in India , including New Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai, hotels and bars were shuttered at 11 p.m., and large gatherings were prohibited, The Associated Press reported. In Mumbai, drones scoured the city, keeping close tabs on the whereabouts of residents.\n\nThousands of spectators attended a fireworks show in Taipei, Taiwan , where the mood was celebratory. Taiwan has been among the few success stories during the coronavirus pandemic, having recorded a total of only 799 cases and seven deaths.\n\nThe usually rowdy New Year's Eve revelry in the Philippines , punctuated by firecrackers and the firing of guns into the air, has been muted this year, with nearly all local governments banning the practice in order to prevent injuries and because many people are not in the mood to celebrate.\n\nGuam, a U.S. territory that sits between Japan and Australia, was the first populated area of the United States to leave 2020 by the wayside. But there were no open bars, nightclubs or fireworks shows to welcome the new year. Grocery sales of meat and alcohol were up, suggesting that many of the island's 170,000 residents were ringing in 2021 in the comfort of their own homes.

Jose Gabriel Martinez with his son, Omar. Credit... Omar Martinez On his family's trips to Mexico, Jose Gabriel Martinez would buy a special bottle of tequila and make a rule: They would open it and finish it on New Year's Eve. Mr. Martinez loved the holidays — stringing up Christmas lights outside his family's home in Iowa, eating his wife's tamales for days and leading boisterous family New Year's parties that spilled long past midnight. This year, the family was to gather for the first time without Mr. Martinez, 58, who died of the coronavirus in April, the first known victim of the pandemic in the agricultural town of West Liberty, Iowa. There was to be no gathering of extended family members. No dance-offs. No wild countdown to midnight. And no ceremonial bottle with Mr. Martinez pouring drinks of tequila and Squirt. Instead, the family planned to reflect together on how 2020 changed them. I'm ready, said Mr. Martinez's son, Omar, 30. I'm going to seal 2020 for life. I don't want to come back to it. It's time to leave it behind. The virus crashed into their lives in late March when Omar's mother and sister got sick. Omar and his father became caregivers, fixing green tea, kiwis, pineapple and bananas to try to keep them hydrated and nourished. Then his father began gasping for breath. Omar said his father was a tough, loving head of the family who always insisted he was fine. Even as he struggled to breathe, he strode around the house and stretched, willing his body to fight the virus. Omar drove him to Mercy Hospital in Iowa City, where he died on April 21. The family has vowed to get healthier in 2021 after months of quarantine and stress, by cutting out sugars and soda from their diet. They are longing for a return to normal. Omar Martinez has already received his first dose of a coronavirus vaccine because he works on the town's fire and ambulance squad, and he is anxious for the rest of his family to get it. He said the family would end the year thinking about what they have lost, but also about what remains. Our bond has become that much stronger now, Omar Martinez said.

Mark Makela/Getty Images Philadelphia's elaborate 120-year-old New Year's celebration known as the Mummers Parade will take a more rebellious form in 2021. Friday's event was branded as a peaceful protest against the city's mayor, Jim Kenney, who canceled the traditional parade because of the coronavirus pandemic. More than 11,000 people have said on Facebook that they will attend the scaled-down event, which will not be televised. Usually, hundreds of thousands line the parade route, watching an array of groups in often-outlandish costumes march through the city. City officials did not issue any permits and said they hoped that protesters would avoid unsafe behavior. This is not the first time the city's traditional celebration has been enveloped in controversy. In 2019, at least two members of one of the brigades marched while wearing blackface, and racist skits and imagery have been commonplace throughout the parade's history. In January 2020, Mr. Kenney threatened to cancel the parade if change did not take place. Though some marchers will still take to the streets on Friday, some who traditionally attend the celebration will be skipping out. Ryan Green, a saxophone player from Cherry Hill, N.J., who usually marches with the Pennsport Stringband every year, said he would miss the sense of community he had while playing alongside his bandmates. As we get closer to the parade, I see them more than my own family, Mr. Green said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Dakar, the usual soundtrack of fireworks on every corner was muted.

For one day, the capital of what is arguably the most peaceable country in West Africa sounds like a bit of a war zone. Anyone and everyone purchases fireworks and sets them off in any direction they like. Kids playing in the street? Avoid them at all costs. They will throw bangers at you. The sweet-looking lady selling sandwiches? Watch out, she might have a Catherine wheel hidden in her cart. Even the policemen in Senegal's largest city could have rockets up their sleeves. This year is different, of course. There hasn't been a lockdown in Dakar for months, but the government recently banned large gatherings again after coronavirus cases started to rise in early December. The last few hours of the year here were muted. Police patrolled the central square downtown, ready to break up any parties. Most people were drinking their champagne, or bissap — hibiscus juice — at home. Firecracker hawkers struggled to sell their stock. There were still a few thrills to be had. At dusk, in the back streets near West Africa's biggest mosque, boys threw bang snaps at each other. One cupped his hands around a match, lighting the Roman candle held up by his friend, who screwed up his face at each blast. Raky Sow, 27, usually would be at home on New Year's Eve, celebrating. But this year, as the sun began to dip behind HLM, Dakar's biggest fabric and accessories market, she was still at her stall selling lingerie and bin bins, strings of beads worn around the waist. People normally buy a lot before New Year's, but now they're not coming, she said, taking gold beads from a bowl on her lap and stitching them onto a red net skirt. 2020 — enough already.

It will be a quiet and somewhat somber New Year's in Colombia, where the virus is spreading rapidly, after a few weeks of semi-containment. New daily cases have surged over the last month, hitting about 15,000 a day at the end of December. Daily deaths have risen as well. Intensive care units are nearing capacity. The mayor of Bogotá, the capital, has reinstated some measures restricting movement and barred the sale of liquor on New Year's Day. But some small signs of celebration remain. Colombians are well known for their New Year's superstitions: Many will eat 12 grapes at midnight, stuff their suitcases with clothes and walk around the block (to usher in travel and adventure), and ring in the year while wearing a new pair of yellow underwear (in a bid for love and happiness). And across the country, many families will engage in a generations-old tradition: stuffing a scarecrow — named the año viejo, or old year — and then, amid cheers, burning it to the ground.\n\nIn Montreal, there is still (takeout) poutine, a hangover antidote.

Graham Hughes/Canadian Press, via Associated Press Montreal has long prided itself on being Canada's party city, a place where revelers dance until dawn on New Year's Eve before nursing their hangovers with poutine, that trouser-busting dish of French fries, cheese curds and gravy. But this year, the city and the rest of the province of Quebec, the epicenter of the pandemic in Canada, braced for low-key anticlimax. At a state liquor store in Montreal's bohemian Plateau-Mont-Royal neighborhood, people were already lining up at noon to buy Champagne. But the mood was somber and resigned. Louise Germain, a retired public health worker, said what she would not be doing. She would not cook anything special, and she would not see her extended family. She would, instead, be glued to the television with her husband, most likely tuning in to Bye Bye, a year-end satirical show that draws millions of Quebecers and has been around for decades. Lucrece Nana, 25, an international business student from Cameroon, said she planned to spend New Year's at home with a friend, cooking a special chicken and seafood dish, sipping Champagne and doing a Zoom call with her family back home. It doesn't feel like a normal New Year's, she said. It is a bit sad.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story
Covid-19: Virus Hammers California as Deaths and Hospitalizations Surge The number of confirmed cases in U.S. prisons has passed 500,000. Britain imposed a strict new national lockdown.\n\nRunning low on oxygen, emergency workers in Los Angeles County are told to administer the minimum necessary.

Apu Gomes/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images California's daily coronavirus case tallies remain around four times what they were during the state's summer surge, and officials predict that the aftereffects of a December surge linked to holiday gatherings will worsen as the winter drags on. After new infections — driven by Thanksgiving travel and gatherings, then Christmas festivities — resulted in a surge unlike any the state had yet seen, the trajectory of its new cases has leveled off somewhat in the early days of 2021. But there are more than twice as many Covid-19 patients in California hospitals now as there were a month ago, and many intensive care units in the state have been overflowing. At least six people in the state have also been found to be infected with the new, more transmissible variant of the virus first identified in Britain. The state is also facing an oxygen shortage for patients, and it has deployed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the California Emergency Medical Services Authority to help deliver and refill oxygen tanks. In a sign of how dire that shortage is, Marianne Gausche-Hill, the medical director for Los Angeles County's E.M.S. agency, issued guidelines to emergency workers on Sunday for administering the minimum amount of oxygen necessary to keep patients' oxygen saturation level at or just above 90 percent. (A level in the low 90s or below is a concern for people with Covid-19.) In the pandemic's brutal logic, more cases inevitably translates to more suffering and deaths. As of Monday night, 4,258 people with Covid-19 had died in the preceding two weeks, compared with 3,043 in the two weeks before that. This is a deadly disease, this is a deadly pandemic, Gov. Gavin Newsom told reporters on Monday. It remains more deadly today than at any point in the history of the pandemic. There has been some progress. California's daily average of 38,086 cases per day over the past week represents a decrease of 11 percent from the average two weeks earlier, for example. And although Covid-19 hospitalizations have increased by 18 percent over the past two weeks, to 20,618, Governor Newsom said that represents a slight flattening of the curve. But the state's last major Covid-19 surge, over the summer, only produced around 10,000 infections on its worst days. And in Los Angeles County, the latest crisis has stretched the health care system so thin that incoming patients at one hospital were recently being instructed to wait in an outdoor tent. Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles said on Sunday that the county's latest surge was infecting a new person every six seconds, and that many transmissions were occurring in private settings. It's a message for all of America: We might not all have the same density as L.A., but what's happening in L.A. can and will be coming in many communities in America, he said. The worst of the state's outbreak is concentrated in Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley, where intensive care units are at zero percent capacity. Officials are now working to bring in extra nursing staff to care for the flood of patients; Governor Newsom said that 90 patients were being kept at alternate care sites outside hospitals to help ease the burden. More inoculations would help ease California's burden, but Governor Newsom said vaccinations were only just ramping up after facing some early challenges. So far, he said, the state has only administered about 35 percent of the coronavirus vaccine doses it has received. That's not good enough, he said. We recognize that. In the meantime, said Dr. Mark Ghaly, the state's secretary of health and human services, Californians should be extra cautious about gathering with people outside their household now that the virus is so prevalent. The same activities that you did a month ago, today are just so much more risky than they were from a Covid transmission perspective, he said.

Elected officials, prison rights advocates and inmates' family members protested for better conditions outside San Quentin State Prison in July. Credit... Jim Wilson/The New York Times The number of inmates and guards known to have been infected with the coronavirus at American correctional institutions exceeded 500,000 on Monday, according to a New York Times database. As correctional institutions have been battered by coronavirus infections and deaths, the number of cases reported in has risen by nearly 84 percent in the last two months, according to a Times analysis of the data from some 2,600 prisons, jails and immigration detention centers. There are now 88 facilities that have had at least 1,000 infections, according to the database. Local jails and state prison systems have been so devastated by the virus that they have resorted to the drastic strategy of shutting down completely and transferring inmates elsewhere. Experts say the jails and prisons that stay open will probably become even more crowded, unsanitary and disease ridden, and the transfers are likely to help the virus proliferate both inside and outside the walls. At the same time, some states, like California and Washington, have begun vaccinating older and medically vulnerable prisoners. Even so, inmates and their families say that the crescendo of new cases has made incarcerated people more afraid of dying from the virus now than they have ever been. Five families called me on New Year's Day, said Beverly Brooks, who manages a prison advocacy program for the Covenant Fellowship of Churches International based in Florida. They're really scared for their loved ones. And the inmates are like, 'OK, is this a way for me to die?' At Lumberton Correctional Institute in North Carolina, Shannon Nyamodi, an inmate, said he worried about prisoners with health issues sleeping an arm's length from other inmates. More than 220 prisoners at Lumberton have tested positive, including a man Mr. Nyamodi knew who died over the summer. There's a mass fear of contracting the virus for a big handful of prisoners, he said. They weren't sentenced to death, they were just sentenced to do a few months or a few years here. A prisoner at the Allenwood federal complex in Pennsylvania, Aaron Kinzer, said he regularly watched staff members walk back and forth between his unit and a quarantine area without changing their protective gowns or masks. Early in the pandemic last spring, he said, there were relatively few cases at Allenwood and prisoners worried mainly about loved ones on the outside. As illnesses inside the facility have piled up since then — nearly 700 inmates have tested positive — so has a sense of despair. The mood in here reflects the greater society's mood, and has throughout the pandemic, Mr. Kinzer said. Early on, there was a lackadaisical approach — a belief that, you know, it was not going to touch us. But after an inmate died of Covid-19 in August, he said, hearing that it's so close — just feet away, 100 yards away, 200 yards away — kind of drove it home. Ms. Brooks said her son Jonathan Brooks called her last week from Wake Correctional Center in Raleigh, N.C., after hearing rumors that a group of inmates would soon be transferred in. Similar transfers have touched off deadly outbreaks in prisons across the nation. Rumors like that, and of more inmates falling ill, can intensify the dread in the cell blocks. Every time this happens, they're thinking, 'Will I be next?' Ms. Brooks said. My son was like, 'I just want to get out of here, Mama. I've got to get out of here.'

Credit... Marco Ugarte/Associated Press Mexico approved the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine for emergency use on Monday, the country's top epidemiologist, Hugo López-Gatell, announced in a tweet on Monday evening. It is the fourth country to approve the vaccine. Mexico's foreign secretary, Marcelo Ebrard, had previously said the approval was imminent. Mr. Ebrard celebrated the approval on Monday evening as very good news, tweeting that it would allow the country to start production very soon. AstraZeneca said in August it would work with the Mexican and Argentine governments to produce 150 million initial doses for distribution across Latin America, and later produce at least 400 million doses for the region. Last week, Britain became the first country to grant emergency approval for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Argentina soon followed suit. India on Sunday said it had also approved the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. On Monday, an 82-year-old dialysis patient in Oxford was the first person in the world to receive the clinically authorized, fully tested Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine when Britain began administering the vaccine. The Oxford-AstraZeneca shot is poised to become the world's dominant form of inoculation. At $3 to $4 a dose, it is a fraction of the cost of some other vaccines. And it can be shipped and stored in normal refrigerators for six months, rather than in the ultracold freezers required by the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, making it easier to administer in poorer and harder-to-reach areas. Mr. López-Gatell said he had incorrectly reported that a single-dose vaccine that had undergone phase three trials in Mexico by Chinese-Canadian firm CanSino was approved, according to The Associated Press. The United States and the European Union have indicated that they are unlikely to authorize the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine until at least February. When given in two full-strength doses, the regimen authorized by Britain, AstraZeneca's vaccine showed 62 percent efficacy in clinical trials — considerably lower than the roughly 95 percent efficacy achieved by Pfizer and Moderna's shots. No one who received the vaccine in the clinical trials developed severe Covid-19 or was hospitalized. Much of the world is looking to AstraZeneca in part because it has set more ambitious manufacturing targets than other Western vaccine makers. It has said that it expects to make up to three billion doses this year — a haul that, at two doses per person, would be enough to inoculate nearly one in five people worldwide. The company has pledged to make the vaccine available at cost around the world until at least July 2021, and in poorer countries into perpetuity. Mexico has the fourth-highest number of coronavirus deaths in the world, according to a New York Times database, and the 13th-highest number of coronavirus cases. The country has reported nearly 1.5 million infections, and 127,213 Mexicans have died of the virus. But Mexico's transparency with the severity of the virus in the country has been spotty. Last month, federal officials told the public that the number of cases in the capital, Mexico City, had not reached a level requiring — per its own standards — a lockdown. A New York Times analysis using the government's own official numbers found that the city had surpassed that level. In the spring, The Times reported that the federal government was not reporting hundreds and potentially thousands of coronavirus deaths in the capital. An earlier version of this item incorrectly stated when Mexico's foreign secretary said the vaccine approval was imminent.\n\nBritain reimposes a strict lockdown as hospitalizations are up 30% from last week. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:34 - 0:00 transcript It's Back to Lockdown for Britain as Cases Soar Prime Minister Boris Johnson addressing Britons on Monday. As I speak to you tonight, our hospitals are under more pressure from Covid than at any time since the start of the pandemic. In England alone, the number of Covid patients in hospitals has increased by nearly a third in the last week to almost 27,000. And that number is 40 percent higher than the first peak in April. On the 29th of December, more than 80,000 people tested positive for Covid across the U.K., a new record. The number of deaths is up by 20 percent over the last week, and will sadly rise further. And my thoughts are with all those who've lost loved ones. With most of the country already under extreme measures, it's clear that we need to do more together to bring this new variant under control while our vaccines are rolled out. In England, we must therefore go into a national lockdown, which is tough enough to contain this variant. You may only leave home for limited reasons permitted in law, such as to shop for essentials, to work — if you absolutely cannot work from home — to exercise, to seek medical assistance, such as getting a Covid test or to escape domestic abuse. Primary schools, secondary schools and colleges across England must move to remote provision from tomorrow, except for vulnerable children and the children of key workers. Prime Minister Boris Johnson addressing Britons on Monday. Credit Credit... Paul Ellis/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed a strict new national lockdown on Monday as Britain's desperate race to vaccinate its population risked being overtaken by a fast-spreading variant of the coronavirus that was on track to overwhelm the nation's beleaguered hospitals. After several days of frighteningly high and escalating case numbers, Mr. Johnson ordered schools and colleges in England to shift to remote learning. He appealed to Britons to stay at home for all but a few necessary purposes, including essential work and buying food and medicine. The decision was a fresh setback for Mr. Johnson, coming at a time when the arrival of two vaccines appeared to provide a route out of the crisis after nine fraught months and fierce criticism of his handling of the pandemic. On the day that the first doses of a vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford were administered, the good news was drowned out by the reintroduction of the type of sweeping restrictions used last spring when the pandemic first threatened to run out of control. In recent weeks, a new, highly transmissible variant of the virus has taken hold in London and southeast England, prompting an alarming spike in case numbers and putting hospitals under acute pressure. On Sunday, Mr. Johnson admitted that the current controls on daily life were insufficient. But the first announcement of a full-scale lockdown came not from him but from Scotland, where the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has consistently moved further and faster in efforts to tame the pandemic. The first minister of Northern Ireland, Arlene Foster, said at a news conference on Monday evening that schools would remain closed as part of the restrictions, which she said could last through the rest of January, probably into February. Students in primary school and some post-primary students in Northern Ireland had been set to return to school on Jan. 11. Ms. Foster said a more complete announcement would be made on Wednesday after the government had time to clarify some details, especially regarding vulnerable and special needs students. Britain is now involved in a high stakes race to roll out its mass vaccination program before its country's health service is overwhelmed by the new variant. Non-Covid treatment is again being postponed and pictures of ambulances stacking up in the parking lots of some hospitals last week illustrated the challenge faced by the country's weary health workers. In a sign of the threat faced by hospitals, the government raised its Covid alert to its highest level for the first time, one that warned of a material risk of health care services being overwhelmed. On Monday, there were more than 26,000 Covid-19 patients in hospitals, an increase of 30 percent from the previous week, Mr. Johnson's office said. New infections have surged to a rate of almost 60,000 a day, double the rate of a few weeks ago. With 75,024 deaths, Britain already has the highest death toll in Europe, and medical experts warn that the toll, after growing more modestly over the summer, will begin spiking again.

Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:09 - 0:00 transcript 'I'm Being Aggressive,' Cuomo Says of New York State Vaccinations On Monday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York threatened to fine hospitals if they don't increase the pace of coronavirus vaccinations. This is a very serious public health issue, and Department of Health Commissioner Zucker is very firm about making sure the hospitals step up and deliver here. So any provider who does not use the vaccine could be fined up to $100,000 — going forward, they have to use the allocation within seven days. Otherwise, they can be removed from future distribution. As you saw, we have almost 200 hospitals. If one hospital isn't performing, we can use other hospitals. I do have a problem with the hospitals saying they're going to participate, receiving a scarce vaccine and not administering it. But I have not heard any explanation other than it's only been three weeks and not everybody comes in every day. And people have different shifts — you know, it's all the bureaucracy. I don't want the vaccine in a freezer. I want it in somebody's arm. So yes, I'm being aggressive. On Monday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York threatened to fine hospitals if they don't increase the pace of coronavirus vaccinations. Credit Credit... Andrew Kelly/Reuters Hospitals in New York State will now face fines and potentially lose the opportunity to distribute the coronavirus vaccine if they do not step up the pace of inoculations, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Monday. The governor said hospitals could face fines of up to $100,000 if they did not use their current supplies of vaccine by the end of the week, and that facilities would be required to use future shipments within seven days of receipt, or face possible removal from distribution networks. We want those vaccines in peoples' arms, Mr. Cuomo said. New York lags behind other large states in distributing the vaccine, and Mr. Cuomo is facing pressure to fast-track the vaccinations as deaths and hospitalizations continue to rise in the state. Mr. Cuomo told reporters about the new penalties during a news conference at which he estimated that about 300,000 people in the state had been inoculated so far. In a call with reporters later on Monday, Mr. Cuomo announced that a case of a more contagious virus variant first identified in Britain had been found in New York State. Mr. Cuomo said the state had conducted about 5,000 tests for the British variant and that this was the first known case. He also announced proposed legislation that would impose criminal charges on facilities and health care providers that ignore guidelines on who is eligible for the vaccine, and exhorted hospital administrators to dispense the vaccine faster, listing the 10 most and 10 least successful hospitals in the state side by side. This is a management issue of the hospitals, Mr. Cuomo said, adding that They have to move the vaccine faster. The announcements came after some health experts expressed concern about the slow pace of vaccinations in the city. At an earlier news conference on Monday, Mayor Bill de Blasio said that New York City will double the number of coronavirus vaccination sites in the city and broaden the pool of people who are eligible to be inoculated in order to achieve his goal of administering one million doses in the city during January. He said that so far about 110,000 people in the city had received a first dose of the vaccine. Mr. de Blasio said that New York State had added a number of categories of workers to the eligible list, including testing-site workers, contact tracers, dentists, physical therapists, police department medical staff, workers at specialized clinics, and outpatient and ambulatory care providers. We want to keep expanding those categories, Mr. de Blasio said. The more people that we can reach quickly, the better. In December, vaccines were reserved mainly for frontline medical workers and nursing home residents and staff, though some other health care workers and clinics have been accused of cutting the line. There are currently about 125 vaccination sites in the city. Mr. de Blasio said he planned to open at least 125 more by the end of January. Dr. Dave A. Chokshi, the city health commissioner, said that the administration hoped to add at least 35 of the new sites by the end of this weekend. From this point on, seven days a week, 24/7, has to be the attitude and the approach, Mr. de Blasio said. Dr. Chokshi noted that some of the first health care workers to be vaccinated in the city would be receiving the required second dose this week. The latest coronavirus statistics Mr. de Blasio offered were grim. New York City has been averaging 3,976 new cases a day over the past week, he said, with about 9 percent of tests coming back positive. We obviously want to get back below 5 percent, Mr. de Blasio said. We're going to push hard to get this number back down in the days and weeks ahead. Nothing will be more important than the vaccination effort to help us get there. The case of the British variant found in the state was identified in a Saratoga Springs man in his 60s who had not traveled recently, suggesting community spread of the variant, Mr. Cuomo said. Mr. Cuomo also appeared to effectively end the six-month battle over whether to reopen schools in New York City by announcing that the city and other regions of the state could keep schools open past the 9 percent positivity rate threshold he set over the summer. Schools can stay open as long as virus rates within school communities remain lower than the overall community average. Mr. Cuomo said it would now be up to individual school districts, rather than his office, to decide whether to stay open. In New York City, parents and educators had been nervously watching the local positivity rate climb for weeks, wondering if schools would close yet again. Mr. de Blasio said over the summer that schools would close if the citywide positivity rate reached 3 percent, according to the city's metrics. He closed schools when the city hit that threshold in the fall, but soon reopened elementary schools, saying there would no longer be a specific threshold for closing them citywide. On Monday morning Mr. de Blasio said he expected to keep primary schools open, along with classrooms for children with the most complex disabilities, and the governor had given him permission to do so. But on Monday afternoon, the president of the city's teachers' union said it would push the mayor to close schools if the citywide positivity rate reaches 9 percent, according to the state's metrics. The city could soon reach that number, setting up a potential battle between City Hall and the union. Middle and high schools have been closed since November, and appear likely to stay closed indefinitely. Daniel E.

Sanjeev Gupta/EPA, via Shutterstock The government in India has defended regulators' decision to approve a homegrown coronavirus vaccine that is still under trial after opposition lawmakers and health care monitors said the authorization was a political move to burnish the image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The approval for the shot, called Covaxin, which has been developed by the Indian company Bharat Biotech, came on Sunday, along with authorization for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. With the approvals, India, which has a population of about 1.3 billion, became the first country in South Asia to authorize shots. Government figures have celebrated the Covaxin approval as a triumph for India and for a stimulus package introduced by Mr. Modi with the aim of making the country more self-reliant. However, All India Drug Action Network, an independent network of nongovernmental organizations, expressed shock over the Covaxin authorization because the shot was still in Phase 3 trials. The only human data available on safety and immunogenicity is on 755 participants in Phase 1 and 2 trials, the network said in a statement. Other than this, there is data from animal studies. Other experts have also raised concerns, pointing out disparities in publicly available data about the vaccine's effectiveness. Dr. Gagandeep Kang, a medical researcher, said that although Bharat Biotech had published some information, the Phase 3 trial of Covaxin had started only in November. There is absolutely no efficacy data that has been published, she said. How Bharat Biotech's Vaccine Works Using inactivated coronaviruses to train the immune system. Shashi Tharoor, an opposition politician, posted a series of messages on Twitter on Monday, criticizing what he called chest-thumping 'vaccine nationalism' and saying that the desire to bolster Mr. Modi's stimulus campaign had trumped common sense and a generation of established scientific protocols. But Dr. Harsh Vardhan, the Indian health minister, said such comments were disgraceful. Dr. Vardhan said that all those receiving the Covaxin shots would be tracked and monitored as if they were in a trial and dismissed concerns about the vaccine's success rate. We will not compromise on any protocol before approving a vaccine, Dr. Vardhan said.\n\nGLOBAL ROUNDUP A Swedish official flew to Spain after advising people to stay home, and other news from around the world. Dan Eliasson, the head of the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency, at a news conference in Stockholm in March. Credit... Jonathan Nackstrand/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Weeks before Christmas, Dan Eliasson, the head of the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency, sent a text message to all Swedes advising them to follow recommendations to stay home for the holidays. A short time later, he packed his bags and flew off on a two-week trip to the Canary Islands. Now Mr. Eliasson is under fire in Sweden, where obeying rules and recommendations — especially during the pandemic — is seen as one of the highest virtues. Mr. Eliasson was photographed looking rather surprised while waiting at the airport in Las Palmas, the Swedish newspaper Expressen reported. He told the paper the trip had been essential, saying he had given up a lot of trips during this pandemic but deemed this one necessary because he had a daughter living in the Canaries. I celebrated Christmas with her and my family, he said, adding that he had worked remotely while on the islands. Many Swedes who did not get to see their families over the holidays were upset. What were you thinking? one man wrote on Twitter. Sweden has avoided going into lockdown, and many public places continue to be open despite recent case rates that are among the highest in Europe. Compared to its Nordic neighbors, the country has recorded a high number of virus deaths, but the figure is on par with other larger European countries. Mr. Eliasson's trip comes on the heels of criticism leveled at the country's prime minister, Stefan Lofven, who was caught on camera shopping at a mall in central Stockholm on Dec. 23, days after he criticized Justice Minister Morgan Johansson for going shopping in Lund. Earlier in December, Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson was spotted renting ski boots in Salen, a ski resort area. The Swedish Public Health Agency has urged people to stay home as much as possible and avoid gatherings. International holiday travel also led to trouble for officials in Canada, where on Monday eight politicians resigned or were demoted following their excursions, Reuters reported. A member of parliament resigned as the chair of an ethics committee after he traveled to the United States. The municipal affairs minister of Alberta, Tracy Allard, resigned after she went to Hawaii. A banner in front of a constituency office read, Welcome Home, Aloha Allard. In other news from around the world: The health minister of Lebanon , Hamad Hasan, announced that the country will lock down for three weeks, starting on Thursday until Feb. 1, Reuters reported. The shutdown, which includes an evening curfew, comes amid a financial crisis that has sent many Lebanese into poverty and unemployment — and the onslaught of coronavirus cases is being met with a health care system already running low on supplies.\n\nThe state health department of São Paulo, Brazil , said on Monday that it had identified the country's first two confirmed cases of the virus variant first found in Britain.

The other was a 34-year-old man, whose case was being investigated by health officials.\n\nSlovakia became the latest European nation to confirm its first case of the variant, The Associated Press reported, after the country's health minister, Marek Krajci, announced that the variant had been found in samples taken in the eastern county of Michalovce.

Phillip/Associated Press The N.C.A.A., in an attempt to limit the threat of coronavirus among teams, announced an agreement Monday to hold its signature men's basketball tournament entirely in Indiana in March and early April. The tournament includes 67 games and is usually held in numerous cities sprawled across the United States, culminating with the Final Four teams meeting in one city in April. This year's Final Four — the tournament's semifinals and final — was already scheduled for Indianapolis before the pandemic widely shut down American sports last year. The N.C.A.A., which has its headquarters in Indianapolis, said the tournament would play out across six venues, detailing a plan it originally announced in November. The teams are scheduled to be selected on March 14, but the early rounds of the tournament have not been fully scheduled. With fewer courts, it will require some juggling to fit in all the games and practices. The N.C.A.A. is working with local health officials in Marion County, where Indianapolis is, to determine safety protocols. Indiana has had a 17 percent decrease in new cases of the virus in the past two weeks, according to a New York Times database. A limited number of family members for participating teams will be allowed at games, according to the announcement. However the organization said it would continue monitoring the pandemic before coming to a decision about allowing other spectators. Teams will practice in the Indiana Convention Center and stay in hotels connected to the venue, with teams separated by hotel floors, unique dining and meeting rooms and secure transportation to and from competition venues, the N.C.A.A. said. The 2021 women's tournament is also set to play in one unique region, with the N.C.A.A. announcing in December that it was in preliminary discussions with officials in the San Antonio area to host. Both the 2020 men's and women's championships were among the first to be called off when the spread of the virus accelerated last March. The 2021 version of March Madness will be one to remember, if for no other reason than the uniqueness of the event, Dan Gavitt, N.C.A.A.'s senior vice president of basketball, said in the announcement. This is going to be complicated and difficult; there's no question about that, he added.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUse them or lose them, Florida's governor warns hospitals about vaccine supplies. Emilio Estefan, 67, receiving the vaccine at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami last week. About 80 percent of Florida's vaccine doses have been distributed to hospitals. Credit... Joe Raedle/Getty Images Florida hospitals may have future supplies of coronavirus vaccine reduced if they do not administer doses quickly enough, Gov. Ron DeSantis warned on Monday. Hospitals that do not do a good job of getting the vaccine out will have their allocations transferred to hospitals that are doing a good job of getting the vaccine out, Mr. DeSantis said at a news conference in Longwood, Fla., near Orlando. We do not want vaccine to just be idle in some hospital system. So far, about 80 percent of Florida's vaccine doses have been distributed to hospitals across the state, Mr. DeSantis said, adding that hospitals have the equipment, expertise and community relationships needed to get the vaccine to the people that Florida has given top priority: people 65 and older and health care workers. But the governor acknowledged that the state needs to do more. We need to add additional layers to the vaccination strategy, Mr. DeSantis said. Long lines have formed when some county health offices in the state opened vaccination sites on a first-come, first-serve basis. Appointment hotlines and websites have been overwhelmed with demand. In Jacksonville, about 4,000 people who filled out online forms incorrectly received confirmation emails and thought they had appointments to be vaccinated, when they actually did not. The Florida Department of Health's own website crashed on Monday. Demand for the vaccines in Florida has far exceeded supply, in part because Mr. DeSantis's administration decided not to limit eligibility for the early wave of immunizations to people 75 and older, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested. We've made the decision in Florida: Our seniors come first, he said. We're going to stand by that. Vaccination efforts were off to a slow start in part because of unfortunate timing, the governor said, since the Moderna vaccine arrived just before Christmas when many people were on vacation or busy with families. He said vaccines have now been delivered to health department offices in each of the state's 67 counties, and to nearly every hospital. He said his administration would identify state-run coronavirus testing sites that could be converted into vaccination sites, and would hire 1,000 nurses to assist in giving the shots at state sites or at short-handed hospitals. And while the CVS and Walgreens drugstore chains have been taking the lead in vaccinating residents and employees at the nearly 4,000 long-term care facilities in Florida, the governor said the state would get more involved in assisting that effort. We want to accelerate that pace, Mr. DeSantis said.\n\nStocks on Wall Street sink in their steepest decline since October. Wall Street began the year with a tumble on Monday, with the S&P 500 suffering its steepest decline in more than two months as it retreated from record territory. Analysts traced the sell-off to a number of factors, including political jitters stemming from Tuesday's runoff election in Georgia — which will determine control of the U.S. Senate — concerns about a resurgent coronavirus, and the simple need for investors to take a breather after a stretch of sizzling gains. It wasn't clear that the slump would continue into Tuesday. Stocks in Asian markets were steady early on Tuesday, while futures markets suggested that Wall Street would stabilize when it opens. The index fell 1.5 percent, its sharpest drop since late October. Stocks that have been most sensitive to investor sentiment about the coronavirus pandemic led the decline. Shares of Royal Caribbean Cruises, Wynn Resorts, Marriott International and Carnival were all down by 5 percent or more.\n\n\n\nMajor benchmarks in Europe also gave up most of their early gains on Monday, though they managed to stay in positive territory for the day. The Stoxx Europe 600 index rose 0.7 percent, and the FTSE 100 index in Britain gained 1.7 percent. After Europe's markets closed on Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed a strict new national lockdown as a more contagious variant of the coronavirus threatened to overwhelm the nation's beleaguered hospitals. The variant is now present in the United States, where coronavirus cases and deaths have reached records in recent days. Monday's retreat also came after the S&P 500 rallied more than 16 percent in 2020, defying the economic crisis and the human catastrophe of the pandemic, as the Federal Reserve stepped in to support financial markets, Congress spent trillions on unemployment and business support programs, and vaccinations began, showing a sustainable way out of the pandemic. But investors have always had to contend with the still-spreading coronavirus pandemic, the risk of new lockdowns and political turmoil in the United States. On Tuesday, two runoff Senate elections in Georgia will settle control of the upper house of Congress, and finally determine how hard it will be for President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. to move forward on his agenda. In the wake of the presidential election in November, investors had begun to anticipate that Republicans would retain control of the Senate, giving them the ability to limit the Biden administration's ability to raise taxes or increase regulation. That view had also helped lift stocks at the end of last year, but Monday's trading showed investors had grown less confident in a Republican win on Tuesday. The market fears the Democrats taking both of those seats, said Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at the brokerage firm BTIG. He said that investors have been closely watching prediction markets give greater chances to that outcome in recent days. It's basically now a tossup as to what the outcome is going to be tomorrow, after the Republicans being heavily favored.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore than 40 people tested positive after Christmas services at a church in Massachusetts.

Erin Clark/The Boston Globe Genesis Community Church, outside of Boston, thought it was taking all the right safety precautions for its Christmas services: requiring an R.S.V.P. in case contact tracing was needed, limiting capacity and requiring masks. But it was not enough. More than 40 people have tested positive for the coronavirus in cases that are believed to be connected to those gatherings. The house of worship in Woburn, Mass., hosted a total of four Christmas celebrations on Dec. 23 and Dec. 24. Its lead pastor, Michael Davis, who declined to be interviewed, said in a series of emails that those who wanted to attend were required to essentially make reservations. That allowed the church to do accurate and complete contact tracing of everyone who was in the building, Mr. Davis said. The average attendance at each gathering was 105 per service, which is 35 percent of our building occupancy. But, he said, he knows of at least 44 people who were at those services who have tested positive. Tara Vocino, 32, a local photographer, is one of them. She said that she was tested on Dec. 29 and received her positive result two days later. It feels like there has been a knife in my mouth, and I've lost all sense of taste and smell, Ms. Vocino said, adding that she feels so exhausted that she has been sleeping about 16 hours a day. She said that she was at one of the services on Dec. 23, was in the front row at the church and was wearing a mask. When I saw there was the outbreak, I went out and got tested, she added. Ms. Vocino, who lives with her parents and suffers from asthma, said, I've been in one room for the last couple of days, and I use a separate bathroom. Mr. Davis said that he has also tested positive but is almost back to full health. He added that the church is working closely with the Woburn Board of Health to help the agency with contact tracing. Mr. Davis said that within 24 hours of church officials learning of five of the cases, they contacted the health board. Neither representatives from the health agency nor the mayor of Woburn responded to numerous calls and emails.

Moncef Slaoui, the chief scientific adviser for Operation Warp Speed, outside the West Wing of the White House on Dec. 21. Credit... Erin Scott for The New York Times The Food and Drug Administration late Monday criticized an idea floated by one of the administration's top vaccine officials for stretching the limited number of Covid-19 vaccine doses, saying that a proposal for half-doses of the Moderna vaccine was premature and not rooted solidly in the available science. The agency's statement, posted on its website Monday night, exposed a fissure between Trump administration officials about whether they can somehow economize vaccine supplies in order to inoculate more people quicker. Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech are the only companies so far whose vaccines are authorized for emergency use in the United States, and together they can deliver only enough doses to vaccinate 185 million Americans by the end of June. On Sunday, Moncef Slaoui, the scientific leader of Operation Warp Speed, the administration's vaccine development program, said that federal officials and Moderna were discussing possibly halving each of Moderna's two doses — effectively giving recipients the equivalent of one full dose. He said data from Moderna's clinical trials demonstrated that people between the ages of 18 and 55 who received two 50-microgram doses showed an identical immune response to the two 100-microgram doses. But the F.D.A., which would have to approve such a change in protocol, suggested in its statement that the available data was insufficient to justify that shift — or other proposed regimen changes designed to stretch out doses. We have been following the discussions and news reports about reducing the number of doses, extending the length of time between doses, changing the dose (half-dose), or mixing and matching vaccines in order to immunize more people against COVID-19, the statement said. Such changes should be researched in clinical trials before adopted, it said. Experts said such studies would take weeks, if not longer. While some data already exists, clinical trial recipients of the Moderna or BioNTech vaccine who did not receive two doses at the proper time were generally only followed for a short period of time, the agency said. Therefore, we cannot conclude anything definitive about the depth or duration of protection after a single dose of vaccine, it said. Changing the dosage could also complicate the vaccine effort just as the public is beginning to become more accepting of the program, according to Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert. One of the dangers of making a change in midstream is that it could confuse the public, he said in an interview on Monday. He also suggested that changing the vaccine dosage was the right answer to the wrong question. The current problem, he said, is not that there are not enough doses, but that state and local governments have been unable to vaccinate people with the doses they already have. At the present time we are not dealing with a shortage of doses — we are dealing with the need to increase our efficiency in getting people vaccinated, he said. He suggested that changing the dosage could become appropriate if a shortage emerged. Sharon LaFraniere and\n\nTokyo, in the grip of rising infections, tightens restrictions. Dining in Tokyo on New Year's Eve. The Japanese government is to consider declaring a state of emergency in the capital and in three surrounding prefectures. Credit... Noriko Hayashi for The New York Times The authorities in Tokyo requested on Monday that restaurants and bars close by 8 p.m. to prevent further spread of the coronavirus, an announcement that came after the Japanese prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, said that the central government would consider declaring a state of emergency in the capital and in three surrounding prefectures for the first time since April. With Tokyo recording a record high of 1,337 cases in one day last week, Governor Yuriko Koike said, We should clearly recognize that the infection situation is in a completely different stage. The metropolitan government has asked residents to refrain from all but essential outings after 8 p.m. Restaurants serving alcohol will be required to close at 8 p.m. starting on Jan 8; all other restaurants will have to follow suit on Jan. 12, with the restrictions in place through the end of the month. Ms. Koike said that the metropolitan government would also ask subway and train lines to end service earlier each evening. Companies have been encouraged to allow employees to work from home, and universities have been asked to move classes online. Mr. Suga said that the central government would consider declaring a state of emergency later this week. Japan has reported a total of more than 240,000 cases and more than 3,500 deaths. Last month, as Japan detected cases of the more transmissible variant of the coronavirus that first emerged in Britain, the government closed the borders to foreign travelers. Mr. Suga also suspended government subsidies for a domestic travel program. Legally, a state of emergency in Japan cannot mandate a lockdown but relies on voluntary compliance. Mr. Suga said that the government was considering punishments for businesses that do not comply with requests, as well as compensation for businesses that have to close early. Japan has not yet approved any of the vaccines that are being rolled out in the United States, Europe and other parts of the world. But it has contracts to buy doses from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca, and Mr. Suga said he hoped that his country would start vaccinating medical workers and older adults by the end of February.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBritain begins giving clinically authorized and tested Oxford-AstraZeneca shots.

Pool photo by Steve Parsons An 82-year-old in Britain became the first person in the world to receive the clinically authorized, fully tested coronavirus vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, adding another shot to the global inoculation effort. The 82-year-old, Brian Pinker, a retired maintenance manager, was injected with the first dose of the vaccine at a hospital in Oxford, where he is a dialysis patient. Mr. Pinker said he was proud to receive the vaccine linked to his hometown. Prof. Andrew Pollard, who was the lead investigator on the trial, also received the shot on Monday. It was an incredibly proud moment for me to have received the actual vaccine that the University of Oxford and the AstraZeneca teams have worked so hard to make available to the U.K. and the world, he said. The Oxford-AstraZeneca shot is expected to become one of the dominant forms of inoculation because it is cheaper and easier to store than the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. After the health regulator in Britain became the first to grant emergency authorization to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine last week, India followed suit and many other countries are counting on the shots to help tamp down the pandemic. Although Britain was the first to authorize and administer the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot — as it was with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine early last month — the country is in the grip of a severe surge in coronavirus cases. A new strain of the virus has pummeled the country, with 54,990 new cases and 454 deaths recorded on Sunday, taking the total number of people killed by the virus in Britain to more than 75,000. Scotland's leader, Nicola Sturgeon, announced that a new lockdown will go into effect at midnight on Monday and will remain in place until at least the end of the month. People will be ordered to stay home unless for essential reasons, such as for caregiving responsibilities or exercise, and most students will return to remote learning. The new variant of the coronavirus accounts for almost half of new infections in Scotland, Ms. Sturgeon said, as the country recorded 1,905 new cases on Monday. I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year, she said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is facing calls to implement a new national lockdown in England and for all schools to be closed. Mr. Johnson on Monday said there was no question the British government would announce stricter measures in due course.
Riskiest Choice: Women's Gowns\n\nThe most powerful red-carpet fashion statement at the Globes occurred in 2018 when almost all the women showed up in black gowns and tuxedo suits in solidarity with Time's Up and #MeToo. So the fact that this year's ceremony took place the night before the start of the trial of Harvey Weinstein, the man who arguably gave rise to the movement, added a certain scrutiny to what everyone wore.\n\nWould they continue what they had started, and make their clothes about more than just a pretty dress? Or would they return to the status quo, when fashion choices were more about marketing and best-dressed lists? In the end, the most striking looks were gloriously, sometimes ridiculously, risky. (Sometimes they were also just ridiculous, but that was O.K.)\n\nThey included Joey King doing her best impression of living sound waves; Cate Blanchett in gold pleats and crystal bra looking like a cross between an archangel and a pole-dancing Valkyrie; and Charlize Theron in Jolly Green Giant goddess drapes over a peekaboo black corset.\n\nAnd then there was Gwyneth Paltrow in a sheer high-necked ruffled mud brown tulle … knit? It was hard to tell, but the Fendi gown revealed everything from her undies to her abs and may well get her on all sorts of worst-dressed lists.
You see how confusing it is. One wants to do something, but there are so many bereft people in the street it's difficult to know who to help and what to do. This may be why, when I read about feminine hygiene gift bags, I liked the idea so much. Tampons, I learned, are a relatively expensive item, which are often in short supply at shelters. So you pack a large handbag with tampons, add baby-wipes, toothpaste, underwear, socks, tissues — anything that might help someone clean herself up and maintain a bit of dignity.\n\nI go on Amazon to stock up. In addition to the basics I find a few luxury items: chocolates, scented soap, cologne — a spray of something lovely might transport someone, I think, even if just for a few moments. As Amazon offers items in bulk I have enough for two bags. I find the bags at Goodwill. One is a soft gray quilted tote; one is a patterned French knockoff. I put $10 in each bag so the freshened-up lady can get a cup of coffee and a muffin. While I wait for the items to arrive, I case my Union Square neighborhood. I spot the perfect recipient, a woman sitting on the street on Park Avenue South at the corner of 17th Street. She is in her late 20s or early 30s, with a backpack and a cardboard sign.\n\nBetter homeless than a victim of domestic abuse, the sign reads.\n\nAs soon as my items arrive I rush back to 17th Street. The perfect recipient is gone; the person now sitting on the sidewalk with a sign is a young man. I move on through the neighborhood. This makes me realize a few things: There are far more homeless men than women in the street. When it is winter and someone is huddled under layers of protective covering, it is not easy to tell who is male and who is female. I see only one homeless person I am certain is a woman, who appears to be deranged. After an hour and a half, I have given away nothing.\n\nThe problem is, I want to give the bag to someone who will use it, I explain to my friend Herb over dinner. I don't want to give it to someone who is so far gone she'll put the Tampax in her ear. I don't want to get up the next morning and see the underwear scattered all over 14th Street.\n\nIt can't work that way, Herb says. It's a gift. You have to hand it to somebody and not look back.
In life, he could always find his way home, so why did he not visit us in the afterlife?\n\nChild-free by choice, my husband, Jim, and I loved being pup parents. Jesse got romps around Los Angeles. Relaxing vacations in Big Bear. Meaty home-cooked stews. A lap of red wine or yeasty beer off Jim's finger at cocktail hour. Excessive? Perhaps. When Jesse was still hardy on his 15th birthday, a friend remarked, He's got it too good to die.\n\nWe thought so, too, but maybe from his perspective he was living a life of forced labor.\n\nWe'd trained Jesse to be an animal therapy dog. Sick kids would squeal with delight when he swaggered into the Ronald McDonald House — a bright distraction as they coped with itchy body casts or a fifth surgery. On visits to the abused children's shelters, traumatized kids would giggle and chase him as he'd climb their play set and zoom down the slide.\n\nJesse seemed to like the job. He'd jump out of the car, eager to go inside. Occasionally a mini-thug would pull his tail or poke a finger in his eye. We'd quickly reward his tolerance with a liver treat. After an hour of squawking kids, Jesse might wobble away with exhaustion but he never complained. Then again, he wasn't much of a talker.\n\nWhile alive.\n\nWhen he retired from volunteer work, people would remark at how fit he stayed for a senior. I'd always quip, The day Jesse refuses a beer will be the day he dies.\n\nOne evening, even a half-teaspoon of frosty Samuel Adams couldn't entice him to eat.\n\nCancer. Our baby had few good night loves left.
Send your workplace conundrums to workologist@nytimes.com, including your name and contact information (even if you want it withheld). The Workologist is a guy with well-intentioned opinions, not a professional career adviser. Letters may be edited.\n\nI have been contemplating quitting my job for the past six months or so. I'm finally certain about the decision, but I can't seem to find the right time to tell my boss. It didn't seem right just after the holiday break. Then I came down with the flu and missed several days, putting additional stress on my team. Plus the company is in the middle of kicking off several big new projects, and my role would be integral. Our company is small, and I have a close relationship with everyone, my boss included. I don't think anyone suspects that I am even thinking about leaving. I have had a couple of amazing years here and expected to stay longer. But I'm burned out by long hours for not enough money and don't find creative satisfaction in the work any more. It's starting to affect my personal and professional relationships. I don't want to blindside my boss, but I fear postponing this conversation, as that may just overcomplicate things. I would love some advice. ANONYMOUS\n\nThe problem here is pretty clear: You like your colleagues, but you really don't like your job. You're right that postponing the conversation will not make it any easier. Eventually, in fact, it's just going to make you bitter: You're suffering for the sake of others who are blissfully ignorant of your unhappiness.\n\nIf you have something else specific lined up, let that dictate the timing. If you don't, then decide on the timetable that's best for you and stick to that as closely as possible. Be selfish about this. If a job is having a negative impact on your personal life and you can get out of it, you need to do so promptly.\n\nWhen you announce your decision, tie it to a concrete final date. You can choose to be flexible if requested, but anchor the discussion to a specific time frame; don't start out with something vague or squishy.
It's happening again with Call Me by Your Name, and that's a good thing. It will bring many visitors to lovely Crema, which has never been on the tourist trail.\n\nFounded in the sixth century, the town was destroyed by the Germans in the 12th century and conquered by the Venetians in the 15th century. Crema was a proud part of the Republic of Venice for three and a half centuries. The marble lions of Mark the Evangelist, Venice's patron saint, still grace the town hall and the Torrazzo, the main gate leading into the Piazza del Duomo.\n\nAnd now, thanks to this movie, many foreigners will discover that Italy is not one gigantic Tuscany, a soft drug peddled in predictable packages, such as hills in the sunset, olive groves, lemon trees and white wine. Crema has none of that. Our land is flat; we grow wheat and corn, not olives; and our wine comes in bottles from Piedmont or Veneto. In Crema you will not bump into an American on every street corner. In Cortona, you do. Sorry, Frances Mayes — there are too many foreigners under the Tuscan sun.\n\nCrema offers the right mix of mild unpredictability and sensory reassurance. Every spring and summer we have friends stay, and they are all enchanted. You may think I'm being too romantic, or even biased. But I do believe that a town like ours represents the stunning, ordinary charm of Italy better than those world-famous cities. Rome, Venice and Florence are unique and breathtaking, but overwhelming. Crema takes you by the hand and slowly teaches you what Italy is about: its old houses and waterways, the deep green and lighthearted conversation, the ripe fruit (the sexual potential of peaches and apricots is fully explored in Mr. Guadagnino's movie).\n\nWe know the pleasures of pausing and observation in my country. We don't look at people, we see them. And we seduce our visitors gently.\n\nItaly can be infuriating — its politics, its bureaucracy, the slow pace of change, the occasional furbo (trickster) getting in the way. But it is a land rich in the variety of human nature, as the travel writer E.R.P. Vincent depicted it in 1927. Luigi Barzini Jr., some 40 years later, in his book The Italians, tried to explain the reasons behind the attraction: The art of living, this disreputable art developed by the Italians to defeat regimentation, is now becoming an invaluable guide for survival for many people.\n\nA half-century on, those assessments still ring true. Last summer, when an English friend, enjoying her aperitivo under our huge magnolia tree, asked me to sum up Italy in a sentence, I said, Italy can have you fuming and purring in the space of 100 meters or the course of 10 minutes. Call Me by Your Name may or may not end up as best picture, but it will convince you that I'm right.
Nancy Pelosi has led the Democrats in the House for the last 16 years. She's been in power for the party's highs … … and lows. Sweeping, stunning Republican victories all across the country. … the president of the United States. Now she is again Speaker of the House, and leading an impeachment battle in a big election year in 2020. I couldn't be more honored. So what are the tactics that have kept her in power for so long? Good morning. Pelosi's affinity for politics may be genetic. Well, I was born into a political family in Baltimore, Md. My father was in Congress when I was born, and he was mayor my whole life from when I was in first grade to when I went away to college. But despite being raised in political circles, Pelosi didn't jump in right away. Instead, she moved to San Francisco with her husband in the late 1960s and raised their five children as a stay-at-home mom. But as they grew up, Pelosi decided to enter the fray. Pelosi quickly rose through the ranks of the California Democratic Party, earning a reputation as a star fund-raiser, and in 1987 she won a seat in Congress. Through the '90s Pelosi navigated the party in Washington, becoming leader in 2003. Thank you all very much. Since then, she's raised millions for the Democrats. Over the years, Pelosi has earned a reputation as a shrewd legislator, especially when it comes to corralling votes. Her tactic: rewarding loyalty with good roles and coveted assignments, and punishing those who cross her. Exhibit A: when Representative John Dingell didn't support Pelosi for Democratic whip, she eventually backed someone else to take one of his committee seats. Pelosi has never been shy about how she feels about her leadership. Well, I'm a master legislator. I think I'm the best person to go forward to unify. I have a strong following in the country. Thank you. And while her confidence has likely paid off, it also provides a counter to her other public persona: Democratic bogeywoman. Pelosi's long tenure has made her an easy target for the right. Amy McGrath is a Nancy Pelosi liberal — … whose name is Conor Lamb, but in Washington he'd be one of Nancy Pelosi's sheep. And occasionally for the left. I didn't support Nancy Pelosi for any leadership position. We need some new leadership. But when asked, she just shrugs it off. I think I'm worth the trouble, quite frankly. Pelosi is no stranger to a fight or a quick retort. Please don't characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting. She's battled President Bush and recent G.O.P. leaders. Mr. President, 'stay the course' is not a strategy it's a slogan. Say one nice thing about Paul Ryan — There's a big difference between the president and me: He has very thin skin, and I have very thick skin. And with a challenging year ahead, there are inevitably many more fights to come. So, help us God.
Getting to this point, though, took longer than expected.\n\nWhen he turned professional in 2005, Moore was the most decorated amateur since Tiger Woods after having won the 2004 N.C.A.A. individual title during his junior year at Nevada-Las Vegas, and the United States Amateur, the Western Amateur and the United States Public Links that summer. Playing on sponsors' exemptions, he earned enough money to become the first player since Woods in 1996 to go directly from college to the tour in the same season, without having to go to qualifying school.\n\nBut the following year, Moore had surgery on his left wrist and missed two months. The injury continued to linger, and other maladies soon cropped up, including problems with his shoulder and left ankle. They led him to alter his swing and change his mentality.\n\nGolf is so much about confidence; it's hard when you're injured and it's hard to gain and keep confidence, Moore said. I had to manage my expectations a little bit. It became 'Let's keep my job, not try to win four times a year.'\n\nIt's hard going from the amount of success I had for that long to losing it, losing that feel and that confidence and hitting the ball where I want to hit it and pick a course apart, to feeling like I was just trying to avoid trouble. You have to find confidence other ways.\n\nAn impressive ball-striker before the injuries, Moore got by with a strong short game, collecting five wins between 2009 and 2016. But it was not until more recently that he elevated his commitment and, consequently, his play.\n\nJeremy Moore, one of Moore's three siblings and also his manager, said Ryan had not approached golf like a career until the past five years.
How Mr. Trump sees the killing of General Suleimani as advancing his broader agenda on Iran is unclear, and on Friday he seemed to portray the operation as something of a one-off: a necessary step to ensure that tensions between the United States and Iran do not spiral out of control. General Suleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks before we caught him in the act and terminated him, the president said from his resort in Palm Beach, Fla., although administration officials did not describe any threats that were different from what they said the general had been orchestrating for years.\n\nWe took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war, Mr. Trump said. The president's decision to kill the general at this time appeared to many military experts as a potentially reckless escalation. But his policy toward Iran, what administration officials call a maximum pressure campaign, has long underestimated how the country would respond to economic sanctions that have crippled its economy.\n\nWhen Iranian operatives blew holes in oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman in June and launched drone strikes on Saudi oil facilities in September, Mr. Trump opted in both cases against a direct, immediate military response. Still, one day after the drone strike targeting General Suleimani, the Pentagon announced it was sending around 3,000 more troops to Kuwait as a precaution against growing threats to American forces in the region.\n\nLindsay P. Cohn, a professor of political science at the Naval War College, said that Mr. Trump appears to be convinced that General Suleimani's death will not lead to a significant surge of violence in the Middle East. It satisfies two imperatives for him: appearing to look tough without taking on, at least for now, any new commitments.\n\nHe doesn't want to get entangled. But he doesn't want to look weak, said Professor Cohn, adding that her opinions did not necessarily represent those of the Defense Department.\n\nThe president's mercurial approach to Iran has left a trail of alienated allies — including European NATO allies angry about his decision to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and Arab nations in the Persian Gulf region uncertain about Mr. Trump's resolve to support them in the face of direct attack from Iran.
As President Trump has sought to overturn the election results, his personal lawyers paraded themselves before television hosts, state elections officials and anyone else willing to entertain their baseless claims of voter fraud.\n\nBut behind the scenes, a longtime conservative lawyer named Cleta Mitchell quietly helped. Her work for Mr. Trump drew widespread attention for the first time over the weekend, when a recording was released of an hourlong call in which Mr. Trump threatened Georgia elections officials with a criminal offense if they failed to find enough votes to change the state's presidential results.\n\nOn the call, Ms. Mitchell repeatedly jumped in to help Mr. Trump, showing an intimate level of involvement in his efforts as they made baseless claims about the election and pressed Georgia officials to hand over election data.\n\nMs. Mitchell is a partner at the law firm Foley & Lardner, which has over 1,000 lawyers and an office in nearly every major city in the United States and represents large corporations such as CVS Pharmacy. Her presence on the call stood out because Mr. Trump has struggled to attract high-profile lawyers to aid his attempts to overturn the election, instead relying on a group that has included Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who has pushed outlandish claims in defense of Mr. Trump throughout his presidency, and Sidney Powell, who has espoused conspiracy theories.
Too often, this is the case. The fine for a misdemeanor is typically about $1,000, which can be unmanageable for a low-income person. This comes on top of many other costs. The application fee a defendant must pay to hire a public defender (appointed because a person charged with a crime cannot afford to pay for an attorney) can be as high as $400. Jail booking fees range from $10 to $100. In some states, defendants can be made to pay fees upward of $200 for the juries who hear their cases. After conviction, victim's panel classes, where some defendants are mandated to hear about victims' experiences and loss, can cost up to $75. Drug courts can and often do make people pay for their own assessment, treatment and frequent drug testing.\n\nThis system shifts the costs of our criminal justice system to the people processed by the system. Juvenile, traffic, misdemeanor and felony courts all rely on monetary sanctions. Fines, court-user fees, surcharges, assessments, interest, collection and per-payment fees fund everything from local law enforcement departments to county jails. Even some municipal services not connected to law enforcement, like campaign elections, are paid for by fines and fees imposed on citizens convicted of — or simply accused of — breaking the law.\n\nThese people are paying for the system of justice from which we all benefit, but they cannot afford to do so. They are often poor, unemployed and of color. In research on monetary sanctions in nine states, my research team and I found that many people have trouble navigating the legal process associated with fines and fees, like finding out how much money they owe and meeting minimum payment requirements. Of the 380 people we interviewed, over half received public assistance and a vast majority had problems paying their legal debt. Many people with court debt suffered added consequences related to their indigence — like difficulty meeting other financial obligations, and mental and physical ailments. They also had to answer to the court for their nonpayment.\n\nFines for drug offenses, in particular, can have long-term consequences for people who are unable to pay. In many jurisdictions, if a person cannot pay a court-imposed fine, probation is lengthened, warrants are issued and he or she can even be jailed for nonpayment. The burden is piled on, as interest, surcharges and collection fees are added to unpaid court costs.\n\nIt doesn't have to be this way. While prosecutors do not directly fine defendants, they have discretion when it comes to which fines and fees they recommend to judges. New prosecutors who are serious about making progressive changes should be aware that alternatives to incarceration like diversion programs and classes and treatment come at a cost — literally.

A supernatural thriller from John Krasinski, a bawdy sex-prevention comedy, a new TV project from Jordan Peele and odd Bill Murray stories are all part of the South by Southwest film festival lineup, organizers announced Wednesday.\n\nThough movie distribution models are continuing to shift, the festival's producer, Janet Pierson, said SXSW's role was unchanged. Our job is to connect talent with audience, she said by phone from Austin, Tex., the festival's home. As the different means of delivery and formats change, we're just looking for people who make compelling work.\n\nSXSW has long showcased new television series, and this year it will also screen independent TV pilots. But the movies are still the biggest thing. This year's festival will run March 9-17. Here are five selections from the lineup that are likely to generate chatter.
The House Republicans' experiment with continuously nationalized politics didn't work out. Politics operates as two interlocking systems, sort of like your left and right brain hemispheres: One system is local, parochial, individualized, pragmatic, while the other involves big national choices and ideas. Successful politicians and parties operate at both levels. Politics of local interests alone can lead to the kind of logrolling bargains — you support my farm subsidy and I'll support your oil-drilling tax break — that create a functioning Congress but risk losing sight of big national obligations such as addressing climate change. But nationalized politics alone strips away the many little points of common ground that cut across polarizing lines of ideology and help make bargains and compromise possible. When the two systems are both healthy, when politicians are engaged both with big ideas and with their own constituents and their concerns, it brings a kind of fluidity to politics that we've seen in more productive periods, such as the 1980s.\n\nIf the new members of Congress are able to govern as they campaigned, tirelessly, unafraid of hostile audiences, deeply connected to their districts, focused on improving individual lives, they might eventually pull politics out of the box in which either one party pushes through an entire unpopular agenda or Congress is paralyzed. A newfound focus on the local will also allow new members to bring forward innovations in local government and civic engagement.\n\nBut today's politicians face an obstacle that the class of '74 could mostly ignore: the enormous cost of campaigns. Republican members fell out of touch with their districts in part because they were increasingly dependent on a few large national donors, operating through super PACs and political nonprofits such as the Congressional Leadership Fund, which get the bulk of their donations from billionaires in Las Vegas, New York, Texas and Florida. Democrats, too, relied on these outside groups and their own billionaires, but 2018 brought an enormous wave of small donors. And while much of that came from fired-up progressives in solid Democratic districts, even in the highest-profile races, a surprising share came from the candidates' own constituents — for example, more than 54 percent of Beto O'Rourke's contributions came from Texans. A majority of Democratic challengers also refused corporate PAC money, which often runs through Washington lobbyists.\n\nIn 2020 and 2022, these new members will no longer be exciting insurgent challengers but incumbents, probably forced to compromise in ways that some supporters might find disappointing. If the volunteer energy and small-donor support that lifted them to victory in 2018 is missing, their campaigns will look very different. They'll have to turn to corporate PACs again and, much like their predecessors elected in 2006 and 2008, focus their attention on donors rather than their districts, compromising their promises.\n\nThe Democratic caucus has announced plans to make a package of political reforms, including the provisions to encourage small donors long championed by John Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, their top priority, bearing the symbolic bill number H.R. 1. In addition to highlighting corruption and the corrosive consequences of the post-Citizens United era, such reforms, if they were ever to pass, could give elected officials a way to stay in better touch with their districts, spending more time with voters and that way keeping the vital, diverse local dimension of politics alive even in a time of deep national polarization.\n\nMark Schmitt (@mschmitt9) is the director of the political reform program at the research organization New America.\n\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.
1. 2020 may be over, but election season is not.\n\nControl of the Senate — and with it, the fate of President-elect Joe Biden's agenda — will be determined on Tuesday as voters in Georgia head to the polls in twin Senate runoff elections. Both the Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff need to defeat the Republican incumbents Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue for Democratic control of the chamber. Above, early voting in Marietta, Ga.\n\nWhile polls suggest that the state's crucial Senate seats are up for grabs, Republicans have grown worried about strong turnout in Democratic areas and mixed messages from President Trump, who baselessly called the Senate races illegal and invalid.
When John and Marcy Palinkas first moved to Hillsborough more than 20 years ago, they were more concerned with finding the right house than with the location, even though living in this Central New Jersey township meant Mr. Palinkas would have a two-hour work commute each day.\n\nAs it turned out, location mattered more than they had realized. Although Mr. Palinkas now has a home-based digital consulting business that allows him to live anywhere, he and his wife decided to buy again recently in Hillsborough when it came time to downsize from their four-bedroom center-hall colonial.\n\nThe couple, now in their 60s, had checked out active adult communities in Delaware and Southern California, but opted to remain in Hillsborough so that Mrs. Palinkas, a retired insurance rater, could run the township's senior programs and food pantry. She had started out volunteering in the township's social services department and eventually landed a permanent job.\n\nShe's doing the job she always wanted, Mr. Palinkas said. And because she's there, she's made a lot of connections with the township we never had before. Now we know a ton of people.
This fire season has been one of the worst in Australia's history, with at least 15 people killed, hundreds of homes destroyed and millions of acres burned. And summer is far from over.\n\nThis week, thousands of residents and vacationers in southeastern Australia were forced to evacuate to shorelines as bush fires encircled communities and razed scores of buildings. Military ships and aircraft were deployed on Wednesday to deliver water, food and fuel to towns cut off by the fires.\n\nThe hot, dry conditions that have fueled the fires are nothing new in Australia. Here's why this fire season has been so calamitous.
Good morning.\n\n(Here's the sign-up, if you don't already get California Today delivered to your inbox.)\n\nOn Friday, we took a close look at one of the highest profile laws to take effect in California at the start of the year, aimed at giving consumers new rights to know what personal data companies are collecting and how they're using it.\n\nBut at the beginning of the year, lots more laws officially went into effect. Hundreds of them.\n\n(To be more specific, 870 laws were enacted in last year's regular session, according to a state report. But some of them — like Assembly Bill 420, which established a cannabis research program — went into effect immediately, while others won't go into effect until later.)\n\nAs I've mentioned, we'll dig into some of the more complicated new rules in coming weeks.\n\nThe state's new rent cap, a major step meant to address the housing crisis, is one of those.
No, he said. It's been great. I think because it's taken me so long to get there, obviously I want to try to stay there. But also I feel like I'm mature enough now to handle it. Maybe if it happens when you're very young, you might feel extra pressures. The responsibilities might feel a bit much, but I think because I'm much older and more mature, it's been good.\n\nThe conventional tennis wisdom is that it is harder to hang on at the top than to reach the top.\n\nI hope not, Murray said.\n\nBut for anyone who believes that he now has nowhere to go but down, that is hardly true in Australia.\n\nHe has reached five singles finals in Melbourne and lost all five. No man has done so well at any Grand Slam tournament without breaking through to win the title.\n\nOthers have lost five finals in the same major event, including Lendl, who lost five at the United States Open. But he also won three. Bill Johnston lost six finals at the United States Championships, but won the event twice. John Bromwich lost five finals at the Australian Championships in the pre-Open era, but won the title twice, too.\n\nMurray, at 29, is in unfortunately uncharted territory, all the more so because Novak Djokovic ended his own long run of frustration at the French Open last year by finally taking the title after reaching four semifinals and three finals.
Depersonalization is a dissociative disorder characterized by a sense of observing one's self from outside one's body. Those with the condition often report an experience akin to watching yourself in a movie. My 86-year-old stepfather, Chuckie O'Brien, does not suffer from depersonalization. But for more than half his life, 44 years, he has watched himself portrayed in news articles, books and motion pictures — most recently, in Martin Scorsese's The Irishman — as someone he is not. The effect on his life has been devastating.\n\nChuckie was the most intimate associate of Jimmy Hoffa, the Teamsters union leader who famously disappeared from a suburban Detroit parking lot on July 30, 1975. Within two weeks, the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced its belief, based on circumstantial evidence, that Chuckie had abducted Mr. Hoffa from the parking lot through force and violence. Ever since, Chuckie's involvement in the crime has been widely repeated and broadly accepted. The charge ruined his life. The government pursued him aggressively and often leaked falsehoods to the press to pressure him into cooperating. He was ostracized in the Teamsters union and lost many friends. And worst of all, at least to Chuckie, the allegation deeply stained his honor.\n\nThis is all tragic because the conventional wisdom about Chuckie is false. For decades, the F.B.I. has not suspected him of involvement in the disappearance. The circumstantial case against Chuckie fell apart long ago, and his known whereabouts on the fateful day make it practically impossible that he picked up Mr. Hoffa. Unfortunately, the government never made this information public. And so Chuckie's innocence in one of the most notorious crimes of the 20th century remains mostly hidden, his guilt remains publicly presumed, his honor remains soiled.\n\nIt has been a bizarre experience, and a grim one, for Chuckie to read so many made-up things about himself over so many decades and not be able to do anything about it. Everybody that's written these books, they all surmise what happened, he once explained to me. They have no facts on them, they have no truth on them. The book gets printed and it goes out and they sell them, and that's it.
_________\n\nThe word impresario has appeared in 92 articles on NYTimes.com in the past year, including on Sept. 26 in Jennifer Lopez and Shakira to Perform at Super Bowl LIV by Ken Belson and Julia Jacobs:\n\nJennifer Lopez and Shakira will perform at the Super Bowl in Miami in February as the N.F.L. tries to restore the cachet of its halftime show.\n\nThe two artists were the first chosen for the halftime show since the N.F.L. formed a broad partnership last month with Jay-Z, the music impresario who will help produce entertainment at the Super Bowl and other prominent N.F.L. events, and support the league's social activism campaign, Inspire Change.
The 52 Places to Go list is one of Travel's biggest efforts of the year, for which The Times enlists writers and photographers around the globe, as well as a cadre of editors, designers and interactive specialists who work to produce it. Until the list is published early on Wednesday morning, I can't reveal what spots made it, but I can offer some insight into how it is put together.\n\nI became The Times's Travel editor at the end of October, just as the process was ramping up, and I had to leap into the deep end.\n\nTo start, the editors on the Travel desk asked the journalists who have written for us in the past what places they find most intriguing. We asked them to pitch their favorite destinations in about 150 words or so, about the length of the final write-ups. Their suggestions were compiled into one big document, which this year ran to more than 70 pages. In some cases, multiple writers suggested the same place — often because there was some new development, or a special event taking place in 2019 — and a number of them made our final list.
It is doubtless upsetting to hit a bird or animal, and many people swerve to avoid them. Others don't, either because the circumstances would make swerving dangerous or because — whether through indifference or rationality — they don't accept that responsibility for the situation lies in their hands. The driving situation, in other words, does not legislate for the behavior of animals, and so it is not the individual driver's job to avoid them. The car itself, of course, is designed to protect the people inside it, not the objects that cross its path. The airbag that cushions the driver in the event of a collision does not have its exterior equivalent to cushion the thing being collided with. Yet in its weight and hardness, its velocity and power, the car is a more or less invincible aggressor. Nothing soft and living stands a chance against it. When cars were first invented, the number of people and animals they hit was proportionately extremely high: The car was not yet a reality that could be anticipated and avoided, to such an extent that early cars had to have a person walking in front of them waving a red flag. An analogy might be that if rocks suddenly began falling from the sky, many people would be hit by rocks before they developed systems and strategies to protect themselves. Yet around here at least, these systems are rudimentary compared with the cars' own advancements in speed and comfort and passenger safety.\n\nIt is often regretted that children can no longer play or move freely outside because of the dangers of traffic; inevitably, many of the people who voice these regrets are also the drivers of cars, as those same restricted children will come to be in their time. What is being mourned, it seems, is not so much the decline of an old world of freedom as the existence of comforts and conveniences the individual feels powerless to resist, and which in any case he or she could not truthfully say they wished would be abolished. There is a feeling, nonetheless, of loss, and it may be that the increasing luxury of the world inside the car is a kind of consolation for the degradation of the world outside it.\n\nBecause of family circumstances, during the past couple of years I have had to drive frequently to the city and back. Emerging from the countryside, I am often startled by the ceaseless flow of heavy traffic. It seems incredible to me that so many people could be pursuing their private aims in this public way. But are cars people?\n\nThe spectacle of mass movement can look like something unstoppable, yet it is the easiest thing in the world to impede the flow of traffic or to bring it to a halt. On my route, there are long stretches of motorway, and the traffic is always thickening or lengthening as it meets and then absorbs an obstruction. It doesn't take much for this thickening to become an actual blockage. The sense of embroilment usually comes without any knowledge of what has caused it: Often the first sign of it is an increase in awareness of the individual identity of other drivers. The forward-flying host begins to be differentiated; cars that seemed anonymous and distant become closer and more familiar; a web of recognition begins to form itself. The phase of community that follows — lacking any redeeming narrative or central event — is more or less indistinguishable from mutual entrapment. In this context, the difference between a car and a person is not entirely clear. Moments earlier, the car was the disguise for, and the enlargement of, the driver's will. Shortly, when the traffic stops, it will become his burden and his prison. But during the phase of transition, their mutual relationship seems more biological, a kind of linked separateness.\n\nAll sorts of things can cause the traffic to stop: an accident, a scene at the side of the road. It's often surprising how minor these dramas are, compared to the size and extent of their consequences. Their power is cumulative; it arises from the number of people exposed to the incident, however trivial. I once talked to a man who specialized in patterns of traffic flow, and he showed me a set of diagrams illustrating how the merest distraction in one place, something so small that it would cause passers-by to briefly glance at it and therefore unconsciously decrease their speed, could over time result in the whole motorway coming to a standstill in another place miles away.\n\nThe drama of the road, once you have been observing and participating in it for a number of years, can be seen to change and develop. New themes arise or die out; new narratives emerge and either progress or fade away again; certain behaviors grow widespread and occasionally take hold. In Britain, for instance, the fast lane of the motorway is increasingly full of people driving slowly, while the other two lanes are often more or less empty. On a motorway, it might be said that you ought to know your place: Here, increasingly, it is clear that a majority of people — wrongly or otherwise — believe that place to be the fast lane. This belief, and the behavior that attends it, has numerous consequences, one of which is that it is now almost impossible to get quickly where you want to go. Rather than representing an opportunity for passing, the fast lane is dominated by the person going most slowly, who dictates the speed at which everything behind him is traveling.
GORHAM, N.H. — The moment you step out into the frozen air on the way up Mount Washington — one of the most frigid spots in the lower 48 — the icy wind steals your breath and freezes your eyelashes. You can't blink. The cold stabs your face and numbs your earlobes to rubber.\n\nIt's an icy hell, said Amy Loughlin, 50, who was visiting from Austin, Tex., and scaling the mountain, the highest in the Northeast, in the back of a SnowCoach — a van retrofitted with tanklike treads to handle the blowing snow and treacherous roads.\n\nWith much of the Northeast and Midwest feeling like a block of ice, the temperature here in the high peaks of New Hampshire's White Mountains was forecast to drop to 40 degrees below zero overnight Friday. The wind chill could make the air feel as cold as 100 below zero. That is not a typo. Negative. 100.\n\nWe should end up being the coldest location tonight in the lower 48, said Mike Carmon, senior meteorologist at the Mount Washington Observatory, who was one of a handful of scientists and others huddled at the top of one of the most dangerous and forbidding places in the country. We basically just start saying it's stupid cold outside.
Find all our Student Opinion questions here.\n\nWelcome to 2020, a new year and the start of a brand-new decade. What predictions can you make about what will happen this year — and this decade? What do you think will happen globally, nationally or locally? What do you think will happen in your personal life? Why?\n\nIn the Opinion essay No More Phones and Other Tech Predictions for the Next Decade, Kara Swisher expresses her belief that technology will bring positive changes in the next few years:\n\nWe haven't quite dealt with all of the repercussions of tech's domination of the past decade — there will be regulations, a lot of tech is still addictive, and digital hate will continue to travel halfway around the world before the truth gets out of bed — but there are some big, positive ideas that I think you will hear a lot more about in the coming years. While I have been a strong critic of tech, and it is easy to chew over what's gone wrong — it makes for a large meal — I think it is more helpful, as 2020 dawns, to put forth five predictions that I hope will allow us to live more peacefully with the tech that we love and hate.\n\nWith regard to climate change, she writes:\n\nMore investment in tech that addresses climate change. With all due respect to Greta Thunberg and the efforts of young people across the globe to bring attention to climate change, governments may never agree on how to properly address our lurch toward environmental suicide. Which is why it is critically important that tech turn its focus toward creating products that will save us.\n\nAbout jobs, she writes:\n\nAutomation for good. There has been a lot of discussion about the job-killing potential of tech, including how an unholy combination of automation, robotics and artificial intelligence will be the death of employment. Many jobs will, in fact, be replaced by tech, especially ones that are rote and also many that are high paying in medicine, law and more. But this is also an opportunity to rethink the entire way we imagine employment and education.\n\nAnd, she imagines a brighter future for social media:\n\nIs there a business in depolarization? I get that the forces of cynicism, manipulation and hate are forever on the digital march, but I am convinced that there is money to be made in appealing to our weariness with how our tech lives have been shaped. There are ways to foster digital interaction that do not have to incite rage. The reason much of social media feels so toxic is it has been built for speed, virality and attention grabbing rather than for context and accuracy. While it seems impossible to imagine a new kind of social-network product in the shadow of Facebook, TikTok, for all its controversy as a Chinese-owned company, has been a runaway success (the first big social success since Snapchat arrived in 2011), and there is room for more. There are opportunities to create new forms of communication that give the advantage to users — by strictly enforcing behavior standards and eliminating anonymity, and most of all, with advertising-based business plans that are not predicated on taking advantage of our personal data.\n\nStudents, read the entire essay, then tell us:\n\nWhich of Ms. Swisher's five predictions do you think are most likely to come true between now and 2030? Why do you think that?\n\nWhat predictions can you make about how technology — and the way it affects our lives — will change in the next 10 years? How will 2030 be different from 2020?\n\nWhat are your other predictions for the future? How will your community, the nation and the world change? How do you think your life will change in 2020?\n\nMs. Swisher writes that tech devices have been designed to hook you, not unlike sugar or cigarettes or gambling or opiates. She continues:\n\nWhether we move toward more intuitively created tech that surrounds us or that incorporates into our bodies (yes, that's coming), I am going to predict that carrying around a device in our hand and staring at it will be a thing of the past by 2030. And like the electrical grid we rely on daily, most tech will become invisible.\n\nWhat did you think when you read the prediction that technology will find its way into our bodies in the next 10 years? Do you agree with her that most tech will soon enough become invisible? Do you see that as a positive change — or concerning?\n\nStudents 13 and older are invited to comment. All comments are moderated by the Learning Network staff, but please keep in mind that once your comment is accepted, it will be made public.
To the Editor:\n\nRe The Inevitability of Impeachment, by Elizabeth Drew (Op-Ed, Dec. 29):\n\nI have always admired Ms. Drew for her political acumen in writing about Washington. However, in suggesting that congressional Republicans might act to help remove President Trump from office, Ms. Drew is allowing hope to overcome reality.\n\nAside from occasional rebukes to the president, congressional Republicans have resolutely refused to criticize him for his lying, for his denigration of anyone who disagrees with him, and for his policies, which have isolated this country from its allies.\n\nSo to expect these Republicans to suddenly help usher President Trump out of office is to expect them to demonstrate some spine and concern for the well-being of the country — something they have thus far refused to do.\n\nDorian Bowman\n\nCambridge, Mass.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nThank you, Elizabeth Drew, for a glimmer of hope regarding impeachment. For the first time I feel there is hope that enough Republicans will finally do their job and put the country ahead of party. Their power is now diminished, President Trump's behavior continues to be erratic and his lack of leadership before the world will finally force them to seek self-preservation.
KARACHI, Pakistan — Every few weeks I get a phone call or text message informing me that yet another journalist, political activist or someone hyperactive on social media has gone missing. From past experience I know that they have most likely been picked up by one of the secret agencies. I also know that when they return they'll be changed people.\n\nWhen they disappear, they are opinionated and noisy; they believe their 800-word op-ed or their Facebook post or the poem that went viral will change the world. When they return, they have become the sort of people who will say, it was nice knowing you, why don't you shut up and go away?\n\nIt's as if they weren't abducted by the state and kept in a dungeon or a safe house, probably interrogated, in some cases tortured, and always threatened. It's like they went to some rehab program from which they have come back fully reformed and compliant.\n\nIn the past year, hundreds of political activists in Karachi have been picked up, and some renounced their loyalties upon their return. They leave the country if they can; otherwise, they try to become unquestioning citizens. Maybe they are right. What good has ever come of talking about state abduction and torture and solitary confinement?
I knew that the creative process for bend the even, the latest project by the improviser and choreographer Jennifer Monson, involved rehearsals on a prairie at dawn. So when the work, which opened at the Chocolate Factory on Tuesday, began in silence and dim light, I settled in for a meditative experience, a slow reveal. But the first sound came as a shock: a floor-shaking rumble that felt like the start of an earthquake.\n\nI shouldn't have been surprised. Ms. Monson, who has been a revered figure in experimental dance for decades, has lately been known for researching outdoors and for bringing a sense of nature inside. But while her nature studies incorporate much stasis and quiet, her vision of nature is of forces larger than herself — wild, powerful forces that can unexpectedly erupt.\n\nThat initial rumble comes from the sound artist Jeff Kolar, who tweaks the dials and levers of his electronics onstage, making visible his technological manipulation of radio waves, storm surges and cricket chirps. The lighting designer Elliott Cennetoglu also works in full view of the audience, brightening and dimming the world, shading it blue and green. The musician Zeena Parkins is sometimes onstage, brushing a microphone against her clothing, connecting sound with touch. She also plays her harp next to viewers' seats. Her music can be dulcet, as you might expect, though other times it sounds — and feels — like heavy metal.\n\nJoining Ms. Monson is the dancer Mauriah Kraker, an effective foil — younger and more svelte. Although it can be difficult to take your eyes off Ms. Monson, Ms. Kraker is essential. Some of the dance is in unison, all of it interactive. Early on, the two women wrestle, grappling with hooked ankles rather than hands. Near the end, they transfer the activity to their arms, seeming at once to desire entanglement and to push each other out of the way.
'The Room Where It Happened,' by John Bolton (Simon & Schuster, May 12)\n\nDrafts of this book, by a former national security adviser to President Trump, contain an explosive anecdote: that the president said he wanted to continue freezing millions of dollars in aid to Ukraine until officials there agreed to investigate the Bidens and other Democrats — actions at the heart of his impeachment trial. Bolton's account directly contradicts the president's lawyers, as he faces removal from office. The memoir follows a string of political tell-alls, including A Warning, by the anonymous White House official who wrote an Opinion essay in 2018.\n\nImage Credit... Win Mcnamee/Getty Images\n\nUntitled , by Chelsea Manning (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, July 21)\n\nThe former Army intelligence analyst, who was jailed for sharing classified information with WikiLeaks, tells her life story. She has called the memoir a coming-of-age story, outlining what led her to leak the files, her experiences in jail and what made her lose faith in the government.\n\nImage Credit... Whitney Curtis for The New York Times\n\nRodham , by Curtis Sittenfeld (Random House, May 19)\n\nYou already know the protagonist of Sittenfeld's new novel — Hillary Rodham. The book imagines what her life might have been like if she refused to marry Bill Clinton. (She did turn him down twice in real life, before eventually agreeing.) Sittenfeld, the author of Prep, Eligible and other novels, is no stranger to imagining the inner lives of people in the public eye; the protagonist of her novel American Wife is an avatar of another former first lady, Laura Bush.\n\nLong-awaited follow-ups\n\nImage\n\nAfterlife ,' by Julia Alvarez (Workman, April 7)\n\nIt's been nearly 15 years since Alvarez's last novel for adults, and she returns with the story of Antonia, a retired professor whose life is upended by the death of her husband and the appearance of a pregnant undocumented teenager at her door. Alvarez, the author of In the Time of Butterflies, How the García Girls Lost Their Accents and more, explores the changing notions of family and what we owe each other.
Six new paperbacks to check out this week.\n\nELASTIC: UNLOCKING YOUR BRAIN'S ABILITY TO EMBRACE CHANGE, by Leonard Mlodinow. (Vintage, $16.) Our capacity to stretch beyond the bounds of our preconceptions and other deeply held beliefs, what Mlodinow calls elastic thinking, is essential to innovation, creativity and independent thought. He offers an engaging guide to the brain's power to solve new problems, weaving together scientific research, politics and literature.\n\nBRASS, by Xhenet Aliu. (Random House, $17.) Elsie and Lulu, the mother and daughter whose potent relationship forms the core of this debut novel, are desperate to leave behind their hardscrabble lives. As our reviewer, Julie Buntin, put it, the book offers a reminder that assumptions — whether about a place, or a person as close to you as your mother — never tell the full story.\n\nTHE WINE LOVER'S DAUGHTER: A MEMOIR, by Anne Fadiman. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $16.) In her study of her father, the literary critic Clifton Fadiman, the author uses his infatuation with wine to explore the motivations that guide connoisseurship and hedonism. Though Fadiman does not share her father's ardent love of the drink, her wine-focused vignettes sketch a portrait of their complicated relationship.\n\nMACBETH, by Jo Nesbo. Translated by Don Bartlett. (Hogarth Shakespeare, $16.) In his reimagining of Shakespeare's tragedy, the Norwegian crime writer draws out the play's noir elements, transposing its moral choices and plot to 1970s Glasgow as the city strained under corruption, violence and addiction. Our reviewer, James Shapiro, praised the adaptation, calling the book a dark but ultimately hopeful 'Macbeth,' one suited to our own troubled times, in which 'the slowness of democracy' is no match for power-hungry strongmen.
Before reading the article:\n\nWhat do you know about opioids and the national opioid epidemic?\n\nDo you know anyone who has been affected by the opioid epidemic?\n\nScroll through the article and look at the accompanying illustrations. What story do these images tell about opioid addiction?\n\nNow read the article, Heroin Addiction Explained: How Opioids Hijack the Brain, and answer the following questions:\n\n1. The article begins dramatically: The opioid epidemic is devastating America. What evidence does the author provide to support this statement? Do you believe this claim is justified?\n\n2. According to the author, why do people start using opioids? What are endorphins? What is their role in addiction? Explain the statement: A drug like heroin creates a tidal wave in the reward circuits of the brain.
Delaying refunds will likely lead to additional financial hardships for some of these families, the report noted, because they are used to being able to use their refunds much earlier.\n\nUsually, the report said, the I.R.S. begins issuing refunds by the end of January. But with the new requirement, even someone who files as soon as tax season begins — this year, it starts on Jan. 23 — won't get their refund until mid- to late February.\n\nAs a result, filers who were unaware of the delay may find themselves short of cash. They are used to getting, and expect to get, their refunds at a certain time, said Chi Chi Wu, a lawyer with the National Consumer Law Center.\n\nBecause of the delay in the refunds, Ms. Wu said, she expects there will be more demand for tax refund advances, loans often offered by professional tax chains. As a result, she said, choosing a preparer carefully is very important, to make sure consumers aren't charged excessive fees or interest.\n\nHow Has the Pandemic Changed Your Taxes? Will stimulus payments be taxed? Nope. The so-called economic impact payments are not treated as income. In fact, they're technically an advance on a tax credit, known as the Recovery Rebate Credit. The payments could indirectly affect what you pay in state income taxes in a handful of states, where federal tax is deductible against state taxable income, as our colleague Ann Carrns wrote. Read more. Are my unemployment benefits taxable? Mostly. Unemployment insurance is generally subject to federal as well as state income tax, though there are exceptions (Nine states don't impose their own income taxes, and another six exempt unemployment payments from taxation, according to the Tax Foundation). But you won't owe so-called payroll taxes, which pay for Social Security and Medicare. The new relief bill will make the first $10,200 of benefits tax-free if your income is less than $150,000. This applies to 2020 only. (If you've already filed your taxes, watch for I.R.S. guidance.) Unlike paychecks from an employer, taxes for unemployment aren't automatically withheld. Recipients must opt in — and even when they do, federal taxes are withheld only at a flat rate of 10 percent of benefits. While the new tax break will provide a cushion, some people could still owe the I.R.S. or certain states money. Read more. I worked from home this year. Can I take the home office deduction? Probably not, unless you're self-employed, an independent contractor or a gig worker. The tax law overhaul of late 2019 eliminated the home office deduction for employees from 2018 through 2025. Employees who receive a paycheck or a W-2 exclusively from an employer are not eligible for the deduction, even if they are currently working from home, the I.R.S. said. Read more. How does the family leave credit work? Self-employed people can take paid caregiving leave if their child's school is closed or their usual child care provider is unavailable because of the outbreak. This works similarly to the smaller sick leave credit — 67 percent of average daily earnings (for either 2020 or 2019), up to $200 a day. But the caregiving leave can be taken for 50 days. Read more. Have rules changed on charitable giving? Yes. This year, you can deduct up to $300 for charitable contributions, even if you use the standard deduction. Previously, only people who itemized could claim these deductions. Donations must be made in cash (for these purposes, this includes check, credit card or debit card), and can't include securities, household items or other property. For 2021, the deduction limit will double to $600 for joint filers. Rules for itemizers became more generous as well. The limit on charitable donations has been suspended, so individuals can contribute up to 100 percent of their adjusted gross income, up from 60 percent. But these donations must be made to public charities in cash; the old rules apply to contributions made to donor-advised funds, for example. Both provisions are available through 2021. Read more.\n\nJohn Breyault, vice president of public policy with the National Consumers League, said tax filers who are claiming the credits should be skeptical of preparers promising to get their refund early. There's no way around this delay, he said. It's the law.\n\nWhat's really being offered is a loan, he said, which may have unfavorable terms.\n\nMost states don't regulate tax preparers. Ms. Wu advises asking preparers what formal training or professional credentials they have, how long they have been preparing tax returns and what the specific fees are for tax preparation and for any advance or loan. Additional tips for choosing a preparer are available from the Consumer Federation of America.\n\nFree tax help from trained volunteers is available for low- and moderate-income filers through the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program; sites generally open near the end of January and users can search online for a location nearby.
Grainy and circular, the sound in the dark could be that of a scratchy old record. But when the lights come up, you see that it is the tap dancer Caleb Teicher, caressing a sanded floor with his leather shoes: not a scratchy old record at all, but a young artist trying new things.\n\nIn More Forever, which had its premiere in the Guggenheim Museum's Works & Process series on Sunday, Mr. Teicher is joined by his company and at the piano by the composer Conrad Tao. Mr. Teicher and Mr. Tao are former teenage prodigies, now in their mid-20s, garnering much attention and acclaim as they mature in public. At its best, their More Forever is both youthful and sophisticated.\n\nThis is a tap show without tap shoes. Mr. Teicher is reaching back before the invention of metal taps to an earlier tradition of thumping and scraping, but he applies it to his own ends. He starts quietly in a corner of the stage, and as other dancers pass through, trailing what looks like sand (it's cornmeal) from their fists, they leave another soloist in another corner. This happens again and again, until the corners are full.\n\nSuddenly, a dancer center stage (the ebullient Macy Sullivan) takes the dance up tempo and onto the balls of her feet. The other dancers follow, locking into diagonals, lines and circles while the rhythms change. One by one, they depart, exiting with a funny little hop.
If we don't provide an exit strategy for ex-offenders, they are just going to be re-offenders, Mr. Vance said. It's just really common sense.\n\nThe college initiative is part of a broader agenda touching on criminal justice reform and social issues that the governor outlined on Sunday, including seeking an additional $100 million for so-called community schools, which aim to address challenges for students beyond the classroom, an approach tried in New York City and other urban areas. He also wants $55 million for jobs programs for at-risk youths, a category that includes those who have committed crimes.\n\nImage Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney. Credit... Branden Camp/Associated Press\n\nThe governor also announced an agreement with the state Office of Court Administration to stop making some juvenile criminal records available for purchase from private data and background check companies. That change, expected to take effect this month, comes in conjunction with a recent executive action by the governor to pardon as many as 10,000 people who were convicted of nonviolent crimes as 16- and 17-year-olds but have since avoided criminal activity.\n\nSome state prisons already offer a handful of college courses, but Mr. Vance said the new initiative would expand those programs by about a third. It would also improve them so that credits could be more easily transferred to colleges outside prison walls, a problem that has bedeviled the existing system.\n\nThe proposal would offer colleges and other educational institutions up to $5,000 per student to provide a full-time course load of 30 college credits, according to the district attorney's office. Only inmates who have a high school degree and are within two to five years of completing their sentences would be eligible. Those serving life sentences would be disqualified.\n\nMr. Vance said studies had shown that educated inmates were less likely to commit crimes when they left prison, an outcome even law-and-order-minded prosecutors could embrace.
You don't look well, the man at the gas station told the older woman in the car. He'd known her for years, always thinking of her as a lively, robust woman. But that day she looked pale and tired. Her sharp blue eyes seemed dim. She gave a feeble smile. I don't feel well at all, she told him.\n\nThere's an urgent-care clinic just up the street, he said. Could she make it there? She was nearly 45 minutes away from her home in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Stopping just up the street seemed a much better option. At the clinic, the doctor took one look at her, put a blood pressure cuff around her arm and told her assistant to call an ambulance.\n\nSurprising Blood Pressure\n\nThe rest of the day was a blur. The woman remembers being bundled onto a stretcher and one of the E.M.T.s saying her blood pressure was very low. It was an odd thing to hear, because her blood pressure was usually high enough to require three medications.\n\nShe was taken to the emergency room at the Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Center in Halifax. She remembers being fussed over — having blood drawn, receiving intravenous fluids, feeling sticky snaps being placed on her chest that connected her to a continuous heart monitor. She had been a nurse for many years when she was younger, yet seeing herself at the center of these familiar activities was strange. A blood test indicated that there may have been damage to her heart. The doctor told her she was having a heart attack, she recalls.
HUARAZ, Peru\n\nAT 50, Americo González Caldua has lived a life that coincided with the retreat of the glaciers of the high Andes. With each passing year, as the cold mountain temperatures rise, the ice moves uphill another 20 yards.\n\nIn the dry season, when the storms break and the research season begins, Mr. González heads to the icy heights of the nearby peaks with survey prisms and markers. He brings heavy drilling augers that bore core samples deep below the surface of the glaciers and reveal a picture of the atmosphere from a century ago.\n\nHe knows the ice sheet as well as anyone. Yet, Mr. González is neither a mountaineer nor a scientist: He's the man most often found trailing behind them, carrying their equipment.\n\nMount Everest has the Sherpas. The Cordillera Blanca, a snowy mountain range in northern Peru, has the ayudantes de campo, or field helpers, in Spanish. They are the mountain men, mainly indigenous, who have watched a huge expanse of ice that was known to them for centuries shrink drastically in the space of one generation.
Q. How do you change the folder colors on a Mac? I can never find the folder I want on my desktop with all of them blue.\n\nA. Apple provides several ways to customize your Mac's desktop and its icons, including changing a folder's look. In one approach, start by clicking once on a desktop folder to select it, and then press the Command and I keys on the keyboard to open its Get Info box. (As an alternative, you can right-click or hold down the Control key and click the icon and choose Get Info from the contextual menu that appears.)\n\nAt the top of the Get Info box, click the folder icon once to select it and then press the Command and C keys to copy it; you can also choose the Copy command from the Edit menu if you are averse to keyboard shortcuts. After you have copied the icon, open the Preview program, which is found in the Mac's Applications folder.\n\nImage In the Mac's Preview program, use the Adjust Color box to create a new shade of folder. Credit... The New York Times\n\nWhen the Preview app is open, press the Command and N keys, or go to the File menu and choose New from clipboard. A window opens showing several folder icons. Next, press the Option, Command and C keys — or go to the Tools Menu and select Adjust Color.
Do you know what a Q fare is? How about an X or a Z? When you browse for flights on an airline's website, assorted letters appear in your search results. Travelers often miss them. Or see them but don't factor them into their decision about which flight to choose. But these letters matter. Because of them, the person to your left may receive more award miles than you, reach elite status faster than you, or change her itinerary at no cost while you pay a $200 fee — yet you're both in the same cabin. What gives?\n\nAs many frequent fliers know, the visible class distinctions on airplanes (Economy, Premium Economy, Business, First) are further divided into invisible groups called fare classes, or booking codes. Different airlines assign different letters to these classes, which can also vary from carrier to carrier. Knowing the ABCs of fare classes may help you attain elite status, avoid penalties for changing and canceling flights, and rack up miles, among other things. If you're aiming to earn award miles by flying an airline that's partners with your primary carrier, it's particularly important to learn how to make fare classes work in your favor.\n\nThe major American airlines have charts that show the relationship between their fare class letters and the miles you'll receive if you fly in those classes — though they don't exactly make it easy to find them. The fastest way is to search the web for your airline's name and the words fare class chart. Here are links for the big three's charts: American's is Aa.com/i18n/AAdvantage/earnMiles/airlines/american.jsp; Delta's is Delta.com/content/www/en_US/skymiles/earn-miles/earn-miles-with-delta.html; and United's United.com/web/en-US/content/booking/flight/fareClass.aspx.\n\nWhat those charts don't show are details about the flexibility of each fare class. To see the complete rules, including how much you have to pay for itinerary changes, you often have to go deep in the flight search process, almost to the payment page. That said, airline websites tend to make it clear early on in a search whether a ticket can be refunded and if changes can be made. I'll touch on this again below. For now, let's look at how fare classes relate to earning award miles, and miles that count toward elite status.
As the former president of New York City Transit — a part of the M.T.A. responsible for the city's buses and subways — and someone who witnessed firsthand the level of destruction and its impact on subway infrastructure as a result of Superstorm Sandy, I am concerned that the decision to change course on the Canarsie Tunnel project is premature and uninformed. This new plan has not been fully evaluated in terms of costs, available M.T.A. resources and, most important, safety.\n\nNor am I aware that the technology recommended to repair the benchwall has ever been used in an under-river environment. As president of New York City Transit, I would have found this new course of action completely unacceptable.\n\nIt is totally understandable that for those living in the communities affected, this news is wildly popular, as it will allow for trains to run through the tunnel during construction. However, since transit engineers were not consulted as part of this new plan, the lack of in-depth knowledge of what's at stake leaves me concerned for the future safety and reliability of this under-river tunnel.\n\nThe decision to reconstruct the tunnel after the storm was not made lightly. Transit leadership and the M.T.A. board knew the effects on the community would be extraordinarily difficult. We looked at every possibility before deciding to shut down the entire tube. We modeled numerous operation and construction scenarios short of a total shutdown, but all had significant safety and operational concerns and fell well short of a long-term fix.\n\nBelieve me, transit decision makers would have seized on a viable solution that would have accomplished the task and still allowed for adequate and safe train service — but that solution did not materialize. While a total shutdown is painful to the community and businesses alike, the pain was measured in months rather than years, and safety and the long-term viability of the tunnel were at the center of that decision.
He was getting over a cold and had a four-month-old at home — he and Ms. Kazan, with whom he co-wrote Wildlife, welcomed Alma in August. But he was warm and genial, brightening as he began to report on his fledgling days of fatherhood.\n\nI didn't think I would like it so much; I mean, I thought I would like it, but it's really quite astonishing, he said. In a crisp, black-and-blue flannel, a nest of light-brown hair and olive librarian glasses he could have passed as an adjunct at the Iowa Writers' Workshop. There's just a sort of … I don't know, a hope or something. Seeing something so innocent and pure and unsullied by the world.\n\nMr. Dano, who has self-diagnosed dorky impulses and relishes researching a role, spent that last movie-less year, in 2003, as a New School freshman studying English and Russian literature. To portray the Beach Boys frontman Brian Wilson in 2015's Love & Mercy he learned to play piano. But now he's found the ultimate research project.\n\nThere's something about being there for the first moments, the fragility, which really begins at conception, he continued. And the heart has this chemical reaction on the first breath — the chambers change, because you've switched from breathing amniotic fluid to oxygen. And then that breath just keeps going, and going, and it doesn't stop until we … It's just mind-blowing stuff.\n\nHe was born in Manhattan to a father who was a financial adviser and a mother who raised him and his younger sister (a half brother is 16 years older). Mr. Dano was acting in school plays and community theater as far back as he can remember, a summer activity that ended up gathering steam, and by the time he was 12 he was performing on Broadway, with George C. Scott, in the 1996 production of Inherit the Wind.\n\nAt 16, he starred in his first feature film (and won an Independent Spirit Award) as a reckless, libidinous teenager coping with his mother's death in the Long Island-based indie L.I.E.

The Max is Boeing's most important plane, with about 5,000 ordered by airlines around the world. But as the grounding has dragged on, Boeing said it would temporarily shut down its 737 factory, jolting thousands of suppliers and stoking the concern of President Trump.\n\nBoeing abruptly fired its chief executive late last month after he alienated the F.A.A. and airline customers. His successor is now contending with the fallout, as Boeing's share price has fallen by 21 percent and the company faces tens of billions of dollars in charges related to the grounding.\n\nRegulators have suggested that the Max could be approved to fly again by the spring, a timetable that could still hold. The company says that even if it needs to fix the wiring issue, it would only take one to two hours per plane to separate the wiring bundles on the Max using a clamp.\n\nWe are working closely with the F.A.A. and other regulators on a robust and thorough certification process to ensure a safe and compliant design, Gordon Johndroe, a Boeing spokesman, said in a statement. We identified these issues as part of that rigorous process, and we are working with the F.A.A. to perform the appropriate analysis. It would be premature to speculate as to whether this analysis will lead to any design changes.\n\nInvestigations by international regulators into the cause of the two Max crashes determined that pilots of those flights did not respond as quickly or effectively as Boeing and the F.A.A., using accepted industry standards, presumed they would when designing and evaluating the MCAS software.\n\nSo in developing a software update for the Max, Boeing and the F.A.A. recognized that the previous industry assumptions should be changed, and that they needed to consider what would happen if it took crews much longer to act in the face of emergencies.\n\nUsing that new set of assumptions about pilot reactions, Boeing discovered that if two wire bundles placed close together toward the rear of the plane caused an electrical short, it could lead to a catastrophic accident. The wiring connects to the motor that controls the stabilizer, the horizontal fin on a plane's tail, sending signals from the flight control computer that can push the nose down or lift it up.
For Najairee Davis, high school was synonymous with bouts of anger and frustration. She had the hallway fights, suspensions and detention to prove it.\n\nEarly in Ms. Davis's high school career, her father was incarcerated on manslaughter charges. I was just angry, Ms. Davis, 18, recalled. I wouldn't talk to anybody. I wasn't feeling good about anything.\n\nAcademics were no longer a priority; she shut everyone out. And if pressed on anything, she said, she would pick fights with classmates. Ms. Davis got a bad reputation at school, and said it was not long before teachers simply assumed she was to blame for any confrontation. Everyone else went unpunished, she said.\n\nHer principal at Frederick Douglass Academy in West Harlem suggested she might benefit from transferring to a different school, one designed for students who struggle in more traditional education settings. Her boyfriend had attended such a school, and compared the experience to being surrounded by a supportive family.
Seventeen notable New York City hotels have committed to getting greener.\n\nMarquee properties like the Waldorf Astoria New York, Grand Hyatt New York, Loews Regency New York and the Peninsula New York recently joined the NYC Carbon Challenge, a program Michael R. Bloomberg started as mayor in 2007 with the city's universities to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Hospitals, commercial office buildings and multifamily residences were eventually added, and in late December, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the initiative would expand to include hotels.\n\nThis initial group of properties — accounting for more than 11,000 guest rooms — has pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions from their buildings by 30 percent or more in the next 10 years, a move that could reduce emissions by more than 32,000 metric tons and save $25 million of energy operating costs. Buildings account for around 75 percent of greenhouse emissions in New York City, and getting the hospitality industry on board will significantly help to cut down on the city's overall emissions, said Nilda Mesa, the director of the Mayor's Office of Sustainability.\n\nHotels are definitely a cause of emissions, and their involvement can have a big impact in achieving the goals of the NYC Carbon Challenge and the mayor's overall sustainability goals, she said. That broader vision, set forth by Mr. de Blasio in September 2014, is to reduce citywide greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2050.\n\nThe Office of Sustainability worked with the Hotel Association of New York City, a trade group that represents 275 hotels in the city, to get the first group of properties to make a commitment.
We get to the altar and not only does the groom run off, but you look at the guy next to you, and you've never seen him before.\n\nBRAD HOYLMAN, whose State Senate district is affected by a late change in plans to repair the L train.
The new governor also said he would propose in his new budget, due out later this week, mandating that all Californians obtain health care insurance, in direct response to the Republican tax bill last year that removed the mandate from the Affordable Care Act. Such a mandate in California would require approval of the Legislature, which is far from assured.\n\nHis office also announced that he would create a surgeon general position for the state by executive order. His aides said the governor's first budget would seek to expand Medi-Cal coverage to undocumented youths up to age 26.\n\nMr. Newsom, 51, had been the state's lieutenant governor — largely a ceremonial position — for eight years under Mr. Brown. Before that, he served as mayor of San Francisco, where he positioned himself, for the most part, on the liberal side of the spectrum. He was an early promoter of same-sex marriage and the legalization of recreational marijuana.\n\nOn Monday, he used his speech to laud Mr. Brown's tenure; the mention of his predecessor's name drew a standing ovation. But Mr. Newsom left little doubt that he had a broader view of government than the moderate Mr. Brown. The departing governor inherited a $28 billion deficit and left Mr. Newsom a $14 billion surplus; he also created an $18 billion so-called rainy day fund to help the state get through what is widely viewed as an inevitable coming recession.\n\nMr. Brown's insistence on holding onto state revenues was a source of continued friction with Democratic allies in the Legislature, who wanted to use the money to restore spending cuts that had been in place during the Great Recession.\n\nMr. Newsom's agenda is likely to be costly, and thus likely to face obstacles as the new governor prepares to offer a new budget. Mr. Brown, among others, has warned that California is heading into a recession, and there are concerns in the business community and among some moderate Democrats that the former San Francisco mayor might take a decidedly different approach to spending than Mr. Brown.\n\nAnthony Rendon, the Democratic speaker of the State Assembly, said in an interview Monday morning that while he supported some of Mr. Newsom's initiatives, he had strong reservations about raising taxes to pay for them, as Mr. Newsom's aides have suggested.
Mr. Barnes said that gymnastics writers themselves were duped by Dr. Nassar, who befriended them on social media. Everyone feels like they were groomed by him, Mr. Barnes said. He presented himself as the one good guy in a sea of exploitative characters, and all gymnastics fans were so desperate for that person to exist that we were willing to buy it. Ms. Hopkins wrote an article for HuffPost about feeling manipulated by Dr. Nassar.\n\nJessica O'Beirne, the host of GymCastic, a podcast devoted to gymnastics news and discussions of its culture, interviewed Dr. Nassar in 2013 and has left the episode up in the podcast's archive, albeit with an altered title, Serial Pedophile Ex-Doctor Larry Nassar Interview. She agrees with Mr. Barnes and Ms. Hopkins that she, too, was groomed by Dr. Nassar after he became a trusted source. In the industry you get close to sources, and I think there was a delay in reporting because there was a delay in people thinking this could be true.\n\nShe and her on-air crew, which periodically includes Ms. Hopkins and Mr. Barnes, have tirelessly pursued the Nassar story since September 2016, when an episode titled Jane Doe vs. USAG Doctor was broadcast, detailing the first police report and first lawsuit against Dr. Nassar as reported by The Indianapolis Star.\n\nI didn't hesitate at all to cover the Nassar story, she said, because I just absolutely believed the victims. She expressed her frustration about the news media coverage of this story as it first developed, comparing it to the Penn State abuse case involving the former football coach Jerry Sandusky. If we had the N.F.L. network, people couldn't get away with this, she said.\n\nMs. O'Beirne said that her efforts to educate her listeners about the Nassar case and its repercussions for gymnastics and beyond have been rewarded by a comment that Ms. O'Beirne called the most incredible insane amazing 'can't believe there is hope in the world' feedback. A woman called into GymCastic to say she had been sexually assaulted, and her assailant called her to apologize after watching the footage of Dr. Nassar's victims reading their statements in court. Oh my God, revolution is possible, Ms. O'Beirne said. My mouth is still hanging open. The power of people speaking out can legitimately change the world.\n\nWe are looking for the voices of the gymternet — gymnasts, coaches, judges, gym parents and spouses — to contribute to this conversation in the comment section.\n\nHow has Dr. Nassar's trial affected your relationship with the sport?\n\nWhat are the next steps the sport needs to take from within?
Ken Van Sickle will never forget the day in 1955 when he became a photographer. He was in Paris, where he'd moved shortly after finishing his military service in Korea, to study painting. One day in the Luxembourg Gardens, while sketching with a friend, he had an epiphany.\n\nMy friend said, 'Your painting isn't that good, but your photography really is,' Mr. Van Sickle, 87, recalled. I almost immediately understood he was right.\n\nMr. Van Sickle soon gave up painting and began seriously pursuing photography instead. Over the next year, he shot about 60 rolls of film in bars and cafes, at parties and clubs and in streets and parks. As he developed his photographic sensibility, he formed a portrait of the kind of artistic, carefree life that has long drawn expats to the City of Light.
Diane Cornelius\n\nPhil Cornelius\n\nSeacliff Park, Australia\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nWe woke recently to heavy smoke in the air. We live in Stanley, a small village in the Victorian High Country, a three-hour drive north of Melbourne. The fire authorities were suggesting that the three bush fires could join to form a mega-fire. We made the decision to evacuate. We loaded the car and joined the thousands of other Australians across the country who were evacuating their homes in regional areas.\n\nRichard Flanagan's article was compelling reading and succinctly reflected the appalling leadership void the Australian community is facing.\n\nFor many Australians, it seems as if we've entered some sort of Back to the Future parallel universe and somehow Biff is in charge.\n\nRobert Craig\n\nStanley, Australia\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nSuicide is an individual action. Richard Flanagan seems to believe that Australia has some significant control over atmospheric carbon dioxide, and that by government action, wildfires and changes to the Great Barrier Reef potentially associated with climate change can somehow be mitigated.\n\nAustralia is a country with under 25 million people. If all Australians stopped use of fossil fuels entirely, there would be no significant effect on any environmental consequence of carbon emission. Countries buying Australian coal and gas would get it somewhere else.
Follow our live updates here.\n\nThe calls for revenge came as millions poured into the streets of Tehran to mourn the general, according to state-run news outlets. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has told advisers that any reprisals must be direct, proportional and openly carried out by Iran — a startling departure for a leadership that typically carries out attacks via regional proxy forces.\n\nHow, or even if, Iran may retaliate against the United States is still a matter of speculation. But the crisis had already strained relations between the United States and its European allies — Britain, France and Germany — that were among the nations to strike a now-imperiled nuclear accord with Iran in 2015.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson is walking an especially fine line. Britain will be ever more dependent on its economic relationship with the U.S. after it leaves the European Union later this month. Yet it could also be exposed if tensions arise between the U.S. and the major European powers over Iran.\n\nRelated: Amid a rapid U.S. troop mobilization and widespread confusion about the Trump administration's Iran strategy, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said that a letter about U.S. forces preparing to leave Iraq was a draft that had been released by mistake.\n\nTrump's threat: Mr. Esper also contradicted President Trump's earlier threat to strike cultural sites in Iran, acknowledging that doing so would be a war crime. (Our art critics said that would not only be illegal, but also barbaric.)
But the meandering nature of the phone call and the fact that the president made no apparent attempt to conceal his actions as other call participants listened could allow Mr. Trump to argue that he did not intend to break the law or to argue that he did not know that a federal law existed apparently prohibiting his actions.\n\nThe federal law would also most likely require that Mr. Trump knew that he was pushing Mr. Raffensperger to fraudulently change the vote count, meaning prosecutors would have to prove that Mr. Trump knew he was lying in asserting that he was confident he had won the election in Georgia.\n\nIt is unlikely federal prosecutors would bring such a case, Mr. Bromwich said. But it certainly was god awful and unbelievable. But prosecuting a federal crime is obviously a very different thing.\n\nDavid Worley, a Democrat and a supporter of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. who is a member of the State Election Board in Georgia, wrote Sunday evening to Mr. Raffensperger and other members of the board asking the secretary of state, who is the board chairman, to open an investigation into the phone call to see if it violated state law, including a provision prohibiting conspiracy to commit election fraud.\n\nIf the board concludes a law has been broken, Mr. Worley said, it could ask state law enforcement authorities to consider filing criminal charges or a civil case against Mr. Trump.\n\nTo say that I am troubled by President Trump's attempt to manipulate the votes of Georgians would be an understatement, Mr. Worley, who is the sole Democrat on the five-member board, wrote in the email. Once we have received your investigative report, it will be the board's duty to determine whether probable cause exists to refer this matter.\n\nState officials in Georgia might also face a challenge in bringing a case against a federal official, or even a former federal official, said Ms. Webster and Ryan C. Locke, a second Atlanta criminal defense lawyer.
Dear Diary:\n\nLast summer, a produce vendor on Broadway at 72nd Street asked me to watch his stand while he used a bathroom. I'll be just five minutes, he said before dashing into the Bloomingdale's outlet store.\n\nHow much? a man asked, holding up a bunch of grapes.\n\nStartled, I demurred. I'm just guarding, I mumbled.\n\nHe gave me a blank look, so I found a price, weighed the grapes and gave him his answer. He pulled out a $20 bill. I blanched and asked him to search his pockets for exact change.\n\nA woman leaning on a walker commanded, I want a good banana for my grandson.\n\nI skipped the loose ones and pulled one from an untouched bunch. She shook her head. My grandson is very particular, she said. It must be perfect.
The year of the woman and the midterm gains that followed electrified Democrats, who have eagerly promoted themselves as the party of diversity. That success has inspired some of the most powerful women in politics to consider running for president. And it has boosted expectations that the political calculus for women has changed in the last two years, and that gender could become an asset, even in a presidential contest. Mrs. Clinton, after all, won the popular vote by almost three million.\n\nYet at a time of ascendancy for women in the party, there's a lingering doubt in some quarters about whether there is a risk involved in nominating a woman to take on President Trump, whom Democrats fervently want to unseat.\n\nThe specter of Mrs. Clinton's defeat in 2016 still haunts some Democratic officials, voters and activists. There is widespread recognition that women in politics are held to a different standard than men on qualities like likability and toughness, and that voters have traditionally been more reluctant to elect women as executives than as legislators.\n\nSome women see bias in the excitement surrounding a potential presidential run by Beto O'Rourke, the Texan who energized the left in a losing Senate bid, while Stacey Abrams is not mentioned as a possibility even though she had a much narrower loss for governor of Georgia.\n\nThere's a real tension, said Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress and a former policy adviser to Mrs. Clinton. On one hand, women are leading the resistance and deserve representation. But on the other side, there's a fear that if misogyny beat Clinton, it can beat other women.
Kelly Picciurro, 29, a physical therapist from the Upper East Side, had been checking New York City's website for days to find out when she could get the coronavirus vaccine. Many health care workers in the first priority group, like Ms. Picciurro, had been anxiously waiting to hear when it would be their turn.\n\nAfter finally being able to make an appointment online on Monday, Ms. Picciurro was one of the first people at a clinic in East Harlem on Tuesday morning, one of the city's initial two pop-up vaccination sites that mark a more urgent stage of the inoculation campaign.\n\nThe effort to vaccinate millions of New Yorkers against the virus has been off to a sluggish start, alarming city and health officials at a time when infection numbers are surging and a more contagious variant has been detected in the state. To ramp up capacity, the city is planning to open more than a hundred of these new vaccination hubs.\n\nImage Kelly Picciurro took a selfie after getting vaccinated. Credit... Kelly Picciurro\n\nBy 9 a.m., a trickle of health care workers had arrived at the East Harlem site, by bike from a nearby neighborhood, by car from Long Island and by taxi, still in their scrubs. Walk-ins were turned away, including Eric Ettinger, 65, a receptionist at a doctor's office, who biked over just before dawn, was first in line and waited for over an hour before being told an appointment was required.
MEXICO CITY — Jair Bolsonaro was sworn in last week as Brazil's new president. Nicolás Maduro, having taken over from the deceased Hugo Chávez in 2013, will be sworn for a second six-year term as Venezuela's president on Thursday. These inaugurations illustrate the threats facing Latin America's democracy, international alignments and unity.\n\nMr. Bolsonaro is a right-wing former military hothead, with a record of incendiary statements on everything from gay rights to women, Afro-Brazilians to Donald Trump. He was elected on a wave of anti-corruption and anti-establishment sentiment in Brazil that was further fueled by a citizenry dismayed by record-high crime (even though his own family has already been accused of corruption). He immediately proceeded to pick fights with other leaders in Latin America — rescinding invitations to Mr. Maduro and Cuba's president, Miguel Díaz-Canel, to attend his inauguration — and has practically broken off diplomatic relations with Venezuela.\n\nVenezuela's foreign minister, Jorge Arreaza, said President Maduro never considered attending the Bolsonaro inauguration, and few guests will be joining Mr. Maduro at his own party. The Latin American Group of Lima, the European Union, and several other countries refused to recognize the legitimacy of his re-election; only the Cubans, Bolivians, Nicaraguans and Salvadorans will figure among Latin American guests, and perhaps an envoy of the new Mexican government, which has clear sympathies for Mr. Maduro, but prefers to be discreet about it.\n\nIn addition to his fraudulent election, Mr. Maduro has egregiously violated human rights, driven the Venezuelan economy into the ground, and generated a humanitarian crisis that has forced nearly three million of his countrymen into exile. With prices languishing for oil, Venezuela's only export, the country will sink even further into chaos.
When Ann Vandervelde visited her primary care doctor in August, he had something new to show her.\n\nDr. Barak Gaster, an internist at the University of Washington School of Medicine, had spent three years working with specialists in geriatrics, neurology, palliative care and psychiatry to come up with a five-page document that he calls a dementia-specific advance directive.\n\nIn simple language, it maps out the effects of mild, moderate and severe dementia, and asks patients to specify which medical interventions they would want — and not want — at each phase of the illness.\n\nPatients stumble into the advanced stage of dementia before anyone identifies it and talks to them about what's happening, Dr. Gaster told me. At what point, if ever, would they not want medical interventions to keep them alive longer? A lot of people have strong opinions about this, but it's hard to figure out how to let them express them as the disease progresses.\n\nOne of those with strong opinions, it happens, was Ms. Vandervelde, 71, an abstract painter in Seattle. Her father had died of dementia years before, in a nursing home after her mother could no longer care for him at home. Ms. Vandervelde had also spent time with dementia patients as a hospice volunteer.
As bad as the pandemic has been for plays, it has been even worse for musicals, which are not only intensely collaborative but also inherently unhygienic. The next A Chorus Line won't emerge while everyone is standing six feet apart. No new Hamilton can spit its rhymes from behind a wall of masks.\n\nBut the urge to tell stories in song and dance does not go dark just because theaters do; it finds new mediums. And so we now have Ratatouille: The TikTok Musical, a show that turns crowdsourcing from a danger into an aesthetic. Compared with the excellent 2007 Disney-Pixar film Ratatouille, it's a trifle, but I mean that in the culinary sense: It's a silly, multilayered delight.\n\nNo people, or even rats, were harmed in the making of the show, which premiered on New Year's Day as a benefit for the Actors Fund and is streaming until 7 p.m. Eastern time on Monday. Its mostly online creation allowed contributors from all over the country, many of them young and apparently stuck in their parents' basements, to collaborate with old hands. Whether the novel development process will change the way musicals are made in the future remains to be seen, but Ratatouille serves the moment admirably.\n\nCredit that in part to how fast it happened. Just this August, Emily Jacobsen, a 26-year-old teacher, posted a 15-second ditty called Ode to Remy on TikTok. Remy is the animated feature's rat protagonist, dreaming of becoming a fine Paris chef despite his family's doubts and the logistical problems of rodents in kitchens. Operating from inside the toque of a bumbling garbage boy named Linguini, he eventually succeeds.
Between network, cable and streaming, the modern television landscape is a vast one. Here are some of the shows, specials and movies coming to TV this week, Jan. 4-9. Details and times are subject to change.\n\nMonday\n\n30 COINS 9 p.m. on HBO. The Spanish filmmaker Álex de la Iglesia has blended the humorous and the horrific in movies like Witching & Bitching and The Last Circus. His latest project, the TV series 30 Coins, is pure horror. It follows an exorcist (Eduard Fernández) who is sent by the church to serve as a priest in a remote Spanish village. He soon discovers that the town is a petri dish for the paranormal.\n\nTuesday\n\nGORDON RAMSAY'S AMERICAN ROAD TRIP 8 p.m. on Fox. Gordon Ramsay, the acerbic celebrity-chef host of Hell's Kitchen, doesn't seem like the type to ask for directions. Luckily, the road trip he takes in this new special isn't really about driving. American Road Trip finds Ramsay and two of his famous chef friends, Fred Sirieix and Gino D'Acampo, traveling North America by R.V. They guzzle gas and have gastronomic conversations over local delicacies.
The proposed rule comes as the nation's biggest cities are trying to cope with housing crises and as homelessness rates have increased, especially on the West Coast. Black homeownership rates have declined to levels not seen since the 1960s. The department has already proposed a rule that would raise the bar for proving housing discrimination. The public comment period for that rule closed last August, and it is still under consideration.\n\nThe Fair Housing Act requires that recipients of HUD funding affirmatively further fair housing and equal opportunity but leaves it to the secretary of housing and urban development to decide what that means.\n\nThe Obama administration defined furthering fair housing as addressing significant disparities in housing needs and in access to opportunity, replacing segregated living patterns with truly integrated and balanced living patterns, transforming racially and ethnically concentrated areas of poverty into areas of opportunity, and fostering and maintaining compliance with civil rights and fair housing laws.\n\nThe Trump administration would drastically pare that back to simply saying people should live where they choose, within their means, without unlawful discrimination related to race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, or disability. No mention of segregation appears in the new definition.\n\nThe 2015 Obama rule required recipients of HUD funding to work with the agency to assess the state of fair housing in their community. The recipients were then required to create fair housing goals. The Obama administration estimated that the rule would cost local entities $25 million a year and HUD $9 million annually.\n\nHousing advocates saw that as money well spent.\n\nAfter several years of considerable input from stakeholders across the spectrum, the Obama administration's fair housing rule made the strongest effort in decades to reverse harmful patterns of segregation and discriminatory practices in communities across the country, Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said in a statement.\n\nThe proposed rule would change how the housing department evaluates whether local governments and housing agencies are advancing its fair housing goals. Under the rule, local governments would be evaluated based on whether they have been sued by the Departments of Housing and Urban Development or Justice and whether they have provided an adequate supply of quality affordable housing. Fair housing lawsuits by advocacy organizations like the National Fair Housing Alliance would not count against the local entities.
It's the way it's going right now, Rowe said. Maybe we can get all the injuries out of the way.\n\nOn Monday, Jagr played nearly 19 minutes — two more than his season average — blocking lanes and turning aside attackers. After the Devils' Taylor Hall found P. A. Parenteau in the slot, Jagr got his stick on the puck to thwart a good scoring chance.\n\nJagr has never been a defensive stalwart. Last month, he passed Mark Messier for second place on the career points list with his 1,888th. (Wayne Gretzky, the record-holder, remains in another stratosphere, 964 points away.)\n\nIt's amazing what he does at this age, said defenseman Keith Yandle, who played in his 593rd consecutive game Monday. A lot of guys on our team, he could be their father. The way he carries himself and keeps himself young and stays young at heart, it's a good thing to see.\n\nYou don't play until you're 45 strictly by being good on offense. He's a guy who plays in all three zones. When he gets into the defensive zone, he always seems to be in the right lane with a good stick. He's never hurting us in the defensive zone.\n\nOn Monday, the Panthers also got a brilliant 28-save shutout from their 37-year-old goaltender, Roberto Luongo, who recorded his 448th career victory to pass Terry Sawchuk for fifth place among N.H.L. goaltenders.\n\nYandle said the Panthers would just have to win tight, tough games until their scorers returned.\n\nThis is Jagr's second full season in Florida. He will become an unrestricted free agent after the season, and he has not indicated what he plans to do next season.\n\nBut he clearly still loves the grind. He retreated to the Panthers' training room late Monday after a tough game to share a few laughs with his teammates. He has hinted that he might refashion his hair into a mullet, a familiar look from his younger years, but at least for now, he has work to do.\n\nHe's always done a lot for us, Luongo said. First line, first power-play unit. The only thing he doesn't do is kill penalties. Other than that, he's always been a big part of our team offensively. He's been a pillar since he's gotten here. It's amazing to see the things that he's done at his age.
[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]\n\nWith Hillary Clinton to his right, female elected officials seated before him and cheering women filling the audience, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Monday promised to protect women's reproductive rights by expanding the state's abortion laws within the first 30 days of the new legislative session.\n\nMr. Cuomo's vow was not exactly new. But the pageantry of the occasion seemed to reflect the circumstances that had prompted it: a Legislature newly controlled by Democrats raring to broaden reproductive rights, and a federal government increasingly looking to rein them in, all against the backdrop of a state with abortion laws that are not as liberal as many perceive them to be.\n\nThe Republican Senate said, 'You don't need a state law codifying Roe v. Wade. No administration would ever roll back Roe v. Wade,' Mr. Cuomo said at the event at Barnard College, describing why previous efforts had languished for so long. So help me God, this was the conversation.\n\nThat Republican-led State Senate is no more, ousted in November in favor of an overwhelming Democratic majority and the chamber's first-ever female leader. The federal administration, meanwhile, is indeed seeking to roll back Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion: President Trump has appointed two conservative judges to the Supreme Court, and women's rights activists are warning that the decision is in peril.
She wasn't the first to bring up the dire situation in Australia. Early on, Russell Crowe won best actor in a limited series for The Loudest Voice. But he wasn't there to accept: He opted to remain at his home in Australia out of concern for the fires. Instead, he sent a message that was read on his behalf by Jennifer Aniston.\n\nMake no mistake, the tragedy unfolding in Australia is climate-change-based, he wrote. We need to act based on science, move our global work force to renewable energy and respect our planet for the unique and amazing place it is. That way we all have a future.\n\nLater, Ellen DeGeneres, accepting the Carol Burnett Award for lifetime achievement, began by saying: Australia, I love you; my heart goes out to everyone who is suffering in Australia, all the animals that we've lost.\n\nAnd winning one of the final awards of the night, best actor in a drama for his twisted turn in Joker, Joaquin Phoenix said he didn't want to rock the boat, but that the boat had already been rocked.
COCODRIE, La. — A marine laboratory 85 miles southwest of New Orleans was designed to be a fortress against extreme weather. But it might be defeated by climate change.\n\nSitting at the end of Louisiana State Highway 56, where dirt dissolves into wetlands and then the Gulf of Mexico, the laboratory, the W.J. DeFelice Marine Center, has successfully weathered many hurricanes since it opened its doors in 1986. It stands 18 feet above the ground on pillars with pilings that extend more than 100 feet underground. Its walls can withstand winds of up to 250 miles per hour.\n\nBut the water is coming. Around the country, from New Jersey to Massachusetts, Virginia to Oregon, education centers and marine laboratories like this one are bracing against rising seas and a changing climate. The assault from climate change is slower but more relentless than any storm, and will ultimately do more damage. It threatens researchers' ability to study marine environments up close at a time when it's more vital than ever to understand them.\n\nBob Cowen, head of the National Association of Marine Laboratories, sees climate change as a challenge, but also a scientific opportunity. We're feeling it, and we're also studying it at the same time as best we can, he said. If labs like this one have to shut down, decades of on-site measurements could be disrupted — and, researchers say, academic budgets might not allow replacements to be built, or built on a comparable scale.
But Onuaku, who began shooting underhanded last season at the University of Louisville, has appeared in only two games with the Rockets.\n\nAnd while he is shooting 71.6 percent on free throws during his more frequent appearances with the Rio Grande Valley Vipers of the N.B.A. Development League, Rick Barry — ever the perfectionist — argues that Onuaku has flaws in his shot that he could help fix.\n\nThe way he does it, it would be virtually impossible for him to be able to perfect it to the point where he can become a great free-throw shooter, Barry said. But I admire tremendously the fact that he wasn't worried about somebody making fun of him. He wanted to try something to get better.\n\nThe technique has long inspired mockery. Barry said that when he began shooting free throws underhanded in the late 1950s, opposing fans made fun of him. Many female players used to shoot underhanded, he said, so fans would ridicule male players if they also shot that way.\n\nWhat Barry does not understand is why players today who shoot under 60 percent on their free throws do not at least try the technique. When his father introduced him to the underhand shot as a child, Barry initially balked at the idea. He finally switched during his high school years in New Jersey, and he hasn't stopped preaching the positives of the shot since then.
Teenagers and young adults in the United States are being ravaged by a mental health crisis — and we are doing nothing about it. As of 2017, statistics show that an alarming number of them are suffering from depression and dying by suicide. In fact, suicide is now the second leading cause of death among young people, surpassed only by accidents.\n\nAfter declining for nearly two decades, the suicide rate among Americans ages 10 to 24 jumped 56 percent between 2007 and 2017, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And for the first time the gender gap in suicide has narrowed: Though the numbers of suicides are greater in males, the rates of suicide for female youths increased by 12.7 percent each year, compared with 7.1 percent for male youths.\n\nAt the same time, the rate of teen depression shot up 63 percent, an alarming but not surprising trend given the link between suicide and depression: In 2017, 13 percent of teens reported at least one episode of depression in the past year, compared with 8 percent of teens in 2007, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.\n\nHow is it possible that so many of our young people are suffering from depression and killing themselves when we know perfectly well how to treat this illness? If thousands of teens were dying from a new infectious disease or a heart ailment, there would be a public outcry and a national call to action.
The stops and starts were especially important for Ms. Brewer. The more repetition, the easier the memorization, and the more the scenes would be ingrained into her muscle memory.\n\nThat was great, Jamie, Mr. Ellis said. Back it up one more time,\n\nAnother stop, more direction and then repeat. Mr. Ellis kept offering words of encouragement to the cast, while Ms. Ferrentino sat nearby, taking notes on a notepad smaller than her hand. Occasionally, she would whisper to Mr. Ellis. Throughout the rehearsal, Ms. Brewer cracked jokes; nearby, Mr. Barbanell quietly observed.\n\nThe play is based on Amy Jacobs, Ms. Ferrentino's aunt, who also had Down syndrome and is now deceased. When Ms. Ferrentino began writing the play, her process was complicated by the limits of her aunt's verbal skills, which made creating dialogue a challenge. In 2015, she reached out to Ms. Williamson, whose entire client roster is made up of performers with disabilities. Ms. Williamson connected her with Ms. Brewer, who had just become the first person with Down syndrome to walk the runway at New York Fashion Week. The playwright and the actress met for coffee and hit it off immediately.\n\nMs. Brewer told Ms. Ferrentino that when she had played characters with Down syndrome, she often had to cater to an audience's expectations, regardless of her abilities. Immediately, Ms. Ferrentino decided that the play would be as much about Ms. Brewer as about her aunt.\n\nThat informed how I wrote the play, she said. She wanted to give Ms. Brewer room as an actor, and a person, a chance to step outside that role and show the audience who she actually is.\n\nMs. Brewer, an only child, grew up in Orange County, California, before moving near Houston, where she was involved with a local theater. She said she started performing around eighth grade, with her family's support.
Type 2 diabetes is almost twice as common in African-Americans as it is in whites. Obesity, rather than racial factors, is to blame, a new study in JAMA reports.\n\nResearchers began with 4,251 black and white men and women ages 18 to 30 who were not diabetic. They then followed up with periodic interviews and health examinations over an average of 25 years. Compared to whites, black men were 67 percent more likely, and black women almost three times as likely, to develop diabetes.\n\nWhen they controlled for a long list of modifiable risk factors — fasting glucose, body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure, blood lipids, location of residence, socioeconomic status and more — the difference in diabetes incidence between the races disappeared. The key cause, the researchers determined, is obesity, which is tied to all of these risk factors.\n\nThe benefit of capturing these behaviors over time is that we can study how the accumulation of unhealthy risk factors contributes to the development of diabetes, said the senior author, Mercedes R. Carnethon, an associate professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University. Modifiable risk factors matter. The answer is simple, but the strategy to achieve change is complicated.
Throw pillows allow people to customize their comfort, especially with a deep sofa. By piling up pillows or stuffing them behind you, he said, you can sit at exactly the angle you want, in the position you want.\n\nHaving a throw or a blanket draped over the sofa will also add to the laid-back vibe and make it easy to get cozy on cold nights.\n\nBecause the TV room should be a casual place, Mr. Bowen likes to add floor cushions or poufs as well, for those who might want to spread out on the rug.\n\nAnd to keep the room tidy, Ms. Pickens suggested adding decorative trays, boxes and bowls. I always try to find a pretty box or bowl to put on people's coffee tables, she said, so they can put their remotes inside that.\n\nA container also offers protection from the scourge of any TV room: the sofa with cushions so deep they swallow the controls.\n\nFor weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

Over time, Corona cameras and film improved in quality. With an archive of almost one million images, the program detected Soviet missile sites, warships, naval bases and other military targets. They counted every rocket in the Soviet Union, said Volker Radeloff, an ecologist at the University of Wisconsin — Madison whose lab has used the images in its studies. These images kept the Cold War cold.\n\nAfter 145 missions and 120 returned usable film canisters, the multi-billion-dollar Corona program was decommissioned in 1972 in favor of satellites that could beam their imagery back to Earth in digital format.\n\nWhen, in 1995, the spy program's archival images were declassified, some appeared on the front page of The Times.\n\nGovernment officials were motivated to release the images, in part, because of their anticipated value for environmental scientists.\n\nThese kinds of photographs, Vice President Gore said at the time, are what make today's event so exciting to those who study the process of change on our Earth.\n\nSince then, the program has remained relatively unknown to the public. It's the best military, taxpayer-funded success that no one knows about, said Jason Ur, a Harvard University archaeologist who regularly depends on Corona images for his research.\n\nOne reason for their relative obscurity is that scientists who wanted to use the images have needed to overcome a variety of obstacles. For example, while the pictures have been declassified, it costs researchers $30 to digitize a single image. Dr. Radeloff said there are gobs and gobs of data, but that most images are still rolled in film and have not yet been scanned.
I forgot what it was like to be in front of an audience, Arestov said.\n\nThey have since performed at a circus in Indiana, at a private event for a hotel and at a Toys for Tots fund-raiser. They have mixed feelings about doing their act at all. They have wanted to do their part during the pandemic, they said, which has mostly meant staying home. Maas of Quick Change was distantly related to Lyric through marriage.\n\nFor a couple who typically spend about 300 days on the road a year, it has been an adjustment.\n\nI think we've watched everything on Netflix, said Arestov, who estimated they had lost about 95 percent of their income for the year. We're trying to stay positive. We can see a light at the end of the tunnel with the vaccines, but we've been juggling our finances because there hasn't been a lot of help from the government for our industry.\n\nBorstelmann had long thought he would retire at 65. At 62, he already considers himself — and take a deep breath, here — the country's oldest daredevil acrobatic hand balancer. There is an element of physical risk that Borstelmann takes every time he does his handstand about 25 feet above center court.\n\nI'm the only one of the halftime performers who actually risks his life, you know? he said. If I fall, I'm probably not getting up.\n\nBut the pandemic has altered his timeline — and in a surprising way.\n\nNow, Borstelmann said, I want to go until I'm 70. I'm not letting the pandemic retire me.\n\nAfter doing a halftime show at Grand Canyon University in Phoenix on March 7, Borstelmann packed up his Chrysler minivan and made the four-day cross-country drive to Greensboro, N.C., where he was scheduled to perform during the Atlantic Coast Conference men's basketball tournament. About 15 minutes after he checked into his hotel on March 11, he got the news that conference officials were canceling the tournament. Borstelmann sat on his bed watching ESPN's SportsCenter and tried to digest what it all meant.\n\nI lost my last 12 contracts, Borstelmann said. That hit me hard. My gosh. That's probably the money that I'm able to save from a whole season after expenses and everything else.
ISTANBUL — Turkey's Parliament approved plans on Thursday to send troops to Libya, escalating what has become a chaotic proxy war between multiple powers for control of the oil-rich country.\n\nThe Turkish deployment, a dramatic intervention championed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, aims to bolster the fragile United Nations-backed government in Tripoli after nine months of siege from rebel forces based in eastern Libya.\n\nThe size and nature of the military deployment was unclear. But coming just months after Turkey's third military incursion into Syria, it expands Turkey's military footprint in a volatile region and, analysts say, offers new evidence of its growing self-confidence as a regional power.\n\nFor Libya's embattled government, Mr. Erdogan has become an essential patron. Already this year, he has sent military advisers, arms and a fleet of 20 drones to defend Tripoli from the forces of Gen. Khalifa Hifter, which control much of eastern Libya and are backed by Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.
All year long as Earth revolves around the sun, it passes through streams of cosmic debris. The resulting meteor showers can light up night skies from dusk to dawn, and if you're lucky you might be able to catch one.\n\nIf you spot a meteor shower, what you're really seeing is the leftovers of icy comets crashing into Earth's atmosphere. Comets are sort of like dirty snowballs: As they travel through the solar system, they leave behind a dusty trail of rocks and ice that lingers in space long after they leave. When Earth passes through these cascades of comet waste, the bits of debris — which can be as small as grains of sand — pierce the sky at such speeds that they burst, creating a celestial fireworks display.\n\n[Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.]\n\nA general rule of thumb with meteor showers: You are never watching the Earth cross into remnants from a comet's most recent orbit. Instead, the burning bits come from the previous passes. For example, during the Perseid meteor shower you are seeing meteors ejected from when its parent comet, Comet Swift-Tuttle, visited in 1862 or earlier, not from its most recent pass in 1992.\n\nThat's because it takes time for debris from a comet's orbit to drift into a position where it intersects with Earth's orbit, according to Bill Cooke, an astronomer with NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office.
Most recently, Timnit Gebru, a leading artificial intelligence researcher and one of the few Black women in her field, said she was fired over her work to fight bias. Her offense? Conducting research that was critical of large-scale A.I. models and being critical of existing diversity and inclusion efforts. In response, thousands of our colleagues organized, demanding an explanation. Both of us have heard from colleagues — some new, some with over a decade at the company — who have decided that working at Alphabet is no longer a choice they can make in good conscience.\n\nWorkers have mobilized against these abuses before. Organized workers at the company forced executives to drop Project Maven, the company's artificial-intelligence program with the Pentagon, and Project Dragonfly, its plan to launch a censored search engine in China. Some of Alphabet's subcontractors won a $15 minimum hourly wage, parental leave, and health insurance after an employee outcry. And the practice of forced arbitration for claims of sexual harassment was ended after the November 2018 walkout — albeit only for full-time employees, not contractors. A few months later, Google announced that it would end forced arbitration for employees for all claims.\n\nTo those who are skeptical of unions or believe that tech companies are more innovative without unions, we want to point out that these and other larger problems persist. Discrimination and harassment continue. Alphabet continues to crack down on those who dare to speak out, and keep workers from speaking on sensitive and publicly important topics, like antitrust and monopoly power. For a handful of wealthy executives, this discrimination and unethical working environment are working as intended, at the cost of workers with less institutional power, especially Black, brown, queer, trans, disabled, and female workers. Each time workers organize to demand change, Alphabet's executives make token promises, doing the bare minimum in the hopes of placating workers.\n\nIt's not enough. Today, we're building on years of organizing efforts at Google to create a formal structure for workers. So far, 226 of us have signed union cards with the Communications Workers of America — the first step in winning a recognized bargaining unit under U.S. law. In other words, we are forming a union.\n\nWe are the workers who built Alphabet. We write code, clean offices, serve food, drive buses, test self-driving cars and do everything needed to keep this behemoth running. We joined Alphabet because we wanted to build technology that improves the world. Yet time and again, company leaders have put profits ahead of our concerns. We are joining together — temps, vendors, contractors, and full-time employees — to create a unified worker voice. We want Alphabet to be a company where workers have a meaningful say in decisions that affect us and the societies we live in.
Why did you join?\n\nI'd just moved in and was interested in learning more about how a building is operated and taken care of. I also liked the idea of being able to contribute to my community.\n\nDid you have to campaign?\n\nSeven of us ran on a slate. I got up at the annual meeting and gave a little speech. I wasn't kissing babies and shaking hands; I wasn't debating.\n\nWhat kinds of decisions do you make?\n\nFor the past few years, we've had a spate of young families moving in, and their needs or wants may be different from somebody who doesn't have kids. Should we have more toys so the kids can play? Should we have a whole play area? How do we make that happen while staying within the constraints of our budget?\n\nHas it been a good experience?\n\nWhen you're looking to buy an apartment in New York City, you hear all kinds of horror stories about boards, how they're cloaked in mystery and you don't know whether they'll let you into the building. I've found it to be a very rewarding experience.\n\nWhat advice do you have for others?\n\nYou have to be prepared to do research, get quotes from vendors, run numbers and talk to people. Nothing is going to change unless you pick up the ball and move it.
[Follow our live score and game tracker of Alabama vs Ohio State.]\n\nTexas said Saturday that it had fired Tom Herman as its football coach and, hours later, announced that it had hired the wizard at the helm of top-ranked Alabama's offense in a bid to restore the Longhorns to championship contention.\n\nBut the dismissal of Herman and the hiring of Steve Sarkisian, a former head coach at Southern California and Washington, immediately renewed tough questions about the merits of paying out millions of dollars in buyouts when college athletic departments are under extraordinary financial strain.\n\nHerman was 32-18 during his four seasons in Austin, with a 4-0 record in bowls and, to the frustration of Texas fans, no Big 12 championships. Although Texas had signed Herman to an extension in May 2019, the university on Saturday cited the measured progress for the football program and said that a coaching change was warranted to get us on track to achieving our ambitious goals.\n\nTexas could ultimately pay about $15 million in private funds to settle Herman's contract. And although Texas is one of the richest athletic departments in college sports, it has acknowledged financial troubles during the coronavirus pandemic.
PRAGUE — President Milos Zeman of the Czech Republic failed to win re-election in the first round of a presidential vote on Saturday and will face a runoff in two weeks against the former president of the country's Academy of Sciences.\n\nMr. Zeman and the runner-up in the first round, Jiri Drahos, advanced to a second round of voting because none of the nine candidates seeking the country's largely ceremonial presidency received a majority of votes in the initial round, held on Friday and Saturday.\n\nWith almost all the ballots counted by the Czech Statistics Office, Mr. Zeman had 38.6 percent of the vote compared with 26.6 for Mr. Drahos.\n\nPavel Fischer, a former diplomat, was a distant third with 10.2 percent. Michal Horacek, a songwriter, finished fourth with 9.2 percent, ahead of Marek Hilser, a doctor, who had 8.8 percent. The three pledged their support to Mr. Drahos in the runoff.
The Cut, the New York Magazine style and culture website with a devoted following, named Lindsay Peoples Wagner as its new editor in chief on Monday.\n\nMs. Peoples Wagner, 30, will rejoin the publication after a two-year stint as the top editor of Teen Vogue, where she was the youngest editor in chief of a Condé Nast magazine and one of the few Black journalists to have led one of the company's publications. She was previously a fashion market editor for The Cut, which started out as a fashion blog on the New York Magazine website and became a stand-alone site in 2012.\n\nThe top job at The Cut came open in October, when the former editor in chief, Stella Bugbee, announced she was stepping aside to become an editor at large for New York Magazine. The magazine announced the appointment of Ms. Peoples Wagner as her successor on Monday.\n\nMs. Peoples Wagner described The Cut as a publication that has all the things that you're thinking about and talking about in group texts, from spiritual matters to social issues.
BERLIN — Seven months after his coalition with the far right collapsed in a spectacular scandal, Sebastian Kurz, Austria's former conservative chancellor, stood before television cameras on Thursday and announced a new government — this time with the progressive Greens.\n\nWe chose a new path, Mr. Kurz beamed. It was a challenge for both sides, because the differences between the two sides are big.\n\nThe result, he said, was a new kind of compromise. We did not try to negotiate the lowest common denominator but consciously tried to unite the best of both worlds, Mr. Kurz said. That's how it is possible that both the Greens could keep their central campaign promises and so could the People's Party.\n\nWerner Kogler, the Greens leader, who will serve as vice chancellor, put it more bluntly: We were elected for different things.
From a dais at the St. Regis hotel in Midtown on Thursday, Jeff Bagwell considered his new teammates and declared this the greatest Hall of Fame class ever. Surely a punch line was coming. Bagwell, Tim Raines and Ivan Rodriguez are worthy inductees, but other classes have held more star power.\n\nI'm the tallest one, Bagwell said dryly, and so he is. Raines is 5 feet 8 inches, Rodriguez an inch taller, and both are shorter than Bagwell, who is listed generously at 6 feet. They can joke like old buddies now, although they never played together. As Hall of Famers, they are linked forever.\n\nWe have a great team in Cooperstown, Rodriguez said.\n\nFor now, the team is still missing Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens, the pre-eminent hitter and pitcher of the generation now being honored. Bonds and Clemens finally received a majority of votes in results announced Wednesday, but their path to the 75 percent threshold needed for election has been slowed by the sludge of the steroid era.
[PHONE RINGING] [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nalice Hey, y'all. This is Alice from Austin. julia allen My name is Julia Allen from Madison, Wisconsin. cindy This is Cindy from Ohio. patrick Hi, I'm Patrick.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nI'm Michelle Goldberg.\n\nross douthat\n\nI'm Ross Douthat. And this is The Argument, 2021. We made it. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nliam hannah My name's Liam Hannah, and I'm calling to talk about how I've changed my mind. speaker Have I changed my mind about anything in 2020? I've changed my mind about almost everything I thought I knew before this year happened.\n\nross douthat\n\nAfter a most eventful year, we're going to hear from you about what you changed your mind about over the course of 2020. And then we're going to share what we changed our minds about, if anything. I suppose it's possible that we were right about everything all along. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nHappy New Year, Ross.\n\nross douthat\n\nMichelle, Happy New Year's. I'm not going to ask you what kind of revelry you engaged in to celebrate the end of what was not actually the worst year in all of human history.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nBut definitely the worst year in my life.\n\nross douthat\n\nDefinitely the worst— yeah. I mean, there was the sixth century, when the sun was blotted out, and the plague of Justinian wiped out, like, half the empire. And we didn't hit that level, but it's good. It's good to have 2020 in the rearview mirror. So we asked our listeners what they changed their minds about this year. And the 2020 election certainly made you rethink some things.\n\npatrick Hi, I'm Patrick. What have I changed my mind on in the last year? Well, before the election, I trusted polls. I thought that 2016 was a fluke, but it was a predictable— it was going to happen eventually. And FiveThirtyEight, in particular, had reassured me that 2016 was within the margin of error, and it wouldn't happen again. And then it happened worse in 2020. And FiveThirtyEight has come out with some excuses for what's happened. But I just feel like I can't trust it. So I went from feeling like everyone is wrong about not trusting the polls to feeling like everyone was right all along. And this has become totally ridiculous that we put so much weight on the horse race, especially when it's so unpredictable. nancy simmons Hi, my name is Nancy Simmons. Something desperately made me change my mind this year. Although I've been a registered Democrat for most of my life, I've decided to change my political affiliation to Independent. The reason? Because I do not hate Republicans. I do not hate people. And I want to unify us. And if I don't declare myself a party one way or the other, then I don't have any enemies, and hopefully, they don't have me as an enemy either. max Hi, my name is Max. The biggest thing I changed my mind on this year would be effectiveness of campaigns. I started really early with the Democratic campaign and worked the entire election cycle the last 16 months. I think at the beginning, I was really bright eyed and bushy tailed and optimistic about the effect the campaigns could have. But up close and personal interaction with thousands of voters across the country, it's now my perception that, at least in this media environment, that our campaign had little effect on persuading voters, which was really contrary to what I had thought going in. christian evans Hi, my name is Christian Evans. I actually called in and got played on the last New Year's podcast at the beginning of 2020. When I called in, I talked about how I was working an election, a state senate campaign that was in suburban Minnesota. And I think the biggest thing, having lived very close to where George Floyd was killed and having experienced the pandemic, was just how much more people are motivated by their identity than by their interests. That was something people had always told me, but it wasn't something I totally believed until now. And having worked an election that did not go the way I wanted, I'm wondering how to reconcile those things as someone who cares about the movement.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nYou know, it's funny what Max said, because I was actually going to say, of everything I've written this year, the piece that I regret the most or have the most second thoughts about is a piece I wrote basically saying that it wasn't necessarily as big a deal as everybody thought that the Biden campaign wasn't doing door-to-door canvassing. And people close to the campaign had talked me into that. People I know who are really serious organizers had made that argument. One of the arguments I saw was that if there was an infection, you would then have to basically contact trace your own canvassing route, which would be an extremely negative thing. But looking back at the results, it does seem like that could have made the difference. I mean, particularly when you look at some of these congressional races. And the smallness of these margins are why I do think campaigns make a difference. And it's a frustrating process because the differences are on the margins. Everybody who's interested in politics should, at one time or another, go and canvas because meeting ordinary voters is very bracing. Both what people know and think they know, and ways that they talk about politics that are in some ways ultra ideological. You'll meet QAnon people, or people who are full of all sorts of conspiracy theories. But you also meet people whose view is so transactional in a way that we never really talk about in the media. I remember being at a Trump rally in 2016 and talking to this guy who had voted for Obama but was now going to vote for Trump. And the reason is, is that he had inherited his parents' car dealership and didn't want to pay higher taxes. And I said to him something like, but don't you think it's fair that now that you make a lot more money, you should pay higher taxes? And he just looked at me like I was crazy. He's like, But I don't want to. It's like, the idea — what's fair completely was not part of the equation for him. And he's not thinking in the macro level at all. And I think that that's true for a lot of people. It's just, what is good for me?\n\nross douthat\n\nAlthough that sort of cuts against Christian, our repeat caller, arguing that identity trumped interest. Whereas your guy with the car dealership, that's the most rational voter in America.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nI don't think you can really draw a bright line between identity and interest because identity is another way of saying somebody who you feel represents your worldview and values. See, I'm the opposite of the car dealership guy. If somebody was going to raise my taxes 80 percent but shared my basic outlook, I'm going to always vote for that person and see that vote as being in my interest.\n\nross douthat\n\nThat's just because you haven't inherited a car dealership yet, Michelle. [BOTH LAUGH] I mean, it's easy to say until you have the car dealership.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nBut to go back to Max, it's a two-sided coin. Because on the one hand, when you start out in campaigns, you think you're going to have all these transformative conversations. And sometimes you do, but it's a lot of — there's a long, long slog in between. And you're really looking to either change the mind or motivate one person out of 100, two people out of 100. And that is ultimately what makes the difference, but it also can often feel like a futile endeavor. For people who are just getting into politics, I think it's kind of unfortunate that this was their first campaign. Because what keeps people going in a campaign is the intense camaraderie, a sort of camaraderie that I've never felt in any other context. And this culture, and the feeling of being part of something larger than you. And it's just hard to do that online. So I hope that anybody who got involved in this campaign and feels like it didn't go exactly the way they wanted to doesn't let that be the last word in their participation.\n\nross douthat\n\nYeah, it's interesting. I have a relative who worked in Maine this summer. Not officially on the Democratic campaign — on a general get out the vote effort. And it was just striking to think about all of these idealistic young campaigners who, in a different world, would be sort of fanning out across the country, and in this world were not.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nAnd I should say, the efficacy of door-to-door campaigning, there's different studies on it and different opinions on it. And there are a lot of political scientists who will say that it is overrated as a tactic. But I think that where you see it is really, really important is on some of these downticket races. One of the things I heard when I sat in an online focus group of Trump voters who really disapproved of him but were torn was people sort of saying, well, I just don't know anything about Joe Biden. I don't have a sense of who he is. Which is, again, hard to fathom if you follow politics closely, but was something that I think a lot of people felt. And they had very good reasons for deciding not to do a lot of door-to-door canvassing. And I understood those reasons. I was convinced by them at the time. But in retrospect, I think that it was a mistake. And of all the columns that I wrote this year, that's the one I wish I could take back.\n\nross douthat\n\nWell, you know, there'll be another presidential election soon. So [BOTH LAUGH] there'll be more columns to write. So we should say well we changed our minds about. I'll go first. I mean, I guess I changed my mind about a lot of things, which is maybe not surprising in a year in which there was a lot of totally insane things happened. But taking it from the top, at the start of the year, I still thought probably that Joe Biden would have a tough time winning the Democratic nomination without creating a real ideological split in the Party. I thought he could win, but that it would be tough for the party to unite around an older moderate with this long list of things that are now heterodoxies or worse. That was wrong. One of my assumptions about the whole Trump era was that, at a certain point, having him as the leader of the Republican Party would lead the Party to a end of that George W. Bush era style catastrophic defeat. Meaning not just him losing, but downballot disasters like there were for Republicans in 2006 and 2008. I expected it in 2016. It sort of happened in the midterms, obviously, but not to the extent that the Democrats could take the Senate. And then in 2020, there were various moments when it seemed really, really likely thanks to those polls that Patrick no longer believes in. And it just didn't happen. The Republican Party has come through the Trump era not as a majority party or a governing party, but also not wiped out in anything like the way that I kept expecting. And then finally, and here I'll edge towards Goldbergian pessimism, but there were a bunch of times in the Trump era when I didn't feel good about Trump, but I felt kind of good about what might be happening on the political right, and what the right might look like after Trump. Just in terms of the way Trump acted as a force breaking up these pretty stale orthodoxies within the Republican Party, and suggesting that various forms of populism could be more successful. And up to like, two days after the presidential election, I was feeling pretty good about that in the sense that I felt like, as we, I think, talked about on an episode, that the way Trump lost pointed the way towards the possibility of a more multiracial, populist Republican Party. And now, a couple of months later, it seems like we're never going to get rid of Trump.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nWell, Ross, in a conversation not long ago, you said that you thought that a lot of Republicans were — that some were cynically echoing Trump's claim to have won the election, but that a lot of them were sort of — they felt like they didn't have the authority to tell Republican voters the truth. And so they were trying to act responsibly without completely losing their relationship to the Republican base. After the Arizona Republican Party sent out a tweet calling on people to martyr themselves for Donald Trump.\n\nross douthat\n\n[LAUGHS] Sorry.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nAfter Ted Cruz offering to take the cause of overturning the Pennsylvania vote to the Supreme Court. Do you still feel that way? Do you still trust in the benign intentions of the Republican Party?\n\nross douthat\n\nActually, I think a lot of Republican officialdom has behaved quite well. If you look at —\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nAt the state level.\n\nross douthat\n\nAt the state level, but also the judicial level. Basically, Republicans in positions of actual responsibility where they actually have to make decisions about how far they're going to go with Trump, I think those Republicans have mostly behaved responsibly. And I still have sympathy for the position, not of Ted Cruz, or Lindsey Graham, or a few others, but of a lot of Republicans who felt like they're trying to figure out how you move on from Trump. And letting Trump have his challenges felt like a way to move on. Where I'm more pessimistic is just about conservatives who I know, both in real life and online, who I feel like should be thinking about what does conservatism look like after Trump, what does the right want to be after Trump, are just so deep in a narrative of a stolen election to an extent that has actually surprised me. And that is what makes me pessimistic about the idea of the Republican Party getting past Trump. Not that it's impossible, but I would say my sense of the likelihood that Trump will be the dominant figure in the Republican Party for the next four years and the nominee in 2024, the odds of that have gone up. And that makes me more pessimistic.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nAs much as I have total pessimism [ROSS LAUGHS] about the connection of the grassroots of the Republican Party to any sort of empiricism or fact-based politics or any set of common values with the rest of their fellow citizens, I do think it's too late for everybody to say, yes, Donald Trump is going to be warlord of the Republican Party for the next four years. Because when he's out of the presidency, when he's ranting at Mar-a-Lago being covered mostly, perhaps, on Newsmax and One America News Network, some of the people are going to follow him. But he's just going to be a much less omnipresent cultural figure. And he's going to be spending a huge amount of time in court. He's going to be spending a huge amount of time staving off his creditors. And I think that when he is no longer able to inflict suffering on the libs, I wonder what that will mean for the emotional connection of the Republican base to him.\n\nross douthat\n\nI am really, really pleased, Michelle, that we are starting off 2021 with you showing more optimism than I have about the future of the Republican Party. But to rip you back into pessimism, here are some listeners who lost some faith this year. For some of them, the challenges of 2020 changed the way they think about America, or their fellow Americans, or both.\n\nlynn Hi, this is Lynn Dorsett. I'm in Scottsdale, Arizona. The thing I changed my mind about this year is that you can get a group of people to unite against the common enemy. In fact, that's supposed to be the easiest way to get people to come together. An illness like Covid that threatens everybody is certainly an enemy. But we didn't unite against it. We divided in the face of it. Now I think that this foundation of group dynamics is wrong, or at least not so simple. julia Hi, my name is Julia Allen from Madison, Wisconsin. What has changed in my thinking since the pandemic is that I am shocked at how many of my fellow Americans do not believe in science. In my mind, science is science, and I don't know how you can argue with it. maggie Hi there. My name is Maggie Shields. I am 21 years old — I just turned 21. I'm from Baltimore, Maryland. I'm a history and political science major at Colorado College. The main thing that I changed my mind about is whether or not the U.S. is going to last forever. And I thought the U.S. system had been strong enough and that the Constitution was righteous enough in print. Maybe not in actual use throughout American history. But I've always had faith in the Constitution to, in the end, give us the right direction about where to go. And I'm not sure if the Constitution can be rectified at this point. I was at the gym yesterday, and I was talking to someone who is a Trump supporter. And she brought up the fact that she believes in the Constitution, and she thinks that we're going to have freedom because of the Constitution, and Trump is the person who is going to do that. And what struck me about that comment was that this complete faith in the Constitution, the same faith that I have, is just being taken align with Trumpism.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nMaggie Shields, I'm sorry to say that I am really with you. I mean, a book I would recommend that you read if you're starting to think in these terms is Our Undemocratic Constitution by the law professor Sanford Levinson. You hear people like Mike Lee saying, well, we're not a democracy, we're a republic. And in a way, I think he's right. We're not a democracy. And the question is, should we be? Can we be? And I increasingly worried that the answer under our Constitution is no. That we had a period of democracy in this country from 1964 to about 2016. If you look at the fact that, of the last eight presidential elections, Democrats have won the popular vote seven times. And yet we have seen nothing like an unbroken period of Democratic rule. You see the vast majority of judges, for example, being appointed by Republicans. Probably more than any of them appointed by Donald Trump. You just had an election where Joe Biden won by over 7 million votes and came uncomfortably close to losing the electoral college, and ended up with the same amount of electoral votes that Donald Trump got in 2016, when he actually got less of the popular vote than Mitt Romney had gotten four years earlier. And increasingly, you're going to have a restive majority ruled over by a hostile minority. And that even when you can summon enough of a definitive majority to take some power to take back the presidency, the country is ungovernable because of the nihilistic check that the Republican minority has in the Senate.\n\nross douthat\n\nSo have you changed your mind? Or have you just become more convinced of this?\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nI can talk myself out of it. But I am coming around to the view that the United States should eventually break up. Which is a view I've flirted with for a long time. But I'm coming around to the idea that is maybe the only settlement. It's something that some of these hardcore Trumpers would probably be amenable to, right? You hear these people say, well, we'd win if it wasn't for California. So fine, try it without California. And I realize there's something deeply immoral about what I'm proposing, which is that it requires basically abandoning a bunch of people in the middle of the country, right? Because we're not talking about a strict sectional split. It's much more of a rural/urban split. And I don't know how to justify that. But I just don't think that our system is going to be tenable. Or if it is tenable, we're getting locked into a soft form of autocracy in which the majority of the country is at a permanent and growing disadvantage. This country does not work at a very fundamental level. We would see it if we were looking at another country. If we were looking at another country that was letting people starve, where you had a defeated autocrat, where you had some of his allies calling for martyrs to come to his support. If it was a different country, we would see the extent of failure that we're facing.\n\nross douthat\n\nWell, [CLEARS THROAT] I've got all the 2021 to talk you out of that level of despair. I'm also thrilled to report that you and I and this very show came up several times in what changed listeners' minds.\n\ncindy Hello, this is Cindy from Ohio. I just want to let you know that, since The Argument, I am just as likely to read a column by Michelle as I am by Ross. I am much more nuanced in my opinions. I see the value of others' ideas, as well as I see the fallacies in my own beliefs. matthew gordon Hi, my name is Matthew Gordon. And Michelle Goldberg has changed my mind on a lot of things this year. I've changed my mind that progressivism is essential in our society to move in the direction that I want to go. And I think that we have to work with moderates. Moderates aren't the evil, and progressives aren't the evil. I think together we can move forward much stronger. simone kunig Hi, my name is Simone Kunig, and I changed my mind this year about Ross. I've just spent the last couple of years yelling every time I would listen to this podcast, yelling at Ross, talking to myself on my walk while people look at me like I'm crazy. But I've really come to appreciate his point of view and understand in myself that you just need both sides.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nOh, those are so nice. So I'm going to revise what I changed my mind about. I now feel like I've changed my mind about the basic futility of my life and works. So thank you, everyone.\n\nross douthat\n\nI'm really glad that Simone realized that it's [LAUGHING] important to have — there's that great Simpsons episode where Sideshow Bob runs for mayor as a Republican. He gets out of jail [MICHELLE LAUGHS] and almost succeeds in stealing the election. Not at all a timely theme or anything like that. And at the end, he's on the witness stand, and he gets badgered into saying something like, Deep down inside — this is like Kelsey Grammer's Frasier Crane voice — You need a Republican to tyrannize you and brutalize you. And I'm not getting the quote right, [MICHELLE LAUGHS] but I like to think that I've become the Sideshow Bob.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nThat you vindicated Bob Yeah?\n\nross douthat\n\nYeah. Well, I'm the Sideshow Bob in a lot of Argument listeners' minds. [MUSIC PLAYING] All right, we're going to take a short break and come back with just a quick dose of New Year's resolutions. So stay with us. [MUSIC PLAYING] And we're back. We had just one more listener question that needs an answer.\n\nshauna fields Hi, my name is Shauna Fields, and I'm calling from the San Francisco Bay Area. And I want to know if Michelle's cat is OK. Two or three episodes ago, at the end, they played the little outtake of her saying her cat was trying to strangle or suffocate itself. And I keep waiting to hear an update, and there's never anything. So I'm assuming it's OK. I don't even like cats, but I don't know, I just want to know if the cat's OK. That's all. Thank you. Bye.\n\nross douthat\n\n[CLEARS THROAT] The cat's dead, Shauna. The cat is dead.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nNo, that's so — That is so thoughtful.\n\nross douthat\n\nI can't believe you brought up — this is like, Michelle, you've exposed all the wounds. The cat is dead. I'm sorry.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nOK, so that is extremely thoughtful. The cat is fine. I think she just — she just put her head in a plastic bag and couldn't figure out how to get out. So I just had to remove the plastic bag. She's completely fine. But really, thank you for asking. That's really nice of you.\n\nross douthat\n\nPeople care. Even Shauna, who doesn't like cats, [MICHELLE LAUGHS] cares. So the cat is alive. That's one note of hope. And let's use it as a segue into your hopes and dreams, Michelle, for this coming year. What are you looking forward to?\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nI hope to travel. The thing that I've been thinking about a lot, and this is personal and also obviously a function of my own privilege that lots of international travel has always been part of my life. And when I had one kid, we still traveled quite a bit. And then I had a second one. And early on, when my son was almost three and my daughter was almost one, we took them to Italy. And it was so hard that we just never really undertook a big trip again. We would take them to beach vacations, and that's about it. And now that I can't go anywhere and I'm thinking about all the places that we could go, all the things that we could have done and didn't get a chance because I, you know, was unwilling to endure the frustration of two bored kids on an eight-hour flight instead of two bored kids in a small apartment for weeks on end. And thinking that we need to make up for lost time. And so I want to both go places that I've never been, but also take them to places that I have been and only have told them about. And so I am hoping that we will get back out there.\n\nross douthat\n\nTurkmenistan in 2021.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nGeorgia, I was thinking.\n\nross douthat\n\nGeorgia, yeah. OK. Turkmenistan in 2022.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\n[CHUCKLES] Ross, how about you? What are your hopes for 2021?\n\nross douthat\n\nWell, I think we can connect our hopes because, I mean, one, I too have a desire to travel. As listeners know, we had a new baby this year. So I'm skeptical that we'll make it to Georgia or Turkmenistan. I'm hoping more for more internal-to-America travel. But what I'm hoping for is both what we're all hoping for, right? Which is that the vaccines work, and they're distributed, and the coronavirus is basically crushed by April or so. And then I'm also hoping that people accept the victory. Obviously, parts of the country that have been corona skeptical throughout are going to throw their doors wide open. But in the future Republic of blue America that you and I both inhabit, Michelle, I sort of worry that it will take a while for, for instance, me to be able to go and sit at my local coffee shop and work without a mask on just because everyone will still be sort of freaked out.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nSo the one thing I agree with you about, Ross. I guess part of it is a place of concern, that people think that they're going to be vaccinated, and yet the pandemic is still raging and they don't know if they can really spread it. But I actually think that the messaging to people in general should be, that you can foresee the end of this. Not that this is your life forever.\n\nross douthat\n\nRight. No, this is what I have in mind, right? That if we get to summer and a big share of the population is vaccinated and caseloads have dropped away to basically nothing, summer camp should not require masks for kids. Things like that. And maybe they just will, and I'm too deep in the Twitter bubble or blue state bubble. But that's what I'm hoping for. I want people to accept normalcy if, God willing, it returns. All right, so that's a dose of semi-optimism. And then to close us out, Michelle, do you have a recommendation for listeners in the new year?\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nYes. So I am going to recommend — it's not new, but it was new to me — the Netflix series A Series of Unfortunate Events, which is the first series that my kids and I have ever both enjoyed about equally. That I've been able to watch with my kids and say, don't watch it without me because I want to see the next episode. Obviously, it's based on the book by Lemony Snicket, which, incidentally, I recently found out that Lemony Snicket is really Daniel Handler who played the accordion on 69 Love Songs by the Magnetic Fields. Probably three of my favorite albums in the entire history of the world. I should have known that a long time ago. But that said, the series is — it's very arch and stylized. It sort of seems like a little bit Wes Anderson-y. It has a lot of these linguistic jokes. Like, there's a running joke about the difference between literally and figuratively. It's pretty dark and macabre. And yet my kids, who are six and eight — five and seven when we started watching it — they absolutely loved it. I could use it to coerce all sorts of good behavior. Like, we're not going to watch another episode until everybody is bathed and brushed their teeth. And it worked like a charm. I keep hoping that there's another series that we would all enjoy as much. I haven't been able to find anything. But if you haven't watched it yet, I would watch that one.\n\nross douthat\n\nSo what I would recommend to match your streaming recommendation, I would make the boring but nonetheless correct recommendation that people who are even mildly into Star Wars should watch The Mandalorian. Which is, of course, the Star Wars TV show created by Jon Favreau about a bounty hunter wandering the Star Wars galaxy with an incredibly cute Baby Yoda in tow. It's something you could watch where you watched the original trilogy, and then you watch The Mandalorian. And you think, OK, this is a good idea for what someone could do with Star Wars that draws on the strengths of the original trilogy but also does something new. Basically, it's everything that the J.J. Abrams sequels completely failed to be. And if you just treat it as the only existing sequel to the original trilogy, you'll have a good time, I think.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nBut do your kids have to have watched the original trilogy to appreciate it?\n\nross douthat\n\nI would say no, but they do need to like enjoy the Star Wars world. You got to enjoy laser guns and stuff. You don't actually need to, I think, be into like the Skywalker family saga to get into this.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nOK. I'll try it. And if anyone out there knows of another extremely arch black comedy that's appropriate for children, send it my way.\n\nross douthat\n\nAren't your kids ready for the Coen Brothers? I mean, age is just a number, Michelle. [MICHELLE LAUGHS] Give them Barton Fink and Burn After Reading. Once again, Michelle, a very happy 2021 to you.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nYes, happy 2021. May it be better than the worst year.\n\nross douthat\n\n[LAUGHS] And better than Justinian's plague. [MUSIC PLAYING] That's our show. That's the end of 2020 officially. Thank you all so much for listening. And a big thank you to everyone who called and wrote in. We're really grateful that you spent some of this wild and crazy and terrible and interesting and disastrous and a longer list of adjectives year with us. The Argument is produced by The New York Times' Opinion section. We want to wish all of our listeners a very happy New Year. Stay safe, take care of yourselves, keep arguing in good faith, and we'll see you next Friday.\n\nmale speaker So thank you. Love the show. female speaker Thank you. male speaker Thank you. female speaker Thank you. male speaker Thanks for the show. Really appreciate it, it's really great. Happy New Year.\n\nross douthat\n\n2021. We made it. Although technically we're recording this weeks in advance. [BOTH LAUGH] Sorry, I'm sorry. [CLEARS THROAT] And this is The Argument 2021. We made it.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nWe think.\n\nross douthat
CRAIG HARRIS at Nublu 151 (Jan. 6, 7 p.m.). Harris, a trombonist, is celebrating the release of Brown Butterfly, an ambitious album paying homage to the legacy of Muhammad Ali. The suite laces gnarled horn arrangements and spoken tributes to Ali over protean rhythms, drawing on influences as varied as Count Basie's big band and the drum-and-bass of 1990s London; the music emulates the rugged grace and mercurial power of Ali in the ring. Harris's band includes Kahlil Kwame Bell on percussion, Calvin Jones on bass, Adam Klipple on piano, Tony Lewis on drums and Jay Rodriguez on saxophone.\n\nnublu.net\n\nCHRISTIAN SANDS at Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola (Jan. 5-6, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). A 29-year-old pianist and bandleader of increasing renown, Sands is aligned with jazz's straight-ahead mainstream, but he's got an unbounded inquisitive instinct. He sounds like he listens to Oscar Peterson, Jason Moran and Eddie Palmieri in about equal doses. He performs this Saturday with a quartet including the guitarist Caio Afiune, the bassist Yasushi Nakamura and the drummer David Rosenthal; that group will likely draw heavily from Sands's most recent album, Facing Dragons. On Sunday, he returns with a trio featuring the bassist Luques Curtis and the drummer Terreon Gully. The latter show is a tribute to Erroll Garner; Sands serves as the creative ambassador for the Erroll Garner Jazz Project, a group dedicated to furthering the canonical pianist's legacy.\n\n212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys\n\nJEN SHYU AND JADE TONGUE at the Jazz Gallery (Jan. 9, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). A vocalist, poet and movement artist, Shyu is equally devoted to open-ended abstraction and absorptive storytelling. Here she presents In Healing/Zero Grasses, a new project with her longstanding group, Jade Tongue, that features a characteristically radical admixture of song, spoken poetry and outré improvisation, all aimed at healing humanity's relationship with the natural environment. Jade Tongue includes Ambrose Akinmusire on trumpet, Mat Maneri on viola, Thomas Morgan on bass and Dan Weiss on drums.\n\n646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc\n\nBEN WENDEL HIGH HEART AND KENDRICK SCOTT ORACLE at ShapeShifter Lab (Jan. 6, 7 p.m.). Wendel and Scott are two of the most admired composer-bandleaders among today's young music students and devotees of jazz's modern mainstream. Here Wendel, a saxophonist, will present the debut of High Heart, a new acoustic-electric ensemble with the vocalist Michael Mayo, the keyboardists Shai Maestro and Gerald Clayton, the bassist Joe Sanders and the drummer Nate Wood. Scott, a drummer, will perform with Oracle, a vessel for his shimmering, gently propulsive compositions; in its current iteration, the group includes Sanders on bass, John Ellis on saxophone, Taylor Eigsti on piano and Mike Moreno on guitar.\n\nshapeshifterlab.com\n\nWINTER JAZZFEST (Jan. 4-12). Now in its 15th year, the Winter Jazzfest has never had a more bountiful lineup of contemporary jazz talent. Its beloved weekend marathon — featuring simultaneous shows at venues across Lower Manhattan — will now stretch across two weekends: a Half Marathon will set the pace this Saturday, with a fuller, two-night marathon taking place a week later, on Jan. 11-12. In the week between, one-off concerts will be held nearly every night at a variety of venues. Highlights include Sunday's New York debut of the pianist Arturo O'Farrill's Fandango at the Wall, a suite he first performed at the United States-Mexican border this past spring, with a multinational federation of musicians; and a concert on Thursday with the saxophone luminaries Pharoah Sanders and Gary Bartz performing together. Both of those shows, and many others at the festival, will take place at Le Poisson Rouge.\n\nwinterjazzfest.com\n\nGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO
Linda Zall played a starring role in American science that led to decades of major advances. But she never described her breakthroughs on television, or had books written about her, or received high scientific honors. One database of scientific publications lists her contributions as consisting of just three papers, with a conspicuous gap running from 1980 to 2020.\n\nThe reason is that Dr. Zall's decades of service to science were done in the secretive warrens of the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nNow, at 70, she's telling her story — at least the parts she's allowed to talk about — and admirers are praising her highly classified struggle to put the nation's spy satellites onto a radical new job: environmental sleuthing.\n\nIt was fun, she said of her C.I.A. career. It was really a lot of fun.\n\nDr. Zall's program, established in 1992, was a kind of wayback machine that looked to as long ago as 1960. In so doing, it provided a new baseline for assessing the pace and scope of planetary change. Ultimately, it led to hundreds of papers, studies and reports — some classified top secret, some public, some by the National Academy of Sciences, the premier scientific advisory group to the federal government. The accumulated riches included up to six decades of prime data on planetary shifts in snowfall and blizzards, sea ice and glaciers.
I did not go poo in the toilet until I was 4 years old.\n\nYes. 4.\n\nI went pee in the toilet, of course. I mean, I wasn't a freak, am I right? The toilet could have all of my pee it liked. But my poo, no. Pooping was my sacred time, and I wasn't about to bid it farewell.\n\nI remember the night. The year: 1991. The place: Los Angeles. A night like any other, except on this night my parents decided that enough was enough and threw away my diapers. They were fed up with cleaning the butt of a person who could use full sentences, fed up with me soiling myself in the candy aisle of a drugstore rather than using the stockroom toilet, fed up with their own fear that I would go to college still in diapers. (Little did I know that being an adult baby is an actual fetish lifestyle. Had I known that in 1991, my life might be very different right now.)\n\nIt didn't register with me that the whole thing was abnormal until later in life. It was probably in high school when I realized that my parents weren't being histrionic; 4 years old is indeed way too late to be potty trained. I think I casually said in a group of people, I wasn't potty trained until I was 4, and, as the heads at the party slowly turned around to look at me, I said in what felt like slow motion, Iiiiiis thaaaaaat weeeeeeeeeeeird?\n\nBack to 1991. As I said, I remember the night I went in the toilet very well, partly due to the fact that it's all on videotape. Yes, my mother taped the entire thing, with my father off to the side doing what would now be considered director's commentary. That might sound weird, but you've got to understand: My parents had a new camcorder and really wanted to try it out.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday told Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, that he does not plan to run for Senate in 2020, most likely ending Republicans' hopes of securing a potentially dominant candidate for the open seat in his home state of Kansas, according to four people briefed on the meeting.\n\nMr. Pompeo, a former congressman from the Wichita area, has quietly explored a campaign for months. But in the aftermath of the military operation last week that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani of Iran, Mr. Pompeo has told senior party officials that he is ruling out becoming a candidate, according to several people who have spoken with him directly.\n\nHis conversation with the majority leader, which took place in Mr. McConnell's Capitol office, touched on the events of the last few days in the Middle East, according to an aide to the senator.\n\nAnother person briefed on the decision said it was clear it would be irresponsible for Mr. Pompeo to leave the State Department and would not help him in any possible presidential run in 2024 as much as people had speculated it might.
How to avoid trouble? For starters, stop adding to your card balance except for emergencies, and seek better terms. There's nothing wrong with calling your card issuer to see if you can get a lower rate, said Bill Hardekopf, chief executive of the card website LowCards.com. He suggests borrowers check their credit report before calling, so they know what kind of a rate they might reasonably expect. And, he advises, be polite.\n\nCutting back on card charges isn't always easy to do. Julie Ford, a fee-only financial planner in New York City who works with clients in their 20s and 30s, said young adults in big cities could get carried away with lifestyle spending and lose track of their budgets amid social pressure to keep up. That super-expensive gym membership becomes normalized, she said.\n\nJanuary is a good time for consumers to peruse credit card statements and consider what's really necessary, Ms. Ford said. She urges clients to consider why they got into debt in the first place — was it a one-time medical expense or emergency, or is it a more persistent problem of living beyond their means?\n\nIf it's continuous overspending, Ms. Ford suggests clients put off wardrobe updates and suspend those gym memberships, perhaps switching temporarily to jogging. The extra cash can go toward their card balances. Most of her clients are able to pay off the debt within a year. I tell them, 'This isn't forever,' she said.\n\nLauren Zangardi Haynes, a fee-only planner with Evolution Advisers in Midlothian, Va., suggests setting spending limits for any discretionary items to manage card spending. For instance, she said, she cooks at home frequently and enjoys serving wine with meals. So she established a monthly budget for wine, and makes a trip each month to buy it all at once; when the wine is gone, that's it until the next month. Buying wine in bulk means you get a lot of strange looks, she said, but helps keep a lid on budget bleed.
Lors de l'interview de deux heures qu'il a récemment accordée au New York Times, M. Nora a insisté sur son profond engagement à publier des textes qui reflètent les points de vue divergents d'une société qui paraît souvent en guerre avec elle-même, même s'il reconnaît que l'édition — encore moins diversifiée ici que son homologue aux États-Unis — échoue souvent à le faire. Il s'est montré déchiré entre sa conviction que les jurys littéraires français, gangrénés par des connivences et des conflits d'intérêts, devraient se réformer et ses doutes quant à leur capacité à le faire.\n\nIl n'est pas le seul à exprimer des réserves.\n\nHugues Jallon, qui dirige Le Seuil, autre maison d'édition d'importance, avoue qu'il est de plus en plus frustré par l'influence corrosive des jurys littéraires.\n\nContrairement au Booker Prize britannique ou au Pulitzer américain, dont la composition des jurys change tous les ans et les membres se récusent en cas de conflit d'intérêt, à la plupart des grands prix littéraires en France les jurés sont nommés à vie et peuvent même être salariés d'une maison d'édition, ce qui préserve les intérêts d'une élite établie.\n\nC'est un système aberrant, juge Hugues Jallon, 50 ans. Il devrait y avoir des règles très strictes: quand on est salarié d'une maison d'édition, ne pas être juré.\n\nIl y a beaucoup d'argent en jeu. L'impact des prix sur les ventes et les bénéfices de l'éditeur est tel, poursuit M. Jallon, qu'ils influent sur les choix de publication du Seuil, aux dépens d'autres manuscrits laissés de côté.
To the Editor:\n\nRe In Fight Over Science Education in Idaho, Lawmakers Move to Minimize Climate (news article, nytimes.com, Feb. 7):\n\nThe actions of Idaho state lawmakers in censoring the global scientific consensus regarding nonrenewable sources of energy, and removing supporting content that refers to human-driven climate change, display a fundamental misunderstanding of how STEM education works.\n\nA comprehensive STEM education teaches students to make evidence-based decisions using data collected in accordance with the scientific method. Such process-driven skills are in high demand by employers in all industries, and we only harm our children — and their future career prospects — by withholding or limiting such instruction.\n\nApproving new education standards while simultaneously denying access to relevant supporting content simply pays lip service to the importance of STEM education without giving science teachers the tools they need to transform students into scientifically literate adults.\n\nIf we want to prepare the next generation of students for a STEM-centered workplace, we need to begin with the scientific method. The development of critical thinking skills will not be possible without exposure to conclusions — even those regarding climate change — derived from scientific inquiry.
Since so few books are published in December, the best-seller lists don't change much this time of year. John Grisham's The Reckoning remains atop the fiction list, and Michelle Obama's Becoming still holds the No. 1 nonfiction spot.\n\nBut it is something of a surprise to see Obama's memoir, which has been translated into 23 languages, selling so well the world over. In Finland, for example, the former first lady's book has been at No. 1 on the bookseller Akateeminen Kirjakauppa's nonfiction list for weeks, followed closely by Paranoid Optimist, a memoir from the Nokia chairman Risto Siilasmaa (clearly that title works better in Finnish than it does translated into English). Next door in Sweden at Svensk Bokhandel, Becoming is at No. 2, edged out by Hans Rosling's Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World — and Why Things Are Better Than You Think, which was one of Barack Obama's favorite books last year. Sweden is a Scandinavian outlier, though; Becoming is No. 1 in both Norway and Denmark. It tops the lists in other European countries, too, including Germany, Portugal and England.\n\n[ In this essay, Isabel Wilkerson brings all her narrative firepower to Michelle Obama's Becoming. ]\n\nBecoming is No. 3 on Ireland's combined list, where it follows Normal People, a novel by the hugely popular Irish writer Sally Rooney, and At All Costs, a memoir from the hurling manager and player Davy Fitzgerald. It is No. 4 in both France and Spain; in Italy, where most of the books on the combined top 10 list are by Italian authors (Elena Ferrante commands the four top spots), Becoming is No. 9. It's No. 14 in Poland and No. 20 in the Czech Republic, and it seems to be selling briskly at bookstores in Albania.
I've had a hard time describing your recent documentary, Minding the Gap, to my friends. What do you think it's about? I struggle with this. When we first got into Sundance, and we had to write the description, we fought really hard to not put the word skateboarding anywhere in there. I've just seen too many skateboarding movies that either are competition narratives or come off as a bit angsty. There was also a lot of talk among us about taking out any reference to social issues in the promotional materials, whether domestic violence or child abuse, and I was like, I guess that makes sense. But I'm torn about the effect that's had, because on the one hand, the film is doing exactly what I want it to — young people who would go seek out a skateboard film anyway, it seems to be destroying them by the end emotionally. But it has turned off a lot of people, too. I talk to film lovers who say, I didn't even watch the film because I saw the word 'skateboarding.' \n\nWho do you want to see it? The 15-year-old kid in rural Arkansas who doesn't have any gauge to let him know that he doesn't have to repeat this pattern of growing into an adult in ways that are both toxic and vapid.\n\nSo make them think it's about skateboarding and then have it be about something much more serious? Well, when I first started the project, I was like: How do I get people in? How do I get young people to engage in things like violence in the home? Let me use the vehicle of skateboarding.
Danilo Krstic and his family are hardworking wheat and tobacco farmers, Serbs who get along with their Albanian neighbors.\n\n''You have to love the place where you live to stay on the land here,'' Marko Krstic, the oldest son, told visitors to the farm at Bec, a few miles from the Albanian border. There have been no serious troubles between Serbians and Albanians in Bec, but Serbs in some of the neighboring villages have reportedly been harassed by Albanians and have packed up and left the region.\n\nThe exodus of Serbs is admittedly one of the main problems that the authorities have to contend with in Kosovo, an autonomous province of Yugoslavia inhabited largely by Albanians.\n\nRioting Brought Awareness\n\nLast year's riots, in which nine people were killed, shocked not only the troubled province of Kosovo but also the entire country into an awareness of the problems of this most backward part of Yugoslavia, which is made up of many ethnic groups.
On the face of it, the Premier League's decision was an easy and an obvious one. Manchester City and Manchester United had finished last season late, thanks to their commitments in the summer's European competitions.\n\nTo ensure that both teams would have a similar break between campaigns as all of their rivals, the Premier League decreed that they would start the new season a week later than everyone else. The league's omnipotent fixture computer had drawn City against Aston Villa and United against Burnley for that first weekend of the season; those two games would have to be postponed.\n\nAll of this, so far, makes sense. What happens next does not.\n\nKnowing that its teams were facing a compacted schedule anyway, the Premier League could have decided that Burnley and Villa might as well play one another on opening weekend. That may have raised some logistical challenges — policing, scheduling — but hardly insurmountable ones, particularly with fans still locked out of stadiums. The benefit, of having only one game, rather than two, to slot in later in a busy year, far outweighed the cost.\n\nThat is not how soccer works, though, not even in a pandemic. Burnley did not play Aston Villa. The two games from the first weekend of the season have not been made up. It took until Thursday for the Premier League to find a window: They now will be played in the middle of January, five months late.
WASHINGTON — The World Bank said on Monday that its president, Jim Yong Kim, would step down from his post in February to join a private infrastructure investment firm, an unexpected departure that comes nearly three years before the end of his term.\n\nThe abrupt resignation, which is effective Feb. 1, could prompt a clash between the Trump administration and other governments over the future of the international body. The United States traditionally selects the president of the World Bank, which is made up of more than 100 countries, but Mr. Trump has taken a skeptical view about the importance of multilateral institutions. The World Bank's priorities — like combating climate change and engaging in foreign aid — also tend to be at odds with those of the Trump administration. Last month, the bank announced it would invest $200 billion toward fighting climate change over a five-year period.\n\nThe Trump administration did surprise some development experts last year when it supported a $13 billion capital increase for the World Bank, the first such boost since 2010. The increase, which the White House had initially resisted, was conditional on the bank putting cost controls in place and came with the understanding that lending to China would be expected to decline. The bank lent $64 billion to developing countries last year, a figure that included China.\n\nJim Kim had deftly struck a balance between keeping the Trump administration mollified and involving the World Bank in work on areas that the administration has been openly hostile to, said Eswar Prasad, the former head of the International Monetary Fund's China division. The new head of the institution will face a difficult challenge in maintaining the institution's legitimacy and relevance while hewing to the Trump administration's open hostility to multilateralism.
Facebook said on Friday that it would agree to an audit of information it provides to marketers and provide them with new, more precise measurement data, less than two weeks after Procter & Gamble, America's biggest advertiser, criticized the lack of transparency provided by digital ad platforms.\n\nThe social network, which came under scrutiny last year for repeated inaccuracies in its tools for measuring ads, also said Friday that it would give marketers new options for buying video ads this year.\n\nFor example, marketers might pay only if an ad was viewed to completion or if the sound was on. The nonprofit Media Rating Council will conduct an audit to verify the accuracy of the information Facebook gives marketers, the company said in a blog post, adding that it was also working with 24 third-party measurement companies.\n\nFacebook announced the changes after Marc S. Pritchard, the chief brand officer at Procter & Gamble, demanded that the digital ad industry grow up, criticizing the different ways platforms, including Facebook and YouTube, define whether an ad has been viewed and the lack of accredited outside sources used to measure digital ad performance.
Andrew Peterka had given up hope that he could ever grow serious facial hair. My beard history has been … a bare parking lot of hair growth, Mr. Peterka, 41, said. I am other people's patches. I'm the negative space of real men.\n\nBut stuck at his home in the suburbs of Atlanta during the pandemic, he craved an outlet for self-expression. Lacking talent in writing and painting, and wary of the permanence of tattoos, his mind returned to beards.\n\nAfter entering a few queries into a search engine, he came across a thread titled Patchy Beard Success Stories on a forum called Jeff's Beard Board. In the comments, men celebrated and complimented each other, using expressions like Grow on! and Beard on!\n\nWhile many corners of the internet, despite their idealistic underpinnings, continue to breed trolls and leave bad behavior unchecked, the users of Beard Board present a counternarrative to those often male-dominated spaces with their unfettered positivity. They adhere to 23 agreed-upon rules of engagement, including no discrimination, no harassment and no recommending Rogaine to promote growth.
Mr. Weinstein, who was at the defense table for about two hours, was dealt a setback: His lawyers were told they could not call as a witness a detective who was accused of withholding evidence from prosecutors that was favorable to the defense.\n\nHe dropped his head in his hands in what appeared to be disappointment, Ms. Ransom said, referring to Mr. Weinstein's reaction to the judge's ruling.\n\nOutside the courtroom\n\nProtesters and curious New Yorkers, as well as several of Mr. Weinstein's accusers, waited in the cold outside of the courthouse, hoping to look him in the eye, my colleagues Jodi Kantor and Emily Palmer said. Many later moved to Foley Square, two blocks from the building, for a news conference.\n\nI wish he would have turned around and faced us, said the actress Rosanna Arquette, who had accused Mr. Weinstein of sexual harassment dating to the early 1990s.\n\nRose McGowan, an actress who has accused him of sexual assault, called the trial a moment of justice, even though most of his accusers won't have even one day in court.\n\nThe case\n\nMr. Weinstein is charged with raping one woman, who has not been identified in court documents, at a Midtown hotel in 2013 and forcing a second woman, Mimi Haleyi, to allow him to perform oral sex on her at his Manhattan apartment in 2006.\n\nHe faces one count of rape and one count of criminal sexual act in those cases and, if convicted, could be sentenced to a maximum of 25 years in prison.
I used to sit down and cry sometimes, Mr. Scott said. I cried and prayed.\n\nHe was desperate to provide for his son. He had no relationship with his own father, and his mother died when Mr. Scott was 2 years old, leading to a tumultuous time in foster care.\n\nA doctor of Zahir's vouched for Mr. Scott's care to officials, and he was able to keep his son.\n\nThe inquiry opened the door for Mr. Scott to receive help and create a more stable environment. A doctor recommended to city officials that the two be placed in housing in the Bronx, close to Zahir's appointments at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore. Returning to the borough where Mr. Scott had spent much of his life proved to be a turning point.
When the choreographer Reggie Wilson curated Dancing Platform, Praying Grounds: Blackness, Churches and Downtown Dance, a series of performances, talks and walking tours at Danspace Project last year, he wove together three rich threads into a tapestry full of history and heart. The aftereffect of that platform still echoes at Danspace, which also, of course, happens to be a church — St. Mark's.\n\nThis week, the work he choreographed in honor of the platform, … they stood shaking while others began to shout, returned to Danspace Project as part of American Realness 2019. (The Gibney dance organization is a co-presenter.) Inspired partly by black Shakers, mainly the religious activist Mother Rebecca Cox Jackson, Mr. Wilson explores the intersection of worship and dance with poetic imagination. Within the frame of postmodern dance — and with a heady mix of spirituals, contemporary music and field recordings — he produces a remarkable work that flows seamlessly from start to finish.\n\nEach program starts with a performance lecture. There are three possibilities for any given night; the one on Monday, opening night, lasted slightly longer than the dance and covered ring shout, African dance and postmodern dance. Mr. Wilson discussed the rhythmic ritual that moves in a counterclockwise circle with shuffling feet and also screened video excerpts from different styles of African dance and contemporary pieces to show, among other things, how cultural appropriation works.
It's hard to miss a musk ox: It looks like a buffalo decked out in a hairy fur coat. And yet this easy-to-spot giant, which lives on tundras from Siberia to Greenland, is still surprisingly mysterious.\n\nHere is the largest land mammal of the polar zones, but we hardly know anything about musk oxen, said Joel Berger, a wildlife biologist at Colorado State University and a senior scientist at the Wildlife Conservation Society.\n\nDr. Berger has studied musk oxen in Alaska for nearly a decade, and on Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports, he and his colleagues reported a disturbing finding: Musk oxen are unexpectedly vulnerable to rapid climate change in the Arctic.\n\nIn a warming landscape, pregnant female musk oxen may struggle to find enough food for their unborn calves, the researchers found. Their undersized offspring may die young or fail to produce many calves of their own. In places, musk oxen may disappear altogether.
At this point in the resolution-heavy month, many of us may be trying to shed pounds, either the ones we added during the holidays or the ones we've accumulated stealthily with time. But by the end of the year, most of us won't have succeeded — and there's not much established science to tell us why.\n\nAn ambitious new study published this month in Cell Systems, however, promises to shed some new light, enumerating for the first time the thousands of changes in genes and various biological systems that may occur after even a small amount of weight gain, and which may — or may not — be reversed if the weight is then dropped. The findings may help researchers better understand why adding weight causes some people to develop diabetes and other conditions, and also underscore the cumulative health risks of so-called yo-yo dieting.\n\nAn international consortium of scientists approached 23 overweight men and women who were already part of a large, continuing study — called an omics study in the parlance of researchers — that examines participants' genomes and microbiomes and generates vast amounts of data about the workings of the body.
The company has had several strong quarters since his arrival, but in its most recent earnings report, a critical sales growth measure was less than half what Wall Street had expected. The company's stock has tumbled 17 percent since the miss in late November; Mr. Bogliolo largely blamed weak spending by Chinese tourists, who have scaled back amid a trade war with the United States and a slowing economy at home.\n\nTiffany hopes to perk up interest in the brand with its program on sourcing. Initially, it will tell customers the country where the diamond came from. In 2020, it will share information about where each diamond was cut, polished and set. Mr. Bogliolo said he hoped to someday be able to provide the name of the mine where it was found, the artisan who shaped its contours and the jeweler who secured it in its setting.\n\nIt's relevant nowadays for customers, he said, surrounded by archival sketches and vintage Tiffany jewelry at the company's headquarters in Manhattan. Customers are very educated, mature and demanding.\n\nTiffany's efforts to attract younger shoppers extend to the Instagram-ready cafe it opened in 2017 inside the nearly 80-year-old flagship store in Manhattan. Its recent ads have featured Zoe Kravitz, an actress described as the reigning millennial fashion icon, and a remix of Moon River, the classic song from the 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany's, performed by the rapper A$AP Ferg and the actress Elle Fanning. At the Golden Globes on Sunday, Lady Gaga wore a custom necklace with more than 300 Tiffany diamonds to collect her trophy for Best Original Song.\n\nAlthough the company hopes its information-sharing campaign endears it to younger buyers, the initiative has its limits.
The home solar business is growing fast as thousands of homeowners install panels on their roofs to save money. Yet the biggest companies that install and finance home solar systems are reporting hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.\n\nThose losses are an ominous reminder of how hard it can be to make money in an industry widely viewed by political leaders and business executives as an important part of the global effort to address climate change. Solving this problem could help determine whether the use of residential solar power is quickly and widely adopted.\n\nThere have been very few success stories, said Vikram Aggarwal, founder and chief executive of EnergySage, which helps consumers compare solar installers. Practically everyone who has tried this has failed. The road is littered with dead bodies.\n\nSunrun and Sunnova, two of the nation's biggest home solar companies, lost a combined $500 million in the first nine months of the year, and their operations and purchases of solar systems collectively used up $1.3 billion in cash. The companies and their Wall Street supporters say the losses are occurring because solar installations are growing rapidly and require a lot of upfront investment, and because investors in the companies get to use the losses to offset their tax liabilities. Still, residential solar is a fiercely competitive and expensive business, and Sunrun and Sunnova must contend with hundreds of smaller rivals, many of which have been turning a profit for years.
It was a shot across the bow, and the snowboarder Billy Morgan played the part of cannonball, wearing all black while tucking and somersaulting through the air more than 100 feet from a specially constructed jump made of snow at a resort in Livigno, Italy.\n\nThis was in April 2015, when Morgan, of Britain, landed a backside quadruple cork 1800, a marvel of physics and rotational forces consisting of four off-axis back flips and five spins compressed into three seconds of hang time.\n\nVideo of Morgan somersaulting through the air went viral on social media. No snowboarder had ever landed a quadruple flip, and it signaled an escalation in the difficulty of maneuvers leading up to the debut of big air, the newest snowboarding discipline at the Winter Olympics next year.\n\nWithin seven months, two more riders — Max Parrot, of Canada, and Marcus Kleveland, of Norway — landed their own versions of a quad cork for cameras. But blowback was just as swift, reviving decades-old discussion in the sport about a so-called spin-to-win mentality versus riding with style, pitting the influence of the Olympics against sensibilities among core snowboarders, who say an emphasis on acrobatics conjures diving, aerial skiing and figure skating.
The president has given Democrats a great opportunity to show how we will govern responsibly & quickly pass our plan to end the irresponsible #TrumpShutdown, she said, just the first sign of things to come.\n\nDemocrats also intend to use their first months in the majority to push for a bipartisan infrastructure bill and legislation to lower prescription drug costs, issues that they believe will have bipartisan appeal.\n\nThe Democrats plan to pass two bills on Thursday. The first includes six bipartisan spending measures that would fully fund agencies like the Interior Department and the Internal Revenue Service through the end of the fiscal year in September. The second would fund the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 8, with $1.3 billion for fencing but no money for a wall on the Mexican border.\n\nWith the plan facing a shaky future in the Senate and an intransigent president, some rank-and-file lawmakers in both parties are suggesting that a deal to revamp the nation's immigration laws, pairing border security and protections for some undocumented immigrants, may be the way out of the stalemate.\n\nHow about comprehensive immigration reform? Representative Debbie Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, said on CNN on Tuesday, when asked how Democrats intend to compromise with Mr. Trump.\n\nOne of Mr. Trump's closest allies, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, has revived his long-stalled immigration proposal to marry $5 billion for the wall with immigration law changes that might appeal to Democrats, including three-year renewable work permits for young undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, known as Dreamers.\n\nMr. Trump has raised the prospects of broader talks on Twitter. We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with, he said last week. Hard to believe there was a Congress & President who would approve!
That is because Nadal is a natural right-hander, which adds heft to his two-handed backhand.\n\nIf he is taken out wide on the backhand, he uses a lot of right arm to be able to muscle that ball into play, Cahill said. No one else from that far back in the court can throw the ball up with that amount of spin and give it enough hang time to make it uncomfortable for the opponent to put away that first ball. It's just difficult to do that.\n\nThe discomfort for the opponent is not only due to Nadal's heavy strokes. It comes from knowing that putting the ball past him when he is healthy and hitting passing shots with precision and flair remains one of the game's great challenges.\n\nWhen he's confident, really confident and playing well, and he does this on clay, too, he'll start the point from a deep position and then you watch where he goes after he hits the return, Annacone said. He gets up right behind the baseline and then tries to dictate. If he stays back there after the return, that's when he's unconfident and a little bit vulnerable.\n\nNadal's extreme variations in return position — either tight to the baseline or far back near the ticket holders — also create doubt and confusion in his opponents.\n\nStill, a lesser player and athlete would have paid too high a price for the deep positioning, and there is still an occasional tax on the tactic: Gilles Müller, in his upset of Nadal at Wimbledon last year, was particularly effective in opening up attacking opportunities by serving wide to Nadal's backhand side in the deuce court.\n\nRoger Federer has used his own precision serving to shift the momentum of his once-lopsided rivalry with Nadal. Last year's final in Shanghai, which has one of the quickest surfaces on the ATP Tour, was a case in point. Nadal could not manage to get a single break point on Federer's serve and lost, 6-4, 6-3.\n\nRoger is one of the greatest strategic servers who has ever played, said Annacone, Federer's former coach. You give him that space, particularly on a fast court, and that's a problem. And that's why Novak Djokovic is harder for Roger to serve against than Rafa, because he doesn't give him space. He's so long. He can stay up on the baseline, and if Roger doesn't hit his targets, Novak will punish him.
Bret Stephens: Belated happy new year, Gail. I was hoping we could celebrate the arrival of 2021 by never mentioning Donald Trump's name again, except maybe as a punchline to jokes involving foul-mouthed parrots. But then our friends at The Washington Post broke the news that the president begged and bullied Brad Raffensperger, Georgia's secretary of state, to find him the 11,780 votes he needed to flip the state's 16 electoral votes his way. To his credit, Raffensperger told him to get lost (proof, by the way, that not every Republican official has lost his soul).\n\nAnyway, serious question: Is it too late to impeach Trump again?\n\nGail: He certainly deserves it, but one of my goals for 2021 is to stop obsessing about the evils of Donald Trump in hopes that if we ignore him he'll go away.\n\nBret: I say impeach him again.\n\nGail: Well, I guess it'd be better than contemplating the pandemic 24-7. And I guess more elevating than probing the alleged Trump family crises over Melania's Mar-a-Lago redecoration.\n\nBret: Trump is America's very own Pandora, a clown of malice, the impresario of idiocy, Nero without a fiddle and Caligula without a horse. His one achievement in Georgia is that the Democrats might end up sweeping the two Georgia Senate races this week, denying Mitch McConnell his majority.
Then Mr. Vizcarra surprised his supporters by announcing that he would run for Congress in the coming elections with a corrupt party whose members had voted in favor of his impeachment. With his unmatched popularity as an anti-corruption crusader, he will surely be elected congressman. And, additionally, if elected he will gain at least a few years of protection from imprisonment, sheltering himself with the same parliamentary privilege he had so adamantly fought against as president.\n\nThe war against corruption ended in farce. A disappointment for millions who believed in Mr. Vizcarra; a wake-up call and an embarrassment for his unconditional supporters and the media that enabled a corrupt caudillo to lead the country to an abyss for his personal gain.\n\nThere is a lesson to be gleaned from the Vizcarra debacle. Peruvians need strong democratic convictions to avoid being fooled by authoritarian demagogues. Liberal elites and our most respected democratic figures should lead the way. The media, civil society organizations and anti-corruption activists must have humility and integrity to reckon with the ominous damage they have caused with their uncritical endorsement of an opportunistic charlatan who in two years ruined a country arduously struggling on a path of progress and stability.\n\nFor nearly two decades Peru's economy averaged 4.5 percent growth. Under Mr. Vizcarra it fell to 2.3 percent before the pandemic hit, producing an economic decline of 11.5 percent, one of the highest in the region. Poverty rates, steadily reduced over three decades, are rising again. Peru has had for months one of the highest death rates from Covid-19 in the world.\n\nThere are deep authoritarian roots ingrained in Peruvian society. Alberto Fujimori became a national hero when he sent tanks to shut down Congress in April 1992. Another former president, Alan Garcia, reached top ratings when the armed forces under his command crushed prison riots in 1986 by killing nearly 300 inmates who were members of the Shining Path guerrilla. A left-wing military coup that seized the media in 1974 was widely endorsed by intellectuals. There is no democratic tradition left or right. Peru needs to build one. There is no room for compromise with democratic values in the name of any legitimate or illegitimate cause.\n\nThe 10 days that shook Peru in November are just a dramatic example of the pronounced decay of our political class. No system can hold when its Constitution is used to condone the abuse of power. Institutions are in ruins. The presidency has been belittled and Congress delegitimized. Peruvians are demoralized and fed up with crooked politicians back-stabbing one another in the middle of a deadly pandemic.

Fossil fuel emissions in the United States have fallen significantly since 2005 and declined each of the previous three years, in part because of a boom in cheap natural gas and renewable energy, which have been rapidly displacing dirtier coal-fired power.\n\nYet even a steep drop in coal use last year wasn't enough to offset rising emissions in other parts of the economy. Some of that increase was weather-related: A relatively cold winter led to a spike in the use of oil and gas for heating in areas like New England.
The change should be effective in increasing scoring in extra innings. Statisticians have shown that teams score about half a run per inning. But when there's a runner on second and no one out, that increases to 1.1 runs. In all, teams score in about 27 percent of innings, but they do so 61 percent of the time when there's a runner on second and no one out.\n\nLet's see what it looks like, Joe Torre, the majors' chief baseball officer, told Yahoo. It's not fun to watch when you go through your whole pitching staff and wind up bringing a utility infielder in to pitch. As much as it's nice to talk about being at an 18-inning game, it takes time.\n\nSpeeding up the pace of play has been a preoccupation of baseball in recent years as games have crept longer and longer. A nine-inning playoff game between the Dodgers and the Nationals lasted 4 hours 32 minutes last fall. Baseball has tinkered with rules about leaving the batter's box and has also been experimenting with time limits on pitchers in the minor leagues.\n\nStill, extra-inning games are not always the cause. About 8 percent of games go into extra innings, and most of those do not stretch deep into the night. Last season, 43 percent of extra-inning games were over after the 10th, and only 16 percent of them went 13 or more.\n\nThe 18-inning games that Torre spoke of are even rarer. Of 12,147 regular season games over the last five seasons, only 22 went 18 or more.\n\nTraditionally, overtimes in sports have had the same rules as regulation time. But in 2015, the National Hockey League started playing overtime with three skaters on a side instead of five, and college football has for two decades started teams close to the end zone for overtime play.\n\nThere may be unintended consequences from baseball's new experiment. Strategically, with a man on second and no one out, some managers may be tempted to have their first hitter bunt, then hope for a sacrifice fly. More bunting may not be what baseball had in mind for the new rule.
As the Golden Globes began on Sunday, Sandra Oh earnestly told the audience, I said yes to the fear of being on this stage tonight because — because I wanted to be here to look out into this audience and witness this moment of change, referring to one of the more diverse slates of nominees in Globes history, in an industry that has traditionally been difficult to break into for people of color.\n\nIt turned out — at least this year — the diversity wasn't just in the nominees, but also in the winners selected by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. Several performers of color won in some of the most prestigious categories, including the night's best actor in a movie drama, the Egyptian-American star Rami Malek.\n\nAnd the diversity extended to the stories being told. Best animated movie went to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, in which a version of the superhero is an Afro-Latino teenager. (The directing team behind the movie included an African-American filmmaker, Peter Ramsey.) Best comedy went to Green Book, about the relationship between an African-American pianist and his Italian-American driver.\n\nOne winner, Darren Criss, spoke onstage about the issue, noting, This has been a marvelous year for representation in Hollywood, and I am so enormously proud to be a teeny, tiny part of that as the son of a firecracker Filipino woman from Cebu that dreamed of coming to this country and getting to be invited to cool parties like this.
The past week's images from Australia have been nightmarish: walls of flame, blood-red skies, residents huddled on beaches as they try to escape the inferno. The bush fires have been so intense that they have generated fire tornadoes powerful enough to flip over heavy trucks.\n\nThe thing is, Australia's summer of fire is only the latest in a string of catastrophic weather events over the past year: unprecedented flooding in the Midwest, a heat wave in India that sent temperatures to 123 degrees, another heat wave that brought unheard-of temperatures to much of Europe.\n\nAnd all of these catastrophes were related to climate change.\n\nNotice that I said related to rather than caused by climate change. This is a distinction that has flummoxed many people over the years. Any individual weather event has multiple causes, which was one reason news reports used to avoid mentioning the possible role of climate change in natural disasters.
Until then, it is unclear just how much the new rule will bind the hands of Mr. Biden's intended E.P.A. administrator, Michael S. Regan. The measure includes a provision that allows the administrator to exempt studies, on a case-by-case basis, from the rule. The final measure acknowledges that there could be some cases in which complying with the rule could be impracticable, like in the use of older studies in which data is not easily available.\n\nThe rule going into effect also only sets public-data requirements for dose-response studies — that is, studies that measure how much an increase of exposure to a chemical or pollutant increases the risk of harm to human health. Previous versions of the regulation applied to a wider array of studies.\n\nHad the transparency rule been in effect already, several people said, the E.P.A. could not have made the case to regulate mercury releases from power plants because it could not have shown that the heavy metal impairs brain development. Nor could the agency have successfully linked cloudy drinking water to higher rates of gastrointestinal illnesses, and then imposed more rigorous clean water standards.\n\nAlready, the Trump administration has used the policy to reject an agency finding that chlorpyrifos, a pesticide, causes serious health problems.\n\nTrump administration officials have not offered examples of policies that they say were wrongly enacted based on studies that did not make underlying data available. But academic and industry opponents of regulation have argued the change will make the E.P.A. more rigorous in its decision-making.\n\nEnvironmental groups assailed the rule as the culmination of a decades-long strategy to undermine science that took off in the tobacco wars of the 1990s and continued as a way to raise doubts about the research upholding pollution rules.
WASHINGTON — Federal agencies would no longer have to take climate change into account when they assess the environmental impacts of highways, pipelines and other major infrastructure projects, according to a Trump administration plan that would weaken the nation's benchmark environmental law.\n\nThe proposed changes to the 50-year-old National Environmental Policy Act could sharply reduce obstacles to the Keystone XL oil pipeline and other fossil fuel projects that have been stymied when courts ruled that the Trump administration did not properly consider climate change when analyzing the environmental effects of the projects.\n\nAccording to one government official who has seen the proposed regulation but was not authorized to speak about it publicly, the administration will also narrow the range of projects that require environmental review. That could make it likely that more projects will sail through the approval process without having to disclose plans to do things like discharge waste, cut trees or increase air pollution.\n\nThe new rule would no longer require agencies to consider the cumulative consequences of new infrastructure. In recent years courts have interpreted that requirement as a mandate to study the effects of allowing more planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. It also has meant understanding the impacts of rising sea levels and other results of climate change on a given project.
But here's where competitive markets come in. In a perfectly competitive economy, with no monopoly power or other distortions — which is the kind of economy conservatives want us to believe we have — everyone gets paid his or her marginal product. That is, if you get paid $1000 an hour, it's because each extra hour you work adds $1000 worth to the economy's output.\n\nIn that case, however, why do we care how hard the rich work? If a rich man works an extra hour, adding $1000 to the economy, but gets paid $1000 for his efforts, the combined income of everyone else doesn't change, does it? Ah, but it does — because he pays taxes on that extra $1000. So the social benefit from getting high-income individuals to work a bit harder is the tax revenue generated by that extra effort — and conversely the cost of their working less is the reduction in the taxes they pay.\n\nOr to put it a bit more succinctly, when taxing the rich, all we should care about is how much revenue we raise. The optimal tax rate on people with very high incomes is the rate that raises the maximum possible revenue.\n\nAnd that's something we can estimate, given evidence on how responsive the pre-tax income of the wealthy actually is to tax rates. As I said, Diamond and Saez put the optimal rate at 73 percent, Romer at over 80 percent — which is consistent with what AOC said.\n\nAn aside: What if we take into account the reality that markets aren't perfectly competitive, that there's a lot of monopoly power out there? The answer is that this almost surely makes the case for even higher tax rates, since high-income people presumably get a lot of those monopoly rents.\n\nSo AOC, far from showing her craziness, is fully in line with serious economic research. (I hear that she's been talking to some very good economists.) Her critics, on the other hand, do indeed have crazy policy ideas — and tax policy is at the heart of the crazy.\n\nYou see, Republicans almost universally advocate low taxes on the wealthy, based on the claim that tax cuts at the top will have huge beneficial effects on the economy. This claim rests on research by … well, nobody. There isn't any body of serious work supporting G.O.P. tax ideas, because the evidence is overwhelmingly against those ideas.
What happens between the last chord of the fugue and the first chord of the minuet, I can't say is a holy moment, because I don't think it's a holy piece in any way, but it's a gentle, warm, humane moment. You realize here that, Wow, I've been wandering around for an hour, but here I am. There's this T. S. Eliot poem. He says, We shall not cease from exploration/And the end of all our exploring/Will be to arrive where we started/And know the place for the first time. That, for me is the essence of so much.\n\nIt's like we're in Beethoven's home. It's of course far away from the waltz, but I have this feeling that I'm not in another place. You kind of realize that it's over. You know that this is the last variation. You just know it. You know this is the last arrival. There's nothing violent about it, and there's lots of violence in this piece.\n\nParticularly in the fugue we've just heard.\n\nExactly. There's lots of violence in Variation 28, it's just pure aggression. And this is an incredibly violent moment, this arrival. But within six bars, the sun comes out again.
WASHINGTON — Emboldened House Democrats, seeking a politically charged debate on gun control, unveiled legislation on Tuesday to expand background checks to nearly all firearms purchases, a move timed to mark the eighth anniversary of the mass shooting in Arizona that nearly killed former Representative Gabrielle Giffords.\n\nBy introducing the measure less than one week after taking control of the House, Democrats are signaling that it is a top priority. A vote could come within the first 100 days of the new Congress. The measure, and a companion bill introduced Tuesday in the Senate, also reflects the changing politics around gun laws, an issue many Democrats once shied away from.\n\nThe bill, which will almost certainly pass the House but will face a steep climb in the Republican-controlled Senate, would require background checks on the purchases of nearly all firearms, including those sold at gun shows and over the internet. There would be limited exceptions, including for law enforcement officers and for guns transferred between close family members.\n\nPolls have shown that a vast majority of Americans — by some estimates, 90 percent — support universal background checks for all gun purchases. Many Democrats, including Representative Lucy McBath, a freshman from Georgia whose son was shot and killed at a Florida gas station, were elected last year after promising to address gun safety.
Congress enacted a wide range of reforms that promised to restrain presidential power. The War Powers Act of 1973 created mechanisms to ensure that Congress authorized the deployment of American troops abroad. The Budget Reform of 1974 centralized the process used by the House and the Senate to make decisions about spending money so as to make the legislative branch more of an equal of the executive. The Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1974 established a system of public finance for presidential elections along with spending and contribution limits.\n\nThe National Emergencies Act of 1976 authorized the president to initiate emergency powers of government, but with the condition that he or she specify the particular provisions in detail. (This is the authority President Trump has reportedly explored as a way of funding his wall.) Intelligence reforms imposed limits on the C.I.A. and F.B.I., whose surveillance and national security operations had greatly enhanced the president's power. Last but not least, the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 sought to watch against a replay of Watergate by establishing the Office of the Independent Counsel to ensure that there would be independent investigations into executive branch corruption.\n\nDespite these reforms, four decades later, the imperial presidency still seems to be alive and well. What went wrong?\n\nThe most familiar challenge stems from the fact that in the midst of national security crises, much of the nation remains willing to allow presidents to respond to its perceived enemies. Despite the War Powers Act and the larger lessons of Vietnam, Congress has continued to allow presidents to send troops into combat without a formal declaration of war. In response to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, Congress passed legislation authorizing a vast expansion of the national security system that gave President George W. Bush and his successors access to new organizations, programs and institutions through which to pursue national security goals without congressional support.\n\nSince the 1970s, Democrats and Republicans have sorted themselves by party, with less room for internal dissent and less of a will to criticize or challenge a president from one's own party. Both parties have been willing to grant the president more authority when it served their purpose. The main dynamic for Democrats has centered around party leaders supporting presidents who use executive action, through regulatory orders and rule making, to deal with urgent policy problems that congressional Republicans oppose. Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton turned to executive power to deal with energy and climate change when Congress refused to do so. President Barack Obama did the same on immigration after congressional obstruction prevented compromise legislation from passing.
This is part of a broader pattern caused by global warming. The Northeast is getting wetter; the Pacific Northwest is getting drier; and the South is getting hotter.\n\nOut of the 149 years of weather data collected at Central Park, the 10 wettest have all happened since 1972.\n\nTo put it another way: New York City's wettest years all occurred since The Godfather hit movie theaters.\n\nWeren't around for that movie? Try this: five of New York City's 10 wettest years have taken place since 2003 — when the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie was on the big screen.\n\nNot that excess wetness is a consistent phenomenon — the three years before 2018 were all unusually dry. But the overall trend is real.
The ski industry already took a hit in the spring when the pandemic struck and many resorts had to close early, leading to $2 billion in losses and causing layoffs or furloughs of thousands of employees, according to the National Ski Areas Association, a trade group. The industry saw its lowest number of visits, 51 million, since the 2011 to 2012 season, the association said.\n\nNow resorts are setting their expectations low for the new ski season, reports Kellen Browning for The New York Times.\n\nMike Pierce, a spokesman for Mount Rose Ski Tahoe, a resort in western Nevada, said the mind-set was to just maintain status quo and survive. He declined to provide any financials, but said, if we break even, that's almost considered a success.\n\nEven before the pandemic, the ski industry was laboring to build interest in the sport. The number of skiers has stagnated in the past decade, according to the National Ski Areas Association.
1. The blue check mark spark\n\nThe earliest and most important dissemination of the video happened on Twitter, Mr. Decker noted. All it takes is a few widely followed, verified Twitter accounts to share a manipulated video to begin the rapid spread of disinformation. (Verified accounts, which are reserved for celebrities, journalists and other public figures, have a blue check mark next to their names.) In this case, a few writers from conservative outlets were the first to share the video.\n\nWith the imprimatur of the verified accounts, the video began to pick up traction on Twitter organically, as similarly minded conservative users shared it. According to VineSight, a company that tracks disinformation online, the vast majority of the engagement with the video on Twitter was organic — it was spread by real humans, not by bot networks and the like.\n\n2. Moving off Twitter\n\nThough it's fast and loud, Twitter's universe is finite. Disinformation can become even more dangerous when it moves to other platforms, particularly the darker corners of the internet. Within four hours of the initial tweet of the video, it was also posted on 4chan, Facebook and Reddit. On 4chan, the anonymous and unrestricted online message board, six separate threads promoted the video. On Reddit, eight threads were posted in the same amount of time.\n\nSome of the posts on Reddit, however, were from the anti-Biden left — largely vocal supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders who were also sharing the video.\n\nOn Facebook, the video was shared primarily in closed groups, spreading in both far-left and far-right groups.
James Franco and Aziz Ansari both won major Golden Globes awards in early January, and both have since faced accusations from women as part of the #MeToo movement.\n\nBut on Sunday night, with the two men nominated for Screen Actors Guild Awards, only Mr. Franco showed up.\n\nMr. Ansari was up for best actor in a comedy series but lost to William H. Macy of Shameless. Mr. Ansari was the only contender in his category to skip the awards show in Los Angeles, a major industry event where campaigning for the Oscars is common. A woman accused Mr. Ansari of aggressive sexual coercion in an article on Jan. 13, and the star said in a statement that he had believed his interaction with the woman was completely consensual.\n\nMr. Franco appeared briefly on camera when the nominees in his category were introduced. The crowd politely applauded, as it did with the other nominees. (He lost to Gary Oldman for Darkest Hour.)
That could allow for the development of new disease treatments that would fix defective genes in the human body. Crispr could also make it more practical to alter the DNA of human embryos, making changes that could be passed to future generations.\n\nAn influential national advisory panel said on Tuesday that such heritable changes should be allowed only in the narrowest of circumstances, to prevent infants from acquiring genes that would cause serious diseases, and only when there was no alternative.\n\nIf Crispr lives up to its promise, the patents on the technique could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, or even more. However, related techniques, such as gene therapy and RNA interference, have also been described as having great promise and have resulted in few or no medical treatments so far.\n\nSeveral companies are trying to develop medical treatments using Crispr, although they are in the early stage of development.\n\nThe stock of Editas Medicine, which holds licenses to the Broad patents, shot up nearly 30 percent on Wednesday. By contrast, shares of Intellia Therapeutics and Crispr Therapeutics, which have licenses to the intellectual property from Dr. Doudna and her colleagues, each fell nearly 10 percent.\n\nThose two companies, and others, may now have to negotiate licenses to the Broad patents, most likely by paying fees and royalties. It is rare in the medical field for one patent holder to block another party from bringing a medical treatment to market.\n\nThere have been some exceptions, such as Amgen's current effort to block a rival cholesterol-lowering drug. But the Broad Institute and the University of California have given every indication that they want Crispr to be applied widely for public benefit, so the ruling on Wednesday is unlikely to slow down research.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage service entities, were supposed to be left for dead.\n\nAnd yet, both have made a comeback.\n\nWhen the government put them into receivership, the idea was to run down Fannie's and Freddie's debt and develop a healthy and growing mortgage market free of the implicit government backing that they had enjoyed.\n\nInstead, almost nine years later, these so-called government-sponsored enterprises are still the largest suppliers of mortgages.\n\nFannie is even guaranteeing $1 billion of debt backed by Invitation Homes, a single-family rental business owned by Blackstone, making the leap into the home rental market.
What's the secret to pulling off such a demanding schedule?\n\nI love music. How could you deny being together with your loved one? Some journalists want me, of course, to say it's because I never smoked, or because I'm a vegetarian, or because I keep the Sabbath. But that's not the reason. It's a gift. I cannot say, Look at me, be like me, you will be in good health. It's not like that. Some people who lived long and active lives lived a not-very-clever life. Churchill drank lots of whiskey and smoked enormous big cigars, and he lived to be 90 or so.\n\nYou were born in Massachusetts, your father a minister and your mother a music teacher, but you moved to Sweden as a child. What was it like to return to study with Leonard Bernstein at Tanglewood?\n\nIt was 1953. I had heard about Tanglewood. I knew that Bernstein was involved in teaching there, and I knew he lived by Carnegie Hall at the time, so I took courage and went up and knocked at the door. He liked young people, as you know, and was most gracious — he accepted me as a student even though applications were done already. And he got me a scholarship, because I had no money.\n\nYou also studied contemporary music at the summer course in Darmstadt, Germany. What was that like?\n\nI was there in '49, right after the war. Hindemith was the great prophet that we had to learn about. I went there also in '56, seven years later — completely different atmosphere. John Cage was the big name. I met him once, on a free day. He was hunting mushrooms. He said to me, That's a good example of what I'm trying to tell you: Look at these mushrooms. They don't grow in straight lines, or in triangles, or in circles. One here, one here, one there. When the temperature and moisture are right, they pop up. This is what I want: The end goal is to free up your mind and get rid of all those rules.\n\nWas it difficult for you, as a Seventh-day Adventist, to tell orchestras you would not rehearse on Saturdays, the Sabbath?
When Redding returned home, he played the song for his wife. My comment at the time was that it was very different, unusual for him, she said — meaning she didn't care for it. He said, 'Well, I'm going to change my style, going to be different.'\n\nThat October, Redding had surgery to remove polyps from his vocal cords; while recuperating, he couldn't speak, so he grew a beard and spent hours in silent contemplation. Five weeks later, his voice sounded better than ever, and he was eager to get some of his new ideas on wax.\n\nSteve Cropper, who regularly backed Redding up as the guitarist for Booker T. and the MG's (a.k.a. the Stax house band), remembered Redding calling him from the Memphis airport to make sure he was at the studio. When Redding arrived, the pair sat on beige folding chairs, hammering out the song. I helped him with the second verse a little bit, helped him with the bridge, Mr. Cropper said in a phone interview. After he sang, 'I watch the ships roll in, watch them roll out again,' I said, 'Have you thought that if a ship rolls, it's going to take on water and sink?' Redding told him, That's the way I want it, Crop.\n\nThe duo went into the studio in November, joined by Donald Dunn (known as Duck) on bass, Al Jackson on drums, Booker T. Jones on piano and three horn players. In an interview, Mr. Jones remembered the sessions as having kind of a hectic feeling — so much so that I remember a number of people sleeping over at the studio. Redding and Mr. Cropper planned to ask the Staple Singers to contribute backing vocals to Dock of the Bay, which never happened. The whistling at the song's end came in a section earmarked for vocal ad-libbing; on one early take, Redding sputtered and the engineer Ron Capone told him, You're not going to make it as a whistler.\n\nIn the middle of the sessions, Redding went back on the road. I'll see you on Monday, were his last words to Mr. Cropper. He had recently acquired a Beechcraft Model 18 airplane so he and his touring band, the Bar-Kays, could fly around the country to play shows on weekends, letting him regularly return to Memphis. But on Dec. 10, 1967, as he flew into Madison, Wis., the plane stalled and crashed into Lake Monona, killing seven people, including Redding. It fell to a shattered Mr. Cropper to finish Dock of the Bay for a rush release. If I had a week to work on it, it probably would have been overembellished, he said. (He finished the job in 24 hours.)\n\nDifferent lines of the song resonate with those who have covered it over the years. Michael Bolton recorded the second-most-successful version of the track (a No. 11 hit in 1988). In an email, he said he thinks the song's key lyric is look like nothing's gonna change, everything remains the same. It states the obvious lack of our evolution as a society, he wrote.\n\nMr. Jones agreed that line has a special power. It's one of those lyrics that has the capability of touching anyone who's been through changes, loneliness, trying to find a secure place in the world, he said. Over the past 50 years, that's proved to be just about everyone.
I was half a mile into the mine shaft, and my heart was racing. Hunched underneath the low ceiling and hardly able to see, I was following along by listening to the splashes of the men's steps in front of me. The water, dripping from above, was up to my ankles. Then we stopped. We'd come to a dead end, one of the miners said. In order for us to proceed, they needed to set off some dynamite.\n\nIn a matter of minutes, several packs of explosives were drilled into the mountain and ready to be detonated. I was told to open my mouth and not close it until the last of the dynamite had exploded.\n\nThe blasts began, and I sensed the mountain groaning around me. Then: complete silence. Ten seconds later, as the dust began to settle, one of the miners shouted, Lets go! It's time to see what we got.
Wiener would struggle with depression for the rest of his life, but he did manage to eventually find professional fulfillment at M.I.T., where he helped invent the field of cybernetics. Sidis was not so successful; after fleeing a criminal charge related to a political protest, he did low-level accounting work in New York. He continued to alienate others with his stubborn arrogance before dying at 46 of a cerebral hemorrhage.\n\nWhat would have helped these boys and the other struggling prodigies in this book? Maybe nothing. But after poring over their words and stories, Hulbert has concluded that they might all offer parents similar advice: Accept who they are.\n\nThat doesn't mean protecting them from failure or stress; quite the opposite. What they want, and need, is the chance to obsess on their own idiosyncratic terms — to sweat and swerve, lose their balance, get their bearings, battle loneliness, discover resilience, Hulbert writes. Interestingly, this is the same advice contemporary psychologists tend to give to all parents, not just the parents of prodigies. Parents must hold children accountable and help them thrive, which is easier said than done; but if they try to re-engineer the fundamentals of their offspring, they will fail spectacularly, sooner or later. And this lesson is particularly obvious in the extremes.\n\nExtraordinary achievement, though adults have rarely cared to admit it, takes a toll, Hulbert writes. It demands an intensity that rarely makes kids conventionally popular or socially comfortable. But if they get to claim that struggle for mastery as theirs, in all its unwieldiness, they just might sustain the energy and curiosity that ideally fuels such a quest.\n\nThe special challenge for prodigies is that they are exceptional in more ways than one. Genius is an abnormality, and abnormalities do not come one at a time, explains Veda Kaplinsky, a longtime teacher of gifted students, in Andrew Solomon's Far From the Tree, a book that is cited by Hulbert. Many gifted kids have A.D.D. or O.C.D. or Asperger's. When the parents are confronted with two sides of a kid, they're so quick to acknowledge the positive, the talented, the exceptional; they are often in denial over everything else.\n\nThe very traits that make prodigies so successful in one arena — their obsessiveness, a stubborn refusal to conform, a blistering drive to win — can make them pariahs in the rest of life. Whatever else they may say, most teachers do not in fact appreciate creativity and critical thinking in their own students. Off the Charts is jammed with stories of small geniuses being kicked out of places of learning. Matt Savage spent two days in a Boston-area Montessori preschool before being expelled. Thanks to parents who had the financial and emotional resources to help him find his way, he is now, at age 25, a renowned jazz musician.
Mr. Spires is one of the hundreds of gay former military personnel who have been emboldened by the 2010 repeal of the United States military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, which prohibited gay men and lesbians from serving openly in the military. In 2011, the federal government allowed changes to veterans' military records, some of which had been labeled undesirable or other than honorable.\n\nThe incentives for doing so were sometimes financial. Such designations could make it difficult for the men and women who had served to get employment, loans or access to veterans benefits. But there was another, more important reason.\n\nThe respect factor, said Matt Thorn, an executive director at OutServe-Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, which helps veterans with the application process needed to reverse such designations. I served my country honorably; I want that respect. And they should have that.\n\nMr. Thorn said many go through an application process that can take up to 18 months. But for Mr. Spires, who recently recovered from pneumonia, it took years of effort that will now allow him to have a burial, when the time comes, with military honors.\n\nI have to quietly go back into my shell now, he said. Because I am 91 years old, and my health is not all it should be. I can't take on jobs that require energy because I don't have it anymore, but I had it long enough to fight the G.D. Air Force and win, he said.
In their statement, the Republicans cited poll results showing most members of their party believe the election was rigged, an assertion that Mr. Trump has made for months, and which has been repeated in the right-wing news media and by many Republican members of Congress.\n\nA fair and credible audit — conducted expeditiously and completed well before Jan. 20 — would dramatically improve Americans' faith in our electoral process and would significantly enhance the legitimacy of whoever becomes our next president, they wrote. We are acting not to thwart the democratic process, but rather to protect it.\n\nThey also acknowledged that their effort was likely to be unsuccessful, given that any such challenge must be sustained by both the House, where Democrats hold the majority, and the Senate, where top Republicans including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, have tried to shut it down.\n\nWe fully expect most if not all Democrats, and perhaps more than a few Republicans, to vote otherwise, the senators wrote.\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the top Democrat on the Rules Committee with jurisdiction over federal elections, called the Republican effort a publicity stunt that would ultimately fail, but said it was dangerous nevertheless, amounting to an attempt to subvert the will of the voters. She noted in an interview that hundreds of millions of votes had already been counted, recounted, litigated and state-certified across the country.\n\nThese baseless claims have already been examined and dismissed by Trump's own attorney general, dozens of courts and election officials from both parties, said Mike Gwin, a spokesman for Mr. Biden's campaign.\n\nWhile lawmakers have sought to register their opposition to past presidential election results by challenging Congress's certification, the move has generally been more symbolic than substantive, given that the loser had already conceded and senators rarely joined with members of the House to force a vote. But as Mr. Trump continues to perpetuate the myth of widespread voter fraud, a growing number of Republicans in Congress have been eager to challenge the results, either out of devotion to the president or out of fear of enraging the base of their party that still reveres him even in defeat.
In November, the state issued a catastrophic fire danger rating for the first time in the decade that the current warning system has been in place.\n\nFormer New South Wales Fire and Rescue chief Greg Mullins said that beginning in April he and 22 other former fire and rescue workers tried to warn Prime Minister Scott Morrison that this fire season would be an especially difficult one and it would be wise to get more water bombers. The fire chiefs were not able to get a meeting with the prime minister, Mr. Mullins said.\n\nLast week, angry residents of the Bega Valley township of Cobargo confronted Mr. Morrison when he visited.\n\nAre major cities, including Sydney and Melbourne, safe from fires?\n\nAlthough the fires haven't ravaged Sydney or Melbourne, and have mostly been in rural areas, smoke and ash have reached coastal suburbs more than 50 miles away, causing the air quality to severely decline.\n\nThe bush fires have created toxic pollution and choking smoke, causing the air quality index in Victoria to rise to more than 999 — the worst in the world on Thursday. Any air quality index over 200 is considered hazardous to health. In Sydney heavy smoke has discolored the sky on many days, and the air quality there has at times been among the worst in the world. In Canberra, the nation's capital, the air quality rating was over 340, leading some businesses to remain closed on Monday. Beijing's rating was 170.\n\nThe Australian Medical Association warned people who are sensitive to smoke, and those with pre-existing heart and lung conditions, to take extra care during the fires. In Melbourne, people rushed to buy P2 and N95 smoke masks. People traveling to Australia should consider bringing their own.\n\nWhat should I do if I'm planning to visit one of the affected areas in the next few weeks?\n\nU.S. Embassy officials said on Thursday that tourists on the South Coast of New South Wales should leave because of extreme fire danger.
CARACAS, Venezuela — Venezuela's National Assembly erupted into chaos on Tuesday as opposition lawmakers took their seats to begin the new year's session, but only after forcing their way through a phalanx of government soldiers.\n\nNational Guardsmen in body armor initially prevented Juan Guaidó, the leader of the country's opposition, from entering the building along with his supporters.\n\nHere the people rule! the legislators cried as they pushed through the heavy wooden doors and installed Mr. Guaidó at the front of the assembly's main hall.\n\nWhen it was all over, Mr. Guaidó said he would continue to claim the country's presidency and he called for a new round of protests, starting Thursday, designed to oust the country's authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro.
Nicole Broch Larsen is probably not discussing much about yardage and lines with her caddie this weekend at the Vic Open in Barwon Heads, Australia.\n\nIf she had her own way, Broch Larsen, the leader of that Ladies European Tour event after 36 holes, would be carrying her own bags. That was how she played the first two rounds, wheeling her bag on a pull cart and making course management decisions by herself as she took a two-stroke lead entering Saturday's third round.\n\nI don't really need a caddie, she told reporters after her six-under-par 67 on Friday at Thirteenth Beach Golf Links. I just need someone to talk to me on the course, just be there. As you can see, I'm pretty good on my own.\n\nRules for the tournament, however, require every player who makes the cut to use a caddie for the weekend rounds. Those rules left Broch Larsen, a 23-year-old Dane, weighing her options Friday evening.
This would give Europeans even less breathing room to keep the J.C.P.O.A. alive until November 2020, when the world would know whether President Trump is re-elected, Ms. Geranmayeh said. It will be very difficult for the Europeans to hold it together.\n\nAfter conversations on Friday morning with officials in Tehran, she said that people inside Iran pushing for the diplomatic process the Europeans have been advocating have lost a lot of ground.\n\nShe said she expected the Iranian response to the killing to be on different tracks, potentially including military attacks on American targets in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan or elsewhere; cyberattacks; or various other possibilities.\n\nPart of the Iranian debate, she said, is whether to retaliate openly or through proxies in a more deniable way, which has been Iran's practice in the past. But with the internal pressure building up inside Iran, and now this external pressure, Iranian decision makers will have to let off some steam somewhere, Ms. Geranmayeh said.\n\nCarl Bildt, the former prime minister of Sweden, said that Europe had been trying to prevent war between Iran and the United States for a decade, but that the scope for salvaging the nuclear accord now is very small, and the scope for diplomacy is extremely limited.
ASUNCIÓN, Paraguay — Before being allowed inside the Paraguay jail cell of a notorious drug kingpin, I braced for an intrusive pat down. But the skinny guard standing just outside the bars barely touched me as he briskly ran his hands down my arms and back.\n\nI was at the prison to interview Marcelo Pinheiro Veiga, who had resorted to an audacious gambit to resist being extradited to his native Brazil: He had confessed to a litany of crimes committed in Paraguay.\n\nAfter the perfunctory search, I entered the small cell and sat about a foot away from Mr. Veiga, close enough to notice his breath smelled fresh.\n\nParaguay is the land of impunity, Mr. Veiga told me after describing a long criminal career that led him to become one of the major smugglers of arms and drugs from Paraguay to Brazil.
Let's hope so, said Mr. Office, 61.\n\nThe measure known as Amendment 4 was approved in November by nearly 65 percent of Florida voters, leaving just two other states — Kentucky and Iowa — with laws in place that prevent people with felony records from voting. But the state's new governor, Ron DeSantis, a Republican who was sworn into office on Tuesday, has suggested that the amendment could face challenges down the line.\n\nMr. DeSantis has said state lawmakers should craft legislation when their session begins in March to define exactly which former felons are now eligible, though the amendment appears to lay that out explicitly.\n\nIt's not delaying it — the people spoke on it, Mr. DeSantis told reporters in Tallahassee, the state capital, on Monday. But I think it's got to be implemented the way that the people intended. And I don't think that they wanted to see any sex offenders fall through the cracks.\n\nThe language of the amendment was intended to be self-executing, making the restoration of rights automatic for former felons without murder or felony sex convictions after they complete all terms of their sentence including parole or probation, without the need for any additional legislative rules. Previously, ex-felons could apply for re-enfranchisement from the governor and state Cabinet, but that strict clemency process was long and laborious, with no set criteria for success.\n\nMore than five million Floridians voted in favor of Amendment 4. That's more votes than any candidate on the ballot received.
You would think that if there were something newsworthy about Waco, a six-episode dramatization of the 1993 Branch Davidian shootout and siege, it would be how it depicts a key event in the radicalization of America's far right. Or, secondarily, how it resonates as the first major offering of the Paramount Network, a new cable channel. (It's on your grid where Spike used to be.)\n\nBut in a sign of how quickly one cultural forest fire follows another these days, Waco has been in the news because of the channel's decision to remove from the credits the name of one of the show's backers — the Weinstein Company, corporation non grata after the Harvey Weinstein sexual-abuse revelations.\n\nOf course, one of the things that David Koresh, leader of the Branch Davidian religious sect, was known for was his habit of sexually appropriating other members' wives. In Waco, a tepid, movie-of-the-week treatment of a fateful calamity in which more than 80 people died, Koresh's appetites are a tolerated vexation among the Branch Davidians and an opportunity for the filmmakers to inject some humor. Turning on his irresistible twinkle, Taylor Kitsch, as Koresh, tells a new recruit that he'll be expected to remain celibate because I've assumed the burden of sex for us all.\n\nParamount's publicity materials claim that Waco, based on a pair of memoirs — one by a Branch Davidian survivor, David Thibodeau, and one by an F.B.I. hostage negotiator, Gary Noesner — will forever change the way the dramatic siege will be viewed. There's nothing to back up that claim in the three episodes available for review, which follow a familiar trajectory from the earlier Ruby Ridge standoff through the botched raid, by Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, on the Branch Davidians' complex outside Waco.
CHAPTER ONE\n\nThe Vanishing American Jew\n\nIn Search of Jewish Identity for the Next Century\n\n\n\nBy ALAN M. DERSHOWITZ\n\n\n\nLittle, Brown and Company\n\nRead the Review\n\nIntroduction The Jewish Question for the Twenty-first\n\nCentury: Can We Survive Our Success?\n\nAmerican Jewish life is in danger of disappearing, just as most American Jews have achieved everything we ever wanted: acceptance, influence, affluence, equality. As the result of skyrocketing rates of intermarriage and assimilation, as well as the lowest birth rate of any religious or ethnic community in the United States, the era of enormous Jewish influence on American life may soon be coming to an end. Although Jews make up just over 2 percent of the population of the United States--approximately 5.5 million out of 262 million--many Americans mistakenly believe that we constitute a full 20 percent of the American people, because of our disproportionate visibility, influence, and accomplishments. But our numbers may soon be reduced to the point where our impact on American life will necessarily become marginalized. One Harvard study predicts that if current demographic trends continue, the American Jewish community is likely to number less than 1 million and conceivably as few as 10,000 by the time the United States celebrates its tricentennial in 2076. Other projections suggest that early in the next century, American Jewish life as we know it will be a shadow of its current, vibrant self--consisting primarily of isolated pockets of ultra-Orthodox Hasidim.\n\nJews have faced dangers in the past, but this time we may be unprepared to confront the newest threat to our survival as a people, because its principal cause is our own success as individuals. Our long history of victimization has prepared us to defend against those who would destroy us out of hatred; indeed, our history has forged a Jewish identity far too dependent on persecution and victimization by our enemies. But today's most serious threats come not from those who would persecute us, but from those who would, without any malice, kill us with kindness--by assimilating us, marrying us, and merging with us out of respect, admiration, and even love. The continuity of the most influential Jewish community in history is at imminent risk, unless we do something dramatic now to confront the quickly changing dangers.\n\nThis book is a call to action for all who refuse to accept our demographic demise as inevitable. It is a demand for a new Jewish state of mind capable of challenging the conventional wisdom that Judaism is more adaptive to persecution and discrimination than it is to an open, free, and welcoming society--that Jews paradoxically need enemies in order to survive, that anti-Semitism is what has kept Judaism alive. This age-old perspective on Jewish survival is illustrated by two tragic stories involving respected rabbinical leaders.\n\nThe first story takes place in 1812, when Napoleon was battling the czar for control of the Pale of Settlement (the western part of czarist Russia), where millions of Jews were forced to live in crowded poverty and under persecution and discrimination as second-class subjects. A victory for Napoleon held the promise of prosperity, first-class citizenship, freedom of movement, and an end to discrimination and persecution. A victory for the czar would keep the Jews impoverished and miserable. The great Hasidic rabbi Shneur Zalman--the founder of the Lubavitch dynasty--stood up in his synagogue on the first day of Rosh Hashanah to offer a prayer to God asking help for the leader whose victory would be good for the Jews. Everyone expected him to pray for Napoleon. But he prayed for the czar to defeat Napoleon. In explaining his counterintuitive choice, he said: Should Bonaparte win, the wealth of the Jews will be increased and their [civic] position will be raised. At the same time their hearts will be estranged from our Heavenly Father. Should however our Czar Alexander win, the Jewish hearts will draw nearer to our Heavenly Father, though the poverty of Israel may become greater and his position lower.\n\nThis remarkable story is all too typical of how so many Jewish leaders throughout our history have reasoned about Jewish survival. Without tsuris--troubles--we will cease to be Jewish. We need to be persecuted, impoverished, discriminated against, hated, and victimized in order for us to retain our Jewishness. The chosen people must be denied choices if Judaism is to survive. If Jews are given freedom, opportunity, and choice, they will choose to assimilate and disappear.\n\nThe story recurs, with even more tragic consequences, on the eve of the Holocaust. Another great Eastern European rabbi, Elchanan Wasserman--the dean of the Rabbinical College in Baranowitz, Poland--was invited to bring his entire student body and faculty to Yeshiva College in New York or to the Beis Medrish Letorah in Chicago, both distinguished Orthodox rabbinical colleges. He declined the invitations because they are both places of spiritual danger, for they are run in a spirit of freethinking. The great rabbi reasoned, What would one gain to escape physical danger in order to then confront spiritual danger? Rabbi Wasserman, his family, his students, and their teachers remained in Poland, where they were murdered by the Nazis.\n\nI call the approach taken by these rabbis the Tsuris Theory of Jewish Survival. Under this theory, the Jews need external troubles to stay Jewish. Nor has this fearful, negative perspective on Jewish survival been limited to ultra-Orthodox rabbis. Many Jewish leaders, both religious and secular, have argued that Jews need enemies--that without anti-Semitism, Judaism cannot survive. Theodor Herzl, the founder of political Zionism and a secular Jew, believed that our enemies have made us one ... It is only pressure that forces us back to the parent stem. In a prediction that reflects an approach to the survival of Judaism strikingly similar to that of the founder of the Lubavitch Hasidim, Herzl warned that if our Christian hosts were to leave us in peace ... for two generations, the Jewish people would merge entirely into surrounding races. Albert Einstein agreed: It may be thanks to anti-Semitism that we are able to preserve our existence as a race; that at any rate is my belief. Jean-Paul Sartre, a non-Jew, went even further, arguing that the sole tie that binds [the Jewish people together] is the hostility and disdain of the societies which surround them. He believed that it is the anti-Semite who makes the Jew.\n\nIf the Tsuris Theory of Jewish identity, survival, and unity is true, then Jews are doomed to live precariously on a pendulum perennially swinging in a wide arc between the extremes of persecution and assimilation. As the pendulum swings away from the Scylla of persecution, it inevitably moves toward the Charybdis of assimilation. In this reactive view, Jews have little power over their ultimate destiny. Our enemies always call the shots, either by persecuting us, in which case we fight back and remain Jewish, or by leaving us alone, in which case we assimilate. The only other alternative--the one proposed by Herzl--is for all Jews to move to Israel, where they control their own destiny. But most Jews will continue to ignore that option, certainly if our hosts continue to leave us in peace in our adopted homelands. In this respect, aliyah (emigration) to Israel has also been largely determined by our external enemies, since most Jews who have moved to the Jewish homeland have done so in reaction to anti-Semitism and persecution in their native countries.\n\nHistorically, therefore, there has been some descriptive truth to this pendulum view of persecution alternating with assimilation. Jews have retained their Jewish identity, at least in part, because of tsuris. Our enemies herded us into ghettos, created pales of settlement, discriminated against us, excluded us from certain livelihoods while pressing us into others. We stuck together and remained Jews, resisting as best we could the persecution by our enemies.\n\nBut there is more--much more--to Jewish identity than collective self-defense. There is something important that is worth defending. After all, until anti-Semitism changed from religious bigotry to racial bigotry--roughly near the end of the nineteenth century--persecuted Jews generally had the option of conversion. Unlike Hitler, our religiously inspired persecutors--the Crusaders, the Inquisitors, Martin Luther, and the pogromists--did distinguish between Jews who converted to Christianity and Jews who did not. Indeed, it was precisely their religious mission to convert the Jews, by whatever methods it took.\n\nMany Jews did convert--some at knifepoint, others to advance themselves. The story about Professor Daniel Chwolson illustrates the latter phenomenon. Chwolson, a Russian intellectual of the nineteenth century, had converted from Judaism to Russian Orthodoxy as a young man, but he continued to fight against anti-Semitism. This led a Jewish friend to ask him why he had converted: Out of conviction, the great man said. What conviction? his Jewish friend inquired. Chwolson responded: Out of a firm conviction that it would be far better to be a professor in St. Petersburg than a Hebrew school teacher in Shklop. Yet despite the material advantages of conversion, most Jews resisted it. Clearly, those Jews--who sacrificed so much--remained Jewish not only in reaction to their enemies. More than our fabled stiff-neckedness was involved. There are substantive principles that Jews have been so stubborn about--that we have been willing to fight and even die for. For Jews who define their Jewishness in theological terms, it is easy to find that principle: It is God's will. For the large number of Jews who are skeptical about being God's chosen people, the principle is more elusive, but it is palpable to most of us, though difficult to articulate. It is a disturbing reality, however, that for a great many Jews, their Jewish identity has been forged and nurtured by our external enemies who have defined us as victims of their persecution.\n\nNow, after two millennia of persecution and victimization, we may well be moving into a new era of Jewish life during which we will not be persecuted or victimized. If this comes to pass, we will need to refocus our attention on defining the positive qualities of Jewish life that ought to make us want to remain Jews without help from our enemies. We must become positively Jewish instead of merely reacting to our enemies.\n\nIf Herzl's and Sartre's entirely negative view of the reason for Jewish survival were to persist even as we enter this new era of equality and acceptance, then Judaism would not deserve to endure. If Jewish life cannot thrive in an open environment of opportunity, choice, freethinking, affluence, success, and first-class status--if we really do need tsuris, czars, pogroms, poverty, insularity, closed minds, and anti-Semitism to keep us Jewish--then Jewish life as we know it will not, and should not, survive the first half of the twenty-first century. We have been persecuted long enough. The time has come to welcome the end of our victimization without fear that it will mean the end of our existence as a people. We must no longer pray for the czar's victory out of fear that the end of our collective tsuris and the success of individual Jews will mean the failure of Judaism.\n\nI believe that Jewish life can thrive in the next century, not despite the end of institutional anti-Semitism, the end of Jewish persecution, and the end of Jewish victimization, but because of these positive developments. The ultimate good news may be that the denouement of negative Judaism--Jewish identification based largely on circling the wagons to fend off our enemies--compels us to refocus on a more positive and enduring Jewish identification, which will be more suitable to our current situation and the one we will likely be facing in the twenty-first century, when Jews will have the unconstrained choice whether to remain Jewish or to assimilate. We may be entering a true Jewish golden age, during which we will prove, once and for all, that Jews do not need enemies to survive. To the contrary: We can thrive best in an open society where we freely choose to be Jews because of the positive virtues of our 3,500-year-old civilization.\n\nI say we may be entering this golden age; there are no guarantees. Many Jews believe that the end is near, because increasing rates of assimilation and intermarriage are propelling us toward a demographic Armageddon. A recent apocalyptic article in a Jewish journal concluded that Kaddish time is fast approaching for the American Jewish community. (Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.) But reports of the death of Judaism may be premature--if we can change the way we think, and act, about Jewish survival. If we refuse to change, if we accept the current demographic trends as intractable, then Jewish life in America may indeed be doomed.\n\nThe challenge is to move the Jewish state of mind beyond its past obsession with victimization, pain, and problems and point it in a new, more positive direction, capable of thriving in an open society. For unless we do, we may become the generation that witnesses the beginning of the end of one of the most influential civilizations in the history of our planet--a unique source of so much goodness, compassion, morality, creativity, and intelligence over the past several millennia. The demise of Jewish life as we have come to know it would be a tragedy not only for the Jewish people collectively, but also for most of us individually--and for the world at large.\n\nThe thesis of this book is that the long epoch of Jewish persecution is finally coming to an end and that a new age of internal dangers to the Jewish people is on the horizon. Institutional anti-Semitism is on its last legs as governments, churches, universities, and businesses embrace Jews. No Jew today needs to convert in order to become a professor, a banker, or a corporate CEO. Although anti-Semitism persists in many quarters, today's overt anti-Semites--the skinheads, militias, Holocaust deniers, and Farrakhan followers--have become marginalized. They continue to constitute a nuisance and pose a potential threat, but they do not have a significant day-to-day impact on the lives of most Jews, as anti-Semites in previous generations did. Today's marginalized anti-Semites do not decide which jobs we can hold, which universities we can attend, which neighborhoods we can live in, which clubs we can join, or even whom we can date and marry. We no longer look up to anti-Semites as the elites in our society who determine our fate. We look down on anti-Semites as the dregs of our society who make lots of noise but little difference.\n\nAs Jews and Israel become more secure against external threats, the internal threats are beginning to grow, as graphically illustrated by the recent assassination of an Israeli prime minister by a Jew, the growing conflict between fundamentalist Jews and more acculturated Jews, the increasing trends toward intermarriage and assimilation, and the decline of Jewish literacy.\n\nFor thousands of years, Jews have been embattled. Surrounded by enemies seeking to convert us, remove us, even exterminate us, we have developed collective defense mechanisms highly adaptive to combating persecution by anti-Semites. But we have not developed effective means of defending the Jewish future against our own actions and inactions. This is our urgent new challenge--to defend the Jewish future against voluntary self-destruction--and we must face it squarely, if we are to prevent the fulfillment of Isaiah's dire prophecy Your destroyers will come from your own ranks.\n\nWe must take control of our own destiny by changing the nature of Jewish life in fundamental ways. The survival of the Jewish people is too important--to us and to the world at large--to be left in the hands of those ultra-Orthodox rabbis who would rather face Armageddon than change the religious status quo. Just as Jews of the past changed the nature of Jewish life in order to adapt to external necessities and to survive the ravages of their external enemies, so, too, must today's Jews change the nature of Jewish life to adapt to new internal necessities and to survive the demographic challenges of intermarriage, assimilation, low birthrates, and the breakdown of neighborhoods and communities.\n\nA hundred years ago, Theodor Herzl identified the Jewish question of the twentieth century as the literal survival of Jews in the face of external enemies committed to our physical annihilation--Jew-haters in every nation where Jews lived as a minority. His solution--the creation of a secular Jewish state--was to change the nature of Jewish life in dramatic and unanticipated ways. A hundred years later, the Jewish question of the twenty-first century is survival in the face of our internal challenges. Herzl also anticipated that this new Jewish question might arise if and when our Christian hosts were to leave us in peace. This is now coming to pass. The solution to this Jewish question also requires the creation of yet another Jewish state: a new Jewish state of mind!\n\nThis book continues where Chutzpah (1991) left off, in exploring the larger issue of being Jewish today. In the concluding paragraphs of that book I issued the following challenge:\n\nWe have learned--painfully and with difficulty--how to fight others. Can we develop Jewish techniques for defending against our own success?\n\nPogo once said: We have [met] the enemy and he is us! As Jews, we have not yet been given the luxury of seeing ourselves as the enemy. There are still too many external enemies who challenge the very physical survival of the Jewish people in Israel and throughout the world. But as we become stronger in the face of our external enemies, we must prepare to confront ourselves.\n\nIn confronting ourselves, we must face the reality that the generation of Jews I wrote about in Chutzpah--those of us who remember the Holocaust, the creation of Israel and the mortal threats to its survival, the movements to save Soviet, Syrian, and Ethiopian Jewry, the struggle against institutional anti-Semitism--is aging. Our children, who have no actual memory of embattled Judaism fighting for the life, liberty, and equality of endangered Jews, are now the crossroads generation that will determine what Jewish life in America and around the world will be in the coming century. It is to that younger generation of Jews, as well as to their parents, that I address this volume.\n\nThe last decade of the twentieth century has witnessed the end of state-sponsored and church-supported anti-Semitism. The fall of the Soviet Union, a nation that, since the time of Stalin, had been a major source of international anti-Semitism, had a domino effect on ending the state sponsorship of this oldest of bigotries. Other nations within the Soviet sphere of influence stopped espousing anti-Semitism as a matter of government policy. Even most Arab and Islamic countries dropped their overtly anti-Semitic policies. As a result, the United Nations has changed its tone, condemning anti-Semitism and reducing somewhat its pro-Arab and anti-Israel bias. Equally important, the Catholic church--the single institution most responsible for the persecution of Jews over the past two millennia--approved diplomatic relations with Israel, thus annulling its entrenched view that Jewish homelessness ... was the Divine judgment against Jews for rejecting Jesus. The American Lutheran Church explicitly rejected Martin Luther's anti-Semitic teachings.\n\nBill Clinton's presidency marked the end of discrimination against Jews in the upper echelons of government. For the first time in American history, the fact that an aspirant for high appointive office was a Jew became irrelevant in his or her selection. President Clinton--our first president who grew up in an age when anti-Semitism was unacceptable--selected several Jewish cabinet members, two Jewish Supreme Court justices, numerous Jewish ambassadors and other high-level executive and judicial officials. Nor, apparently, was Jewishness a bar to election to the United States Congress, which has ten Jewish senators and more than two dozen Jewish representatives, several from states with tiny Jewish populations. Though we have still not had a Jew at the top of either party's ticket, it is fair to say that in today's America, a Jew can aspire to any office, any job, and any social status.\n\nThe wealth of individual Jews grew perceptibly during this decade, with 25 percent of America's richest people being of Jewish background. (If only earned, as distinguished from inherited, wealth is counted, the percentage would be even higher.) An American Leadership study in 1971-72 found that Jews represented more than 10 percent of America's top movers and shakers in business, a higher percentage than any other ethnic group. Jews' per capita income is nearly double that of non-Jews. Twice the percentage of Jews as non-Jews earn more than $50,000 a year. And twice the percentage of non-Jews as Jews earn less than $20,000. Jewish charitable giving has increased along with Jewish wealth. Jews are now among the largest contributors to universities, museums, hospitals, symphonies, opera, and other charities. In 1991, the United Jewish Appeal raised more money than any other charity in America, including the Salvation Army, American Red Cross, Catholic Charities and the American Cancer Society. Yet only one-tenth of Jewish philanthropists limit their giving to Jewish charities alone, while one-fourth give only to non-Jewish causes.\n\nA Jew today can live in any neighborhood, even those that were formerly restricted. Jews live alongside white Anglo-Saxon Protestants in the most exclusive neighborhoods throughout the country--Grosse Pointe, Greenwich, Fifth Avenue, Beacon Hill. And they have been welcomed into the best families, including the Roosevelts, Kennedys, Cuomos, and Rockefellers. Economically, socially, and politically, we have become the new WASPs, as a perusal of the sponsor list of any major charitable or cultural event will show. Indeed, terms such as J.A.S.P. (Jewish Anglo-Saxon Protestant) and W.A.S.H. (White Anglo-Saxon Hebrew) have become current in some circles to denote the full social acceptance that Jews increasingly enjoy.\n\nOf America's Nobel Prize winners in science and economics, nearly 40 percent have been Jews. Of America's 200 most influential intellectuals, half are full Jews, and 76 percent have at least one Jewish parent. Jews attend Ivy League colleges at ten times their presence in the general population. It is no wonder that so many non-Jews believe that we constitute so much higher a percentage of the American population than we actually do. Jews today are equal in virtually every way that matters. What could not have been said even at the end of the 1980s can be said today: American Jews are part of the American mainstream; we are truly victims no more.\n\nYet despite these enormous gains, many older Jews do not seem to be able to give up their anachronistic status as victims. A recent book on the American Jewish community notes: [A]bout a third [of affiliated Jews in San Francisco said] that Jewish candidates could not be elected to Congress from San Francisco. Yet three out of four Congressional representatives ... were, in fact, well identified Jews at the time the poll was conducted. And they had been elected by a population that was about 95 percent non-Jewish.\n\nNor is this misperception limited to California. According to journalist J.J. Goldberg, [T]he percentage of Jews who tell pollsters that anti-Semitism is a `serious problem' in America nearly doubled during the course of the 1980s, from 45 percent in 1983 to almost 85 percent in 1990. Yet by every objective assessment, the problem was less serious in 1990 than it was in 1983, and the trend has clearly been in the direction of improvement.\n\nWhen I speak to older Jewish audiences, I am often accused, sometimes stridently, of minimizing anti-Semitism and am told that it is worse than ever. Social scientists call this dramatic disparity between the reality of declining anti-Semitism and the widespread belief that it is increasing a perception gap between what is actually happening and Jewish sensibilities. Some of the Jews who believe this are similar in this respect to some feminists and black activists I know, who insist that the plight of women and blacks is worse than it ever was. These good and decent people, whose identities are so tied up with their victimization, are incapable of accepting the good news that their situation is improving. It is not even a matter of perceiving the glass as half full or half empty. They see the glass as broken, even though it is intact and quickly filling up. As the sociologist Marshall Sklare puts it: American Jews respond more readily to bad news than to good news.\n\nI am reminded of the story of the two Jews reading their newspapers over a cup of coffee in a late-nineteenth-century Viennese cafe. Kurt is reading the liberal Yiddish-language newspaper and shaking his head from side to side, uttering soft moans of Oy vey and Vey is meir. Shmulie is reading the right-wing, anti-Semitic German-language tabloid and smiling. Kurt, noticing what Shmulie is reading, shouts at his friend, Why are you reading that garbage? Shmulie responds, When I used to take your newspaper, all I would ever read about was Dreyfus being falsely accused, the Jews of Russia being subjected to pogroms, anti-Semitic laws being enacted all over Europe, and the grinding poverty of the Jews in the Holy Land. Now, ever since I take this paper, I read about how the Jews control the banks, the press, the arts; how Jews hold all political power behind the scenes; and how we will soon take over the world. Wouldn't you rather read such good news than such bad news?\n\nWith some of today's older Jews, it is exactly the opposite: they refuse to read the good news, even when it is demonstrably true. They insist on focusing on the oys rather than the joys of Judaism, as Rabbi Moshe Waldoks put it. This is understandable, in light of the long history of persecution. Like an individual victim of a violent crime who sees his assailant around every corner, the Jewish people have been traumatized by our unrelenting victimization at the hands of Jew-haters. It is impossible for anyone who did not personally experience the Holocaust, or the other repeated assaults on Jewish life throughout our history, to comprehend what it must have been like to be victimized by unrelenting persecution based on primitive Jew-hating. We continue to see anti-Semitism even where it has ceased to exist, or we exaggerate it where it continues to exist in marginalized form. Indeed, some Jewish newspapers refuse to print, and some Jewish organizations refuse to acknowledge, the good news, lest they risk alienating their readerships or losing their membership. For example, in November of 1996 I saw a fundraising letter from a Jewish organization which claimed that anti-Semitism ... appears to be growing more robust, more strident, more vicious--and more `respectable.' Well-intentioned as this organization is, it seeks support by exaggerating the threats we currently face and by comparing them to those we faced during the Holocaust.\n\nMy students, my children, my friends' children--our next generation--understand our new status: they do not want to be regarded as victims. They do not feel persecuted, discriminated against, or powerless. They want to read the new good news, not the old bad news. A 1988 poll of Jewish students at Dartmouth College made the point compellingly: When asked whether they believed that their Jewishness would in any way hamper their future success, not a single student answered in the affirmative. That is the current reality, and it is different from the reality my parents faced--and even from the reality many of my generation perceived when we were in college or beginning our careers. The coming generation of Jewish adults will not remain Jews because of our enemies or because of our perceived status as victims. They crave a more positive, affirmative, contemporary, and relevant Jewish identity. Unless we move beyond victimization and toward a new Jewish state of mind, many of them will abandon Judaism as not relevant to their current concerns.\n\nIf we are to counteract this trend, we must understand the dynamics of contemporary assimilation and not confuse them with past episodes of assimilation, which were based largely on the perceived need to escape from the burdens of Jewish identification. Today, there are no burdens from which to escape. Being Jewish is easy, at least in relation to external burdens. Jews today assimilate not because Christianity or Islam is better or easier, but because Jewish life does not have a strong enough positive appeal to offset the inertial drift toward the common denominator. Jews do not convert to Christianity; they convert to mainstream Americanism, which is the American religion closest to Judaism. They see no reason not to follow their heart in marriage, their convenience in neighborhoods, their economic opportunities in jobs, their educational advantages in schools, their conscience in philosophy, and their preferences in lifestyle. Most Jews who assimilate do not feel that they are giving up anything by abandoning a Jewishness they know little about. They associate the Judaism they are abandoning with inconvenient rituals and rules that have no meaning to them. As one young woman remembers her Jewishness: An old man saying no.\n\nWe must recognize that many of the factors which have fueled current assimilation and intermarriage are positive developments for individual Jews: acceptance, wealth, opportunity. Most Jews do not want to impede these developments. Indeed, they want to encourage them. For that reason, we must accept the reality that many Jews will continue to marry non-Jews, but we should not regard it as inevitable that these marriages will necessarily lead to total assimilation. We can take positive steps to stem that tide--but it will take a change in attitude toward mixed marriages, and indeed toward the tribalism that has understandably characterized Jewish attitudes toward outsiders for so much of our history.\n\nWhy is this book different from other books about the Jewish future? Because its author does not have a religious or political agenda. This book is not a commercial for any particular brand of Judaism or Zionism. It does not begin with a priori assumptions about God, the survival of the Jewish people, the superiority of Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, or Reconstructionist Judaism, or the essential conservativism or liberalism of Judaism. I am neither a rabbi, a Jewish fund-raiser, a member of a Jewish studies faculty, an officer of any Jewish organization, nor an advocate for any particular Israeli party. Though I am essentially a secular Jew, I do belong to Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, and Reconstructionist congregations. Most of my family members are modern Orthodox, and a few are ultra-Orthodox. Some are completely secular. I have generally positive feelings about all Jewish denominations, as I do about the numerous Jewish political, educational, and philanthropic organizations to which I belong and contribute. I have no personal stake in any particular solution to the problem of Jewish survival. I just want American Jewish life to move from strength to strength. I love my Judaism and I feel passionately about its survival, but I do not believe in survival merely for survival's sake. Judaism should not be seen as a patient about to die a natural death, who is kept alive artificially on a respirator for as long as possible without regard to the quality of life. Our goal should be a self-sustaining Judaism that can thrive in the kind of open society in which most Jews want to spend their lives. I strongly believe that it is essential--both for Jews and for America--that the mainstream American Jewish community flourish. It would be a tragedy if the only forms of Judaism the made it past the twenty-first century were insular, ultra-Orthodox Judaism and Israeli Zionism. I hope that they, too, will continue to prosper, but I believe that a more diverse Jewish life has even more to contribute. If I have a bias, it is in favor of an eclectic, tolerant many-branched menorah that is inclusive of all who wish to safeguard and share the future of the Jewish people.\n\nI also bring to this book a unique perspective informed by my experiences growing out of the publication of Chutzpah five years ago. Since that time, I have spoken to well over 100,000 Jews in nearly every city with a significant Jewish population, not only in this country but throughout the world. The talk is usually preceded by a social hour and followed by a question period. I estimate that I have been asked more than a thousand questions by concerned Jews. I have received more than ten thousand letters and phone calls from Jewish men, women, and children. I have also been teaching young students, many of them Jewish, for a third of a century. I have served as faculty adviser to the Harvard Jewish Law Students Association, have been an active participant in Hillel, and have spoken to Jewish student groups at many colleges and universities around the world. Over these years, I have discussed virtually every Jewish issue--from God to intermarriage to Israel to anti-Semitism to Jewish feminism--with thousands of students. These questions, letters, calls, and discussions have given me an extraordinary window into the fears, hopes, and beliefs of a wide assortment of Jews. It has been quite an education. I think I understand what is on the minds and in the souls of many Jews, of all ages, and I try to address myself to these concerns in this book. I also have a unique window into the mind of the anti-Semite, since I continue to receive hundreds of anti-Semitic letters and calls each year, some quite lengthy and revealing.\n\nThough I care deeply about the survival of the Jewish people, I do not believe that survival is assured by any biblical imperative or divine promise. I approach the issue of Jewish survival as I would any other important empirical challenge: with an open mind ready and willing to accept any pragmatic solution, or combination of solutions, that will work. I am committed to doing whatever is in my power to help ensure the Jewish future. I know that many Jews feel the same way.\n\nI agree neither with those theologians who believe that Jewish survival is assured because God promised it nor with those demographers who believe that Jewish disappearance is inevitable because of forces beyond our control. I believe that our future as a people is largely in our own hands, and I want to help define and defend the new Jewish state of mind.\n\nIn the first chapter of this book, I focus on what is probably the most whispered-about subject among American Jews today: intermarriage and how to cope with this growing reality. I try to bring this controversial subject out of the closet in all its dimensions. I do not moan and groan and wring my hands. I do not present a religious agenda. I explore the issue from both a demographic and a personal perspective, in an effort to understand it and deal with it instructively and realistically. My analysis and conclusions will be controversial and will, I hope, stimulate a debate within the Jewish community and beyond. My goal is to ask all the hard questions, and to provide a wide variety of responses in addition to my own. I know that many readers will disagree with me, but I hope they will not be able to ignore the challenges I pose.\n\nIn chapters 2, 3, and 4, I develop my thesis that the nature of anti-Semitism is changing in fundamental and important ways: Mainstream anti-Semitism--as traditionally practiced by churches, states, corporations, universities, and other elite institutions--is coming to an end; today's Jew-haters are largely marginalized and powerless. This change means that although anti-Semitism persists and must continue to be monitored, it has far less daily impact on the lives of American Jews than in the past. Thus we must define our Jewish identity in different and more positive ways than we did the past.\n\nIn chapters 5, 6, and 7, I explore the most frequently proposed solutions to the problem of assimilation. To those who are sure that return to religion is Judaism's only salvation, I say, Get as many to return as you can. Maybe you are right. But we cannot rely exclusively on your solution, because maybe you are wrong. Maybe not enough Jews will become religious. Maybe religion--at least as currently defined and practiced--is not the wave of the future for most young intellectuals. Maybe there is a strand of Judaism that can survive and thrive without exclusive dependence on theology and ritual. After all, the Yiddish secularism that flourished between the beginning of the Jewish Enlightenment (Haskalah) and the Second World War was an authentic Jewish culture, which was destroyed by external forces. Political Zionism, which grew largely out of that culture, remains an authentic Jewish civilization of enormous importance to the survival of Judaism. Today's influential American Jewish community is largely secular.\n\nTo those who look to Israel as Judaism's sole salvation, I say, Keep trying to get Jews from throughout the Diaspora to make aliyah. Maybe you are right. But we cannot count on Zionism and aliyah alone, because maybe you are wrong. Maybe most Jews will want to remain where they and their families have established a comfortable home. Maybe they will not come to Israel. Maybe Israel will not endure forever as a Jewish state. Maybe it will normalize--as Theodor Herzl put it--and become like most other states, which began as religious but became secular and multicultural over time.\n\nTo those who believe that an emphasis on Jewish ethics will be enough to transmit the essence of Judaism to our children, I say, Maybe you are right. Certainly many Jews, especially secular Jews, agree with you and hope you are right. But beyond broad generalities, it is difficult to distill from the highly diverse Jewish sources a few programmatic essences that are easily transmittable from generation to generation, without living the kind of Jewish lives that our grandparents lived.\n\nTo those who say that Jewish fund-raising, charity, and defense organizations are the answer, I say, Work on, raise money, build buildings, elect officers, bestow honors, monitor anti-Semitism, support Israel. But do not count on it to ensure the Jewish future, because maybe the next generation will not be as attracted to these institutions as the post-Holocaust generation was.\n\nTo those who say that Jewish education is the key to Jewish survival, I say, You are undoubtedly right. Whatever the essence or essences of Judaism may be, they are in large part, at least, to be discovered and rediscovered in our books, in our history, and in our approach to learning. But we cannot count on all Jews, so many of whom are busy with their successful careers, to become Jewishly educated, especially since Jewish education today is controlled almost entirely by the religious component of Jewish life and has been one of the great failures of the American Jewish community.\n\nIn the final chapter, I propose a series of steps that I believe we must take in order to safeguard the Jewish future. We must change the nature of American Jewish life in fundamental ways if we are to survive the new threats to our continuity as a people. These changes must make us more adaptive to the reality that we can no longer define ourselves--and our children--by reference to our past victimization and persecution. We must adopt a new, more positive, Jewish identity based on a 3,500-year-old tradition of education, scholarship, learning, creativity, justice, and compassion. But first we must figure out a way to make this diverse library of Jewish knowledge accessible and useful to generations of Jews who are abysmally ignorant of their remarkable tradition. The famed Yiddisher cup (khop)---Jewish head--is only half full: the typical Jewish college graduate is extraordinarily well educated about general subjects, but goes through life with a kindergarten understanding of Judaism. We must begin to fill the Yiddisher cup with the kind of useful Jewish knowledge that will assure both our success and our survival. To do this, we will have to loosen the monopolistic hold that rabbis now have over Jewish education, so that we can begin to compete effectively in the marketplace of ideas for the minds and hearts of our Jewish youth. Unless we begin to make use of our competitive advantage--as teachers, communicators, scholars, advocates, and strategists--we will lose our children and grandchildren to the seductive drift toward assimilation and away from Jewishness. The fundamental changes we must make will require a reordering of our priorities away from an almost exclusive focus on defending Jews against external enemies and toward new ways of defending ourselves and our children against self-destruction through assimilation. We will have to educate our children differently, allocate our charitable giving differently, select our leaders differently--even define our very Jewishness differently. Jewish life will have to become less tribal, more open, more accepting of outsiders, and less defensive.\n\nWhen I describe some of the multiple roads we must take if we are to maximize our chances for survival, I think of a variation of the old story of the rabbinical judge who, after hearing a wife's complaints about her husband, says, My daughter, you are right, and, after hearing the husband's complaints, says, My son, you are right. When his student observes, Rabbi, they can't both be right, he replies, My son, you are right. Under my variation, the rabbi responds to his student, No, you are wrong. They can both be right. To the differing and sometimes inconsistent approaches to Jewish survival, I would say, You may all be right. Don't you dare tell each other that you are wrong. Nobody has a monopoly on the truth about the Jewish future. Everything that may work must be tried.\n\nAt the end of the last century, Theodor Herzl called for a new Jewish state. As we approach the close of this cataclysmic century, I believe we need a new Jewish state of mind if we are to define and ensure the Jewish future, not only for our sake but for the sake of all humankind.\n\n(C) 1997 Alan M.

Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and his deputies have made clear to colleagues that they strongly oppose the effort to reverse the election results, but Mr. Hawley has said he will force a vote and at least 12 other Republican senators plan to back him. The party fissures have extended to the House, where the top Republican, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, has not revealed how he plans to vote on Jan. 6 but has said he is supportive of those who want to have a debate, while Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican, has argued vociferously against the move.\n\nThat has created something of a free-for-all in the House. Lawmakers have been left to weigh on their own whether to vote to protect the sanctity of the election and risk incurring the wrath of their constituents, or move to overturn the results in a doomed loyalty test that could badly damage their party.\n\nRepresentative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, said in an interview that he and the other conservatives who came out on Monday against the challenge were hoping to put forward a constitutionally grounded argument from a pro-Trump perspective that their colleagues could adopt.\n\nI think there are a lot of people of the same mind as us, but they were looking for some kind of grounding or maybe some kind of cover, Mr. Massie said. I feel like there are people getting sucked into the other vortex as the hours go by.\n\nOther Republicans, including some of the president's most ardent defenders, were plainly uneasy about the coming vote, prompting a series of tortured statements seeking to justify the most basic of democratic positions: a vote to respect the outcome of an election.\n\nThe easiest vote for me politically would be to object to everything and vote for every objection, Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, said on Sunday. On Monday, Mr. Cramer issued a statement saying he would not object, adding objecting to the Electoral College votes is not an appropriate or effective way to change the results.\n\nSenator Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican who is up for re-election in 2022, said in a lengthy statement that he voted for Mr. Trump but could not object to certifying the election results, citing his opposition to a similar, Democratic-led effort in 2005.
12:30 p.m. Over lunch, we continued to talk about holiday 2020 ideas, because a few key accounts would like to see previews. We reviewed cards that need to get to the printer. We ordered take out from Sweetgreen and ate at the conference table in the office. In Florida, nobody eats at their desks. I didn't think that was weird until we hired New Yorkers and they would say, Where is everyone? And I would say, They're out taking their lunch break.\n\n2 p.m. Trish brought up some big collaborations she wants me to consider. I passed on most of them. We have a capsule collection at Anthropologie of mugs and travel accessories, categories we have not yet fully developed. Anthropologie wants to keep some of that going and I did say yes to that.\n\n7 p.m. I went back to Greenwich Hotel and ordered room service (spaghetti). I was in bed by 9:30. One of my goals when I come to New York is to sleep. Child-free sleep is a deep, magical sleep.\n\nTuesday\n\n7:45 a.m. I had breakfast with a friend in the pretty parlor room at the hotel. He works at the Art Academy and we've been talking about our doing a workshop with the students, where we would end up with a limited-edition print.\n\n9:30 a.m. I did a few emails. We use Slack at Rifle, so I checked in on some Slacks from the Florida team. I personally like Slack for group-chat back-and-forth conversation, whereas email is good for discussions you need to keep organized.\n\n1 p.m. We had an epic two-hour meeting discussing our spring marketing initiatives, so that I can go to the creative team in Florida to talk about how we can support it all. We had lunch during the meeting. I ordered from a random Japanese place I found on Uber Eats.\n\n3:30 p.m. We reviewed some 2021 planners and a few tech samples. Like an AirPod Pro case we are making with Case-Mate.
MELBOURNE, Australia — Tennis got more than its share of undesirable events in 2016: Roger Federer's first surgery, Maria Sharapova's suspension for a doping violation, the knife attack on Petra Kvitova that left the future of her career in doubt.\n\nBut the sport also checked some long-empty boxes. Novak Djokovic won his first French Open to become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold all four major trophies at the same time. Serena Williams tied Steffi Graf's record for Grand Slam singles titles in the Open era by winning her 22nd. Argentina finally won its first Davis Cup, and Andy Murray became Sir Andy Murray, even if he sounded as if he could have happily waited quite a bit longer for the honor.\n\nWith the new season beginning in earnest with the Australian Open this week, what might 2017 bring?\n\nOne longtime observer's annual wish list:\n\nTennis needs to follow the lead of other sports and get better at prologue. A draw is too good an opportunity to waste, but for now, the major events are not taking full advantage. There should be more spectacle and, above all, more suspense. Consider the buzz generated by the draws for the World Cup or the Champions League. Or by the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament selections in the United States.\n\nProfessional tennis can do better. At the Grand Slam events, cutting back to 16 seeds in singles from the current 32 would be the boldest way forward. There were 16 until 2001, when the United States Open successfully pushed for 32, with an eye toward increasing the chances that stars would still be in contention on the first weekend, when major television coverage then kicked in. The change was originally linked to an agreement to use surface-based seeding, but at this stage surface-based seeding exists only to a limited degree at Wimbledon, yet the 32 seeds remain.
An exposé of Silk Road, the underground drug market.\n\nPulitzer-winning restaurant criticism in Los Angeles.\n\nA tale of eating mozzarella sticks for 14 hours straight.\n\nJournalists and readers have feared that gems like these could disappear from the internet if the wealthy owners of Gawker and L.A. Weekly wanted to eliminate what they deem to be unfavorable coverage elsewhere on the sites.\n\nHoping to neutralize the potential threat, the Freedom of the Press Foundation said on Wednesday that it would archive online content it deems at risk of being deleted or manipulated, starting with the two publications.\n\nThe organization, which protects and defends adversarial journalism, said it aimed to protect publications from what it calls the billionaire problem, or the ability of news figures to buy publications with the intent of taking them offline.
FOR USE: After 11:30 A.M., Saturday, October 16, 1965 TIME CAPSULE II DEPOSITED FOR 5,000 YEARS AT WORLD'S FAIR WORLD'S FAIR, N. Y., Oct. 16 -- Time Capsule II was lowered into a 50-foot steel shaft here today to await its discoverers in the 70th century. At the push of a button by Westinghouse President Donald C. Burnham, an electrically driven hoist sent the 465-pound torpedo-shaped vessel to its permanent resting place alongside the 1938 Westinghouse Time Capsule. Its message, chosen by world authorities, documents major achievements and events of the past quarter century in 117,000 microfilmed pages and 45 objects selected for their significance to people in the distant future. Taking part in the special ceremony at the Westinghouse pavilion were Fair President Robert Moses, New York City Park Commissioner Newbold Morris, and Dr. Leonard Carmichael, vice president for research and exploration, National Geographic Society. Dr. C armichael headed the committee of distinguished experts who selected contents for Time Capsule II. In these Time Capsules, Mr. Burnham said, men 5,000 years from now can find a record of civilization -- a record which could be more priceless to them than the Rosetta stone, or the Pyramids, or the Dead Sea Scrolls have been to us. Mr. Burnham pointed out that chemical testing of the Kromarc stainless steel used to make the Time Capsule, and of the soil where it lies, show that the Capsule's contents will be safe from corrosion. Speaking for the Selections Committee, Dr. Carmichael described the project as an unusual intellectual experience. For those who are destined to recover it, he said, Time Capsule II preserves a rich and varied picture of our time. But it does more. Within it have been placed scientific experiments in astronomy and in nuclear science which will enable us to join with our counterparts across 50 centuries in seeking answers to certain basic questions concerning the fundamental nature of the universe and man's environment. Contents in Gas Atmosphere Final packing of the Time Capsule was completed last week at the Westinghouse Research Laboratories in Pittsburgh. All contents were sealed into a Pyrex glass cylinder filled with inert argon gas. In addition, 17 cans of archival quality microfilm, prepared by the Recordak Corporation, were sealed separately in an aluminum container, and many of the objects were enclosed in individual glass vials, all containing argon gas. Westinghouse scientists covered the glass cylinder with asbestos tape before inserting it into the 7-1/2-foot capsule shell. The end of the capsule was then welded on to make it completely airtight. At today's ceremony, Time Capsule II was deposited exactly 10 feet due north of the 1938 Westinghouse Time Capsule, which documented civilization as it existed in the 1930's. Information about the capsule is being mailed to hundreds of libraries, museums and other depositories throughout the world which received the 1938 Time Capsule Book of Record. The Book of Record contains directions for locating and retrieving the original capsule, along with a phonetic key to the English language. At the close of the World's Fair, a seven-ton granite monument will remain to mark permanently the site of the Time Capsules in Flushing Meadow. The 50-foot steel shaft will be filled with pitch, concrete and earth. World Experts Aided Project Fourteen American authorities, including two Nobel Prize winners, were aided in selecting contents for Time Capsule II by International Advisory Sub-Committees in Europe, Far East-Oceania, Latin America and African-Middle East. Their task was to create a lasting record of the major achievements and events in human activity over the past 25 years. The result is a collection of material from more than 475 references, including encyclopedias, magazines, newspapers, technical papers, pamphlets, catalogs, transcripts, and 29 texts written especially for the capsule by international experts. The bibliography of contents fills 70 typewritten pages. In point of time, the documentation runs from Albert Einstein's 1939 letter to President Roosevelt, alerting him to the dawn of the atomic age, to the seven-day Gemini flight of Astronauts L. Gordon Cooper and Charles Conrad. Voices of famous world leaders and modern music are preserved on special recordings made of nickel. Among objects in the capsule are antibiotics, freeze-dried food, credit cards, a ball-point pen, a bikini bathing suit and a Beatles record. As a genealogical record, there are signatures of nearly a million people, including President Lyndon B. Johnson and Pope Paul VI. Special Experiments Included Three experiments in the capsule promise valuable information to scientists in the far future. Astronomers of the mid-70th century can compare their skies with those of our time and determine the short-term astronomical changes that occurred in the int ervening millennia. A sample from a 200-year-old Sequoia tree will enable scientists to measure the change in the level of cosmic radiation. Vials of normal and irradiated seeds are also included in the capsule to see if they can remain alive for 5,000 years. Serving on the Selections Committee for Time Capsule II with Dr. Carmichael were: Dr. Detlev W. Bronk, President, The Rockefeller Institute and past president, The National Academy of Sciences and the Johns Hopkins University Dr. Ralph J. Bunche, Under Secretary, United Nations and recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize Dr. Vannevar Bush, honorary chairman, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Corporation and former President, Carnegie Institution of Washington Dr. James B. Conant, former U. S. Ambassador and former president, Harvard University Dr. Watson Davis, director, Science Service and former president, American Documentation Institute Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, deputy administrator, National Aeronautics & Space Administration and former director, National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics Dr. John Kieran, former newspaper columnist, sport authority and author of natural history books Dr. Henry Allen Moe, president, American Philosophical Society and former president, John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Dr. Eugene Ormandy, conductor and music director, Philadelphia Orchestra Dr. Alfred Newton Richards, pharmacologist, past president, National Academy of Sciences and former vice president in charge of medical affairs, University of Pennsylvania Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg, chairman, Atomic Energy Commission, winner of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry and former chancellor, University of California at Berkeley Dr. William E.

Q. I have a Netflix account for streaming only. Is there a list of all the movies and shows available with French-dubbed audio?\n\nA. Netflix supports alternate audio and subtitles in multiple languages for much of its content, but not every show or movie is available in every supported language. One way to see what items are available in French (or another language) in your region is to log into your Netflix account and point your browser to netflix.com/subtitles.\n\nOn the Audio & Subtitles page, use the drop-down menus to select Audio or onscreen Subtitles, and then choose a language. In the United States, 18 languages (including French, German, Hindi, Spanish, Tagalog and more) are currently listed. Once you have made your menu selections, Netflix shows you the available content.
INVERLOCH, Australia — They fled from looming firestorms that threatened to cut off their escape, only to join a slog alongside the masses of others who crowded the roads. Thousands more waited for rescue by sea.\n\nAcross the scorched southeast, frightened Australians — taking a few cherished things, abandoning their homes and vacation rentals, and braving smoke that discolored the skies — struggled Thursday to evacuate as wildfires turned the countryside into charcoal wasteland.\n\nAnd from government officials came a disheartening warning: This weekend will be one of the worst periods yet in Australia's catastrophic fire season.
You don't really learn anything, said Malkovich, who has appeared in more than 100 screen and theatrical productions; was a founding member of the Steppenwolf Theater Company, in Chicago; and is also a vintner and a men's fashion designer. You're comprised of your experiences. And that's what makes you, or in fact breaks us all in the end.\n\nHis trademark gaptoothed smile spread slowly across his face: We die and then we're gone. That's O.K.\n\nThese are edited excerpts from the conversation.\n\nWhat did you and Paolo discuss in terms of how your character might be a different type of leader than Jude Law's?\n\nWhen we discussed it, mine was going to be a German who had spent a lot of time in England. Then he became an English aristocrat. The punk rock back story came when the decision was made to make him English. And then we communicated about what I thought was important or we could use more of or less of, et cetera. But it wasn't so much the discussion; the role kind of revealed itself in the writing and rewriting.\n\nOf course with Paolo, most things are revealed when you see what the camera does. His way of putting people in a geography — in a room or outdoors, at a time of day — pretty much tells you what to do. The rituals, the secrets, the symbolism of the church: That's a very hard kind of nut to crack with words.\n\nDid putting on the papal vestments prompt something more in terms of connecting to that character?\n\nYeah, sure. Because the church just fits into all those S's: symbolism, spirituality, sacredness, secrets. It satisfies a longing that I think naturally exists in people. How do we live? Why are we here? Was I even here? We kind of forget to ask those questions. That's what I think the church is for. You know, I'm an atheist, but I get the point. And that's something I think Paolo, being Italian and being Catholic, just understands on the most profound levels.
Will the United States spend tens of billions of dollars over the next few years to slow climate change?\n\nWill Congress reduce medical costs for middle-class and poor families — and raise taxes on the rich?\n\nWill Joe Biden be able to appoint the judges of his choice to the federal bench?\n\nAnd will Biden be able to enact the coronavirus policies he favors?\n\nThese questions and many more are effectively on the ballot in Georgia today. The state is voting in runoff elections that will choose both of its senators, after no candidate won 50 percent of the vote in November. Republicans need to win only one of the two races to keep Senate control; Democrats need both to retake control.
According to them, a standard American home should cost around $200,000, a figure that includes the cost of construction, what land would cost in a lightly regulated market, and a modest profit for developers. In many places, that's what the prices roughly are. But for a few metropolitan areas like San Francisco and Boston, homes are wildly overpriced, leading to distortions in the economy and labor market.\n\nWe would still see homes of different sizes and styles — condos in some places, single-family homes in others — depending on the market in each city. A New York home would be smaller than one in, say, Houston.\n\nAnd prices would still vary from place to place, based on demand and geography. It's easier to build in Phoenix (plenty of flat land), and harder in San Francisco (lots of hills and nearby water). But while building in the San Francisco metro area is more expensive than in other places, it's not that expensive. By the paper's calculations, a home in the San Francisco area should cost around $281,000.\n\nThe actual price for a standard home in the area is more like $800,000 (using 2013 data). The paper argues that most of that difference is caused by regulatory hurdles like design and environmental reviews that can add years to a project's timeline and suppress the overall housing supply. The result is overpayment on a grand scale for the few homes that do get built.\n\nPeople are sure to quibble with the economists' calculations, but their general conclusion — that an abundance of new homes would result in lower prices — is not remotely controversial. Many studies, from the McKinsey Global Institute, California's Legislative Analyst's Office and others, have shown that California's high home prices are largely a supply problem: The state doesn't build enough homes.\n\nThere are counterexamples around the world. Tokyo has not had rapid home price appreciation because increases in demand are met with increases in new building.\n\nSo let's carry on with this hypothetical. Say we opened the floodgate of development. What kind of effects could we expect? The economy would grow, and by a lot. According to a recent paper by the economists Chang-Tai Hsieh, from the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business, and Enrico Moretti, from the University of California, Berkeley, local land-use regulations reduce the United States' economic output by as much as $1.5 trillion a year, or about 10 percent lower than it could be.
Adding to the difficulty of reaching a deal has been the fractious nature of the Trump administration, with the three main government departments involved in the negotiations each pursuing a somewhat different agenda. Those different agendas to some extent reflect each agency's institutional biases and responsibilities, but make it harder to predict what a final deal will look like.\n\nRobert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative and a hawk on trade issues, has led the push to impose tariffs on imports from China and has pursued an ambitious agenda that would require China to carry out verifiable and enforceable changes to the basic structure of its economy. Mr. Trump said last month that Mr. Lighthizer would be the lead trade negotiator with China.\n\nThe Commerce Department, which oversees American export promotion activities overseas, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross have been pushing since the early days of the administration for a deal that would require China to buy more food, natural gas and other products from the United States. Beijing officials have been happy to go along, as their country is short on arable land and gas, and long-term purchase agreements fit easily into the Chinese government's economic planning model.\n\nThe Treasury Department, under Secretary Steven Mnuchin, has been pushing for a quick deal that would stop further increases in American tariffs. But Treasury would preserve indefinitely the 25 percent tariffs that Mr. Trump imposed in July and August on $50 billion a year in Chinese-made goods, or roughly a tenth of American imports, and the 10 percent tariffs that he imposed in September on an additional $200 billion in Chinese goods.\n\nThat first set of tariffs covers several categories in which China does not export much now but plans to do so in the next several years. The most important products covered by the 25 percent tariffs are gasoline-powered and electric cars. At least six Chinese automakers have announced plans to start exporting cars to the United States in 2020, said Michael Dunne, the chief executive of ZoZo Go, an automotive consulting firm specializing in China.\n\nImport duties will slow — but not stop — Chinese automakers' plans to enter the U.S., he said. With a slowing home market, pressure to export has never been greater.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans alike have been wary of allowing an influx of Chinese cars in an election year, particularly when manufacturing states like Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin have been among the main electoral battlegrounds in recent decades.
Chief executives and other leaders from many of America's largest businesses on Monday urged Congress to certify the electoral vote on Wednesday to confirm Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s presidential victory.\n\nAttempts to thwart or delay this process run counter to the essential tenets of our democracy, they said in a statement. Included in the list of 170 signers were Laurence D. Fink of BlackRock, Logan Green and John Zimmer of Lyft, Brad Smith of Microsoft, Albert Bourla of Pfizer, and James Zelter of Apollo Global Management.\n\nOver the weekend, President Trump called Georgia's Republican secretary of state in an effort to subvert the election results. On the call, which was recorded, the president pressured the official to find enough votes to overturn Mr. Biden's victory. The president's demand raised questions about whether he violated election fraud statutes, lawyers said, though a charge is unlikely. President-elect Biden won the Electoral College, 306 to 232, and the popular vote was 81.2 million for Mr. Biden to Mr. Trump's 74.2 million.\n\nMembers of the president's party are divided over whether to accept that he lost the election: While top Republicans, such as Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, have pushed back on a futile attempt in Congress to reject the results, about a dozen senators and senators-elect have lined up behind President Trump's bid to hold on to power.
But when it came to settling on a career, he decided there was not enough real piloting involved. We were told, 'Nobody flies above 10,000 feet, they're all on autopilot. You're a glorified backup,' he recalled. Whatever romance was left in commercial aviation, the jet engine killed.\n\nHe was not interested in stunt flying or becoming a military pilot, so he abandoned aviation and found a job managing a branch of a courier company in Silicon Valley. Jobs at a consulting firm that handled transportation planning issues and at another trucking firm followed.\n\nThen it was on to law school at Boston University and a summer job as a volunteer law clerk, drafting opinions for administrative law judges from the National Transportation Safety Board. None of the judges were pilots, he said. I understood the facts better than they did, no offense. They said they wanted to hire me on a paid basis during law school. So they did, and also after he finished law school.\n\nThe slowest part of a conversation with Mr. Avedisian is the tell-us-all-about-it part, because he will not discuss details of his idea for the subway while the contest is still going on.\n\nThe transit agency said he was a finalist in a category called Rapidly Deploy Modernized Subway Cars to the Subway System. (The other categories involve modernizing the antiquated signal system and improving the communications infrastructure.)\n\nThe transit authority said Mr. Avedisian had proposed adding up to four cars to trains currently in operation to increase both train capacity and passenger comfort. The agency said Mr. Avedisian's longer trains would stop at every station, but not every car would open. Some cars at the front and back of a train will not platform at every station, the authority said, but generally will platform at alternating stations.\n\nIn plainer terms, using an existing 10-car train as an example, the first four cars would open at one station, leaving the last four beyond the platform with the doors closed. At the next station, the train would in effect overshoot the platform, allowing the last four cars to reach the platform and open while the first four stayed shut. Six cars in the middle would open on the platform at every stop.
Good morning. There's a lot of exciting reading in the Food section we sent to the printing plants last night and delivered to the vicinity of front doors and driveways this chilly morning. Ligaya Mishan takes us all on vacation to Hawaii, where she's from, to eat poke and experience it in its indigenous form, far superior to anything you'll ever find on the mainland. For Beers of The Times, Eric Asimov and his merry band of tasters dive deep into the pleasures of brown ale. Pete Wells reviews Ferris, a new New American restaurant in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan.\n\nAnd Tejal Rao brings forth a delightful profile of Angie Mar, the chef and an owner of the Beatrice Inn in Manhattan, which includes a recipe of Ms. Mar's for an impressively large English-style meat pie with potatoes and brown gravy, with a marrow bone roasted right into it. Some, like me, will want to make that as soon as this weekend, a kind of cry against winter in place of a flight to Kailua. (Though we'd take that flight if we could, for sure. You ever see how they fish for giant trevally there?)\n\nTonight, though, I think most will want to cook simply, get some grub on the table soon as possible. That is the way of the world in the middle of the week, and, though we ache to change many things about our state of affairs, that is not one of them. You won't even need a recipe! Just cook some pasta — ziti, for instance, for that's what is on the shelf — in salted water, and drain it just before it is done, reserving a cup of the cooking water.\n\nWhile the pasta cooks, melt a honking big knob of unsalted butter in a pan large enough to hold the pasta and cook some diced onions or shallots in it until they're translucent. Add some slivered sage leaves and finish cooking the pasta in all of that, making a kind of sauce with around a half-cup of the cooking water and a healthy shower of grated Parmesan — like, at least a cup. Season liberally with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper and — here's a twist — serve the whole thing on a bed of raw baby greens, which will melt a little in the heat, while still retaining some crunch. Dinner is served.
Broadway performers and stage managers are demanding a share of the profits from hit shows they help to create, setting off a labor dispute that is threatening to disrupt the high-stakes development of new musicals and plays.\n\nActors' Equity, a national labor union, and the Broadway League, a trade association representing producers, are at odds over the issue two years after public pressure from the original cast of Hamilton prompted that blockbuster show's producers to agree to a new formula for distributing its proceeds.\n\nEquity says the two sides are at an impasse and it is considering a limited strike in which it would bar its members from participating in any developmental work with commercial producers. The union says it is unhappy with how its members are compensated for work in developmental labs, which are generally four-week sessions in which actors and writers test out material for shows in progress. Recent productions that have used labs include The Cher Show, To Kill a Mockingbird, Hello, Dolly! and Waitress.\n\nAfter two years of wrangling and negotiating we are just at a standstill, Mary McColl, the union's executive director, said.
Tesla has long promoted its cars as among the safest available. After its Model S electric sedan was reviewed by the federal government's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 2013, Tesla said it had received the best safety rating of any car ever tested.\n\nBut a more rigorous safety review has reached a different conclusion: that the Tesla S is not on a par with several of its luxury rivals.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a group known for its strict testing, announced that the Tesla S did not receive either of its safety awards. That was, in part, because in one of five crash tests the dummy's head hit the steering wheel.\n\nTo be a 2017 Top Safety Pick, a vehicle must have good ratings in five crash tests and have an advanced or a superior rating for frontal crash prevention, which includes automatic emergency braking if a collision is imminent. To receive the higher 2017 Top Safety Pick+ designation, a vehicle must meet all those criteria and get an acceptable or good headlight rating, which was added for 2017.
While China has landed spacecraft on the moon three times in the last seven years, NASA has not landed there since 1972, the last Apollo mission. That could change in 2021, deepening the commercial transformation of American space efforts.\n\nNASA has in the past decade relied on private companies to build and operate spacecraft that could ferry cargo, and now people, to the International Space Station. It is trying a similar approach with Commercial Lunar Payload Services. The program has contracted with a number of private companies to build robotic lunar landers that will carry cargo from NASA and other customers to the moon's surface.\n\nThe first company, Pittsburgh's Astrobotic, is scheduled to launch its Peregrine lander to the moon in June. It could be followed in October by Nova-C, a spacecraft built by Intuitive Machines of Houston.\n\nNASA also has its eye on returning astronauts to the moon this decade. Its first step will be an uncrewed test flight of the massive Space Launch System built for future American deep space launches. The rocket has faced numerous delays and ballooning costs, but NASA still plans a journey in 2021 known as Artemis-1. It will send Orion, a capsule for astronauts, around the moon and back to Earth. That test is tentatively scheduled for November.\n\nDeeper into deep space
BRUSSELS — The Trump administration downgraded the diplomatic status of the European Union's delegation to the United States last year without making a formal announcement or informing the bloc about the change, a European official said on Tuesday.\n\nAfter protest from Brussels and discussion between the European Union and the Trump administration, the reclassification of the delegation and the consequent demotion of the ambassador, David O'Sullivan, is understood to have been reversed, at least temporarily, the official said.\n\nMr. Trump has been critical of multilateral institutions, and his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, delivered a provocative speech in Brussels on Dec. 4 in which he questioned the value of multinational organizations and institutions like the United Nations and the European Union. Mr. Pompeo then asked whether the European Union was ensuring that the interests of countries and their citizens are placed before those of bureaucrats here in Brussels.\n\nThe next day, the European Union's demotion from a member state to an international organization became clear at the funeral of President George Bush, when Mr. O'Sullivan's name was not called in the expected order, dictated by diplomatic protocols. The names of diplomats who had gathered in Washington to pay their respects were spoken, as is custom, from the longest-serving to the newest ambassador, a European Union official told the German news agency Deutsche Welle. But he was called up as the last person.

Rent-controlled tenants say they are just as aggrieved and also deserve relief. State Assemblywoman Linda B. Rosenthal, a Democrat who represents the Upper West Side and parts of the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood in Manhattan, said the increases did not reflect current economic realities. She has proposed a bill to change the way the state calculates rent increases.\n\nEach and every day, my staff and I sit with seniors — 70-, 80-, 90-year-olds — who cannot afford to pay their rent, she told state officials at the Dec. 17 hearing. Any increase is an unwarranted one.\n\nThe median rent for tenants in rent-controlled units is $900 a month, census data for 2014 showed, and that of rent-stabilized tenants was $1,200 per month. But the median household income for rent-stabilized tenants was $40,600, while that of rent-controlled tenants was $29,000.\n\nBoth sets of tenants paid slightly more than 30 percent of their income in rent.\n\nOwners of rent-controlled units need to apply for the increases, and state officials say less than half of them do. Owners say the paperwork is too laborious in cases in which the increase may translate into just a few dollars more a month or the building has only one rent-controlled unit. But the buildings must also be free of major housing code violations, such as those relating to basic services like heat and water, to be eligible for the rent increase.\n\nOwners also said that oil costs were down and that that would help offset some of the rent increase. That is because tenants in rent-controlled units pay a fuel charge and the savings are being passed along.\n\nBut many of the tenants said that any increase would be a hardship.\n\nSome tenants, like Regina Karp, 76, a retired public school teacher, said she had tried having roommates to help her pay the rent on the Upper West Side apartment where she has lived for 46 years, but I've found it difficult to give up my privacy.\n\nI don't know if I can stay in my apartment, she told state officials at the hearing. I don't want to leave New York City and live with my children. I want to remain independent.
Proponents of the plan, also known as time-restricted eating, say that intermittent fasting could help me lose weight, always a worthwhile goal. It would also give my gut a much-needed break from processing food, improve focus and lessen daily inflammation. In the long-term, it might even help me live longer.

Whether it can do the same in people has been an open question. But an intriguing new study suggests that in young and middle-aged adults, chronically restricting calorie intake can have an impact on their health. Read more>>>
[MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) When you walk in the room, do you have sway? [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nkara swisher\n\nHave you ever watched The Mindy Project, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, or The Good Place? Behind all those shows and many more was Bela Bajaria. That was back in her studio days. Now she's head of global television at Netflix. She's running all TV everywhere for the streaming giant. She's fed us shows through the pandemic like Indian Matchmaking, Money Heist, and Unorthodox. And she's probably going to be behind whatever we'll binge next. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, Bela. Good to see you. Welcome.\n\nbela bajaria\n\nHi, Kara. Nice to see you.\n\nkara swisher\n\nWhen I mention your name — I was talking to a lot of people. I said, oh, I'm doing the person who's really in charge of all the programming you like on Netflix. And they always go, oh, Reed Hastings or Ted Sarandos. And you're the person people in Hollywood certainly know but not a lot of other people know is responsible for a lot of what they're watching. You were born in London. You lived in Zambia. Can you talk a little bit about that as how you rose and how TV impacted you in growing up?\n\nbela bajaria\n\nMm-hmm. So I was born in London. My family's Indian, but my family — my parents were both born and raised in East Africa. So we have a Africa, India, London sort of connection. Very typical immigrant route for that trajectory of following business and opportunity. And we moved to the U.S. We moved to California when I was nine. It was a hard time because I moved to Los Angeles. I was a brown girl with a British accent, and there were just no Indian people around, and being used to being in Africa and London where there was a large Indian community and it wasn't — didn't feel weird to be Indian or as weird. And when I moved to Los Angeles, it was a culture shock in many ways. And so I figured one thing had to go, and the brown wasn't going anywhere. So the British accent as a nine-year-old girl had to go. And I ended up after school every day watching a lot of television. And I watched the television to learn the American accent and learn American culture. And that really was, I think — now that I look back, I mean, it was very — I really sort of disappeared into television a lot, of just learning so much about America.\n\nkara swisher\n\nWhat were the television shows? I think you said I Dream of Jeannie was one of them. I watched that, too.\n\nbela bajaria\n\nYeah. I did. I watched. When I look back at that time, I watched I Dream of Jeannie, I watched Gomer Pyle, which I remember, and Bewitched. But the accent at nine years old, which is extraordinary, in three months, I had no trace of a British accent.\n\nkara swisher\n\nThrough golly? I mean, Gomer. Remember, Golly?\n\nbela bajaria\n\nYeah. Yes. So I just didn't have — I just lost every trace of it. And that really is where I learned about culture and the accent. And now sadly, many years later, I can't even fake a British accent. So clearly —\n\nkara swisher\n\nDon't do that. It's called pulling a Madonna, and it never ends well.\n\nbela bajaria\n\nYes. It's deeply buried in there.\n\nkara swisher\n\nSo what attracted you to this, the television business? Because you're Indian-American kid with no connections in Hollywood, right? Your family owned a car wash. Is that correct?\n\nbela bajaria\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nkara swisher\n\nAnd you worked there. You were cashier. You did all kinds of unusual jobs.\n\nbela bajaria\n\nI really admire writers and just in every form. It's just such an amazing craft that I definitely have no skill in, and but I really admire it. And I loved this idea of this impact of storytelling, which might go all the way back to the roots of me watching TV in that way, that connected so many people. And everybody watches it at the same time or different times, but the story has an impact on many people. And I was always fascinated by that. And so for me, I wanted to be in the entertainment industry because I loved — I appreciated writing, and I appreciated the craft of many of those things. But I wanted to be a part of telling a story on a large scale. And it never occurred to me, because I was an Indian woman 23, 24 years ago when I got in the business, that I couldn't do it. I just —\n\nkara swisher\n\nBecause none. There's nobody there that you could look up to.\n\nbela bajaria\n\nI mean, nobody's there.\n\nkara swisher\n\nRight. Talk about breaking in. How did you break in? So here you are with nobody to look up to, with a media that's very much not your experience whatsoever.\n\nbela bajaria\n\nI wrote letters for a general meeting to — back then it was the Hollywood Creative Directory, which was like literally the phone book for Hollywood.\n\nkara swisher\n\nBut you wrote hundreds of — trying to get a job, correct?\n\nbela bajaria\n\nHundreds. I just started at A and just wrote letters because I knew just the general meeting, at least getting in the door and learning, because the truth is, at that time, I wanted to be in entertainment. And I think I wanted to be — I probably was like, I want to make films. I had no idea the difference between any of those things.\n\nkara swisher\n\nBut you had not made any. You had not made any. You just wanted to get in.\n\nbela bajaria\n\nNo. I just wanted to get in. And at that point, I applied to every TV and film company, production company's network, and to everybody. And I got two calls for generals. One was Columbia TriStar pictures, and one was CBS Network. And I ended up getting my first job as an assistant in that group.\n\nkara swisher\n\nAnd that meant what? In Hollywood, the assistant is sort of — it is the path forward. A lot of well-known people were assistants. I delivered mail at The Washington Post for people that later worked for me, which was interesting. Only lesson is really talented people are not jerks, and untalented people are jerks. But go ahead. So you were an assistant. What did you do?\n\nbela bajaria\n\nSo I had my first assistant job there. It was TV movies and miniseries. Back then the volume was so — we made so many of them. And at that point when I started, it was Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday movies and miniseries. And I had no idea what the learning — I just didn't know anything when I started. And I answered phone calls and scheduled meetings. And I did all of the administrative stuff that an assistant does. But what I did was I knew enough to know that I was sitting on that desk, and I had access to all of this information. The scripts come in to me first, the notes. You're scheduling the meetings. So the learning was all there.\n\nkara swisher\n\nSo you read. You just started reading.\n\nbela bajaria\n\nI read everything. I read every script that came in. I read every revision that came in. I then went to every single other executive in the department, not just my boss, and read all of their development. And then so people would always reference movies. They would reference old miniseries or old movies which I was not as familiar with. And then I went to the — back then it was the videotape library in the basement. And I went to the videotape library. And I asked for some key miniseries that people would always refer to, and I just studied. And I promised myself, for a year and a half, I would be a sponge. I would just read and watch everything, so I understood the business. I did realize during that time, though, my point of view, or my background, or the way I looked at material was different. I just had a different upbringing. And so I realized that was an asset. And I didn't want to assimilate or hide it. I just owned the Indian part, the background part. When I looked at material, it was different. And I was vocal about that in notes. My great — Nancy Tellem was also at the company, who is an amazing just mentor of mine and such a champion and taught me so much. And she really took the shot. And I ended up when I was an executive, my first executive job at CBS, I had championed Joan of Arc, which was a big miniseries. So I had worked on some big titles that then led me to getting the job to run the department.\n\nkara swisher\n\nSo you went over to NBC to run Universal Television.\n\nbela bajaria\n\nYes.\n\nkara swisher\n\nAnd you were also very aggressive there in creating whole bunches of shows there, including The Mindy Project.\n\nbela bajaria\n\nMm-hmm. So I went to Universal in 2011 to — and at that point, it was really to rebuild the studio because it had been collapsed into the network. And so the idea was to rebuild the studio, which I was really passionate about being at the studio because you really get to make shows. You're closer to making shows. But you also get to sell and strategically hopefully put shows in the right place or a place where you really think they could thrive.\n\nkara swisher\n\nSo you can sell them to others. For people don't know, you can sell them to others or make them for the network.\n\nbela bajaria\n\nYeah, so you can make them for NBC, the sister network, or you can sell them outside to streaming cable or other broadcast places, which I was very interested in supporting the vision of a writer and placing the show in a place where I thought it could thrive and where they would have the best creative experience.\n\nkara swisher\n\nRight. And then in doing this, and you had a number of hits including The Good Place for NBC. You did make sure. And that turned out to be a hit. And so you left NBC because you weren't making enough shows for them? Is that — for the regular person, how does that work?\n\nbela bajaria\n\nSo there has historically sometimes been tension between studios and networks and what we talked about, the supplying for your sister network, and then also how many shows you have outside and how many shows you take outside. So there is tension. Even though I had Brooklyn Nine-Nine which was also on Fox, I had many hit shows and launched Chicago Fire and the entire Chicago franchise to date, which still continues, it just — I got fired at NBC. And it — seemingly doing a good job during it.\n\nkara swisher\n\nYeah.\n\nbela bajaria\n\nBut it was such an interesting time. So May 2016, it was the best personal and professional lesson that I had ever gone through.\n\nkara swisher\n\nExplain that for people.\n\nbela bajaria\n\nSo there's the initial just personal rejection, failure. There's the — which people forget — going home and telling your three kids you got fired of a place that you're super passionate about and helped build that culture and that team and how they actually even feel connected to that place. And that was a really hard thing to do. Also, to try to explain like, oh, in our — you get fired, even if it's not that I'm a failure. And I'm still good at my job. And it's a very complicated thing but amazing learning because I also realized with my three kids, I was also going to show them that you get knocked down, and you get back up. And you go do some cool thing. And you grow and you learn from these things. And so I felt a responsibility to also handle it as — be honest about it but handle it gracefully and hopefully strategically and smart for my career. And it's also great because it really helps unwrap your identity, what you think your purpose is. It was very difficult the first month. It was a very difficult thing. Luckily, I had a trip to Tanzania, a safari, a month later already planned. And it was just amazing to be there and do perspective and big picture in life. And it was just an amazing learning experience. It was so difficult when it happened and painful, but it was incredible learning.\n\nkara swisher\n\nSo what you did, though, is you started working at Netflix. And they brought you in to do licensing and unscripted television, which is reality TV, and then local language production. So how did you — this was not something you were involved in at all. You had been creating your basic regular shows that are stock and trade for networks.\n\nbela bajaria\n\nSo I had known Netflix and worked with them because I had sold Kimmy Schmidt to Netflix, and I made Master of None for them also. So I had the relationship. They knew me. We had a great relationship making multiple seasons of those shows. So then during the 2016 summer of just exploration and what do I want to do next, and — but I really wanted to learn something different. I had made lots of television. I'd been on the studio side. I'd been on the network side. I had been at cable studio at CBS. And I really had felt like I'd always wanted to run a studio. I had done it. And it was liberating and terrifying because I didn't know what was next. But I wanted to learn a different part of the business. And I met with Ted.\n\nkara swisher\n\nThis is Ted Sarandos who's now the co-C.E.O. Yeah.\n\nbela bajaria\n\nTed Sarandos. And he asked me to start the unscripted group. And I said, you know that I've never done unscripted, right? And he said, oh, and I want you to do licensing. And I said, you know I've never done licensing, right? And he said, and I want you to do co-licensing and co-productions. And I just said, OK, all of these things you're offering me I have never done. And he said, yes. I just hire smart people. And for me, it was one of those, oh, this is interesting. I'm going to learn streaming, because I really wanted to actually be on the inside. I'd worked — I'd sold shows, but I was not on the inside at a streaming company. I wanted to really learn streaming. So I just took the leap.\n\nkara swisher\n\nBut one of the things you did was unscripted television local language productions and, again, basically non-English shows. You also had your — probably one of your first more deep experiences with data, and so the idea of Netflix decides what we're all going to watch. Was that something you thought about it? Would the whole world watch, say, Indian Matchmaking, another show you're responsible for, if it wasn't served to us at the top of the app? Could you contrast algorithms and creativity because you had come from the creative background here at a company where algorithms are very important?\n\nbela bajaria\n\nSo when I came into the company, so it was interesting. So unscripted, we had to launch the unscripted group. We know there's tons of audience all over the world for many different kinds of unscripted shows. We hadn't had unscripted shows. So there was no data. There was no algorithm. There was no data to say this kind of show will work. But we just knew from, if you look at the audience and where interests are, that we were just going to take bets. And those are all gut, and intuition, and working with very experienced unscripted people in making shows. I'd say I think when I came in, it was interesting to see the amount of data and just the sophistication of it. And globally who was watching how many things in each country was interesting. But commissioning television shows, unscripted or scripted, is all about gut and intuition. It has to be a human — it's a human call because a writer walks in. They pitch a show. And it has to be whether you think you believe in the vision of the show, because there's not any data or algorithm that would have ever suggested or proven out that a limited series about a female chess prodigy would ever be —\n\nkara swisher\n\nThis is Queen's Gambit.\n\nbela bajaria\n\nYes, Queen's Gambit — that would ever capture the hearts, minds, and viewing hours as it did. So it's a good tool when we license. It's a good tool to have data, algorithm for personalization on the shows you see. Great. Commissioning television shows has to be about human judgment.\n\nkara swisher\n\nAll right, talk about Queen's Gambit since you brought it up. So that was, from what I understand, a movie. Scott Frank thought it was going to be a movie. And then the decision was to cut it up into a limited series, essentially. Why did that strike you since you were responsible? What was it about that?\n\nbela bajaria\n\nIt was a great book. And there were themes in there. People root for underdogs. People do like and are fascinated by genius, the idea of watching somebody genius at something. So there were themes in there that seemed like, OK, those could really resonate, that — because in a way, you would probably think, which would make sense, initially that chess would be narrow or limiting in some way as far as an audience. But her journey — and it was based on the books, so the material was there, and the book is a great book— really made sense to champion that. But even in that, on every kind of data, that's just not an obvious thing — this should be a big hit. And it just captured people. And she's extraordinary in it. And Scott Frank did such a beautiful job.\n\nkara swisher\n\nSo Unorthodox, eight Emmy nominations with one win for directing for Maria Schrader. Why that?\n\nbela bajaria\n\nSo I think what's amazing about Unorthodox, German original. That's where it was. It was from the local language original team. And I think what you see with Unorthodox, what you see with Barbarians recently from Germany, what you see with La Casa de Papel from Spain —\n\nkara swisher\n\nWhich is called Money Heist here, right?\n\nbela bajaria\n\n— Money Heist here — as authentic and specific that a story is to a vision, to a country, to a language, those shows really resonate. And I think people think we're a global platform. You make it global. We don't make it global. We make it so authentic, so specific, and so unique to that voice. And those kinds of shows resonate because they're great. And the many themes are universal about those things. And Unorthodox was interesting because it was a German original. But as the writer wrote it, the really organic way is Yiddish and some English. And that was just the authentic way to tell that story. And —\n\nkara swisher\n\nYeah. There's German in it.\n\nbela bajaria\n\nYeah. And we just supported the creator and let it be the true vision of the story in the way that it would have folded out. So it was incredibly rewarding to see how it was discovered on Netflix, that it really went worldwide and then got an Emmy.\n\nkara swisher\n\nSo when you're talking about the idea of worldwide, these local language originals like Barbarians from Germany, it's the top non-English show in the US for 2020. Money Heist, it's season four from Spain. Through its first 28 days, 65 million households chose to watch the show. Dark Desire from Mexico, July 2020, 35 million households in the first 28 days. When you're thinking about this idea, because Netflix used to break up content by markets, why is it significant that you're overseeing everything in Netflix global slate?\n\nbela bajaria\n\nSo I think for consumers, big picture, to really look at holistic programming slate is really great and making trade offs and making sure we're programming a wide breadth of tastes and types of shows, because we subtitle in 37 languages. We dub in 34 languages. So there's access to this. And so I think to be able to tell stories from all different kinds of countries in all different languages and export it to the world. So traditionally, Hollywood, the U.S. lands in Hollywood exported content around the world.\n\nkara swisher\n\nExported.\n\nbela bajaria\n\nExported. And that was how people watched. Now on our platform, we're exporting content, storytelling all over the world. And I think people talk about representation a lot, and more so, I think, this year finally. But people talk about representation a lot. It's so personally rewarding, but just, I think, for consumers amazing that we're telling these stories from all over the world. And I don't think people — I'm not sure everybody realizes the amount — the power of that storytelling from all over the world and the amount of the big — like there's a big audience that watches so many shows not in English.\n\nkara swisher\n\nSo through these local lens, this idea of local lens.\n\nbela bajaria\n\nLocal storytellers in front of, behind the camera, in their language that gets exported day and day around the world that day. And it's a global launch. So the reach of that. So during this year, during Covid, global pandemic year, the increase of non-English viewing was up 50%. The increase of K-dramas tripled, from Korean dramas, K-dramas. And anime had 100% increase. So it's just interesting to see the discovery of different types of shows told —\n\nkara swisher\n\nIn different ways.\n\nbela bajaria\n\n— many different ways.\n\nkara swisher\n\nIt also could be a response to the fact that Netflix has 73 million subscribers in the U.S. — very impressive — and Canada. A lot of people feel like it's approaching saturation. Also, half the revenue is now coming from abroad. Would you say the U.S. is its market now? When you're talking about this import export, the idea it was Hollywood exported, and except for perhaps the Indian market which has a very vibrant internal market there, has that changed utterly? Do you feel like that's the way it's going to go now?\n\nbela bajaria\n\nThere's room to grow in the U.S. There's still room to grow there. I do think there is a lot of room to grow outside of the U.S. still. And in Latin America, we started making originals five years ago. And this year, we launched our Africa slate. India was a few — like three years ago. So there's still more room to grow in many of these other countries. And I think big picture, U.S. is 5% of the world's population. We have over 190 million members. So there's definitely room to grow outside of the U.S. But I do think there's still room to grow here. And Hollywood has been the dream factory. Amazing writers, great shows come out of here. So that's not going away. But I do think when you think about something like Indian Matchmaker — Indian Matchmaker, which I'm not sure people realize is that I greenlight that show because to me, it was just a show in the U.S. I didn't greenlight it for the India team. It really was, oh, interesting matchmaker, a way to explore marriage, dating, relationships. So that was something that I just bet on. Isn't this just fascinating? It's subculture. It's a culture I know well clearly. But I think there were interesting things in there that people would be fascinated by. But again, I don't look any of it to purposefully feel like, oh, are we making a global show? It's just, are we making the best vision of that show? And if that vision is true and it's great, it'll connect. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Sway.\n\nkara swisher\n\nWe'll be back in a minute.

And you'll get new ones delivered directly to you. More with Bela Bajaria after this break. [MUSIC PLAYING] Netflix made headlines the past year by signing splashy contracts with Shonda Rhimes, Ryan Murphy, paying them hundreds of millions of dollars for the privilege of featuring their shows. It's sort of changing the economics of these relationships which relied heavily on back end deals. So reviews have been mixed for some of the big creators. I know you have Bridgerton coming, which looks fantastic, by Shonda Rhimes.\n\nbela bajaria\n\nSo exciting. It's so — it delivers on what you hope and imagine it would be.\n\nkara swisher\n\nIt looks very juicy. It looks very Shonda Rhimes, is all I'll say. How are these going versus, say, people that aren't as well known? Because a lot of your shows are people that aren't well known?\n\nbela bajaria\n\nSo overall deals have been around for a long time. This is not new to Netflix. They've been part of the business. I ran a studio with many overall deals. And so I'm very familiar with the deals and the relationship and what that is. I think overall deals are also — have always historically been a long-term investment. It's not a short-term thing. You usually start a relationship and build this and really look at the slate long term strategically. And it's also a very small percentage of our content budget. It gets outsized attention about the overall deals. So I think it's still early days with some of these deals. And I think we always have a mix of big, very experienced creators. Many times we have shows with other new voices that sometimes are supervised by other people. And we just have a mix of shows because we want a wide variety of shows.\n\nkara swisher\n\nDo you see yourself doing big deals around the world with big names creators, or is it like creative retreads like Cobra Kai? I love Cobra Kai. It's the best thing ever. And it looks like you spent $12 on set design and everything else.\n\nbela bajaria\n\nCobra Kai is so fun!\n\nkara swisher\n\nIt is. Yes, it is.\n\nbela bajaria\n\nSo yes, I think it's just a wide variety of shows. The slates are very diverse in all of these countries. In Spain, we have a relationship with Álex Pina who did La Casa de Papel — Money Heist. And we have a deal with him there. But it really is just a wide range of shows. We did How to Sell Drugs Online in Germany with writers who had never done a scripted show before. And that became a big hit. So it's a wide range of very known filmmakers in many countries where there's a very robust film community. It's been filmmakers turning to episodic television for the first time in certain places. We have over 190 million members in 190 countries. It has to be a wide range of types of shows, and documentaries, and unscripted, and lots of other things.\n\nkara swisher\n\nBut you are heading into streaming wars. I think there's — it's very clear. There's Disney, there's HBO Max, whatever Apple is going to do, whatever they're all going to do, Amazon. What is your best pitch to creators in other places right now in this new environment?\n\nbela bajaria\n\nCompetition has been around for a long time and Blockbuster and Hotstar. And there's been Sky. There's been a lot of competition. And there's also room for many people to grow at the same time. While we've grown, HBO has grown, and Amazon has grown. And other people are going to grow because it's not zero-sum. The thing is, though, I feel like it's smart to know what your competitors are doing but not spend so much time on it, because I think it's hard to move forward if you're always looking over your shoulder.\n\nkara swisher\n\nYeah, but what's your biggest worry as they enter the market? Because eventually, they're going to get the technology right. They're not going to be as good as you are, but they'll get it right on some level. And then it's just down to what you had, because I subscribe to all the services, every one of them. And I subscribe for the shows, really, not the networks. I don't think of — although Netflix tends to have more shows I like at this moment, it doesn't mean they will. And I know my kids are often on Disney+ because they like all those Marvel movies. What's your biggest worry as they enter the market? Is it their I.P.? Because Warner makes movies. Disney makes movies. That's their main business. They're not selling toilet paper like Jeff Bezos.\n\nbela bajaria\n\nSo the advantage that Disney definitely has, and even Warner Brothers, they've been at this for a long time — 100 years. They've been at it for a long time. They have I.P. They have catalog. They have those franchises. And for us, we've been in it for seven years and making original content. So now we have Stranger Things. And we have The Witcher. And we're growing our own, hopefully, I.P., and franchises, and original content. And so we're going to continue to do that around the world. Money Heist, La Casa de Papel definitely franchise for the company and growing what that is. So I think for us, it's to continue to do that. And again, creators have great experience. And then you hope you get their repeat business. They come back to work with you again. And I think for all of us, it really — you have to win, just like you're saying about what you watch, the consumer every day. Next year, I hope we still have more shows that you like than somebody else has. And I do think ultimately competition is good for consumers because I do think it keeps all of us trying to make the best shows, pushing forward, taking risks on content still. So I do think net net, it's great to have competition.\n\nkara swisher\n\nAll right, I want to go through some — a couple of things really quickly. You may not want to answer any of these, but let me try. What do you think of Disney plus and minus — Disney+ plus and minus?\n\nbela bajaria\n\nI think they have great I.P.\n\nkara swisher\n\nGreat I.P. OK, Apple TV?\n\nbela bajaria\n\nI think they make amazing iPads. And I enjoy The Morning Show.\n\nkara swisher\n\nOK, and a pile of money they have. Amazon Prime?\n\nbela bajaria\n\nSome really good shows. Just content's not their core business.\n\nkara swisher\n\nOK, Hulu?\n\nbela bajaria\n\nGood catch up television and have done, I think, a good job and in television have grown at the same time as we have.\n\nkara swisher\n\nOK. And then HBO Max?\n\nbela bajaria\n\nInteresting HBO brand. Still will be interesting to see how it all shakes out.\n\nkara swisher\n\nWhy is that?\n\nbela bajaria\n\nI think they're still just trying to restructure and figure out how to reorient a company towards direct to consumer.\n\nkara swisher\n\nRight, and kind of a mess of a brand. Is there a show on another network you wish you had? Issa Rae, The Mandalorian, Succession, The Undoing?\n\nbela bajaria\n\nI like so many — so I'm a fan of TV. So I watch a lot, a lot of different TV.\n\nkara swisher\n\nIf you had to pick one and you get to have it, like it's Christmas. You get to —\n\nbela bajaria\n\nPick one. Oh, I love Succession. Oh, I love — Game of Thrones.\n\nkara swisher\n\nOK, smart. About getting new voices in Hollywood, Hollywood's been going through a big reckoning with its bad history with gender, and race, and so much other things. You're a woman, a person of color in a position of real power to make change in one of the biggest streaming companies. I've heard a lot of people say you talk about being an outsider a little bit. You often — you have said this here, telling people you're the only brown girl in the room. And people at first ignored you. And you see it as an asset. How do you see that shaking out?\n\nbela bajaria\n\nIt's a conversation that I think you have to be open to having. And there's many people on our content teams who are very passionate about more representation, about diverse stories, about different points of views. The one thing that I do talk about is sometimes people talk about these underrepresented groups. And it's this show to the side or this little show, but it'll be important to that group. I want to do big shows that have underrepresented voices and people. They can be big, and they can be commercial. And we want those shows to be seen, and talked about, and heard. So I think it's important. Netflix has done a great job in representation with Orange Is the New Black, and Never Have I Ever, and many other shows. And it is rewarding that we get to do it from all different countries and all different — with many representation from all over the world that everybody gets to see. And I do think that builds cultural affinity in many ways of seeing different people and seeing different stories. But I think it's something we just have to continue to do.\n\nkara swisher\n\nIt's been a perceived strength of Netflix, the diversity in its programming, reaching out to fresh voices, younger voices, different voices. This is something they can do. Is Hollywood too Hollywood-centric when you think about it? Because they do — they're kind of local. They're local in how they think, a lot of these studios, still.\n\nbela bajaria\n\nI think sometimes it depends on executives sitting in the seats. Who can greenlight a show? Who is going to champion and advocate for that show? Do you have enough executives? Are you giving shots, which — to enough creators that — oh, they haven't — it's always that chicken and egg. Oh, they don't have experience. Well, they can't get experience because you have to give them the shot to get the experience. In another company that I worked at, there was — we had bought an Indian sitcom, a family show, a family comedy that happened to be an Indian family. And somebody had said — a few people said to me, but we already have one. We already have one in development. And I said, so out of 100 things, we can't have two Indian? We already — so I think that, pushing back on that kind of thinking. And I think it depends on Hollywood executives sitting in those seats and taking a risk. You're going to have to give people a shot.\n\nkara swisher\n\nSo when you get that, when you have that, when here you are in a position of power, do you feel like you — I've had lots of women executives in tech. But they always say, I have to be the one to speak up. Do you feel that's too much burden on you? Do you use up your capital? Because there is capital in Hollywood. There is only so far if you don't get along. Or maybe that's changed.\n\nbela bajaria\n\nNo. Look, I think I'm lucky in the sense that my whole life, I pushed back against a lot of gender norms of being Indian. And you should behave like this. And this is what should happen. And so I feel like I have been pushing back on, where are those boundaries? And where can I push through? And it's something which can be annoying to or used to be annoying to my family. But there is a lot of these questions and pushing back and saying it, so — because I don't think people are resistant to it. They're just more embarrassed. I had a script. There was a script that was given to me at some point in another company. And I said, you don't have any diverse characters in here. So they said, look, the security guard, the DJ, and the housekeeper. And I just said —\n\nkara swisher\n\nWhat?\n\nbela bajaria\n\n— wow! When you say that out loud — and I said, oh, that's the way you see the world. I thought that that C.E.O. was a brown woman. Or I thought that went — oh, I just see this group differently than they do. And they were more embarrassed because they didn't even see it. And so I think it's a responsibility. And by the way, and I feel like I have really pushed myself at every level. So now people go, oh, you're in this job. So you can do it. But it's not just this job. It had to be the job before, and the job before, and the job before that to be able to bring it up at every level.\n\nkara swisher\n\nWhen you say, OK, there's only — we can't have two Indian shows — I've heard that on boards. We can't have two women on boards. We've got one, kind of thing. When you think about that, can we have more than one top Indian woman executive? Do you feel that pressure, because it's still, when you look across the broad landscape of Hollywood, it's mighty white, and it's mighty male?\n\nbela bajaria\n\nAnd it's interesting in your own personal career. You have this interest, this ambition, this drive, all of these things. And what you don't realize is many other people have been watching you along the way. And I didn't realize it until much later when Indian kids would reach out to me, or somebody said, I did it because you did it. And you don't realize that because that's not what I set out to do in any way. But I'll steal a Kamala Harris line of, I may be the first, but I'm definitely not going to be the last. And so there are going to be other Asian-American women, and Black women, and Hispanic women in these roles for sure. But we have to mentor, and we have to develop, and we have to help that. It doesn't just happen.\n\nkara swisher\n\nThank you so much. I really appreciate it. This was really great. And good luck. And you're doing — the shows are — they are really great. And the Cobra Kai, I just —\n\nbela bajaria\n\nGood!\n\nkara swisher\n\nSo brilliant. I love the cheap sets even, like the fact that they have one box of cereal or one glass.\n\nbela bajaria\n\nIt has to feel a little throwback.\n\nkara swisher\n\nOh man, Ralph Macchio, I want to interview him for the third season.\n\nbela bajaria\n\nSee, I love it. See, we — everybody would think because of your very intellectual, amazing background that you would only like Queen's —\n\nkara swisher\n\nAre you kidding?\n\nbela bajaria\n\nYou would only like Queen's Gambit. But you like Queen's Gambit and Cobra Kai.\n\nkara swisher\n\nAnd The Crown. I have a very —\n\nbela bajaria\n\nOh my God. Have you watched this season?\n\nkara swisher\n\nOf course, I watched the first.\n\nbela bajaria\n\n[GASPS]\n\nkara swisher\n\nAnd then I went —\n\nbela bajaria\n\nIt's —\n\nkara swisher\n\nNow I'm back to season three.\n\nbela bajaria\n\n— so good.\n\nkara swisher\n\nIt is really good. The guy you got to play Prince Charles is so irritating on every level, and he's fantastic.\n\nbela bajaria\n\nIt's so good.\n\nkara swisher\n\nBut I still think Cobra Kai is my favorite because it's so funny. Anyway, all right. OK.\n\nbela bajaria\n\nOK, I appreciate you doing this.\n\nkara swisher\n\nOK, thanks.\n\nbela bajaria\n\nThank you. Of course. Take care. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nkara swisher
There is the constant, relentless, unremitting financial triage as our financial obligations slowly overwhelm our means of meeting them. The choices are especially painful when they involve responding to one child's needs over another's. We have to weigh expensively nurturing a child's gift against expensively responding to a child's challenge.\n\nIt's not just the money. To say that there is less use for a 62-year-old white male (unless you happen to be running for president) these days is not to devalue the social transformations that are rapidly occurring in the age of Trump. You can hail necessary social change and complain about being, to some degree, a casualty of it, both at the same time.\n\nIn this way, I view myself — and imagine others — caught in a double bind. My depression springs from my biology, my biography, my choices. But it occurs within a far broader context that could bring just about anyone down, and apparently does. The fact is that the country is not red and blue. It is almost entirely blue.\n\nThe real national division, as I see it, is between people who have the resources, inner and outer, to survive their mental illness and those who don't.\n\nAffording a therapist and finding the right therapist — it is rare: wisdom, empathy and kindness cannot be taught — they are the first obstacles to overcome. Then you might have to find the right and affordable psychiatrist, who will help you make an informed decision about whether to take psychiatric drugs that will or will not help, perhaps even saving your life.\n\nEven more people never receive an actual psychiatric diagnosis. A 2014 study found that 80 percent of all prescriptions for antidepressants were being issued by primary care physicians who had no psychological, psychiatric or psychopharmacological training at all.\n\nYet even as our mental health crisis proliferates, even as streams of books and articles are published about depression and anxiety, the subject of mental illness has become another voyeuristic exhibition in the carnival of commerce. We talk about it, but we don't talk about how to address it.
Adele was right to stop the show and insist on getting Take 2 for Fastlove, Pt. 1, the Grammys' tribute to George Michael. The Grammys have been a technical nightmare for Adele two years in a row: last year with a problematic piano and this year with an embarrassing false start. Perhaps only Adele commands the music-business clout to stop and restart a song on live TV — letting loose a profanity that didn't make it onto the air — but on Sunday she justified her perfectionism.\n\nHer revamp of Fastlove was already going to be fraught. It deliberately turned a dance-pop song into an elegy, finding the more somber spirit of Mr. Michael's later years in the song, and risking the wrath of those who (rightfully) love Mr. Michael for his grooves and flirtations.
The National Climate Assessment, America's premier contribution to climate knowledge, stands out for many reasons: Hundreds of scientists across the federal government and academia join forces to compile the best insights available on climate change. The results, released just twice a decade or so, shape years of government decisions.\n\nNow, as the clock runs down on President Trump's time in office, the climate assessment has gained a new distinction: It is one of the few major U.S. climate initiatives that his administration tried, yet largely failed, to undermine.\n\nHow the Trump White House attempted to put its mark on the report, and why those efforts stumbled, demonstrates the resilience of federal climate science despite the administration's haphazard efforts to impede it. This article is based on interviews with nearly a dozen current and former government officials and others familiar with the process.\n\nIn November, the administration removed the person responsible for the next edition of the report and replaced him with someone who has downplayed climate science, though at this point it seems to be too little, too late. But the efforts started back in 2018, when officials pushed out a top official and leaned on scientists to soften their conclusions — the scientists refused — and then later tried to bury the report, which didn't work either.
[baby fussing] Sorry, guys. That's all right. Honestly, don't worry. It's O.K. The whole process, you're led to believe, as a woman, that it's the most natural thing that can happen to you, sort of the purpose of your body. Except it felt incredibly unnatural and alien to me. I hated the bit at the beginning where you don't really look pregnant. You just look like you've let yourself go. You look like you've had too many Greggs or something. I liked that bit where I looked discernibly pregnant, and, like, my tits went really massive and I was a bit, like, that felt like quite sexy. I was like, Hey, yeah. I'm just carrying a child. It was really nice having nice hair. It was wavy and long. And there was more of it. And I had beautiful nails. That was really nice. The come down from that, not so nice. But I'd say, the middle of the pregnancy is a really great time, because you're still feeling really comfortable and you get all the benefits of the hormones kicking in. So that was awesome. The first time I was pregnant, I didn't get stretch marks until the last month. With him it was way more challenging on my body. I put on more weight. Funny enough, the stretch marks are not the thing that bothered me the most. It's the breasts. Because my boobs are huge, way bigger than it was with Bebe. And they fell a bit. It's life. You know, it's gravity. And in the beginning, I was really upset about it and I was telling my husband, you know, I'm going to get a boob job when I stop breastfeeding. The funny thing is is that it took so long to accept that this is my body and I should be happy and it's not good or bad, it's just me. And then you get pregnant. And then you slowly start seeing it change, which is fine, because you're growing a human being. But when you finally give birth and then you're left with this new body that you took — it took you 30 years to accept and to love and to figure out and figure out what works and doesn't work and all of a sudden, it's a completely different body. I think that's where my issues with giving birth came from. Not being able to wear your own clothes sounds trivial. But actually, just is another thing that really makes you not feel like yourself. And it's one of the things that makes your life legible to you. Feeling my boyfriend slightly recoil from me, like on a sexual level. Like he would probably object to that word, but feeling that shift of his perception of me as no longer a sexual being, he was like, I don't want to cover you in spunk, I want to look after you. I expected lots of negative things from pregnancy and from giving birth. And I was prepared that it's going to be hard and everything. But I wasn't expecting so much love. I really didn't even know that I'm capable of so much love, which dwarfs everything else in comparison. But I was never really too much in tune with myself as a woman to know how I looked down there or can't even define how I felt down there. But the minute I gave birth, I knew that everything changed. For me, it wasn't really bouncing back into my normal intimate life with my husband. That took long, long time and I think two bottles of wine. But I mean, I'm talking about like seven months I think. The last couple of weeks of being pregnant, I lost all sensation in my hands. So one after another, all 10 fingertips went numb. It's some syndrome where your wrists swell up so much that the nerves that go through your wrist stop sending the impulses through from your fingertips. I think it took probably more than two to three months for sensation to come back in my hands. If you can't feel what you're doing, it's a very weird thing to be taking care of a very little child. I never had a serious or real injury before in my life until C-section. So that was a big thing. I had no idea what's going to happen there or how it's going to look like after the surgery. I had a scar. I had stretch marks. I don't have flat belly at all. But all that physical changes comes together with the everyday work of being a mom. Even the tension you put on your muscles, you should hold her tight, because like you shouldn't drop her, and things like that. You know what I mean? Yeah. The C-section, I think it was hard on my body. And yeah, it made me dislike my body even more. You know, obviously, even things like now, you know, we're thinking of going on holiday and I'm like, I always liked wearing bikinis. I'm Brazilian. I grew up on the beach. Now I'm like: swimsuit. I don't want to show my belly. I don't want to show my scar. Although I don't think I should be ashamed of it, of course, but I do have to look at myself sometimes and admit, I don't like it. I don't love it. I love to send the message to people, yes, show it. Be proud of it. But I'm still working on it, let's say. You just keep looking at yourself and you're just, what is that? And it, actually, it affected me bonding with my baby, because you're meant to love and protect automatically, which I did, I protected my baby, but I just didn't like him for what he did to me. It took me like eight weeks to get into, Oh, O.K., you're my son. I love you. I had some tears and I was showering six times a day, because that was the only time I could pee without feeling pain. And half my digestive system was hanging out of my butt. It was really disgusting. How do I go to the bathroom, you know? How do I take a shit? These were the kind of things that I was apprehensive about. So I had, like a two for one deal. I had like a full labor, like 36 hours of that. And then, an emergency C-section. I definitely had no idea what level of pain you can be in without being dead. It would have been really nice to just be told, it's going to be almost as if you were going to die. Post-surgery recovery, that was a lot longer than I thought. And there were a lot more unexpected things that happened. Like the vaginal walls were really irritated, which nobody could really explain. I was forever bleeding, like every day for half a year. And nobody could tell me why or whether it was going to stop. Just before I got pregnant, I'd finished my master's. So I'd gone from this being very stimulated intellectually to those first stages of looking after an infant, which are boring. There's a lot of monotony. And you're very, very tired. And so it's a bit like, well, if no one fancies me, my brain's not involved in the same kind of activity it used to do, then who am I? I started working out six weeks after having a baby. And I did it because I wanted to go back to how I looked as quick as possible. It's such a weird balance of trying to diet, but at the same time, worrying about are you giving enough nutrients to your kid through your breast milk? Am I being selfish by compromising his food supply, because I'm trying to lose weight and look good, which is such a superficial thing to want? And what a selfish thing to want, you know? It felt really important to me that I wanted to breastfeed. And I think also I would have felt like, I had really failed Wolfie if I hadn't. But afterwards, my breasts, they were quite empty. They were quite haunted, basically. The skin never kind of went back. When Wolfie was a year old, I had a breast augmentation and breast lift. For me, it felt like it was just taking ownership back of my own body. No, yeah. Breasts are only for my daughter now, definitely. Like nobody else can touch them. It is. It is. It's different. Yeah. It's a different feeling. But it's generally after giving birth and being so preoccupied with keeping her alive and everything, that I put all that part of myself aside for a long, long time. Something that made me self-conscious about having sex in both pregnancies is milk, because I don't want anyone near my boobs while I'm breastfeeding. And it's really weird, because you have to change how you do things a bit, basically. It's not about a sex thing, but like it's about feeling of my boobs only belong to Luna kind of thing, which was so silly. But like, you only have that tolerance and patience just for your baby and nothing else. Sex used to be natural and fun and spontaneous and beautiful and you can't wait for it or sometimes you want it. Sometimes you don't. Now, it's like this psychological thing. And I never thought that would be the problem with having a baby. The amount of pressure and the amount of responsibility that's placed on our shoulder the moment we give birth and they give us this baby and they're like here you go, good luck. The anxiety. I was overwhelmed with anxiety constantly. And even when Wolfie was asleep, I couldn't sleep, because it was like having a tiny bomb that could go off at any moment. I mean, I can't look back at the aftermath of pregnancy and birth with anything other than, I feel traumatized by that really, still. Yeah. I plan to have another one as well. And all these changes doesn't have any effect on it, because apart from everything, each second I share with her is just amazing, just like heaven. Right. I mean, I oscillate wildly between thinking, I really want to have another baby and to I don't want to have any children. I don't want to have any family. I want to be on my own, just on my own on Tinder. I guess after having two children, I basically don't give a fuck to, like, anything else anymore. Do you know what I mean? I feel like, look, my body's not, yeah, it's not how I want it to be, but you know, who cares, basically?
2. This is not a bush fire. It's an atomic bomb.\n\nThat was the transport minister in New South Wales describing the fires ravaging Australia. Searing heat and afternoon winds propelled fires on Saturday, above in Tomerong, adding to the devastation of a deadly fire season that has now claimed 24 lives.\n\nThousands of people have been evacuated in what was most likely the largest peacetime maritime rescue operation in Australia's history, the authorities said. About 3,000 army reservists, along with aircraft and naval ships, are also being made available to help with the evacuation and firefighting efforts.\n\nMore than 12 million acres have burned so far. Here's where the fires are burning and a look at the country's air quality.
You follow advice and then find out years later that it was the wrong advice, Ms. Doggart posted on the Facebook page of kidswithfoodallergies.org.'Oh no. Wait. We were mistaken. It's actually the opposite thing you should be doing!'\n\nBut others reacted with sadness, wondering whether better information earlier on might have prevented their children's allergies. It is a bit disheartening and frustrating, Heather Eslinger, a physical therapist in Colorado Springs whose children have nut allergies, said in an interview. It is hard to accept that things may have been different had we known then what we know now.\n\nWhile national health officials have a track record of reversing medical advice from time to time — menopause hormones and trans fats are two examples — few topics are as fraught as food allergies. For starters, food allergies disproportionately affect children, and the risk of making the wrong decision about a food is immediate and potentially deadly. As a result, parents are particularly fearful about following the advice.\n\nI gave my 5-month-old a bit of my toast and peanut butter and we ended up in the emergency room, said Lori Dombek, 58, a web developer in Gorham, Me., whose son is now 22. Peanut allergies are nothing to fool with.\n\nBut scientists say the new guidelines are based on the latest science. A large clinical trial studied hundreds of British children at risk for peanut allergies, giving them either peanut-containing food regularly from infancy or withholding all foods with peanuts.\n\nBy the age of 5, the trial found, those who had been given peanut-containing food early in life had an 80 percent reduced risk of developing a peanut allergy.\n\nThe trial's results were very very unambiguous, said Dr. Matthew Greenhawt, chairman of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology's food allergy committee and one of the authors of the new guidelines. The fact that the guidelines changed over time makes them more credible, not less, he said.
Alain Servais, a Brussels-based collector who before the pandemic would typically attend around 15 major art fairs per year, said that the crisis provided an opportunity for smaller regional events.\n\nMr. Servais said that he planned to be in the Netherlands in early February for Art Rotterdam, a showcase mainly for Northern European galleries representing emerging artists that as of Tuesday was still scheduled to be an in-person event. But Arabella Coebergh, a spokeswoman for Art Rotterdam, said that an expected announcement by the Dutch government next week regarding pandemic restrictions could lead to the postponement of the fair until July.\n\nStill, said Mr. Servais, There is room for local fairs if they have a good focus — I'm not so worried about them. But he added: The big international fairs are most exposed this year. People will travel less, and these fairs count on international attendance for their success.\n\nThis shake-up of the international fair scene comes at a time when, in a contracting art market, many gallerists were already questioning the cost of exhibiting at such events.\n\nIn 2017, we were doing 12 art fairs, said Marianne Boesky, a New York-based gallerist. I felt I had to do these events. They'd gotten so expensive. When I looked at our revenues compared to overheads at art fairs, we barely broke even, and that didn't count the man hours.\n\nIn 2021, Ms. Boesky's program will be cut down to about six fairs in Europe, the United States and Asia, she said. But I'm not sure, she added. Every two weeks we seem to change our plans.
The School of Life is a London-based company devoted to developing emotional intelligence through the help of culture. Its best and worst qualities look a lot like the best and worst of its founder, the popularizing philosopher Alain de Botton. At best, witty, elegant and insightful. At worst, of the softheaded but seemingly sincere belief that a more manageable life is just a well-chosen Virginia Woolf quote away.\n\nThe institute offers classes and lectures at outposts around the world, but its most visible work to bookstore browsers is a series of small, stylishly designed how to guides. The books are a balancing act. Primarily written in a way so as not to insult the intelligence of literary self-help seekers, they also want to keep you from fearing that certain things in life might just permanently not be O.K. Concerned but cozy, they have titles like How to Stay Sane and How to Deal With Adversity.\n\nNow comes Eva Hoffman's How to Be Bored, in keeping with the brand. Woolf is in here, as are Kierkegaard, Rousseau and Sartre, among other distinguished life coaches. But it's also one of the more confounding entries in the series.\n\nThe book's title starts the trouble. Being bored is not something you do, it's something that happens to you, envelops you like unexpected weather. You can get out of it, but you can hardly get into it. The boredom part of the book's focus could be better labeled How to Make the Most of Down Time. But Ms. Hoffman touches so many bases — how we should approach culture, talk therapy, human contact, creative work — that she could have chosen from a thousand titles.
When Apple lost more than $75 billion in market value this past week after a surprise announcement that it is expecting lower iPhone sales than originally projected, the company put most of the blame for its troubles on China, where a slowing economy and the trade war with the United States have hurt sales.\n\nBut a bigger issue for Apple might exist much closer to home, in a small, leafy town in Ohio.\n\nThat's where my mom lives. She's a relatively tech-savvy retiree and a longtime Apple fan who has used many of the company's products over the years. I learned to type on an Apple IIGS at her office, and she was an early adopter of the original turquoise iMac. These days, she uses her iPhone to check Facebook and Instagram, talk with her friends and relatives, and play solitaire and Words With Friends.\n\nHer phone isn't the latest model — it's a three-year-old iPhone 6S — and it's missing some of the latest features. She can't take portrait mode photos using a dual-lens camera, a feature introduced in the iPhone 7 Plus, and she can't unlock her phone using Face ID, which was introduced in the iPhone X in 2017. Her phone's battery life could be better, and the device sometimes runs out of storage space.\n\nBut she's happy with it, and doesn't feel the need to upgrade. She also has a first-generation Apple Watch and a several-versions-ago MacBook Air, neither of which she's planning to replace anytime soon.
1. One more election day.\n\nGeorgia voters are choosing two senators in races that will decide which party controls the Senate — and how far President-elect Joe Biden can take his agenda. If both the Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff defeat the Republican incumbents Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, Democrats would control the chamber.\n\nPolls close at 7 p.m. Eastern. The results of Tuesday's race are expected to come much more quickly than the presidential tally, which included two recounts in Georgia. It's possible — but certainly not guaranteed — that we'll know who won on Tuesday night, or very early on Wednesday. Above, voting in Marietta.
T Introduces: The Nomad\n\nWhat is a hotel for? For most of history, it did only what it had to: provide a home when you were away from yours. Then, in the last century, a hotel became a place meant not just for shelter, but a destination; a place that embraced its not-homeness by being better than your home could ever be.\n\nNow, a new project is defining the hotel anew. In September, 700,000 Heures will become the world's first nomadic hotel. The idea is that a hotel is not an actual structure, but a state of mind, a series of experiences, a respite from your life. Every six months, 700,000 Heures (the approximate length of an average human life in the developed world) will change locations, occupying different buildings in different places — sometimes an existing building will be reimagined or refit for the hotel's needs; other times, it might even be built from scratch. First up will be a four-room, 19th-century stone palazzo in Gagliano del Capo, a small town in Salento, Italy, known for its wild beaches and groves of knotted olive trees. Then, after this trial run, the palazzo will be returned to its owner, and 700,000 Heures will move to northwestern Cambodia, where guests will stay in a series of locations, among them an ancient Buddhist temple. Most of the structures the company inhabits will be small — likely no more than eight rooms in any one location — and first priority will be given to its several hundred members, who'll pay an annual 500 euro fee and will be able to opt into destinations as they please. (Those wanting to join can apply through one of 700,000 Heures' 50 approved travel agents.) The company is the invention of a French hotelier named Thierry Teyssier, who over the years has operated small, exquisite hotels in Morocco, Portugal and Brazil. I want to be able to spend real time with my guests, he says. 700,000 Heures is personal. It's the hotel I would like to find, if I were the traveler.\n\nAlthough 700,000 Heures will be the first impermanent hotel, it finds its origins in a dining and hospitality culture that has become ever more attracted to the ephemeral, the rootless and the rare. The past decade or so has seen a proliferation of pop-up restaurants and shops — Teyssier made his own contribution to this trend in the form of a pop-up hotel in Paraty, in southern Brazil, which operated for six months in 2014 before shutting down. At the same time, there's been an embrace of what might be called subscription-based hospitality: In London, there's Carousel, a restaurant with a constantly rotating series of guest chefs and a set menu each night for which tickets must be purchased in advance, or the membership-based Soho House, which now has 18 locations worldwide. Teyssier's company speaks to a certain kind of traveler's desire for both novelty and consistency — the location might be different, but the mood must always feel familiar.\n\nOne of the ways 700,000 Heures plans to achieve this is through Teyssier's presence; indeed, he'll act less as hotelier and more as impresario, remaining on-site through each of the hotel's incarnations, and organizing excursions and events for all of the guests. In Salento, this might mean a fishing-boat ride through hidden coves along the Adriatic, or a sunset picnic at Santa Maria di Leuca, a little-known Roman sanctuary. In Cambodia, destinations will include Tonle Sap Lake, a biosphere reserve with a floating village of wooden houses, or the French colonial city of Battambang, where travelers can train with acrobats at the renowned Phare Circus. The goal, Teyssier says, is for the guest to feel like an actor in a theatrical production: the natural outgrowth of an age in which vacations are presented like biopics on social media. And, as for an actor, 700,000 Heures also provides props: Along with the physical spaces, Teyssier has created a series of leather trunks — each filled with objects to create a different mise-en-scène, from cocktail bar to art studio — that will appear at all of the hotels and will provide an aesthetic through line. The hotel will also present members with a mock passport, which will be stamped after each trip. Some people make sculpture, Teyssier says. I'm in the business of creating memories. — GISELA WILLIAMS
People under 21 are no longer able to buy semiautomatic assault rifles in Washington as of Jan 1. It is the first of several new state measures intended to reduce gun violence. The National Rifle Association has already filed suit.\n\nPreviously, state law barred the assault weapons' sale to those under 18. The new rules, approved by voters in a ballot initiative in November, come alongside dozens of moves by other states to strengthen gun control regulations in the absence of federal action.\n\nIt is a meaningful step in the right direction, said Christian Heyne, legislative director at the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, on Washington's initiative. Gun violence on the whole is such a complex problem. We need to have complex solutions, comprehensive solutions. This is a part of that conversation.\n\nIn addition to the age restrictions, Washington's new rules state that gun dealers must wait 10 days before delivering semiautomatic assault rifles they sell. That is designed, in part, to prevent impulsive action. The rules also require anyone buying a semiautomatic assault rifle to have completed a gun safety training in the last five years. The measure also imposes criminal penalties for unsafe gun storage, and requires more extensive background checks for purchases of the assault weapons.
MADRID — Four decades after Spain transitioned from Franco's dictatorship to democracy, the country's far right has found its voice again in the nationalist, anti-immigrant Vox party.\n\nThe group made its mark in December in regional elections in Andalusia, in southern Spain, where it won parliamentary seats for the first time.\n\nIn the greater political sphere in Spain, Vox remains a small player. But some analysts say its appeal could spread, making it an important wild card in European Union parliamentary elections in May, when more traditional parties will be trying to hold off nationalist parties on the Continent.
In Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei wept and offered prayers over the coffin of General Suleimani at his funeral in Tehran on Monday. The general's successor swore revenge, while chants of Death to America rang out from the crowds in the capital.\n\nThe latest: Leaders from several European nations were scrambling to put the abandoned 2015 nuclear deal back together while calling on Iran to refrain from violence.\n\nBehind the scenes: The general may have been working as a go-between in quiet efforts to reduce the tension between Iran and Saudi Arabia at the moment he was killed.\n\nBig picture: General Suleimani's killing has left a swirl of confusion among analysts, former policymakers and academics, our Interpreter columnist writes. None of them seem to be able to identify a long-term strategy in the Trump administration's actions.

He has also promised to restore Bears Ears National Monument, a marvel of sandstone, mountains and Native sacred sites in the Southwest that was gutted by Trump, who reduced the size of the protected area by 85 percent.
Transition Highlights: Georgia Official Blasts Trump for Repeating Falsehoods on Eve of Two Critical Senate Runoffs It was like Groundhog Day, a top election official said of once again having to debunk President Trump's baseless claims of election fraud. Georgia's two runoff races on Tuesday will determine who controls the Senate, and with it how easily President-elect Joe Biden's agenda is realized.\n\n'I wanted to scream.' Georgia election official voices his exhaustion with Trump's baseless fraud claims. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:17 - 0:00 transcript 'Everybody's Vote Did Count,' Top Georgia Election Official Says Gabriel Sterling, a top election official in Georgia, delivered a scathing refutation on Monday of President Trump's false claims of voter fraud. The secretary wants me to make clear that everybody's vote is going to count. Everybody's vote did count. I want to make that abundantly clear. If you care about, you know, the values and direction of the nation you want to see, it is your obligation to turn out and vote tomorrow — be you a Democrat or Republican. However right now, given the nature of the president's statements and several other people who have been aligned with him previously, have literally had a rally saying protest and don't vote, we are specifically asking you and telling you, please turn out and vote tomorrow. The president's legal team had the entire tape. They watched the entire tape, and from our point of view, intentionally misled the State Senate, voters and the people in the United States about this. It was intentional. It was obvious, and anybody watching this knows that — anyone watching it knows that. That's why we released the entire tape for people to watch. We've seen nothing in our investigations of any of these data claims that shows there are nearly enough ballots to change the outcome. And the secretary and I at this podium have said since Nov. 3, there is illegal voting in every single election in the history of mankind because there are human beings involved in the process. It's going to happen. It's a question of limiting it and putting as many safeguards as you can in place to make sure it doesn't happen. Gabriel Sterling, a top election official in Georgia, delivered a scathing refutation on Monday of President Trump's false claims of voter fraud. Credit Credit... Erik S Lesser/EPA, via Shutterstock Gabriel Sterling, a top election official in Georgia, delivered a scathing refutation on Monday of President Trump's false claims of voter fraud, running through a long list of already-debunked conspiracy theories and systematically debunking each one again. It was like Groundhog Day, he said with evident frustration, adding of the fraud claims, This is all easily, provably false, yet the president persists, and by doing so undermines Georgians' faith in the election system. Mr. Sterling implored Georgians to vote in Tuesday's Senate runoff elections and not to be deterred by disinformation. If you want your values reflected by your elected officials, I strongly beg and encourage you, go vote tomorrow, he said. Do not self suppress your own vote. Don't let anybody steal your vote that way. The office of Georgia's secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, scheduled the news conference with Mr. Sterling a day after the disclosure of an hourlong phone call in which President Trump repeated a litany of conspiracy theories and asked Mr. Raffensperger to find 11,780 votes to overturn the will of Georgia voters, who chose President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. [Read more about the voting in Georgia so far.] Among many other false claims, Mr. Trump and his lawyers have claimed that thousands of votes were cast in Georgia by people who were under 18, weren't registered to vote, registered late, or registered with a P.O. box instead of a residential address. The secretary of state's office investigated the claims, Mr. Sterling said, and did not find a single ballot cast by anyone in any of those categories. I've got such a long list, he said as he rattled off claims about ballot scanning devices being hacked (it's very hard to hack things without modems) and people replacing parts in Dominion voting machines (I don't even know what that means). He added that Mr. Raffensperger does not have a brother named Ron who works for a Chinese technology company, as one of the conspiracies retweeted by the president claims — nor, in fact, does he have a brother named Ron at all. I wanted to scream, he said of his reaction to the call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Raffensperger. Well, I did scream at the computer and I screamed in my car at the radio, him talking about this, because this has been thoroughly debunked. He demurred when asked if he considered Mr. Trump's behavior an attack on democracy, but said, I personally found it to be something that was not normal, out of place, and nobody I know who would be president would do something like that to a secretary of state.

Senator Kelly Loeffler of Georgia campaigns at Augusta Regional Airport in Augusta, Ga., on Monday. Credit... Michael Holahan/The Augusta Chronicle, via Associated Press A day before facing voters in a runoff Senate election, Senator Kelly Loeffler of Georgia announced plans to vote against the Electoral College certification process, joining a dozen Republican senators in voting to overturn electors for President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. The potentially career-defining vote has divided congressional Republicans ahead of a typically perfunctory session on Jan. 6 to confirm Mr. Biden as president and winner of the Electoral College. Ms. Loeffler, who has aligned herself with President Trump as she fights to maintain her seat in the Senate, made the announcement mere hours before the president was set to take the stage in Georgia to campaign on her behalf. She did not say which state's electors she would object to. It is the latest instance in which Ms. Loeffler has broken with Georgia Republicans, who have largely resisted Mr. Trump's unsubstantiated claims of fraud after Mr. Biden won the state in November. Tens of millions of Americans have real concerns about the way in which the November presidential election was conducted — and I share their concerns, Ms. Loeffler said in a statement issued Monday evening. David Perdue, whose term as senator ended on Jan. 3, is also facing a runoff on Tuesday. He said on Sunday that if re-elected, he would also support a challenge to the election result certification even though he would not be present for the vote. While both Georgia Senate races will take place on Tuesday, only Ms. Loeffler can participate in the joint congressional session on Wednesday to certify the Electoral College results. Mr. Perdue saw his term formally conclude on Sunday with the end of the 116th Congress, while Ms. Loeffler was appointed to finish the term of former Senator Johnny Isakson, which will not end until January 2023.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCampaigning in Georgia on eve of runoffs, Biden warns that politicians cannot 'seize power.' Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:26 - 0:00 transcript Biden Campaigns in Georgia on Eve of Senate Runoffs President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. campaigned in Atlanta on Monday on behalf of the two Democratic candidates, Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock, for Georgia's Senate runoff election on Tuesday. I've said it before, getting America vaccinated will be one of the most difficult operational challenges this nation has ever faced, but we've known it for the last months. This administration has gotten off to a God awful start. The president spends more time whining and complaining than doing something about the problem. I don't know why he still wants the job, he doesn't want to do the work. As our opposition friends are finding out, all power flows from the people, from the people. That's our history. That's our law. That's our tradition. That's our Constitution. That's our democracy. Politicians cannot assert, take or seize power. Power is given, granted by the American people alone. I know this campaign, this campaign has been exhausting. You put the hard work in over the last few years to get to this moment. It's been intense. It's been non-stop. But I'm asking you to give everything you've got one more day, one more day. And that one more day, this is not hyperbole, you can change America. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. campaigned in Atlanta on Monday on behalf of the two Democratic candidates, Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock, for Georgia's Senate runoff election on Tuesday. Credit Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times Sweeping into Atlanta late Monday afternoon, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. made no direct mention of President Trump's telephone call but did obliquely criticize the president's strongman tactics. Addressing a few hundred supporters splayed out on the hoods and roofs of their cars in a downtown parking lot near the former Turner Field, Mr. Biden said Mr. Trump was absorbing a harsh lesson in democracy. As our opposition friends are finding out, all power flows from the people, said the president-elect, adding that politicians cannot seize power. Mr. Biden did, though, take more direct aim at what he described as Mr. Trump's god awful effort to distribute coronavirus vaccines. The president spends more time whining and complaining than doing something about the problem, he said to cheers and horn honks. I don't know why he still wants the job, he doesn't want to do the work. Mostly, though, Mr. Biden, clad in a black mask emblazoned with VOTE, encouraged the multi-racial audience of Georgians to do just that. It's not hyperbole, you can change America, he said, claiming that if Democrats control Congress, lawmakers will approve the $2,000 checks Senate Republicans blocked last month, even citing the two Republican runoff candidates — David Perdue, who finished his term on Jan. 3, and Senator Kelly Loeffler — by name to claim they'd oppose the checks. While some of the attendees at the Biden rally waved signs in support of the two Democratic candidates — the Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff — many indicated that they got involved in the runoff because they had been galvanized by Mr. Trump. We're supporting democracy because we've seen it dwindle these last four years, said Deshunn Wilkerson, a 36-year-old social worker, who wore a sweatshirt with the pink-and-green letters of the sorority she shares with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, Alpha Kappa Alpha.\n\nThe leader of the far-right Proud Boys was arrested in Washington. Enrique Tarrio, leader of the Proud Boys, led a contingent of the group in Washington last month. Credit... Victor J. Blue for The New York Times WASHINGTON — The leader of the Proud Boys, the far-right group that has vocally supported President Trump's efforts to overturn the election results, was arrested on Monday on charges of destruction of property after he arrived in Washington to protest the congressional certification of the election later this week, according to a person familiar with the matter. Enrique Tarrio, the chairman of the Proud Boys, was arrested by Metropolitan Police on suspicion of burning a Black Lives Matter banner torn from a historic Black church in Washington during protests last month that led to several violent clashes, including stabbings, around the city. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police Department confirmed that Mr. Tarrio, 36, had been arrested on charges of destruction of property, stemming from a mid-December incident in downtown Washington. Upon his arrest he was found to be in possession of two high-capacity firearm magazines and charged accordingly with possession. The arrest also pits the Justice Department against some of Mr. Trump's most ardent supporters; the U.S. attorney's office in Washington acts as the main prosecutor's office for the District of Columbia. A police spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A lawyer for Mr. Tarrio could not immediately be located, and Mr. Tarrio could not be reached. Mr. Trump exhorted his supporters to descend on Washington to express their dismay with the certification of the election for President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. On New Year's Day, he promoted what he described as the BIG Protest Rally in Washington. The Proud Boys were key players in protests and marches in mid-December that gave way to violent clashes between Mr. Trump's supporters, counterprotesters and law enforcement, as well as vandalism and destruction of property at churches in the city, including historic Black churches. The local police said at the time that it would investigate the church attacks as potential hate crimes. Mr. Tarrio then said on social media and in an interview with The Washington Post that he had burned the Black Lives Matter flag from the Asbury United Methodist Church, one of the oldest Black churches in Washington, and that he would plead guilty to destruction of property if he were faced with a criminal charge. Let me make this simple, he said. I did it. Washington is bracing for another round of protests on Wednesday, when the Senate convenes to certify the results of the Electoral College. Pro-Trump groups including the Proud Boys are expected to protest, and law enforcement officials are preparing for more violence. Mr. Tarrio had said on far-right message boards and the social media app Parler that the Proud Boys would turn out in record numbers on Jan 6th, but that they would fan out across the city incognito.\n\nTrump, fixated on his loss, heads to Georgia sending mixed messages. President Trump walking to the Oval Office last week. Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times President Trump is sending mixed messages ahead of Georgia's runoff elections on Tuesday, prioritizing personal grievance over the party's drive to win the state's two seats and imperiling Republican control of the Senate. The president is fixated on his loss in Georgia, an obsession that can be explained by two powerful and concurrent motivations — one psychological, one impelled by calculation and grounded in political reality, people close to him said. For starters, Mr. Trump simply cannot believe he lost a once-red Southern state — and cannot comprehend that his own unpopularity hastened a political realignment already taking place in the swing state. At the same time, he is very much in touch with the reality that he holds sway over party's right wing, and sees the runoff as a valuable moment of final political leverage as president. Over the past week, he has whipsawed from supporting the Senate candidates, albeit tepidly, to griping about the legality of the runoffs, far more passionately. The president, who will appear with the incumbent Republicans, Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, in Dalton, Ga. on Monday, wrote on Twitter late Friday that the runoff was illegal and invalid, but then urged his supporters a day later to get ready to vote on Tuesday. The trip comes a day after the stunning revelation that Mr. Trump asked Georgia's Republican Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, to find 11,000-plus votes in order to overturn the will of the state's electorate. On Monday, Mr. Trump signaled on Twitter that he planned to make his case at the campaign event, intended to kick-start sluggish Republican turnout. It was low in early voting, prompted by skepticism among his own die-hards about the validity of the November results. Mr. Trump muscled his way to power by bullying the Republican establishment — and the party's leaders now worry that he might drag them down with him. In Saturday's call, which was made public by Mr. Raffensperger's office, Mr. Trump vaguely threatened to the secretary of state that he would incite wrath — and discourage Republicans from voting — if he did not get his way. You're going to have people just not voting, said Mr. Trump, hinting at a dark outcome for politicians, like Mr. Rasffensperger, who opposed him. They don't want to vote, they hate the state. They hate the governor, and they hate the secretary of state. Mr. Raffensperger, in an interview on ABC's Good Morning America, said of the taped one-hour call that Mr. Trump did most of the talking. We did most of the listening, but I did want to make my points that the data that he has is just plain wrong, he added. It was inappropriate, Georgia's Republican lieutenant governor, Geoff Duncan, told CNN on Monday. It is a moment of profound angst for Mr. Perdue and Ms. Loeffler. They have tethered themselves to the president in hopes of survival, going so far as to call for the resignation of Mr. Raffensperger, a Trump supporter. Ms. Loeffler, speaking over the weekend, dodged questions about whether she would support the futile effort to object to President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s Electoral College victory in the Senate. But Mr. Perdue has said that he would have backed the effort if his Senate term had not expired on Sunday. In a blow to Mr. Trump, Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, declared on Monday that he would oppose that effort, prompting a tweet from the president warning of the consequences. Republicans have pluses & minuses, but one thing is sure, THEY NEVER FORGET! Mr. Trump wrote, singling out Mr. Cotton by name.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRepublicans splinter over effort to overturn Biden's victory ahead of consequential vote. Rep. Elise Stefanik thanks her supporters at her election night victory party at the Queensbury Hotel in Glens Falls, NY. Credit... Cindy Schultz for The New York Times Republicans staked out dueling positions on Monday about whether to join the sizable faction of their party that is seeking to overturn President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s election on Wednesday when Congress meets to certify it. The vote, which is potentially career-defining, has sowed deep divisions in their ranks. A group of conservative House Republicans argued that the move violated the Constitution, noting that state electors reflecting the will of voters — not Congress — decide elections. To take action otherwise — that is, to unconstitutionally insert Congress into the center of the presidential election process — would amount to stealing power from the people and the states, wrote the group, which included Representatives Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota, Ken Buck of Colorado, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Tom McClintock of California, Chip Roy of Texas and Nancy Mace of South Carolina. It would, in effect, replace the Electoral College with Congress, and in so doing strengthen the efforts of those on the left who are determined to eliminate it or render it irrelevant, they added. Though the Republican effort to reject the election results is expected to fail, a dozen Republican senators and many more in the House plan to vote against electors for Mr. Biden on Wednesday when Congress is set to hold what's normally a perfunctory session to confirm Mr. Biden's victory. Representative Elise Stefanik, Republican of New York, who last year led a successful recruitment effort to bring more conservative women into Congress, said she would join the push. She cited the widely held belief among the party's base that the election was stolen through fraud, a debunked claim that Mr. Trump has stoked for weeks, and which has been amplified by the right-wing news media and many Republican lawmakers. I have an obligation to act on this matter if I believe there are serious questions with respect to the presidential election. I believe those questions exist, Ms. Stefanik said in a video message posted on Twitter. Tens of millions of Americans are rightly concerned that the 2020 election featured unprecedented voting irregularities, unconstitutional overreach by unelected state officials and judges ignoring state election laws, and a fundamental lack of ballot integrity and security. Every state in the country has certified the election results after verifying their accuracy, and judges across the country have rejected nearly 60 attempts by Mr. Trump and his allies to challenge the results. Former Attorney General William P. Barr said the Justice Department had not uncovered any voting fraud that would have changed the results of the election. Representative Liz Cheney, the third-ranking Republican, called the move exceptionally dangerous. None of these investigations or lawsuits has resulted in evidence of fraud that comes anywhere close to the standard for rejecting a state's electoral votes, Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia, said in a statement announcing her opposition to the effort. Refusing to count a state's electoral votes in the absence of such evidence would disenfranchise millions of American voters and call into question the very foundation of representative government enshrined in our Constitution.\n\nMore than 170 business executives urge Congress to certify Biden's win.

Doug Mills/The New York Times Chief executives and other leaders from many of America's largest businesses on Monday urged Congress to certify the electoral vote on Wednesday to confirm Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s presidential victory. Attempts to thwart or delay this process run counter to the essential tenets of our democracy, they said in a statement. Included in the list of 170 signers were Laurence D. Fink of BlackRock, Logan Green and John Zimmer of Lyft, Brad Smith of Microsoft, Albert Bourla of Pfizer, and James Zelter of Apollo Global Management. Over the weekend, President Trump called Georgia's Republican secretary of state in an effort to subvert the election results. On the call, which was recorded, the president pressured the official to find enough votes to overturn Mr. Biden's victory. The president's demand raised questions about whether he violated election fraud statutes, lawyers said, though a charge is unlikely. President-elect Biden won the Electoral College, 306 to 232, and the popular vote was 81.2 million for Mr. Biden to Mr. Trump's 74.2 million. Members of the president's party are divided over whether to accept that he lost the election: While top Republicans, such as Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, have pushed back on a futile attempt in Congress to reject the results, about a dozen senators and senators-elect have lined up behind President Trump's bid to hold on to power. The urging from business leaders came on a volatile day for financial markets and just a day before runoff elections in Georgia, which will determine whether Republicans or Democrats control the Senate. Coronavirus cases are surging, and vaccinations are taking more time than hoped. Business leaders took issue with Washington's new divide at a moment of grave uncertainty. Our duly elected leaders deserve the respect and bipartisan support of all Americans at a moment when we are dealing with the worst health and economic crises in modern history, the business leaders wrote. There should be no further delay in the orderly transfer of power. The statement, which was organized by Partnership for New York City, a business advocacy organization, came on the same day that Thomas J. Donohue, the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, issued a statement urging certification of the vote. Efforts by some members of Congress to disregard certified election results in an effort to change the election outcome or to try a make a long-term political point undermines our democracy and the rule of law and will only result in further division across our nation, Mr. Donohue wrote. The United States of America faces enormous challenges that not only require an orderly transition of administrations, but the focus of the incoming Biden administration and the new Congress, and cooperation across party lines, he continued. We urge Congress to fulfill its responsibility in counting the electoral votes, the Trump administration to facilitate an orderly transition for the incoming Biden administration, and all of our elected officials to devote their energies to combating the pandemic and supporting our economic recovery.\n\nThe top federal prosecutor in Atlanta abruptly departed. Byung J. Pak, the U.S. attorney in Atlanta, during a press briefing in 2019. Credit... Bob Andres/Atlanta Journal-Constitution, via Associated Press The top federal prosecutor in Atlanta abruptly announced his departure on Monday, two days after President Trump complained that the prosecutor did not support him as he pushed Georgia's secretary of state to give into unfounded claims that the city had seen massive voter fraud and complained. Byung J. Pak, the U.S. attorney in Atlanta, said in an email to his office on Monday that he was resigning immediately, according to a spokesman. He gave no reason other than unforeseen events, and spokesmen for his office in Atlanta and the Justice Department in Washington declined to comment further. Multiple people who have spoken with Mr. Pak expected his departure and said that he had been looking for other work. Several other U.S. attorneys have left since the election, including in Texas, Missouri, Ohio and North Carolina, and more are expected to go before the end of the Trump administration on Jan. 20. But Mr. Pak's decision to leave on the same day as he announced his departure took people in the department by surprise. Known as BJay, Mr. Pak was nominated by Mr. Trump in 2017 to serve as the U.S. attorney in the Northern District of Georgia, a district that includes Atlanta and Fulton County. While Mr. Trump did not criticize Mr. Pak by name, and there are three U.S. attorneys in the Georgia, he has lately become increasingly focused on the specious claim that poll workers in Fulton County manipulated the vote count. If you check the signatures, a real check of the signatures going back in Fulton County, you'll find at least a couple of hundred thousand of forged signatures, Mr. Trump said in a phone call with the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, who refuted the allegation. Mr. Trump also complained about the quality of the investigative work into voter fraud in Georgia, especially in Fulton County. You have your never-Trumper U.S. attorney there, he said. Mr. Pak also served in the Georgia House of Representatives from 2011 to 2017.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHistorians condemn Trump for 'brazenly sabotaging' the electoral process. President Trump about to board Air Force One on Monday to travel to Georgia for a campaign rally in support of Georgia's Republican senators in tomorrow's run-off election that will decide which party controls the Senate. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times A group of prominent American historians added their voice on Monday to the debate about President Trump's effort to overturn the election, decrying what they called an undemocratic bid to unravel a free and fair vote that has no historical precedent in the long annals of the United States. Never before in our history has a president who lost re-election tried to stay in office by subverting the democratic process set down by the Constitution, the historians said in a statement. That is what President Trump has been doing since November 3, when a strong electoral majority of Americans chose Joseph R. Biden to be the 46th president of the United States. The historians' statement pointed out that the 2020 election was not even particularly close in historical terms. Mr. Biden won as many or more Electoral College votes as the winning candidates in five elections since 1960 and larger popular majorities than in more than half of the presidential elections held in the last six decades. Yet in none of these elections did any losing candidate attempt to claim victory by brazenly sabotaging the electoral process as Donald Trump has done and continues to do, said the letter, organized by Douglas Brinkley of Rice University and Sean Wilentz of Princeton University. Among the 22 signatories were Ron Chernow, Jon Meacham, Kenneth Mack, Susan Dunn, Akhil Reed Amar, David Blight and H.W. Brands. Also signing was Michael W. McConnell of Stanford University, a former appeals court judge who was effectively repudiating the effort led by one of his old clerks, Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri.\n\nPence visit kicks off final campaign push in Georgia. Vice President Mike Pence at a campaign event in Columbus, Ga., last month. Credit... Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images Vice President Mike Pence kicked off the start of a final push by party leaders on Monday to urge voters to turn out for Tuesday's highly consequential runoff elections. He implored Georgians to send Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler back to Washington, allowing Republicans to maintain control of the Senate. In one more day, we need Georgia to defend the majority, Mr. Pence said in a midday appearance at a church in Milner, Ga. A Republican Senate majority could be our last line of defense. An influx of new voters and a fractured Republican electorate have given Democrats hope for a power-shifting victory by their Senate candidates, Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., who won the state in November, will campaign with the two men on Monday in the largely Democratic Atlanta area. The Republican incumbents are turning to President Trump to shore up the vote and motivate the Georgians who supported him in November, even as the president continues to challenge the validity of the state's results. Mr. Trump is holding a rally on Monday evening with the two candidates in Dalton, a city in northwest Georgia in a region where early voting turnout has been relatively light. Some Republicans worry that the president's two-month campaign against the election outcome could keep Trump supporters home on Tuesday because of a loss of faith in the system. There are also concerns about the potential for Mr. Trump to use Monday's appearance to mostly talk about himself, particularly after the release of a recording of a call between Mr. Trump and the state's top elections official. During the call, the president warned of a criminal offense if the state could not find the votes that would hand him the state's 16 Electoral College votes. Mr. Perdue was confident on Sunday that Mr. Trump would focus on the senators in his appearance because he knows what's at stake. During an interview on Fox News, Mr. Perdue said if the two Democrats won, Georgians would see a radical socialist and very dangerous agenda out of Washington. If the Republican candidates win, Mr. Biden will face gridlock in the Senate and struggle to pass legislation. Eileen Sullivan, Astead W.

Lee/The New York Times Jon Ossoff, a Democrat who is running for Senate in Georgia's Tuesday runoffs, criticized President Trump at a campaign event on Monday for having pressured Georgia's secretary of state to find votes to undermine the outcome of the election. Mr. Ossoff, who is challenging the incumbent, David Perdue, drew parallels between Mr. Trump's effort and the bitter history of disenfranchisement in the state, citing poll closures and cumbersome voting rules. The president of the United States on the phone trying to intimidate Georgia's election officials to throw out your votes, Mr. Ossoff told supporters at a canvassing event in Conyers, a suburb east of Atlanta. Let's send a message: Don't come down to Georgia and try to mess with our voting rights. Among Democrats, the president's statement only added to their anger and drive to defeat the two Republican candidates, Mr. Perdue, whose term ended on Jan. 3, and Senator Kelly Loeffler. Both have closely aligned themselves with Mr. Trump. Hillary Drummond Simpson, a retired elementary and middle school teacher, said that she has been left puzzled by the support that the president still has. I don't get it, she said. I don't understand what they are looking for in a leader. I'm shocked to see a president leaving office has so much power still, she said. Verdailia Turner, who was in Conyers to help with canvassing, said she could sense the momentum surrounding the race. It's like a perfect, beautiful storm, and all eyes are on us, said Ms. Turner, the president of the Georgia Federation of Teachers. It's imperative we bring some sanity back to Washington, D.C.\n\nGeorgia election officials receive requests for investigations into Trump's call, but haven't started any yet.

Credit... Erik S Lesser/EPA, via Shutterstock Georgia elections officials have received at least two requests for investigations into whether President Trump violated state laws prohibiting election interference in his phone call Saturday with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. But as of early Monday afternoon, it appeared no such investigation had been opened. On Sunday, The Washington Post, followed by other news outlets, reported that Mr. Trump, in a recorded phone call, had asked Mr. Raffensperger to find him enough votes to overturn the presidential election results in Georgia, and appeared to vaguely threaten Mr. Raffensperger with a criminal offense. A number of lawyers have since said that Mr. Trump may have violated state and federal laws, but said that such charges may prove difficult to pursue. On Sunday evening, the lone Democrat on Georgia's five-member state elections board wrote a letter to Mr. Raffensperger requesting that his office open an investigation to determine whether Mr. Trump had violated state law. Then, on Monday, the state board of elections received a complaint from John F. Banzhaf III, a law professor at George Washington University. Mr. Banzhaf also requested an investigation, citing three specific state statutes dealing with the commission of election fraud and interference with state officials' performance of election duties. Mr. Raffensperger, as secretary of state, serves as chair of the five-person state elections board, and in many cases, investigators in his office would start an investigation based on such complaints. In an interview Monday morning on ABC's Good Morning America, the host George Stephanopoulos asked Mr. Raffensperger, a Republican, if he would open an investigation into Mr. Trump's phone call. Mr. Raffensperger said that because he had been on the call, he might have a conflict of interest, and suggested instead that such an investigation might be in the works by the Fulton County district attorney. I understand that the Fulton County district attorney wants to look at it. Maybe that's the appropriate venue, Mr. Raffensperger said. Mr. Raffensperger's office did not return queries Monday from The Times asking for clarification as to whether he would indeed formally step back from the matter. Mr. Raffensperger's office is planning a news conference at 3 p.m. at the state Capitol in Atlanta. Fani Willis, the district attorney for Fulton County, has not yet opened an investigation, said Jeff DiSantis, a spokesman for Ms. Willis and the incoming deputy district attorney. Mr. DiSantis said that his office had not yet received a formal notification from Mr. Raffensperger that he wished to hand off the decision. Mr. DiSantis noted that the office of the state attorney general, Christopher M. Carr, might also have jurisdiction over such a matter. Mr. Carr's office did not respond to a request for comment Monday. In a prepared statement, Ms. Willis said that she found Mr. Trump's conversation with the secretary of state disturbing. Once the investigation is complete, this matter, like all matters, will be handled by our office based on the facts and the law, she said.

Representative Devin Nunes during a television interview at the Russell Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill. Credit... Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times President Trump awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to one of his most outspoken Republican defenders in the House, Representative Devin Nunes of California, and plans to award another to Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio in the coming days, two officials familiar with his plans said. The award is the nation's highest civilian honor, meant to recognize exceptional contributions to national security, world peace or cultural and other significant endeavors. While presidents have bestowed the honor on members of Congress in the past, it has typically been granted at the end of a lawmaker's time in public service or in recognition for an unrelated achievement. In the case of Mr. Nunes and Mr. Jordan, however, Mr. Trump wants to honor the lawmakers for their leading roles in personally defending him against the F.B.I.'s investigation of Russian election interference and the House's impeachment inquiry, according to the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss plans not yet made public. Both investigations uncovered wrongdoing by the president and his advisers, but Mr. Trump viewed them as partisan witch hunts, demanding his party rally around him to fend them off. Mr. Nunes and Mr. Jordan enthusiastically answered the call, working in public and in private to dig up unflattering information about those investigating the president, including his own Justice Department, which they would then publicize, often with the help of the White House. The two took a similar approach when Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump based on his attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Joseph R. Biden Jr. Mr. Jordan, a pugnacious force in congressional hearings, became the face of Mr. Trump's defense on Capitol Hill, ultimately helping to win his acquittal in the Republican-controlled Senate. The work infuriated Democrats, but it made Mr. Nunes and Mr. Jordan heroes on the right and persuaded many in their party to follow suit. In 2018, Mr. Trump said that Mr. Nunes, then the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, ought to be awarded the Medal of Freedom or the Medal of Honor, which is reserved for military valor, based on his attempts to discredit the Russia investigation. That Mr. Trump is doing so now, even as he refuses to concede his election defeat, suggests that he recognizes his time in office is limited. Mr. Nunes received the honor in a ceremony on Monday, and Mr. Trump is likely to bestow it upon Mr. Jordan next week. The Washington Post first reported the awards.

Brynn Anderson/Associated Press The call by President Trump on Saturday to Georgia's secretary of state raised the prospect that Mr. Trump may have violated laws that prohibit interference in federal or state elections, but lawyers said on Sunday that it would be difficult to pursue such a charge. The recording of the conversation between Mr. Trump and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger of Georgia, first reported by The Washington Post, led a number of election and criminal defense lawyers to conclude that by pressuring Mr. Raffensperger to find the votes he would need to reverse the election outcome in the state, Mr. Trump either broke the law or came close to it. It seems to me like what he did clearly violates Georgia statutes, said Leigh Ann Webster, an Atlanta criminal defense lawyer, citing a state law that makes it illegal for anyone who solicits, requests, commands, importunes or otherwise attempts to cause the other person to engage in election fraud. At the federal level, anyone who knowingly and willfully deprives, defrauds or attempts to deprive or defraud the residents of a state of a fair and impartially conducted election process is breaking the law. Matthew T. Sanderson, a Republican election lawyer who has worked on several presidential campaigns — including those of Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Rick Perry, the former Texas governor — said that while it did appear that Mr. Trump was trying to intimidate Mr. Raffensperger, it was not clear that he violated the law. That is because while Mr. Trump clearly implied that Mr. Raffensperger might suffer legal consequences if he did not find additional votes for the president in Georgia, Mr. Trump stopped short of saying he would deliver on the threat himself against Mr. Raffensperger and his legal counsel, Ryan Germany, Mr. Sanderson said.\n\nGeorgia's young voters are being vigorously courted, in some unusual ways.

Nicole Craine for The New York Times ATLANTA — As hundreds of millions of dollars have been pumped into Georgia for a runoff election that will determine which party controls the Senate, few groups have been as vigorously pursued as young voters. Voter registration efforts and political campaigns have tried to reach them through TikTok videos, poetry readings and drive-in events with celebrities. College Republicans have had phone-banking competitions, while other volunteer groups have approached young voters on dating apps, such as Tinder. The work has paid off. More than 75,000 new voters registered ahead of the runoffs, more than half of them under the age of 35. Campaigns put an intense focus on 23,000 young people who were not old enough to vote in November but are qualified to do so in the runoffs. Early voting began in mid-December, and so far, more than three million people have cast their ballots — about 75 percent of the early votes cast in November's general election, which set turnout records. Over 360,000 early voters in the runoffs were between the ages of 18 and 29, according to data maintained by GeorgiaVotes.com. The intense interest surrounding the Senate races has reached across party lines. I think that young voters have felt so disconnected from politics, and their voice was not heard, said Bryson Henriott, a sophomore at the University of Georgia and the political director for the College Republicans chapter. They're the ones door-knocking for these campaigns, they are the ones on social media. Now that young people feel like they have a voice in politics, they're going to stay focused.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTrump's disregard for democratic norms leaves allies fearful for America's global standing. Supporters of President Trump at a rally in Washington last month. Credit... Victor J. Blue for The New York Times BRUSSELS — President Trump's extraordinary, wheedling telephone call to state officials in Georgia seeking to overturn the election results there has shaken many Europeans — not so much for what it reveals about Mr. Trump himself, but for what it may portend for the health of American democracy. Foreign leaders are looking forward, but many worry that the Trump effect will last for years, damaging trust in American predictability and reliability. A lot of people will just roll their eyes and wait for the clock to run down, said Leslie Vinjamuri, director of the U.S. and Americas program at Chatham House, the British research institution. But by far the most troubling thing is the number of Republicans who are willing to go along with him, and what it's doing to the Republican Party, playing out in real time. A group of House Republicans has vowed to challenge Biden's Electoral College win on Wednesday when Congress meets to certify it, and at least a dozen Republican senators are expected to join them, forcing a vote though it is all but certain to fail. The dangers that entails for foreign allies are manifold and will not be easily dispelled even with a new president. But they are raising special concerns before Mr. Trump exits. Patrick Chevallereau, a former French military officer now at RUSI, a defense research institution in London, said that the Trump call shows that the current president is in a mind-set to do anything — absolutely anything — before Jan. 20. There is zero standard, zero reference, zero ethics. And Laurence Nardon, head of the North America program at the French Institute of International Relations in Paris, said that America's soft power and democratic example is damaged by Mr. Trump's behavior. But he added, I think we have understood that his practice of power is an exception, even if his election is not an accident.\n\nFormer defense secretaries warn using the military to settle the election would be 'unlawful' and 'unconstitutional.' In an op-ed, all 10 living former defense secretaries call for a smooth transition between administrations as President Trump refuses to accept his defeat in the November election. Credit... Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times All 10 living former defense secretaries warned in an op-ed on Sunday against involving the military in election disputes and urged leaders at the Defense Department to facilitate a smooth transition with the incoming administration. The op-ed, published by The Washington Post, was an extraordinary public statement from a group of officials who served presidents from both parties. Its signatories included President Trump's two Senate-confirmed defense secretaries, James N. Mattis and Mark T. Esper, as well as former Vice President Dick Cheney. The former defense secretaries weighed in with one voice as Mr. Trump continues to make baseless claims about the election and refuses to recognize his defeat. Our elections have occurred, they wrote. Recounts and audits have been conducted. Appropriate challenges have been addressed by the courts. Governors have certified the results. And the Electoral College has voted. The time for questioning the results has passed; the time for the formal counting of the Electoral College votes, as prescribed in the Constitution and statute, has arrived. In the op-ed, the former secretaries — who served under Mr. Trump and Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George Bush and Gerald R. Ford — said unequivocally that the military had no role to play in settling election-related controversies. Efforts to involve the U.S. armed forces in resolving election disputes would take us into dangerous, unlawful and unconstitutional territory, they wrote. Civilian and military officials who direct or carry out such measures would be accountable, including potentially facing criminal penalties, for the grave consequences of their actions on our republic. Retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser whom Mr. Trump recently pardoned, suggested on the conservative television network Newsmax last month that Mr. Trump could use the military to rerun the election in swing states, and later attended a meeting with the president at the White House. The former defense secretaries also called for cooperation at the Pentagon during the transition between administrations, an issue that President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his team have complained about. Last week, Mr. Biden said his transition team had faced obstruction from the Defense Department. In the op-ed, the former defense secretaries noted that transitions can be a moment when the nation is vulnerable to actions by adversaries seeking to take advantage of the situation, and they said it was critical that the transition at the Pentagon be carried out fully, cooperatively and transparently.\n\nNancy Pelosi secures another term as speaker. Video Speaker Nancy Pelosi was re-elected to lead the House of Representatives as the 117th Congress convened Sunday evening. Credit Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times WASHINGTON — Democrats returned Representative Nancy Pelosi of California to the House speakership on Sunday for what may be her final term, handing a tested leader control of the slimmest majority in almost two decades as Washington prepares for a new Democratic president. The nearly party-line vote punctuated an opening day marked more by precaution than pomp, as the 117th Congress convened under the threat of a deadly pandemic and awaited a pair of Senate runoffs in Georgia that will determine control of that chamber. Several House members sick with Covid-19 missed the session altogether and others cast their votes from behind a plexiglass enclosure specially constructed in a gallery overlooking the chamber. Her victory means that after two years as President Trump's most outspoken antagonist, Ms. Pelosi will now be responsible for trying to shepherd through Congress as much of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s agenda as possible. Scripture tells us that to everything, there is a season: a time for every purpose under the heavens; a time to build, a time to sow, a time to heal, she said in a speech after winning the speakership. Now is certainly a time for our nation to heal. Our most urgent priority will continue to be defeating the coronavirus. And defeat it, we will. It will be no easy task. With her party in control of just 222 of 435 seats, Ms. Pelosi can afford to lose only a handful of Democrats on any given vote. Emboldened Republicans are gunning to retake the majority in next year's midterm elections and are in no mood to extend an olive branch. Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader, used his own remarks before presenting Ms. Pelosi the gavel to torch Democrats' record in the majority and effectively declare the beginning of the campaign to wrest power from them. It has been said that a house divided cannot stand, he said. Well, if there is any lesson Americans have learned in the last two years, it's this: A House distracted cannot govern.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBiden plans to renew nuclear talks with Russia while punishing the Kremlin, an adviser says. Comments by Jake Sullivan, the incoming national security adviser, indicated how quickly the Biden administration would be immersed in complex arms control issues with Russia and Iran. Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s incoming national security adviser said on Sunday that the new administration would move quickly to renew the last remaining major nuclear arms treaty with Russia, even while seeking to make President Vladimir V. Putin pay for what appeared to be the largest-ever hacking of U.S. government networks. In an interview on GPS on CNN, Jake Sullivan, who at 44 will become the youngest national security adviser in more than a half century, also said that as soon as Iran re-entered compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal — which he helped negotiate under President Barack Obama — there would be a follow-on negotiation over its missile capabilities. In that broader negotiation, we can ultimately secure limits on Iran's ballistic missile technology, Mr. Sullivan said, and that is what we intend to try to pursue through diplomacy. He did not mention that missiles were not covered in the previous accord because the Iranians refused to commit to any limitations on their development or testing. To bridge the impasse, the United Nations passed a weakly worded resolution that called on Tehran to show restraint; the Iranians say it is not binding, and they have ignored it. Taken together, Mr. Sullivan's two statements indicated how quickly the new administration would be immersed in two complex arms control issues, even as Mr. Biden seeks to deal with the coronavirus pandemic and the economic shocks it has caused.
While its results were partly attributable to investment decisions, the endowment has also had a series of chief executives come and go. And analysts say some talented investors do not want to work at an endowment or foundation because the compensation will never equal what they can earn running their own funds. Even if an endowment can hire an outstanding investor, once that person has a strong record, he or she may leave for higher pay, and that does not create a stable environment, said Charles Skorina, a recruiter for chief investment officers.\n\nAs the head of Columbia's $9 billion endowment for 10 years, Mr. Narvekar allocated funds to a diverse group of outside managers, an approach that was developed by David F. Swensen and is known as the Yale model.\n\nIn a letter on Wednesday, Mr. Narvekar said that the real estate investment team would leave Harvard but that Harvard would continue to invest with it.\n\nAs far back as 1998, when Jonathon S. Jacobson left Harvard to form the hedge fund Highfields Capital, that fund raised a third of its initial $1.5 billion from the endowment. Mr. Narvekar also said the staff members running the endowment's internally managed hedge funds would depart, but he did not say whether Harvard would continue to invest with them.\n\nTo help orchestrate the change in strategy, Mr. Narvekar has brought in several new managers, including Richard Slocum, former chief investment officer of the Johnson Company and senior director at the investments office at the University of Pennsylvania. Mr. Narvekar is also hiring three more executives to oversee and monitor Harvard's diversification and risk profile; two of them previously worked at Columbia's endowment. Mr. Narvekar left open the possibility of bringing in some internal managers, but stressed that he did not expect a large portion of the portfolio would be managed internally.
You might be watching a community of nuns or worker bees. These women, dressed in calf-length culottes with chemises and jackets in dark pastel colors, remain gently purposeful throughout. The movement is entirely flat-footed, often pedestrian, with impulses now rigorous, now mild. Dancers bend from the knee or waist; arms and spines ripple and stretch.\n\nOften they employ four wooden rods or sticks. Sometimes they arrange them to make various mini- or maxi-geometries on the floor. Or they wield them like implements — punt poles, divining rods, balancing poles, spears used as if to catch fish. One striking effect comes when we watch one dancer walking, with long rod, outstretched along a central line of shadow; because the zones on either side of her are lighted from different sources, her straight rod casts the shadow of a broken line.\n\nThe mood stays soft, hushed. On three or four occasions, the dancers murmur to one another; you can't hear words. The only other sounds are from the sticks (some loud percussive clacks) or breathing. (Ms. Demyanenko's series of sighs at the end of one solo is distracting, contrived.) Yet nothing is monotonous. Although the dynamics are mainly muted, they contain gradations, contrasts. The three at times move like a single team, at others like three independent people engaged in unrelated tasks. The sustained peacefulness is remarkable: Latitude is as satisfying as listening to wind chimes or watching birds on a lawn.
In a searing news conference on Monday, Gabriel Sterling, a top election official in Georgia, systematically debunked President Trump's false claims of voter fraud. Again.\n\nThe reason I'm having to stand here today is because there are people in positions of authority and respect who have said their votes didn't count, and it's not true, said Mr. Sterling, a Republican who last month condemned the president's failure to denounce threats against election officials, and who was tasked on Monday with responding to the news of a phone call in which Mr. Trump pressured Georgia's secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, to find enough votes to change the outcome of the presidential race.\n\nIt's anti-disinformation Monday, Mr. Sterling said. It's whack-a-mole again, it's Groundhog Day again, and I'm going to talk about things that I've talked about repeatedly for two months. I'm going to do it again one last time. I hope.\n\nHere is a rundown of the false claims about Georgia's vote-counting that Mr. Trump and his lawyers made on the call and in other venues, and Mr. Sterling's explanations of what actually happened.
As long as you're sure of your answer, these theme entries are really of moderate difficulty, but the premier example was tough, because the Johannes that I know is either Brahms or Burg, and even after getting the entire first word in the phrase PROJECT GUTENBERG I was flummoxed. I know the site, which is an excellent repository of free books and an important component of the early internet (and before — the mission dates to 1971). As a human who owes her main livelihood to actual printing presses, spacing on Johannes Gutenberg himself is a bit embarrassing.\n\nSo, if you interpret the clue at 23A correctly, you'll be reminded of a drama club buzzword that comes up in community and club meetings, recitals and anywhere a person who doesn't enunciate and modulate their vocals like Ethel Merman suffers greatly. We're told to pro-JECT! pro-JECT! We can't hear you! And so you have the trick today — we're looking for those words that look the same but have more than one pronunciation, and more than one meaning.\n\nAll of the words in question are common, and all are two-syllable (I deliberated over this and shall deliberately avoid being definitive, but there are hardly any examples of longer words that fit this pattern). I am still mildly amazed at how hard it is for my brain to cleanly navigate the difference between the two identical words (PROJECT, long O, and PROJECT, rhyme with Ah, sect) without sort of murmuring them both to myself. The phrases and terms that work with both pronunciations (and meanings) to form the actual entry are all quite well known as well.\n\nSo, for 38A, as long as you know a little Sondheim (this is a classic, and it's coming back to Broadway quite soon), you can come up with PRESENT, as in put on, COMPANY. For 66A, workers at the sticker factory PRODUCE those little sticky origin identifiers that come on oranges and avocados: PRODUCE LABELS.\n\nThe capitonym is at the bottom: CONVERSE, ALL STARS! Talk among yourselves, perhaps while wearing Chuck Taylors. A capitonym requires a change in capitalization — from converse to Converse, in this case, although they don't always need a change in pronunciation (who's eating turkey in Turkey?).\n\nConstructor Notes\n\nIt was really tough to come up with a good set of themers for this one. To be as consistent as possible, I wanted all the themers to involve words that become an etymologically related word with a different meaning when the stress is switched from the first to the second syllable, and I wanted all those words to be at the beginning of a two-word phrase. I'm happy I was able to come up with seven themers that worked symmetrically — but at the same time, I'm not sure I'd still submit this puzzle today. Phrases like CONTRACT TERMS and PRODUCE LABELS aren't exactly exciting, so there's not as much of an entertainment factor as I'd like. Still, I hope there's enough good stuff in here for solvers to enjoy!\n\nDon't shed a tear, or tear up this puzzle …\n\nSubscribers can take a peek at the answer key.\n\nTrying to get back to the puzzle page?

Really?\n\nWhat I found was the one-on-ones just became this laundry list of issues. And I want most of the issues exposed in a team environment, because most of these things have to be worked out in a group setting.\n\nAnd why no performance reviews?\n\nIf I have to do performance reviews with you, something's wrong. We should be on the same page at all given times. We should have shared goals and shared accountability. And when the job is at a point where it's gone beyond your capabilities, we're both going to know, and we'll work it out.\n\nBut what if people say, I need feedback.\n\nIf I have feedback, I'll let you know. If you want feedback, call me up. I'll give you all the feedback you want.\n\nAnd when you say to people, I'm not a manager, do you mean that?\n\nI really do, because I'm goal oriented. I don't wake up in the morning thinking about what you need to be successful, what your obstacles are and how I can remove them. I'm out there talking to customers. If you want help in those things, let's have a conversation. I'm always there to help, but I'm not actively thinking about it.\n\nHow do you hire?\n\nWhen you hire a lot of folks, you start thinking you're good at it. And that's when all the trouble starts. One day you realize your track record is about 50/50, and that there are real limits to how much you can get out of an hourlong interview or dinner.\n\nThat's when I decided I'm going to hire in a different way. I'm going to identify the people who seem to have the best hiring skills. And they're able to give me feedback about a candidate that's pretty specific, rather than the fuzzy stuff.\n\nA couple of my board members are really good at this, because that's what V.C.s do — they're identifying talent. So I usually put them on the hiring docket along with others, and then I synthesize everything they're saying.
As case numbers dropped in New York, in late August, Ruth's building allowed family members to visit — outside, at opposite sides of a long table.\n\nHer building started to open the dining room partially in September. A few times a week, Ruth goes downstairs and eats a meal by herself at a table, six feet away from her closest friend. It is near enough that they can talk a little, even with hearing aids. Intermittently the dining room will close again because someone in the building tests positive. But on days when Ruth dines downstairs, Judy said, she can notice the difference in her mother's voice. She's much more alive, Judy said.\n\nIn November, a day before her 97th birthday, Ruth fell in her apartment and hit her head, telephoning Judy from the floor when she could not get up. Mother and daughter were finally able to spend time together, four hours in the hospital emergency room.\n\nBy the time Ruth fell again a few weeks later, she had learned a lesson: This time I wasn't going to tell anyone, because I didn't want to go back to the hospital, she said. You should've seen how I managed to get up. I moved around on my behind, otherwise known as my tush. And I had black and blue marks all over my elbows, and I managed to get up without calling anybody. I'm a stubborn mule.\n\nAfter the second fall, a physical therapist advised her to use a walker even in the apartment.\n\nJust before her birthday, Ruth mentioned the prospect of living to 100 — a change from our past conversations, when she had said only that she did not want to get there. That same day she brought it up again with her daughter. For the first time ever she said, 'Maybe I'll live to be 100, and if I do, we can have a party,' Judy Willig said.\n\nAt last, on Dec. 7, the building opened for a few visitors — with an appointment and a negative test for the virus. Judy grabbed the first appointment, in order to get in before someone in the building tested positive and the doors shut again.\n\nShe was given one hour. She had a long list of chores, starting with Ruth's closet.\n\nMostly we hugged, Ruth said, which we haven't been able to do forever.
michael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. Today: A crucial witness from inside the president's inner circle now says he's willing to testify in the impeachment trial. The question is whether the Senate will let that happen. Julie Davis with the latest on the impeachment. Plus, the Iranian retaliation begins. It's Wednesday, January 8. Julie Davis, the last time that we talked about impeachment on The Daily was basically the day of impeachment in the House. What was supposed to happen following that historic vote?\n\njulie davis\n\nAfter the House impeachment vote, the Democrats went and had a huge news conference.\n\narchived recording (nancy pelosi) December 18, a great day for the Constitution of the United States, a sad one for America that the president's reckless activities necessitated our having to introduce articles of impeachment.\n\njulie davis\n\nThey talked about the significance of the historic vote.\n\narchived recording (nancy pelosi) And so I view this day, this vote, as something that we did to honor the vision of our founders to establish a republic.\n\njulie davis\n\nAnd everyone expected that they were then going to get a timetable for where this is going next. When are they going to send these impeachment articles over to the Senate?\n\narchived recording (nancy pelosi) We have legislation approved by the Rules Committee that will enable us to decide how we will send over the articles of impeachment. We cannot name managers until we see what the process is on the Senate side.\n\njulie davis\n\nAnd somewhat surprisingly, Nancy Pelosi hedges.\n\narchived recording You would wait to send the articles until you understand what the Senate's going to do? archived recording (nancy pelosi) We'll make a decision as a group, as we always have, as we go along.\n\njulie davis\n\nShe is essentially saying that they're not in any rush to send over these charges. And in fact, maybe it's better to keep them until she can get some assurances from the Senate about how the trial is going to look, whether they're going to allow witnesses, whether they're going to have what Democrats would consider a fair process.\n\narchived recording All right, joining us now is senate majority leader — Mitch McConnell is with us.\n\njulie davis\n\nAnd around this time, Mitch McConnell has been openly talking in interviews and on the Senate floor about how he is planning to quickly move to acquit President Trump.\n\narchived recording (mitch mcconnell) Everything I do during this, I'm coordinating with White House counsel. There will be no difference between the president's position and our position as to how to handle this.\n\njulie davis\n\nHe wants to coordinate and work hand-in-glove with the White House to essentially clear the president's name after what he says has been a completely unfair and illegitimate process in the House.\n\narchived recording Do you see any possible defections? archived recording (mitch mcconnell) I doubt it. There's zero chance the president obviously would be removed from office. And I'm hoping we'll have no defections at all.\n\njulie davis\n\nAnd so Pelosi is suggesting —\n\narchived recording (nancy pelosi) Leader McConnell has stated that he's not an impartial juror, that he's going to take his cues, in quotes, from the White House —\n\njulie davis\n\nWell, if that's going to be their approach, if they're just going to take what we've just done and essentially throw it in the wastepaper basket, maybe I should wait around a little bit and see if I can't get some guarantees about what this process is going to look like before sending it over.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd Julie, to the best of your understanding, what is Pelosi's thinking about how holding up this process changes anything in her favor?\n\njulie davis\n\nWell, there's two issues here. One of them is the issue of a fair trial is important to Democrats, but it's also important to a handful of moderate Senate Republicans who could be key if they were to side with Democrats enforcing McConnell to change the rules of a trial, to allow witnesses, for example, or to allow some new evidence to be introduced. She's thinking maybe that sort of tweaks the political calculus that McConnell is facing and persuades him that he's really going to have to make some of these concessions if he wants to have his conference united among Republicans on how a trial looks. The other factor here is that Pelosi knows that the president is extremely eager for the Senate phase of this trial, where he envisions having a parade of people come and publicly defend him and ultimately getting vindicated by the Senate in a quick and decisive vote. So part of this calculation, I think, is maybe the president is going to lean on McConnell to say, let's just get this done. If it's going to take more witnesses, if it's going to take some more concessions from our side, let's just do it, because I want this trial to start.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo the gamble here is that one way or another, waiting this out will somehow benefit Pelosi and the rest of the Democratic Party in this process?\n\njulie davis\n\nI think she calculates that there's no downside to waiting, that there are — there's something to be gained potentially and nothing to be lost.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd she can just do this, hold the articles of impeachment back from the Senate pretty much indefinitely?\n\njulie davis\n\nYes. There is no rule that says that the House, once it has voted to impeach a president, has to send over the articles of impeachment. She could just sit on them. But there is a big risk to that. The House has just taken what it has characterized as urgent and historic vote to impeach the president. And for a lot of Democratic members, particularly the ones in Trump-friendly districts, it was a pretty hard vote. It was a pretty politically difficult thing to do. And so having just taken this very high-profile and politically risky vote to do what they said they thought was right, if they then don't follow through with the process, it looks pretty bad.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nO.K. So then what happens?\n\njulie davis\n\nSo then the House finishes its business for the year and they adjourn without ever sending over the articles of impeachment, and essentially leave the question up in the air as everyone goes home to their districts for the holidays.\n\narchived recording (mitch mcconnell) — a highly unusual step. The speaker of the House continues to hem and haw about whether and when she intends to take the normal next step and transmit the House's accusations over here to the Senate.\n\njulie davis\n\nAnd rather than reacting in the way that Pelosi may have thought that he might have, Mitch McConnell seems really gleeful.\n\narchived recording (mitch mcconnell) Some House Democrats imply they're withholding the articles for some kind of leverage.\n\njulie davis\n\nAnd he's basically taunting Pelosi and saying, this strategy that you think you have of trying to pressure me to do something is never going to work.\n\narchived recording (mitch mcconnell) Eh, I admit I'm not sure what leverage there is in refraining from sending us something we do not want. So we'll see. We'll see whether House Democrats ever want to work up the courage to actually take their accusations to trial.\n\njulie davis\n\nBut then, as everyone goes home for the holidays and is with their families, and celebrating Christmas and taking a break, things start to happen that appear to vindicate, in some ways, Pelosi's decision to wait.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nLike what?\n\njulie davis\n\nFirst, you have Lisa Murkowski, Senate Republican, a moderate, gives an interview where —\n\narchived recording (lisa murkowski) For me to prejudge and say there is nothing there, or on the other hand, he should be impeached yesterday, that's wrong. In my view, that's wrong.\n\njulie davis\n\nShe says she is disturbed by the fact that McConnell has said that he's going to coordinate with the White House on the trial. She is sort of suggesting she might be open to this argument that this is not fair, or that somehow this is short-circuiting a process. Then, a few days later —\n\narchived recording Democrats are hoping that new revelations by The New York Times that President Trump overruled his own national security to hold up military aid to Ukraine is a potential impeachment game-changer.\n\njulie davis\n\nOur colleagues at The Times published a big investigation about the machinations inside the Office of Management and Budget, the White House budget office, around President Trump's decision to withhold this military aid from Ukraine that's at the center of the impeachment saga. And in response to all of this —\n\narchived recording (chuck schumer) This news story shows all four witnesses that we Senate Democrats have requested, Mick Mulvaney, John Bolton, Michael Duffey and Robert Blair, were intimately involved and had direct knowledge of President Trump's decision to cut off aid in order to benefit himself.\n\njulie davis\n\nDemocrats like Chuck Schumer, their minority leader, are basically saying, this is exactly why we are saying we need to have witnesses, we need to have the ability to review and admit new evidence in a Senate trial.\n\narchived recording (chuck schumer) Simply put, in our fight to have key documents and witnesses in the Senate impeachment trial, these new revelations are a game-changer.\n\njulie davis\n\nBecause the argument is that impeachment charges themselves are based on obstruction of Congress, the fact that the president and the White House directed all of the administration not to testify to the House in the impeachment inquiry, and not to give documents that would be evidence.\n\narchived recording (chuck schumer) We don't know how these witnesses will testify. We don't know what the documents, if we get them, our hands on them, will say. Maybe they'll be exculpatory of President Trump, or maybe they'll be further condemning President Trump's actions. We don't know! But we should see them, regardless of what they say.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo this unexpectedly eventful holiday season seemed to be proving Pelosi's strategy right, to some degree?\n\njulie davis\n\nIt's making her case that you moderate Senate Republicans, you Senate Republicans who maybe are facing re-election next year, you may want to think twice before you just snap to and follow Mitch McConnell's lead on how this trial is going to go.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Julie, by the time the holiday break comes to a close, has anything really changed here?\n\njulie davis\n\nWell, a little bit. But it's only after everyone gets back from the break and the Senate reconvenes that something happens that really reshuffles the picture.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe'll be right back. So Julie, what is this development that, as you said, starts to reshuffle this picture?\n\narchived recording (john king) Welcome to Inside Politics. I'm John King. We begin the hour with the just-breaking major news related to the Trump impeachment inquiry. The former national —\n\njulie davis\n\nThe development is that John Bolton, the former White House national security adviser, who has been one of the figures that Democrats have most wanted to hear from throughout this impeachment inquiry, puts a statement up on his website saying —\n\narchived recording (john king) He's now willing and ready to testify in a Senate impeachment trial —\n\njulie davis\n\nI would be willing to testify —\n\narchived recording (john king) — if — if the Senate issues a subpoena demanding his testimony. Let's get straight to the State Department.\n\njulie davis\n\nAnd Bolton is a person who left the White House last year under pretty tense circumstances. He broke with the president. And everyone has been wondering what Bolton has to say.\n\narchived recording Bolton has until now been complying with the White House's directive not to cooperate in the impeachment inquiry. And while the White House is downplaying the significance of Bolton's announcement, Democrats see him as a potentially key witness.\n\njulie davis\n\nHis lawyer has indicated in the past that he actually has a lot to say, that he has knowledge of a lot of conversations and meetings that would be relevant to the House impeachment inquiry. But he hasn't shown up, even after House Democrats asked him to. So Democrats are in this position where they know he has information that's material, and they can't get it. And all of a sudden, he goes public and says, actually, if the Senate wants me to talk, I will talk.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd Julie, why do you think that John Bolton, who we have long regarded as a very loyal Republican figure — I mean, all the way back to George W. Bush, he is a foot soldier in the Republican national security apparatus — why would he suddenly say, I am willing to testify, in a way that could hurt Trump?\n\njulie davis\n\nWell, that is the million-dollar question that everyone immediately began speculating on as soon as he came out with the statement. And there's a few theories. Democrats' favorite theory is, ironically enough, that this person who they have detested as a super-hawk and a loyalist to Trump might actually be the hero who has really damaging things to say about the president, who will be the one who had direct conversations with him in a way that could tie President Trump to what he is accused of in the impeachment articles. Because remember, during the impeachment inquiry, they were not able to get access to any of the people who had direct conversations with the president about linking aid to investigations or any of the other key accusations that they were making. So Bolton could do that. There is another possibility too, which is that he, having been a part of the National Security Council at the White House, is very keen to make it clear that he did not agree with some of these decisions that the president was making, particularly with regard to withholding military aid from Ukraine. And since we already know from our colleagues' own reporting that he actually had meetings with the president trying to talk him out of freezing military aid to Ukraine, he wants to essentially flesh out that picture, that the president was going in one direction and he couldn't stop it. But there is another possibility here too, which is that John Bolton is loyal to President Trump. And perhaps he wants his day in the Senate to say things that are going to exonerate the president.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nJulie, given that we don't know exactly what Bolton would say if he testified, what does this turn of events mean for Pelosi's strategy of holding back the articles of impeachment, this gamble that she took, in order to ramp up pressure on Republicans to hold the kind of trial that she wants them to have?\n\njulie davis\n\nWell, I think it really sort of proved out her thesis, which was there was no downside in waiting. Because as it turns out, the pressure has mounted. Now, instead of sort of a theoretical discussion about what if we wanted to call witnesses, senators are faced with the prospect of an actual human being who a lot of people want to hear from as a witness actually coming forward and saying yes, I will appear if subpoenaed. So it is a more concrete thing that they're facing. And that makes the negotiation that still has to happen, between Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell about the terms of this trial, a lot more complicated.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo let's talk about those negotiations and what we expect to happen in the Senate. How are members of the Senate responding to this development and to all the other developments that you described as happening over the holidays?\n\njulie davis\n\nWell, not surprisingly to anyone who has followed Mitch McConnell —\n\narchived recording (mitch mcconnell) [CLEARS THROAT] Well, hello everyone. Happy new year.\n\njulie davis\n\n— he has completely dug in.\n\narchived recording (mitch mcconnell) I wanted to make sure you understood that we have the votes once the impeachment trial has begun.\n\njulie davis\n\nAnd on Tuesday, he announced that he plans to move forward with this impeachment trial, even without an agreement on whether to call witnesses or whether to admit more evidence.\n\narchived recording (mitch mcconnell) What's good for President Clinton is good for President Trump. We'll get around to the discussion of witnesses. We got around to the discussion of witnesses after we got through phase one 20 years ago.\n\njulie davis\n\nAnd the Democrats are where they were, which is protesting and complaining and saying they don't want to go forward with a trial until they are assured of at least the possibility that they are going to get to call witnesses and possibly ask for new documents as well, as part of this process. But it's also put the moderate Republicans and some of the folks who were up for re-election under intensified pressure. Because while they are willing to go along, it seems for now, with starting a trial without committing to witnesses, it's not at all clear what they're going to do when they're faced with the actual question, which they will be at some point, of should we subpoena John Bolton or not? Should we issue subpoenas for other people or shouldn't we? And that's a question that will really affect what kind of a trial President Trump has in the Senate.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo you're saying that even if the Republicans come up with rules for a Senate trial that does not commit them to having new witnesses, that it's still somehow possible that someone like John Bolton might get called in the middle of this trial?\n\njulie davis\n\nRight. So how it would work from here on out is that at some point, Nancy Pelosi would send the articles of impeachment over to the Senate. The trial would begin. Each side would give its opening statements. And then at any time, a Democratic senator or one of the Democratic impeachment managers from the House could move to call a witness. And that would lead to a vote. And that is a vote that could put a lot of moderate Republicans or, rather, the few moderate Republicans there are in the Senate in a really tight spot.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd who are those moderate senators? And how many of them are required to vote to have someone like John Bolton end up testifying?\n\njulie davis\n\nWell, this is a tricky question. It would take four Republicans to side with the Democrats, who control 47 votes, in order to make the majority that would be necessary to do something like this. And that's because normally, in the Senate, you have the vice president, who breaks ties. But in an impeachment setting, the chief justice of the Supreme Court presides over a Senate trial.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAh. So there's no tiebreak from the vice president?\n\njulie davis\n\nNo. And what's needed is a simple majority. So if four Republicans were to side with the Democrats, they could control the process. The Republicans who are in play here are Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, who has been very clear that he wants to hear from Bolton.\n\narchived recording (mitt romney) I'd love to hear what he has to say. He has firsthand information. And assuming that articles of impeachment do reach the Senate, why, I'd like to hear what he knows.\n\njulie davis\n\nBut has also said that for now he's content to start a trial without an upfront commitment that that will happen. Susan Collins of Maine, who's up for re-election, has already said that she would be open to witnesses, potentially.\n\narchived recording (susan collins) There are a number of witnesses that may well be appropriate, of which he would certainly be one.\n\njulie davis\n\nLisa Murkowski from Alaska, who, as I mentioned, has expressed some discomfort with the way that Mitch McConnell has talked about this trial. And then the question is, who's the fourth? And that's a real question. And that is one of the things that when Bolton came forward, we all wondered whether there would be sort of a groundswell among Republicans for hearing from someone who they know well and who clearly has something to say, and is making it clear that he's willing to say it. So far, the dam isn't breaking. But it would just take four Republican votes to side with the Democrats to force someone like John Bolton to come and testify and furnish information that could totally change the course of the trial.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo for now, it seems like this strategy is working?\n\njulie davis\n\nWell, at the moment, it's looking like it panned out pretty well. It might produce some new revelations in a trial that we never really expected to produce much in the way of new revelations. This has been a very predictable process from start to finish. In the House, everyone knew that the House was going to vote on the articles of impeachment, and then the Senate was going to quickly move to acquit President Trump with no muss, no fuss. And now it looks like, well, the acquittal is not really in doubt. But the path that gets you there is a lot more windy and a lot more uncertain. And that is a place that did not look likely, even a couple of weeks ago. So, you could say that this has paid off for the Democrats, because it's at least opened the door to a bit more of a thorough process than they thought they were going to get. But the longer you wait to start a trial, the less control you have over the events surrounding what else is going to be going on in the world when the impeachment trial unfolds. And that was really demonstrated last week when another issue that has nothing to do with impeachment began to overshadow all of this. And that was the strike that President Trump took against Qassim Suleimani, the Iranian general in Iraq. And that has totally rejiggered the conversation, reordered the priorities for the moment on Capitol Hill. So even if things are not going to change very much on the fundamentals of the trial, I think Democrats are in a place now where they recognize it's time to move forward, and the articles ultimately are going to have to move to the Senate.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nJulie, thank you very much.\n\njulie davis\n\nThank you, Michael.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe'll be right back.

The 2019 Golden Globes marks one year since attendees signaled their commitment to fighting sexual misconduct and inequity in the workplace by donning Time's Up pins and bringing activists — including Tarana Burke, the founder of the #MeToo movement, and Ai-jen Poo, the director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance — to the ceremony as their guests.\n\nSince last January, protests on the red carpet have mostly waned, and tonight's red carpet was also apolitical.\n\nHere are some of the highlights:\n\nLady Gaga arrived wearing a periwinkle couture Valentino gown and Giuseppe Zanotti platform heels, and discussed her evolution from musician to actress. (She is nominated for best actress in a motion picture, drama for her role in A Star Is Born.)\n\nI discovered something in working on this film and it's something called alchemy, Lady Gaga said. I learned a lot about going to the nectar of your being, she added, explaining that acting, for her, was about tapping into something I had already in me.\n\nIdris Elba, whose appearance on the Coachella lineup was announced to much surprise last week, discussed his musical leanings on the red carpet. I play house, Mr. Elba said. I've been DJing all my life. I'm going to rock Coachella. I can't wait.\n\nIsan Elba, Mr. Elba's 17-year-old daughter, is this year's Golden Globe ambassador, a role that goes to celebrity offspring every year (past ambassadors include Dakota Johnson, Rumer Willis, and Sylvester Stallone's three daughters Sistine, Sophia and Scarlet, but the role was previously called Miss or Mr. Golden Globe in the past). What advice did Mr. Elba have for Isan? Keep your back straight, smile and nod politely, and if you feel like you're going to pass out, don't, he said. Thanks, dad!\n\nWhat does Charlize Theron want to say to Emily Blunt, her friend and fellow nominee in the category for best actress in a musical or comedy? I'll meet you in the back alley.\n\nHuh? Ms. Theron explained: After the nominations were announced, Ms. Theron sent Ms. Blunt a drawing by one of her children that depicted the two women as ice queens fighting each other, and said, This is going to be us at the Globes. The actresses played sisters at war with each other in The Huntsman: Winter's War. But off screen? Ms. Theron said: We're sisters. It's for life.\n\nDebra Messing said she was the sole representative from Will & Grace at the Globes. Ms. Messing, who has been nominated nine times, including this year, but has never won, distilled what takes place at the event into several words: We drink. At the Golden Globes that's what you do. You drink.\n\nRami Malek, wearing Givenchy, answered why he thinks he was cast as Freddy Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody, which is nominated for best motion picture, drama: I think it was a little bit of the mischief I have going on behind my eyes, said Mr. Malek, who is also nominated for best actor in a motion picture, drama for the role.\n\nCarol Burnett, a 16-time Golden Globe nominee and five-time winner, will now have an award named after her. I guess now I'll have to keep my name, Ms. Burnett said. On the red carpet, Ryan Seacrest asked about how it might feel to see the award given out annually. Maybe they'll give it to me every year, Ms. Burnett said. I don't know.
Representatives from Brazil's scientific community and government will head to Antarctica this month to inaugurate its new Comandante Ferraz Research Station, which replaces a facility lost to fire in 2012. The two low-slung buildings, designed by Estudio 41, a Brazilian architecture firm, house laboratories, operational support and living quarters — and could be mistaken for an art museum or a boutique hotel.\n\nBrazil is a tropical country, so we were not used to these conditions, said Emerson Vidigal, a principal at the firm.\n\nThese conditions include temperatures that drop below minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit and winds that reach 100 miles per hour.\n\nThroughout the 20th century, architecture in Antarctica was a pragmatic and largely makeshift affair, focused on keeping the elements out and the occupants alive. In 1959, the Antarctic Treaty dedicated the continent to research. Since then scientists have come in growing numbers and with ever more complex needs. Construction in Antarctica, long the purview of engineers, is now attracting designer architects looking to bring aesthetics — as well as operational efficiency, durability and energy improvements — to the coldest neighborhood on Earth.
MELBOURNE, Australia — Swarms of bluebottle jellyfish stung thousands of beachgoers on Australia's east coast over the weekend, forcing officials to close a number of beaches in what they described as a relentless influx of the creatures.\n\nThe bluebottle usually inhabit more remote ocean waters. But strong winds have helped the jellyfish sail ashore in recent weeks.\n\nFor beachgoers, it has been a painful introduction to Physalia utriculus. More than 3,500 stings were reported this past weekend alone, according to Surf Life Saving Queensland, the aquatic rescue authority.
Our guide to cultural events in New York City for families with children and teenagers.\n\nORAN ETKIN: GRAND OPENING CELEBRATION CONCERT FOR TIMBALOOLOO SOHO at City Winery (Jan. 13, 11 a.m.; doors open at 10). You usually have to travel to New Orleans for an authentic jazz parade, but the musician Oran Etkin promises to lead one in Manhattan at the conclusion of this event, which honors the opening of his music school in SoHo. But while the school is new, his program, Timbalooloo, is not: Mr. Etkin founded it in 2005 to teach jazz and world music to young children as a conversation among instruments. This concert will feature Mr. Etkin's quintet and two of his favorite musical characters: Clara Net (his clarinet) and her mother, Big Mama Tuba. At 12:30, after the performance, everyone will parade from City Winery to the school for a ribbon-cutting ceremony.\n\n212-608-0555, citywinery.com/newyork\n\nFAMILY FILMS: 'UNLIKELY FRIENDSHIPS' at the Museum of Modern Art (Jan. 13, noon to 1 p.m.). Friends are supposed to have a lot in common, but sometimes the most rewarding relationships are between the most different individuals. This free program of international animated shorts, geared to children 5 and older, explores such unusual connections, offering discussions and suggestions for follow-up gallery activities. The movies are The Gossamer (2016), a Russian look at a friendship between a spider and a human knitter; The Happy Duckling (2008), a British tale about a child and the duck that follows him; and the Oscar-winning The Lost Thing (2010), from Australia and Britain, in which a boy bonds with the strange tentacled being he finds on a beach.\n\n212-708-9805, moma.org/family\n\n'I HAVE A DREAM CELEBRATION!' at the Brooklyn Children's Museum (Jan. 13-15, 11 a.m. until closing). This holiday weekend will be filled with dreams, and not just those of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.: Young museum visitors will contribute their own visions of social justice to programs honoring his birthday. From Saturday through Monday, those activities will include Make Art Not War, at 11:30 a.m., in which children will add their handprints to a mural of a 1964 quotation from Dr. King: The time is always right to do what's right. From 1 to 3 p.m., they can listen to his I Have a Dream speech while writing their hopes on cloud-shaped cutouts that will soar in a museum display. Kids Take Action!, at 1:30 p.m., will aim for concrete change — children will write letters to their City Council members — and Sylvia's Story Corner, unfolding on a real Brooklyn bus at the end of each day, will chronicle Rosa Parks's transformative action on a Montgomery, Ala., bus in 1955. On Saturday only, the museum will also sponsor a neighborhood Brooklyn Kids March. At 3 p.m., visitors will make signs and posters, then at 3:45 take small steps toward a better world.\n\n718-735-4400, brooklynkids.org/mlk
Q. How do I stop Windows 10 from rebooting itself after it automatically installs a software update? I find it does this at night.\n\nImage The Windows 10 Anniversary Update includes an active hours setting that lets you choose when you do not want automatic restarts. Credit... The New York Times\n\nA. The current version of the operating system — the Windows 10 Anniversary Update — allows you to block out the time of day you normally use the computer and prevent those automatic restarts that happen after new software is installed. You can set up to 12 active hours when Windows is not permitted to restart itself, so if you tend to use the computer at night, you can set different active hours and let the PC restart during the day when you are away. (Some test versions of Windows 10 allow 18 active hours, an option that may appear in future system updates.)\n\nTo set your active hours, go to the Start menu and choose Settings, or just press the Windows and I keys on the keyboard. On the Settings screen, select Update & Security and then Windows Update. On the Update Settings area, tap or click Change active hours. On the Active Hours screen, set the start and end times in which you want to avoid restarts and click the Save button.
MARANA, Ariz. — There may be no airliner as recognizable as the Boeing 747, the world's first jumbo jet, with its iconic hump of an upper deck. For aviation fans, the introduction of the Queen of the Skies was a triumph of engineering and grace: unprecedented size and speed with spiral-staircase international glamour.\n\nBut the airline business has changed, and the giant plane has become more expensive to operate. A couple of weeks ago, the final 747 flight by any commercial United States airline took to the sky.\n\nLike so many others before it, the plane was heading to the Southwest to retire.
My teenage patient looked nervous as I reviewed her glucose readings from her glucometer and her glucose logbook, which people with diabetes use to track their blood-sugar test results. There were a lot of high levels — ranges in the 12's and 14's, when the goal was around 7 or 8. The peaks were mostly in the middle of the day and on weekends. (This was in Canada; blood glucose readings of 12 to 14 are equivalent to 216 to 250 mg/dL in the United States.)\n\nWhat do you usually eat at home? I asked. She said that her mother was careful to make her a breakfast that balanced carbohydrates with protein. Her dinners were similar.\n\nWhat do you usually eat at lunch? I asked. My patient started tearing up. She ate whatever her friends were eating in her high school's cafeteria that day — like spaghetti, hamburgers or pizza, and something like a cupcake for dessert. This was probably what led to her readings being so high.\n\nShe had met with diabetes educators before, and she knew what uncontrolled glucose does to a person with diabetes, from speeding up nerve damage in the feet to hastening blood vessel damage in the back of the eyes and the kidneys, to increasing her risk of heart disease.
Maria Sibylla Merian, like many European women of the 17th century, stayed busy managing a household and rearing children. But on top of that, Merian, a German-born woman who lived in the Netherlands, also managed a successful career as an artist, botanist, naturalist and entomologist.\n\nShe was a scientist on the level with a lot of people we spend a lot of time talking about, said Kay Etheridge, a biologist at Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania who has been studying the scientific history of Merian's work. She didn't do as much to change biology as Darwin, but she was significant.\n\nAt a time when natural history was a valuable tool for discovery, Merian discovered facts about plants and insects that were not previously known. Her observations helped dispel the popular belief that insects spontaneously emerged from mud. The knowledge she collected over decades didn't just satisfy those curious about nature, but also provided valuable insights into medicine and science. She was the first to bring together insects and their habitats, including food they ate, into a single ecological composition.\n\nAfter years of pleasing a captivated audience across Europe with books of detailed descriptions and life-size paintings of familiar insects, in 1699 she sailed with her daughter nearly 5,000 miles from the Netherlands to South America to study insects in the jungles of what is now known as Suriname. She was 52. The result was her magnum opus, Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium.
I told myself I would never fall down the wife trap rabbit hole.\n\nMy mother and father both worked outside the home, but like many women of their generation, my mother was in charge of keeping the home and caring for the children on top of her paying job. When my boyfriend and I moved in together, I made sure not to take over the housekeeping. We both cooked and cleaned and knew how to operate the washing machine. Home maintenance was either a joint effort or jointly neglected.\n\nLike so many egalitarian efforts, our domestic parity was lost once we had a baby. Everyone probably has a story of how it happened to them. In our case, my husband fell into a depression. On top of that, our 2-week-old baby needed surgery for a stomach condition called pyloric stenosis, and he came out of the operation weak and underweight. Along with the love I gave him, I went into a tough-broad-who-gets-everything-done mode. But I never came out of it.\n\nAnd so our patterns formed. I took care of the baby. I took care of the house. As my son grew older, I managed everything: food, medical appointments, preschool reconnaissance, after-school activities, birthdays and wardrobe and transportation. We had a second child and we constantly renegotiated the terms of our labor division because neither of us wanted to be stuck in those stereotypical roles. But though my husband had emerged from his depression and I from my tough broad mode, we never got our gender equality groove back despite our efforts.\n\nThen, two years ago, my husband took a job in Luxembourg, where the lingua franca is French. He's fluent in French, whereas on a good day, I speak it like a 5-year-old. Suddenly, the entire dynamic between us changed.
When you grow up and you don't see that, you feel that you can't do it and that is not right, she said. So coming back home to Jamaica, I wanted my Jamaican people to see that they can do it … if they want to be a winter Olympian and do Alpine ski, now they see their fellow Jamaican in the Winter Olympics.\n\nNearly 3,000 athletes from 92 countries are competing in the Pyeongchang Olympics. Six of those nations — Ecuador, Eritrea, Kosovo, Malaysia, Nigeria and Singapore — are competing in the Winter Olympics for the first time.\n\nAsia has also become a major force in the Olympics movement as the host for the next two Games after Pyeongchang. The next Summer Olympics will be held in Tokyo in 2020, and the next Winter Olympics will be held in Beijing in 2022.\n\nFor its part, the United States Olympic Committee said that its team is the most diverse it has fielded at a Winter Olympics.\n\nOf the 243 athletes, 10 are African-American and 10 are Asian-American. The U.S.O.C. does not release data on other racial and ethnic groups because the national governing bodies for individual sports collect and report the data and have done so inconsistently (the sports ask but do not require athletes to report their racial and ethnic identities).\n\nJason Thompson, the director of diversity and inclusion at the committee, said progress has been made in fielding a more diverse team, but that more needs to be done to recruit athletes across racial and ethnic groups.
Last year at this time, Republicans feared the blue wave, a surge of voter enthusiasm for Democrats in the midterm elections.\n\nWith the election over, and the fears of Republicans partly realized, the party's worry has shifted to the green wave: $39.67 here, $39.67 there.\n\nThat's the average donation to ActBlue, the online fund-raising hub used by more than 90 percent of Democrats. Buoyed by ActBlue, more than 100 Democratic candidates outraised their Republican counterparts in hotly contested congressional races.\n\nThat kind of uniformity and heft in small-dollar donations — typically defined as $200 or less — was missing on the Republican side, a costly shortcoming that the party is now confronting after losing 40 seats, and control of the House, to Democrats.
To update a bathroom, you could swap out the cabinet pulls and switch the faucet. But if you're ready for a bigger change, almost nothing is more effective than new tile.\n\nReplacing tiles that are damaged, stained, outdated or just not to your liking is an opportunity not just to refresh a bathroom, but to give it a whole new style. And with all of the materials, shapes and colors currently available, you have the chance to create something extraordinary.\n\nBut that's also the problem: With all those choices, how do you know you've made the best one?
In the aftermath of Donald Trump's 2016 election victory, analysts fiercely debated the role of the approximately six million voters who supported President Barack Obama in 2012 but shifted their support to Mr. Trump in 2016. Democratic strategists also had to worry about their future behavior: Was 2016 a temporary blip or were these voters gone forever? With newly available data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study survey, the largest publicly-available election survey, we can now analyze what happened with these Obama-Trump voters in 2018 and what that might portend for Mr. Trump's re-election campaign.\n\nTo understand the potential ramifications of Obama-Trump voters in 2020, it's worth understanding how they voted in 2018. Among those who voted, three-quarters stuck with the Republican Party. But Democrats did win back about one-fifth of the Obama-Trump group in 2018, which would amount to a net swing of about 1.5 million votes. While the idiosyncratic governing style of Mr. Trump may have been one key factor in bringing Obama-Trump voters back into the Democratic fold, it wasn't the only reason. It's true that most Obama-Trump voters who stuck with the Republican Party in 2018 strongly approved of the job Mr. Trump was doing as president, but interestingly even half of those who flipped back to the Democratic side at least somewhat approved of Mr. Trump. Democrats won back a significant share of Obama-Trump voters not because those voters disliked Mr. Trump, but in spite of the fact that many actually approved of him.\n\nInstead, these voters appeared to be drawn back toward the Democrats by some of the party's bread-and butter-issues, and in spite of others. On issues like gun control, health care and the environment, these voters look remarkably like the Democratic Party's base — those who voted for Obama in 2012, Hillary Clinton in 2016 and a Democratic House candidate in 2018. Eighty-four percent of Obama-Trump voters who voted for Democratic House candidates in 2018 want to ban assault rifles, compared to 92 percent of the Democratic base. By contrast, 57 percent of Obama-Trump voters who stayed with Republicans in 2018 support an assault weapons ban (which has far less support among the Republican base).\n\nMedicare for all is surprisingly popular among all Obama-Trump voters, but especially those who voted for Democrats in 2018. Eighty-three percent of those who switched back to the Democratic Party in 2018 support Medicare for all, nearly as high as the 93 percent support the policy achieves among the most solidly blue Democratic voting bloc.
When will they ever learn? The aliens, I mean, who can't seem to resist the impulse to invade Earth and wipe out humanity. Before We Vanish, Kiyoshi Kurosawa's witty science-fiction chin-scratcher — less a horror movie than a series of musings on potentially horrifying ideas — addresses the question literally. It concerns a reconnaissance squad of space travelers sent to do fieldwork in our ways and habits, with particular emphasis on our mental concepts.\n\nThere is a long and rich tradition of debate in philosophy and cognitive science about the nature of those entities, which the three main aliens resolve with impressive practical acumen. For them, to acquire a concept is to steal it from the person who explained it, a theft that is consummated by a brisk tap on the forehead. The victim crumples to the ground (there are some variations on this procedure) and then resumes life missing a key piece of mental furniture.\n\nThe result is not always terrifying. A manipulative, sexually-harassing boss, robbed of work, capers across the desktops of his office, laughing and tossing paper airplanes. A young man who has lived for a long time as an anxious shut-in loses home and finds himself free to explore the world and embrace political causes. It almost seems as if the aliens do their unwitting hosts a favor. The catch is that they plan to exterminate us and take over the planet.
Four months after Puerto Rico was battered by Hurricane Maria, Congress last week approved more badly needed emergency assistance, including $2 billion to repair the island's severely damaged power grid. An additional $9 billion will be directed to recovery and restoration projects in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.\n\nThe expectation is that this aid will help provide relief not only to the hundreds of thousands of utility customers in Puerto Rico who are still without power but also to the more than three million islanders as a whole, who are still being warned to boil water before drinking it. But the money from Washington falls far short of the island's requirements.\n\nPuerto Rico needs more than bandages. It needs to rethink and redesign its electric, water and wastewater systems, both to protect them against the next big storm and to provide the dependable service they were failing to give residents before Hurricane Maria. To accomplish that and other rebuilding needs, Puerto Rico had sought $94.4 billion in total disaster aid in November. That included nearly $18 billion to rebuild the power grid — nine times what Congress has provided.\n\nAchieving resiliency in the face of powerful storms will require the wholesale rebuilding of the island's utilities. Simply patching them up will not be enough. If that's the extent of the fix, the island is likely to find itself back in the same place after the next big storm, with taxpayers asked to spend new billions on more life preservers.
1. President Trump's national address lasted just nine minutes. Watch it here.\n\nMr. Trump argued that there is a crisis on the southern border that must be addressed before the government shutdown — now the second longest — can end. He was at times misleading. Here's what he said and how it stacks up against the facts.\n\nHere is the response from the Democratic Party leaders, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.
In 1931, the town of Rugby, N.D., erected a 15-foot stone monument declaring itself the Geographical Center of North America. For 85 years, the town has enjoyed a steady stream of tourists to the monument and local gift shops.\n\nBut recently, Rugby received an unwelcome challenge, from a bar about 100 miles south. By our calculations, the center of North America is in Robinson, a couple feet outside Hanson's Bar, said Bill Bender, the owner of Hanson's and mayor of Robinson, N.D., which has a population of 40. We have as much claim to it as anybody does.\n\nNow the science of geography may prove them both wrong. When Peter Rogerson, a geography professor at the University at Buffalo, heard about the kerfuffle, he decided to weigh in. In 2015, he had published a new method for calculating geographic centers. Using this method, he found that the continental center was in a town called (wait for it) Center, N.D. By car, Center is 145 miles southwest of Rugby and 90 miles west of Robinson.\n\nThe novelty of Dr. Rogerson's method is the map projection he used. Map projections transform Earth's three-dimensional surface into two dimensions. The process always introduces some distortion, in shape, area, distance or direction. Perhaps the most well-known projection is the Mercator, which greatly distorts size, showing Greenland at roughly the same size as Africa, when Africa is 14 times as big. Another projection, the Mollweide, preserves size, but distorts shape, direction and distance.
At issue is whether FIFA has made every effort to contact Grigory Rodchenkov, the Russian whistle-blower and former director of the Moscow laboratory for drug testing whose testimony unmasked a vast doping program that corrupted global sports across several Olympics, with evidence extending from 2011 to 2015.\n\nFIFA said it initially tried to contact Rodchenkov last year through WADA but was told he was not available. In a statement Tuesday, FIFA said it was awaiting the reanalysis of the samples of Russian athletes who were implicated by a trove of data obtained from Moscow in November before trying to re-establish contact with Rodchenkov. The reanalysis of the doping samples, expected to happen later this month, may be necessary to establish further evidence to successfully discipline athletes. The lab in Switzerland that is conducting the analysis is giving priority to samples from the tainted 2014 Winter Olympics before the Winter Games next month in South Korea.\n\nFIFA will continue its investigations, working in close collaboration with WADA and exploring every possible avenue, FIFA officials said in the prepared statement.\n\nJames Walden, a lawyer for Rodchenkov, said FIFA officials had never gotten in touch with him.\n\nTygart said that was unacceptable. Frankly, it's exasperating. Clean athletes and the public deserve to have the impact of Russian doping on football, if any, resolved immediately. We are over three years into dealing with this mess and there is no excuse for FIFA failing to contact the star witness at this point, Tygart said Tuesday.\n\nRodchenkov is currently in hiding in the United States. His testimony ultimately led to the International Olympic Committee's decision in December to ban Russia's Olympic Committee from next month's Winter Olympics. After conducting their own investigation, the I.O.C.'s investigators surmised that Rodchenkov, branded a traitor in Russia, had largely been telling the truth.
FLORHAM PARK, N.J. — Have patience, the Jets' owner, Woody Johnson, said Thursday, urging disgruntled fans to trust the team's leadership as it begins to rebuild after a 5-11 season.\n\nI'm like the fans; I'm not essentially patient, Johnson said. But I know that planning is the only way to get anything done. You've got to stick to your plan.\n\nIn his first remarks since electing to retain Coach Todd Bowles and General Manager Mike Maccagnan, Johnson set the stage for what could be a lengthy overhaul, saying that the Jets needed to become younger, faster, smarter and that the best way to do that would be through the draft.\n\nCalls for patience and trust might not be what most Jets fans want to hear, Johnson acknowledged. But he said it was what they needed to hear.
It was a difficult decision, he said. It happens to all of us. We reach the point when it is not as easy to do the work.\n\nActive in Democratic politics since his youth, Mr. Brown had risen to become a state appellate judge in June 1991, when Gov. Mario M. Cuomo tapped him to replace the Queens district attorney, John J. Santucci, who had retired. Mr. Brown won his first election that fall and went on to win re-election six more times.\n\nMr. Brown said in a recent interview that the criticism lodged against his office is totally unjustified. His senior staff highlighted a number of innovative programs the office has launched over the years. Mr. Brown was among the first prosecutors to create a domestic violence bureau and to set up an office to help immigrants navigate the legal system. Queens also processes arrests faster than the other counties in New York City, and has dozens of alternatives-to-incarceration programs.\n\nYet the office still prosecutes minor marijuana offenses and fare evasion. It also employs a number of hard-nosed policies aimed at compelling people to plead guilty. Queens prosecutors, for instance, will only negotiate plea deals before a grand jury indictment, a period when defendants have not seen the evidence against them. The office also encourages defendants to waive their rights to a speedy trial or risk losing a chance at a plea deal.\n\nGrass-roots campaigns pushing for more progressive, forward-thinking prosecutors have helped transform district attorney elections in several major cities. In Philadelphia, the longtime civil rights lawyer Larry Krasner, the city's new district attorney, won over voters last year with a radically progressive campaign to end mass incarceration.\n\nBut some political strategists and law enforcement officials question whether Queens — where pockets of conservative voters remain in one of the most diverse counties in the country — will elect a prosecutor with a left-leaning platform.\n\nHistorically, the Democratic Party has had enormous influence in choosing the city's district attorneys. The races often attract little interest, and low voter turnout allows the favorites of the political machine to win, cementing long, unchallenged tenures. Nowhere has that been more true than in Queens, where the Democratic Party has picked the county's district attorney for decades.
RE: THE OLYMPICS ISSUE\n\nFourteen writers contributed to The Enthusiast's Guide to the Winter Games, covering every sport from speedskating to curling.\n\nSam Anderson's dour portrait misses the subtlety and grace in cross-country skiing. Yes, it is a grueling sport — as are rowing, running, speedskating, cycling and swimming — and Anderson pays fair homage to this aspect. But fitness, strength and perseverance in the face of fatigue alone are not enough to win.\n\nTo be a good skier requires balance, rhythm and an animal-like ability to respond to constant variations in topography and snow conditions. Every meter of trail varies in slope, pitch and smoothness. Skis will slide differently over snow that has been shaded or lies on a north-facing slope versus snow in an open, sunny field. And snow changes day by day, hour by hour. Skiers must maintain balance over their skis as they glide over what may be a rough or rutted surface or when they hit a patch of snow that is softer and slower. Losing balance costs speed, and long practice is needed to attain this skill. But once it is mastered, the skier can speed across the landscape, almost floating above the snow. And on downhills, good skiers preserve their momentum and use it to glide up the next hill. And therein lie the joys of what I will argue is a most elegant and engaging sport.

michael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. Today: The prime minister of Australia is calling for a high-level investigation into how the country's government has responded to the devastating wildfires there. My colleague Livia Albeck-Ripka on the events that led up to this moment. It's Monday, January 13. Livia, you're on the ground in Australia, covering these wildfires that have been raging throughout the continent. What have you been seeing these past few weeks?\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nSo the scenes that are unfolding here in Australia are totally unprecedented. We do have bushfires here in Australia, but what we're seeing now has not happened before.\n\narchived recording It's been labeled the worst fire season ever recorded, an apocalypse, a nightmare, and like looking into the gates of hell.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nThis has been the hottest and driest year on record in Australia.\n\narchived recording Several bushfires burning outside of Sydney have combined into what's being called a mega-blaze.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nIt's not really one large fire but hundreds if not thousands of smaller fires that started across various states, along the southeastern coast of Australia. They traveled down the coast, just becoming more immense and ferocious.\n\narchived recording Officials Friday warned the bushfire was too big to put out. There are over 100 fires burning in the state.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nAnd so these fires have created smog and smoke haze.\n\narchived recording Sydney's skyline is renowned for being one of the most beautiful in the world, but it was far from its best today.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nYou probably saw images of the harbor totally covered in smoke.\n\narchived recording That iconic Sydney harbor view that we all know and love virtually made invisible by this thick smoke haze.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nIn Canberra, the air pollution was recorded as the worst in the world. Worst than Delhi, even.\n\narchived recording Pollution's levels in some parts more than 17 times above hazardous levels, while major landmarks, including Parliament House, are barely visible through the smoke.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nAnd some estimates put these fires at more than eight times larger than those in California that wiped out the town of Paradise.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\narchived recording Emergency officials warn that for some communities, if they wait too long, they might not be able to get out.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nThey've destroyed nearly 2,000 homes at this point.\n\narchived recording 1 Residents are coming to terms with shattered livelihoods. archived recording 2 The amount of work that was put into this place to make it the home it is, and then to lose it in one night to the fire — archived recording 3 Nationally, 28 people have lost their lives.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nThousands of people have had to evacuate their homes and are camping in these relief centers. They don't know if their homes are standing or not standing.\n\narchived recording It is now estimated that over one billion animals have been lost in wildfires burning out of control in Australia. Those that are still out in the wild are desperate for water. Volunteers are stepping in, helping any way they can.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nSo beyond the scale, what is so unique about these fires is they're threatening an entire ecosystem. By some accounts, they've already wiped out at least half a billion animals.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI have to say that the scale of that is hard to fathom. So how is that possible?\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nSo what you have to understand about Australia is that we have this incredibly unique ecosystem. There are hundreds of species of animals that are endemic, so only found in Australia, which include koalas, kangaroos, possums, wallabies, cockatoos, and many other types of bugs and other species. And increasingly, as we've built up the landscape, they've been pushed into these dense parts of bush. And that's what's burning.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nAnd what that means is that entire species of some of these animals could be wiped out in what some ecologists have described as a kind of biological armageddon.\n\narchived recording In Australia over the past few weeks, hundreds of koalas have been killed and large swaths of their habitat destroyed by raging bushfires.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nWe're seeing images of singed koalas, dehydrated koalas and kangaroos emerging from the bush.\n\narchived recording Scores of people doing their best to rescue as many kangaroos, koalas and other animals from the charred landscape.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nSo one thing I was really interested in finding was someone who was coming face to face with this massive destruction of Australia's ecosystem.\n\nspeaker This is Susie. susan pulis Nice to meet you. speaker Livia. livia albeck-ripka Hi, we met briefly —\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nSo last week, I drove out to Raymond Island in the southeastern part of the country to meet a woman named Susan Pulis, who's been going to great lengths to save these animals whose lives and habitats are being destroyed. And I show up to this house on the island. Susie's staying at a friend's place. The house is in disarray. Her daughter's there. Her friend's there. There's a lot of things going on, kind of a manic energy. And there's this smell of hay and animals. And I go in and have a look in the living room, and there are all these joeys, baby kangaroos.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka Have you ever had joeys in your living room before? susan pulis Never. No, this is a first.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nThere's blankets and hay on the floor. And so we're sitting in this living room with kangaroos.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHuh.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nOne of them is poking its head out and having a look around.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n[CHUCKLING]\n\nlivia albeck-ripka So the first one that you fed here. susan pulis That's Pluto, and this is Reilly. And so he's about eight months.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI mean, so that's obviously not these animals' natural habitat. So how did they end up in this living room?\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nRight, so they normally live at a wildlife shelter that Susie runs, which is about 30 miles inland, in the bush. Because what Susie does for a living is she rehabilitates and releases animals that have been orphaned or injured back into the wild.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nAnd she starts to tell us the story of these fires.\n\nsusan pulis Evacuating the animals was certainly challenging at the time, because we knew the fire was burning.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nA few weeks ago, she starts hearing that this bushfire is approaching her house. It's getting closer and closer. But it's not so close that the authorities are telling her to evacuate.\n\nsusan pulis They said it would be O.K. to stay the night and go the next morning.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nAnd then Susie and her daughter, who is 11, are outside, and they look at the horizon, and they see this weird orange glow.\n\nsusan pulis And at that point, we were standing out there, and you could see the glow right around the whole ridge.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nHer daughter asks her, is that the fire?\n\nsusan pulis Lily made a comment to say, Mum, is that the fire? Is the fire there? And I said, No, no.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nAnd Susie says, no, no, no. That would be way too close.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nSo they go back into the house. They start getting ready for bed. And then Susie gets a call. It's the C.F.A., which is the state fire authority.\n\nsusan pulis I got a phone call at 1:30 in the morning from the C.F.A. to tell me shit's happening.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nAnd they tell her the fire is approaching.\n\nsusan pulis You either stay now and bunker down for this big fire front, or you're gonna have to go now.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nAnd that's when it clicks. That red glow she saw, it was the fire.\n\nsusan pulis So we were just like, whoa. Then next I ran and starting evacuating animals.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nThey wrapped the kangaroos in blankets, put the koalas in baskets, put the chickens in boxes, and they drive down in this bizarre convoy.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka The total number that you evacuated with — 11 koalas, 15 kangaroos. Chickens? susan pulis Two possums. livia albeck-ripka Two possums. susan pulis One bird.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\n11 koalas, 15 kangaroos, possums, a lorikeet, two dogs, chickens.\n\nsusan pulis That's all I've got, I think. I think that's it.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nAnd they go down from the bush to the coast, to this island where several of Susie's friends have agreed to house these animals while the fires are blazing.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka Amazing. susan pulis [INAUDIBLE] — flaps around a little, and it doesn't fly exceptionally well.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Livia, how is everyone managing, especially the animals, being suddenly all together in this house?\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nWell, it's not ideal. These animals are — they're wild animals. They're stressed. They don't like being locked up in a bedroom. And this is why Susie is really eager to get home. And while I'm there, there's this lull in the fires, and Susie decides this would be a good time to go back and check the property, to assess the scale of the damage. So we hop into the car, and we're driving out to her property. We drive up this road, which is officially closed. It's raining, and the rain has turned the ash to this kind of sludge on the road. And we're driving through miles and miles of blackened forest.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka How are you feeling, seeing all of this? susan pulis Oh, it's bad.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nThe eucalyptus trees don't have leaves on them. Some of them have fallen over. Susie rolls down the window to make sure that we hear the cracks of any trees that might fall over and hit the car.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka You've heard the sound of cracking timber before? susan pulis Man. livia albeck-ripka Really, a tree fell down? susan pulis Yeah, someone died one year. livia albeck-ripka Oh, my god.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nSo this is a pretty hairy drive. It's really slippery.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nThe forest is totally decimated, and there's an eerie smoke haze hanging over everything. At some point, we're at this turn in the road filled with mangium trees, which is a type of eucalypt, that have been totally decimated. And Susie starts crying.\n\nsusan pulis [CRYING]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhy?\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nThis was her koala feed.\n\nsusan pulis This was my koala feed here. Oh, my god. It was absolutely alive.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nThis is where she used to collect leaves for her animals that she was rehabilitating. And she doesn't know where she's gonna get it from anymore. So even if she moves the animals back, she doesn't know how she'll feed them.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nWe continue driving to the property and her home. And finally we arrive. And —\n\nsusan pulis This — livia albeck-ripka Wow. susan pulis Healthy, green grass. livia albeck-ripka It's just green.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nIt's incredible.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka It's like — susan pulis An oasis for the animals. livia albeck-ripka Wow. That's just amazing.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nAfter miles and miles of burnt forest, we're finally in this place, and it's a lush, green oasis that has miraculously survived these fires.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka It's crazy to drive through all that, and suddenly you're in this oasis. It's amazing. susan pulis It's a bit surreal.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nEven Susie isn't quite sure how it survived.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nShe's somehow been spared.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nYeah, and one of the reasons is because there's been someone looking out for her land. There's this friend.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka Hey there. It's nice to meet you. susan pulis This is Jason. He's the brave one.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nA guy named Jason, who's stuck around.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka Yeah, well done.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nEven when everyone else evacuated, even when the flames were yards high and threatening the property and his life.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka What was it like being here on your own, surrounded by fire in the bush? That must've been terrifying. jason Yeah, it was. I had me moments.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nSo despite the evacuation notices, despite what the authorities were saying, he decided that he was going to stay and defend her property.\n\njason The flames here, they were up to here. They were up the trees and — livia albeck-ripka Wow. jason I was standing here, just —\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nHe's filling up a tanker with water. He's got a hose and a pump, and he's desperately trying to ward off these flames, which are meters high.\n\njason Because I just didn't want these trees to fall, because they're so tall.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nHe's frantically trying to protect Susie's property, this place where she keeps these animals, when it just becomes too much.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka Were you afraid for your life? jason I was a little, just because I didn't know what it was gonna do. It was scary.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nAnd at the last minute, he hears this sound.\n\njason Then I heard a helicopter, and he's just hovering around, hovering around, and then he just stayed around. And I was like, hmm, that's good. And then all of a sudden, I heard another helicopter. It was another small one. And then they both were hovering around. And then yeah, the big one turned up, and —\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nIt's a water bomber, an aircraft that can drop massive amounts of water. And one of these water bombers soaks her property and saves it.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka So you're the hero that defended the property. How does it feel? jason Oh, it was good. Good that it's still standing, you know, that it's still here.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow. So she got incredibly lucky.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nRight. But even now, they're not completely in the clear.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka Is there a fire down there? jason Yeah. livia albeck-ripka Oh my gosh. jason Even with the rain, I've put about 2,000 liters of water on that log, and it still just keeps catching, because it's inside it.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nThere are still some spot fires. There's this one log that is just persistently on fire. And even if Susie takes her animals back, she can't be sure that another fire won't come. And this time, maybe she won't be as lucky.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nLivia, you're describing a series of good Samaritans who have risked a lot to save these animals, but the problem, I have to imagine, is far greater than any number of good Samaritans could possibly solve.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nRight. I mean, these people are battling these immense changes to Australia's landscape on a tiny, tiny scale. And they can't save Australia's wildlife on their own, but it is mainly volunteers who are battling these blazes and their impacts. And that touches on a deep frustration throughout the country that I've seen in my reporting, that it's falling on people like Jason, like Susie, to protect Australia in this disaster, and that the government of Australia isn't doing enough.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe'll be right back. So Livia, you said that the work of fighting these enormous fires has really fallen on individuals like Susie, and that there's a sense that the government isn't doing enough. So what exactly has the government been doing?\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nSo a number of weeks ago, these posters of the prime minister, this man named Scott Morrison, began to pop up around Australia and online as a kind of meme. They said, Missing. Your country is on fire.\n\narchived recording The prime minister, Scott Morrison, is getting hammered tonight for quietly going on a holiday to Hawaii while large parts of the nation burn.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nIt starts to emerge that maybe the prime minister is away on vacation. We don't really know where he is, and then these pictures start to circulate online, where he appears to be on the beach in Hawaii.\n\narchived recording (protesters) Hey, hey, ho, ho, ScoMo has got to go! archived recording Protesters will gather at the prime minister's Sydney residence this morning, claiming Scott Morrison is missing in action — archived recording (protesters) ScoMo must go! archived recording — at a time when the country needs leadership on bushfires and smoke haze.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nAnd people are really pissed off.\n\narchived recording I'm angry. I'm angry. We're really angry.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nBut it's not just about this vacation.\n\narchived recording We're really angry that these people are denying, continuously denying, climate change.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nWhat people are really upset about is the prime minister's attitude toward the environment and climate change, and his beholdence to coal.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what exactly do you mean by that, his beholdence to coal?\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nSo Australia has always had this really intimate relationship with coal. We're the world's largest exporter of it. Most of it gets sent to growing economies in Asia. The government is highly supported by the coal industry, and both parties take donations from the coal industry. So there's this intimate connection between coal and government in Australia. It's a part of our identity and has been for a long time. But increasingly, there's this climate war growing in Australia, where, because we're one of the most vulnerable developed nations to the impacts of climate change, people are increasingly growing tired of this connection to coal.\n\narchived recording We are living in a dangerous climate, and it is time for our prime minister to get out of the pockets of the coal and gas lobby groups and to start thinking about the future of Australians.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nBut on the other side, we do have those who still believe that it's integral to our identity, that the economy would collapse if we didn't have it.\n\narchived recording (scott morrison) 55,000 jobs depend on our coal mining industry.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nAnd as far as the prime minister goes, he's certainly on the side of the coal industry.\n\narchived recording (scott morrison) I'm not going to support those running around Queensland trying to steal people's jobs.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd how has this climate debate going on in Australia and the prime minister's approach to it factored into how he has responded to these fires?\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nSo when these fires start in September, Mr. Morrison is really slow to respond.\n\narchived recording (scott morrison) I would like to go and provide direct personal support to people as they're suffering. But at the same time, we don't want to hamper or in any way frustrate the firefighting effort and the support efforts that are in place, so —\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nThere's no federal government response, really, at all. And the way that Australia fights fires is primarily with volunteers. And as these fires become more and more intense, these firefighters are becoming fatigued. But the prime minister says he's not going to pay them.\n\narchived recording (scott morrison) Australia is very well placed and positioned to deal with these types of disasters. The coordination and the relationships that have been built up between our state agencies are simply outstanding. And I've seen it on display.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nHe says this is an issue for the states and not the federal government.\n\narchived recording Public anger has risen after two volunteer firefighters were killed battling bushfires sweeping the East Coast.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nThen two firefighters die.\n\narchived recording A heartbreaking scene as their colleagues comfort each other in a time of incredible sadness.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nSo word gets out that the prime minister's on this vacation in Hawaii.\n\narchived recording The prime minister has caved tonight, rushing back from Hawaii amid criticism for taking a holiday while Sydney burns.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nAnd he finally holds a press conference.\n\narchived recording (scott morrison) I want to start by extending my sincere condolences and sympathies once again.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nHe agrees to pay the volunteer firefighters 6,000 Australian dollars each.\n\narchived recording (scott morrison) I also want to acknowledge the outstanding work that is being done.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nAnd he does this really big thing.\n\narchived recording (scott morrison) The H.M.A.S. Adelaide, the Navy's largest amphibious ship, has been readied to join H.M.A.S. Choules, and the M.V. Sycamore in supporting evacuation of citizens from fire-affected areas along our coastline.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nHe says he's going to deploy the Navy to evacuate people.\n\narchived recording (scott morrison) The best response I can provide to people who are feeling angry and people who are feeling isolated, for people who are fearful and afraid, is to do what I'm doing today.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nAnd some say this is the biggest maritime evacuation Australia has ever seen.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd since returning from this unfortunately timed vacation and really engaging with the response to these fires, what has the prime minister said about the connection between the fires and climate change?\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nAs these fires have intensified, and so has the pressure from the public and from journalists, he's being forced to address climate change head-on.\n\narchived recording (scott morrison) There is no argument about the links between broader issues of global climate change and weather events around the world, but I'm sure people equally would acknowledge that the direct connection to any single fire event, it's not a credible suggestion to make that link.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nAnd what he said is that he's always believed in climate change, but that it's impossible to link events like the bushfires to any one regulation or policy of a specific country.\n\narchived recording (scott morrison) So we must take action on climate change. And we'll do it without economy-wrecking or job-destroying reckless targets. We'll do it with sensible targets that gets the balance right.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nAnd so there's this real divide here between those who see the bushfires in Australia as some kind of natural disaster, as a tragedy, and those who see it as a turning point in the conversation about climate change.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight, because a tragedy would not be preventable. It's just a horrible thing that you experience and you mourn, whereas a turning point in the case of these fires implies that what's being mourned here becomes a call to action, to prevent this from happening again.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nYeah, I think for those people who are experiencing these impacts firsthand, and for those who are watching them play out online, on their TVs around Australia, this is one of the first times we're really experiencing as a country what climate change feels and looks like, just how apocalyptic it can be, and just how much our ecosystems can be devastated. And so for these people, they're really hoping that this is a moment where the government is finally going to act and change its policies around this issue.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nLivia, how much more can we expect from these fires? And as Australia tries to put them out, have people like Susie been able to return to their homes and basically start rebuilding their lives?\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nSo since I visited Susie and there was this little lull in the fires, it's picked back up again, and whatever small amount of rain fell, authorities are saying, really made no difference to the fires that are continuing to rage all along the coast. And we've got weeks, if not months, left of them.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nLivia, thank you very much.\n\nlivia albeck-ripka\n\nThank you.\n\narchived recording (scott morrison) I think there is obviously a need for a national review of the response. And let's not forget the role of — archived recording A royal commission, is that what you're talking about? archived recording (scott morrison) I think that is what would be necessary. And I'll be taking a proposal through the cabinet to that end, but it must —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn an interview on Sunday, Australian prime minister Scott Morrison said he would call for a high-level investigation into the government's handling of the country's bushfires, acknowledging the nation's deep frustration with the response. But in the interview, Morrison did not call for a significant shift in his government's policies towards carbon emissions.\n\narchived recording (scott morrison) In the years ahead, we are going to continue to evolve our policy in this area to reduce emissions even further. And we're going to do it without a carbon tax, without putting up electricity prices — archived recording So if you can do it without a carbon tax and putting up prices, are you willing to — archived recording (scott morrison) — and without shutting down traditional industries upon which regional Australians depend for their very livelihood.\n\nmichael barbaro
It is still a good place to service cars and ship packages. But with gathering speed, the western edge of Hell's Kitchen is going residential, and in the process, it is becoming New York's latest industrial district to reinvent itself.\n\nApartment houses with rentals and condos are now rising between 10th Avenue and the West Side Highway, in the West 40s and West 50s. Developers are betting that the area can overcome its reputation for being far from subways and lacking stores, and become a more typical neighborhood.\n\nI've got to tell you, I don't mind the changes at all, said Juan Rosado, a salesman with the real estate brokerage Citi Habitats. He grew up in Hell's Kitchen and now lives in a three-bedroom there.\n\nAlthough he admits that the boom has resulted in too many blocked-off sidewalks, Mr. Rosado, 40, said the situation is preferable to when he was growing up in the 1980s, when 11th Avenue was very dangerous. He added that in later decades, the area was unappealingly sleepy.
In a now commonplace career switch, Daniel Minzer abandoned banking for baking. I wanted a career change, and I have a passion for food, said Mr. Minzer, a native of Chile. His Dulceria New York City, a new brick-walled bakery as narrow as a breadstick, features Chilean confections, notably alfajores (sandwich cookies). Chile has great ingredients, but not much in the way of cuisine, he said. But pastries are the highlight. He has hired Daniela Cañete to turn out several kinds of alfajores filled with dulce de leche, with one covered in chocolate, as well as elaborate cakes and layered confections, some embellished with meringue. Savory sandwiches on crusty rolls are also available.\n\nIndividual cakes and pastries, $4 to $7; whole cakes and tarts, $20 to $60; Dulceria New York City, 2220 Frederick Douglass Boulevard (119th Street), 646-570-0466, no web.\n\nFollow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

Looking back at the 2020s from our vantage point in 2030, the first great event was the complete destruction of Donald Trump's Republican Party. As the former Republican consultant Mike Murphy had noticed, there were roughly 300 state and federal elections during the Trump years and Republicans did horribly in most of them. The 2020 vote was a continuation of that trend. Trump's landslide defeat left him humiliated, and the Republicans lost their Senate majority.\n\nTrump cried fraud and tried to whip up his followers, but they turned their backs. He went from idol to scapegoat in an instant. It seemed they could forgive him everything but losing. Many temporarily retreated from political life, the way evangelical Christians did after the ignominy of the Scopes trial.\n\nPresident Joe Biden faced an interesting dynamic in his party. The political power was with moderates. The intellectual power was with the left. People of color, whose views were largely more moderate, became the crucial swing faction.\n\nAs president, Biden resisted the interest groups that wanted him to address health care first. Instead, he did child and earned-income tax credits, infrastructure, expanded early childhood education, expanded prison reform, and so on — what some writers called reparations by any other name. He gave regulatory czar Elizabeth Warren a special portfolio to take on Big Tech.
HOUSTON — One of the most compelling subplots of this year's Super Bowl is the showdown between the New England Patriots and N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell, who suspended the team's star quarterback, Tom Brady, for four games at the start of the season.\n\nSeemingly all of New England is relishing the possibility of Robert K. Kraft, the Patriots' owner, accepting the Vince Lombardi Trophy from Goodell on Sunday night.\n\nKraft, a longtime ally of Goodell, continues to rail against the league for suspending Brady in connection with underinflated footballs used in a playoff game two years ago. Patriots fans are hoping for the ultimate revenge: the team winning its fifth Super Bowl title, and Goodell having to congratulate the team for it.\n\nBut this showdown between the commissioner and a powerful owner is not unique. Nor is it as poisonous as the long fight between Pete Rozelle, who led the league from 1960 to 1989, and Al Davis, who owned the Raiders and fought many battles with his fellow owners and Rozelle.
Even before the virus, there have been efforts to create more year-round outdoor public spaces. The design for a glass-and-steel canopy at 550 Madison Avenue — a city landmark that was once the home of AT&T and the Sony Corporation — was unveiled in 2019.\n\nBut the pandemic has brought plenty of new and expanded outdoor options across the city — though many are in well-off neighborhoods and priced beyond the reach of many New Yorkers.\n\nThey serve people who can afford it, said Claudia Coger, 85, a retired city transit worker who has been treated to shows at the Astoria drive-in theater and would like to see more outdoor options around the city for everyone. The rest of the people get left out. They need to go back to the drawing board at a time like this.\n\nStill, some groups have organized free and low-cost outdoor activities. There is a new audio guide to Belvedere Castle, a fairy-tale lookout point in Central Park. During the holidays, there was a pop-up market with Caribbean and Black artists in Prospect Park.\n\nLater this month, 25 giant prisms will cover a block of Broadway like a rainbow-hued forest. The Garment District Alliance, which runs the business improvement district, is installing the show, titled Prismatica, to lift spirits in a hard-hit neighborhood where foot traffic is down by more than half during the pandemic, said Barbara A. Blair, the alliance's president.\n\nIn Lower Manhattan, Ziggy, a whimsical art installation that resembles a glowing neon jungle gym, doubles as outdoor seating on Water Street.

I have been married to a man for almost 40 years. He's a good man, but he's not my soul mate. I have wanted to leave him several times. I never did, for the usual reasons: kids, economics, laziness, fear of the unknown. We went on, the kids grew up, and we just settled in. About six years ago, he was diagnosed with dementia. In October 2018, he was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. I thought I knew everything about this man but he has surprised me and, moreover, given me a lesson in love. He used to be full of anxieties and anger. Now he has distilled himself down to pure love. It's who he is and how his days go. He tells us how much he loves us, he tells people he's supposed to know but has forgotten how much he loves them. It's not just words, it's action; in his eyes, his face, his gestures. He lights up at your presence; he kisses your hand; he tells you how wonderful you look. He dispenses love from a bottomless well. There is no filter, no bargaining for affection. And I stand here, in awe. — Mary Carroll, Copake, N.Y.\n\nA flicker of hope after a bright light goes out\n\nWe lost our 6-year old daughter, Nina, to cancer last year. She was funny, bright, and the kindest soul I have ever known. My own life has seemed to stretch out endlessly and pointlessly in front of me while my radiant child lies buried in the ground. To give our 12-year old son a buddy, my husband and I agreed to bring home a puppy in the new year, a ridiculously fluffy, boisterous little Havanese. And suddenly we find that we are all breathing a little easier, smiling at the thought of this energetic new life entering ours. The tiniest flicker of hope is here again. — Usha Rao, Philadelphia\n\nA return to midwifery\n\nI had been serving as a Peace Corps volunteer in Uganda through a program that was attached to the Corps. Funding for the program was cut when the Trump administration took over. I am 73 and I know that for three years I made a profound difference. I want to return to my students there in the midwifery program. The work has just begun. — Cherie Clark, Broomfield, Colo.\n\nFair and affordable health care\n\nMy hope for 2019 is that all U.S. citizens will have fair and affordable access to health care services. I worked as an R.N. case manager for years, both on the insurance side and hospital side. Maybe people don't realize the burdens of pre-existing conditions, health care services caps or young people not being able to get insurance. I hope for legislators who see the need to take care of their citizens, and that this country will have the stamina, concern and willpower to provide health care to all. — Georgia Stapleton, Shawano, Wis.\n\nModerate weather\n\nMy hope for 2019 is a return to the bad weather of the good old days, when California was wetter, Texas was dryer and hurricanes were just destructive, not biblical. My hope is that sky rivers revert to rainstorms that simply ruined graduations and picnics, and that snowstorms become a reason to drink hot chocolate under warm blankets again. Bad weather used to be an inconvenience that gave us welcome pauses from routine and bloated schedules. Nature is now a raging, unrelenting, unpredictable force, unsettling and sometimes downright scary. We are at its mercy and there is no help coming. — John White, Newport News, Va.
When we're making Grammys, we don't know whose Grammy that's going to be, so we don't have one favorite, Mr. Billings said, adding: They're all just like children. I really never try to question why someone is getting an award; I do sometimes question why someone is not.\n\nBefore artists can hoist the five-pound award onstage in front of their peers, a lot of work must be done, which starts when the nomination list comes in. Mr. Billings and his team review it and estimate the number of Grammys that need to be cast to cover the nominees receiving the awards. In his 2,000-square-foot Ridgway, Colo., studio, the whirring of a polishing wheel and tapping of a hammer provide the soundtrack for his team of three, who tinker five days a week, year-round.
There are also Daf Yomi phone apps and lively discussions in Facebook groups.\n\nIn Jerusalem on Sunday, Hadran, an organization that advances Talmud study for women and that Ms. Cohen Farber co-founded, is holding a first global women's Siyum celebration. The Siyum, or completion of the 13th cycle of the Daf Yomi, falls Saturday. About 3,000 people, mostly women, are expected to attend, and it will be streamed live to an international audience.\n\nThe 1,500-year-old Talmud is a meandering text including interpretations of biblical Halakha, or Jewish law, ethics and narratives full of digressions and arguments among rabbis.\n\nIt largely depicts women as a husband's property. And the final volume, Niddah, deals with the intricacies of a woman's physiology and anatomy and the laws of family purity, including the prohibition of intercourse with a menstruating woman.\n\nIlana Kurshan, a Jerusalem resident originally from Long Island, said she did not have the anger some women have over the Talmud's depiction of women as property.\n\nI feel so blessed to be a Jewish woman in the 21st century, she said.\n\nA Hasidic rabbi in Lublin, Poland, conceived the Daf Yomi tradition nearly 100 years ago, setting the order of study as a way of unifying and synchronizing an increasingly sprawling Jewish diaspora by having Jews focus on the same page each day.\n\nA few women first began the Daf Yomi program several decades ago. Talmud study has since been introduced in some religious girls' schools, and there has been growing interest in secular academia and modern Orthodox circles.\n\nTalmud was often considered too difficult and less relevant for women than other texts like the weekly Torah portion.
The industry has attracted thousands of young people in recent years with the promise of secure careers as shale drilling took off and made the United States the world's largest producer of oil. But many students and recent graduates say they are no longer sure that there is a place for them in the industry. Even after the pandemic ends, some of them fear that growing concerns about climate change will lead to the inevitable decline of oil and gas.\n\nThese students are seeking elite positions in an oil and gas industry that employs about two million people. Even after recent layoffs, petroleum companies still employ more people than the fast-growing wind and solar businesses, which have a combined work force of at least 370,000, according to trade groups.\n\nMs. Burns, 22, said her choices have narrowed considerably over the last nine months. With opportunities in oil and gas limited, she recently accepted an internship with an engineering consulting firm specializing in energy conservation, and she may eventually apply to graduate school in environmental science. She is also considering moving in with her sister after graduation to save money.\n\nI feel like companies are going to be pretty cautious about coming out of this, about taking new hires, she said.\n\nMs. Burns was enticed into an oil and gas career by stories her father, a helicopter pilot, told her about the successful female engineers he had met servicing offshore rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. But while her professors have talked up the future for oil and gas companies, she is worried.
When Mayor Bill de Blasio took office, it seemed like the start of a bright new day in the relationship between City Hall and the people who run New York City's schools.\n\nRather than close struggling schools, as his predecessor Michael R. Bloomberg had done, Mr. de Blasio promised to support them. In November 2014, he and his schools chancellor, Carmen Fariña, announced a program to funnel resources, training and social services into 94 of the lowest-performing schools.\n\nAt the time, Ernest A. Logan, the president of the union that represents the city's principals and assistant principals, lauded Mr. de Blasio, saying that the initiative demonstrated a philosophy of collaboration over competition and reflected the deeply held values of most of our school leaders.\n\nNow, however, Mr. Logan says he — and by extension, the 6,000 members of the Council of School Supervisors and Administrators — has lost confidence in the de Blasio administration. In a column to be published in the union's newsletter this month, Mr. Logan writes of the Education Department, Sadly, in the timeworn tradition of the D.O.E., there are so many cooks running around in the kitchen, the chefs don't know what kind of dish they're concocting. So many different mandates have been thrown at these schools, he writes, that all we have is a recipe for disaster.
Hundreds of cities, large and small, have adopted or begun planning smart cities projects. But the risks are daunting. Experts say cities frequently lack the expertise to understand privacy, security and financial implications of such arrangements. Some mayors acknowledge that they have yet to master the responsibilities that go along with collecting billions of bits of data from residents.\n\nConcerns have intensified as Kansas City prepares to expand its technology experiment from downtown to poor neighborhoods on the city's East Side. The expansion will bring free wireless to homes, but also dozens of surveillance cameras and a gunshot detection system, and some residents worry that in the quest to be seen as forward thinking, the city may be handing off too much control to private companies and opening up residents to consequences it doesn't fully understand.\n\nWe increasingly see every problem as a technology-related problem, so the solution is more technology, said Ben Green, a Harvard University graduate student who studies cities and technology. And you have cities, which are caught in this devil's bargain, where they feel they don't have the resources to provide the services people need, and so they make these deals with tech companies that have money, but which in the long term might not be beneficial to either them or their residents.\n\nIn Seattle, officials this year began to dismantle a network of surveillance cameras and wireless devices that the police had deemed vital in fighting crime, but that drew complaints over the network's ability to track cellphones.
Instead of becoming overly fixated on teens' smartphone use in general, it is important to think about what are the applications on the smartphone and how is your particular child using the applications on that smartphone, said Katie Davis, assistant professor at the University of Washington and co-director of the UW Digital Youth Lab, whose research explores the role of new media technologies in young people's personal, social and academic lives. Parents trying to monitor use can have difficulty distinguishing abusive behavior from appropriate use, especially since teens use their devices for both schoolwork and free time, often simultaneously.\n\nFor some teens, the constant potential feedback loop from notifications and messaging might create a fear of missing out, or FOMO. And although there is currently no official medical recognition of smartphone addiction as a disease or disorder, the term refers to obsessive behaviors that disturb the course of daily activities in a way that mirrors patterns similar to substance abuse.\n\nHere are some questions to ask: Does your teenager's mood suddenly change and become intensely anxious, irritable, angry or even violent when the phone is taken away or unavailable for use? Does your teen skip or not participate in social events because of time spent on the phone? Another red flag is spending so much time on a smartphone that it affects personal hygiene and normal daily activities (most notably, sleep). Lying, hiding and breaking family rules to spend more time on a smartphone can be cause for alarm, said Hilarie Cash, a psychotherapist and the chief clinical officer at reSTART, an internet addiction rehabilitation program outside of Seattle.\n\nIn my work with students, I've found that even teenagers who want to curb their phone use may find it difficult to self-regulate without parental guidance. Creating daily and weekly offline time as part of the family routine is helpful, and finding a way to have a once- or twice-yearly extended period of time off — at a summer camp or outdoor expedition without Wi-Fi, or on a family trip — may provide the reset teens need to break negative habits.\n\nSouth Korean researchers developed and tested a 10-item questionnaire to determine adolescent smartphone addiction. The brief questionnaire, published in the journal PLOS One in December 2013, asks users to answer statements like whether they have missed work because of smartphone use, have had a hard time concentrating in class because they were thinking about their phones and whether they became impatient when not using a smartphone.
Alluding to Mr. Trump's Oval Office address on Tuesday night, in which he demanded the construction of a border wall, Mr. Steyer said the president had once again lied to the American people, repeatedly, for his own political skin. He described Mr. Trump as having already committed numerous offenses warranting his removal from office, and warned Democrats that shying away from an impeachment battle would serve to enable the president.\n\nMr. Steyer, 61, left himself some wiggle room to change his mind on 2020, saying in prepared remarks that he had decided against running at this time. But his announcement ended — at least for now — the latest of several flirtations with seeking high office, which have also included abortive candidacies for the United States Senate and for governor of California. He considered running for president in 2016 before ultimately endorsing Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn some respects, the Democratic primary landscape appeared inviting for a candidate like Mr. Steyer, with his sterling credentials as a Trump antagonist and a virtually bottomless well of money to spend on advertising. He has been one of the Democratic Party's most prolific donors over the last few elections, eclipsed in 2018 only by Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor who is considering a presidential campaign of his own.\n\nAnticipating a likely race, Mr. Steyer had settled on a close adviser, Heather Hargreaves, to serve as his eventual campaign manager. He had conducted research into his own political vulnerabilities, in anticipation of attacks from other Democrats in a rowdy primary, and had mapped out how to reorganize his advocacy groups to comply with the fund-raising regulations that apply to presidential candidates.\n\nMr. Steyer also recently retained a new senior adviser, Doug Rubin, who previously advised former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts on a possible 2020 run. Mr. Patrick announced last month that he had closed the door on a presidential candidacy.
I was astonished when, in late September, Saudi Arabia decided to allow women to drive, putting an end to an old, discriminatory practice. This was only one of several cautious social reforms that have been introduced in the country. In the past two years, King Salman bin Abdulaziz has restricted the powers of the notorious religious police and relaxed male guardianship laws. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has spoken about embracing moderate Islam and increasing social freedoms.\n\nPrince Mohammed is being credited for the effort to transform Saudi Arabia, but the changes might not have been possible without the Saudi activists and intellectuals who struggled and suffered over the years — enduring the loss of jobs, imprisonment and exile — to increase the freedoms in their country.\n\nAs I look forward to seeing Saudi women drive starting in June, I remember the 47 women who drove their cars in 1990. They were arrested, lost their jobs and were prohibited from traveling. Two years later they were allowed to return to their jobs. Some faded into private life; others focused on helping women at schools and universities and in programs for abused women and children.\n\nThe courage of Wajeha al-Huwaider, a women's rights activist, is unforgettable. On Aug. 4, 2006, three days after the first anniversary of King Abdullah's accession to power, she stood on Fahd Causeway — the bridge that links Saudi Arabia and Bahrain — and held a poster with a single sentence written on it: Give women their rights! She was arrested but treated respectfully and released the same day.
It's not going to change a damn thing, but I'm still doing it, Mr. Trump said of the border visit, according to one of the people, who was in the room. The trip was merely a photo opportunity, he said. But, he added, gesturing at his communications aides Bill Shine, Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Kellyanne Conway, these people behind you say it's worth it.\n\nMr. Trump plans to head to the Capitol on Wednesday to attend a Senate Republican lunch and later will host congressional leaders from both parties to resume negotiations that so far have made little progress. Mr. Trump has insisted on $5.7 billion for the wall, while Ms. Pelosi said she would not give him a dollar for a wall she has called immoral.\n\nIn a nod to Democrats, Mr. Trump spent the first half of his talk on the humanitarian situation at the border before even mentioning the wall, expressing sympathy for those victimized by human smugglers. This is a humanitarian crisis — a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul, he said.\n\nEven so, he directly took on Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer. The only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized, he said.\n\nMr. Trump has made the wall the singular focus of his presidency as he enters his third year in office. His promise to erect a big, beautiful wall along the border became perhaps the most memorable promise on the campaign trail this fall, eliciting chants from supporters of build the wall, and he has been frustrated by his inability to deliver on it.\n\nBut his alarming description of a crisis at the border has raised credibility questions. While experts agree there are serious problems to address, migrant border crossings have actually been declining for nearly two decades. The majority of heroin enters the United States through legal ports of entry, not through open areas of the border. And the State Department said in a recent report that there was no credible evidence that terrorist groups had sent operatives to enter the United States through Mexico.
NASHVILLE — The snow was three inches deep, a blizzard by Nashville standards, when I got a text from a parent supervising the neighborhood sledding: It's a robin migration out in your front yard. Do you put food out there for them?\n\nI went to the window to look. There are nine bird feeders around my house, but I've never seen a robin at a single one of them. In winter, robins do gather in great flocks here in Middle Tennessee, and our yard is always popular with them because we have a birdbath with a heating element that keeps it from freezing. Even in winter, birds need to bathe — a seemingly counterintuitive behavior that keeps their feathers in shape for maximum insulation.\n\nSo it didn't surprise me to find more than a hundred robins in our yard on that snowy day. What surprised me was what they were doing. A robin's usual practice here is to pick earthworms out of the exposed soil churned up by moles in what passes for a lawn at this house, but there are no worms near the surface on freezing days. Instead, these robins were eating dried berries from the brown monkey grass bordering our front walkway. Normally one of our sons mows down the monkey grass in late fall, after the first frost, but our youngest child left for college in August, and this year neither my husband nor I ever got around to cutting it back ourselves.\n\nI have never been a very orderly gardener. In spring I prefer planting to weeding. I like to watch birds pulling seeds from dried flowers, so I let the flowers fall to ruin in summer instead of deadheading them to force the plant to produce new blooms. In fall it has always seemed almost criminal to tidy up the golden windfall of sugar-maple leaves covering the ground like pirate's treasure in a storybook, so we let them lie until they're finally brown and brittle. By then there's no good reason not to bring out the mower and reduce the leaves to shreds so they can feed the trees they fell from.
Lead with values, not facts\n\nIf you want to convince someone about climate change, don't lead with data, writes Katharine Hayhoe in The Times. Dr. Hayhoe is a climate scientist at Texas Tech University, and she's also an evangelical Christian, two identities she realized after moving from Canada were supposed to be entirely incompatible in the United States. Understanding why that's the case is crucial when attempting to convert climate change skeptics, she writes, explaining:\n\nIt turns out, it's not where we go to church (or don't) that determines our opinion on climate. It's not even our religious affiliation. Hispanic Catholics are significantly more likely than other Catholics to say the earth is getting warmer, according to a 2015 survey, and they have the same pope. It's because of the alliance between conservative theology and conservative politics that has been deliberately engineered and fostered over decades of increasingly divisive politics on issues of race, abortion and now climate change, to the point where the best predictor of whether we agree with the science is simply where we fall on the political spectrum.\n\nIn her experience, Dr. Hayhoe has found that the best way to neutralize the partisan charge on climate change is not by appealing to science — which some prominent Republicans, such as Senator Ted Cruz, have cast as a competitor to religion — but by emphasizing shared values. For some, this could be the well-being of our community, she writes. For others, our children; and for fellow Christians, it's often our faith.\n\nIn such conversations, it may be important to remember how your interlocutor's values differ from your own. In Vice, Maggie Puniewska points to the moral foundations theory, according to which liberals and conservatives prioritize different ethics: the former compassion, fairness and liberty, the latter purity, loyalty and obedience to authority. Ms. Puniewska writes:\n\nIf you're trying to convince someone who leans left, you can stick with the polar bear and keep tugging at their heart strings with talk of how unfair it will be to our children if the world is poisoned, but if you're with a conservative, it's wise to change up your approach — science has found that personalized climate-related messages work better.\n\nFor example, research has found that conservatives are more likely to support a pro-environmental agenda when presented with messages containing themes of patriotism and defending the purity of nature.\n\nEmphasize the potential benefits\n\nFor many skeptics, Neha Thirani Bagri has written in Quartz, delineating the myriad potential harms of unmitigated climate change is not an effective strategy. Instead, it can be more productive to illustrate the potential benefits that mitigation may carry. She writes:\n\nA comprehensive study published in 2015 in Nature surveyed 6,000 people across 24 countries and found that emphasizing the shared benefits of climate change was an effective way of motivating people to take action — even if they initially identified as deniers. For example, people were more likely to take steps to mitigate climate change if they believe that it will produce economic and scientific development. Most importantly, these results were true across political ideology, age, and gender.\n\nThe messenger matters\n\nPeople are more likely to listen to a message when it comes from someone they trust, Alexander Maki has argued in The Washington Post, and messages about climate change are no different. For example, he writes, experimental research discovered that when free-market enthusiasts who are concerned about government regulation hear from experts who emphasize how companies are developing climate responses, they are more likely to accept climate science.
Mr. Lapidus and Ms. Consi had spent years looking at bigger houses nearby, and had made numerous offers, but were outbid every time. Resigned to staying put, they hired Mr. Coburn to develop plans to renovate their matchbox-size home shortly before stumbling upon their new house.\n\nAt 18 feet wide, it offered the generous spaces they longed for and appeared to need a renovation that was mostly cosmetic, along with the addition. But after they discovered the structural problems, their renovation budget of $900,000 ballooned to about $1.3 million, and the timeline grew to more than two years.\n\nGiven that time and expense, they were intent on creating exactly the home they desired, in collaboration with Mr. Coburn and their interior designer, Katherine Hammond.\n\nI definitely wanted all of the traditional touches for the interior architecture, said Ms. Consi, who planned to furnish the house with vintage midcentury-modern and contemporary pieces.\n\nThe interior had to be gutted, but their contractor, Creative Renovations, recreated many of the details, including the crown molding and ceiling medallions in the living room and the front hall. Workers also salvaged pieces of the original joists and repurposed them as shelves and decorative exposed beams in the garden-level family room.\n\nMs. Consi had been so smitten with the woodwork in their old home that she cut away a piece of window trim and removed a staircase spindle so they could be copied for the new townhouse, reinstalling the originals before putting the house on the market.\n\nTo create the storage space the family's previous home lacked, Mr. Coburn designed extensive built-in cabinetry and shelving, including a bar hidden behind paneling between the living room and the kitchen, a workstation with integrated desks in the family room and a bookcase that wraps around a home office doorway. The children also have generous closets behind pocket doors.
I set to thinking about this after watching my Mets spend much of November and December in a modestly lunatic attempt to trade Noah Syndergaard, one of the National League's best starting pitchers. They appear to have failed at this self-mutilation. Now that they have retained two true aces — Syndergaard and Jacob deGrom, the Cy Young Award winner — why not stretch them out and push them to go deeper into games? What is the point in allowing an ace to pitch six innings before turning the ball over to a committee of anonymous relievers?\n\nGame 4 of the 2018 World Series presented something of a nadir when Los Angeles Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts, a bright fellow no doubt, pulled his starting pitcher after he had yielded a single hit through six and a third innings and was ahead, 4-0. The Dodgers ended up marching six relievers into that game, lost, 9-6, and exited the World Series the next day.\n\nMazzone pulled out a few of his remaining hairs.\n\nThe greatest teacher for a pitcher is starts, he says. Pitch and pitch and pitch. Let a pitcher find himself.\n\nThe problem is that so many pitching coaches and managers are yes-men and don't want to challenge their front offices.\n\nThere's a sizable mound of statistical evidence to back such assertions. At risk of giving the quadratic dudes a seizure, I turned to Baseball Reference and selected 40 pitchers from the past half-century, men who ran the gamut from solid to superb. These are the sort of pitchers you'd expect to see in the postseason, and my list included Bobby Ojeda, Mike Torrez, Steve Avery, Tom Browning, Tom Seaver, Steve Carlton, Ferguson Jenkins and Mazzone's troika of Hall of Famers. I examined their performances across games, from beginning to end.\n\nFor most good pitchers, their worst inning was the first. Once they found a rhythm and once pitches began to crackle, they became progressively more difficult to hit. Tom Seaver's career earned run average in the first inning was 3.75. His E.R.A. for the last three innings of a game, that dreaded third and fourth time through the batting order, stood at 2.75.
DeSteno and his former student Piercarlo Valdesolo conducted studies that showed that even strangers placed into groups quickly start favoring the people in their group, as they would favor themselves, even if that group was created randomly, and only minutes earlier. Morality, as it turns out, can change by the second, and for no good reason.\n\nIt's not even a conscious decision, DeSteno said. It's an innate survival reaction.\n\nIt even showed up in the coin-flip experiment. Before it started, the initial group had been divided using different color wristbands, effectively separating participants into teams, and then some were told to watch on a hidden camera as the coin flippers cheated. When the observers saw people cheat, they considered it unfair and wrong — unless they saw that the cheater was wearing the same color wristband as they were. In those cases, they were much more likely to excuse the behavior.\n\nWhat's interesting to me is that smart people can see the same events, but can have such different views of an act that's otherwise objective, like videotaping another team when it's illegal, DeSteno said. Some people could see that and say it's terrible. Others could say it's not cheating because everyone's doing it. Both groups of people would believe what their mind is telling them to believe.\n\nThe closer you feel affiliated with a group, DeSteno said, the more moral leniency you are willing to allow. So imagine that you have grown up a Patriots fan, watching their games with your family every Sunday. Your friends and neighbors follow the team just as devotedly, and even your children can recite the names and jersey numbers of the top Patriots players.
… and we're back! Welcome to 2020 — we're looking forward to a big year ahead. If you like this email, please share it with your friends and colleagues. And if you have news tips, send them to us. Now, on with the show.\n\nCarlos Ghosn's escape committee\n\nThe former head of Nissan and Renault managed to evade 24-hour surveillance in Tokyo and spirit himself out of Japan to Lebanon. How he did it increasingly sounds like a movie-level caper.\n\nAssociates planned the heist for months, the FT reports, citing unnamed sources. They hired private security operatives who worked in multiple countries.\n\nMr. Ghosn made it onto a private plane bound for Turkey and arrived in Lebanon early Monday, the WSJ adds. (A Lebanese news media outlet claimed that he had hidden in a box meant for musical equipment; the world's tabloids, perhaps with an eye on that movie version, reckon it must have been a double bass case.) He entered Lebanon on a French passport.
Entering the offices of CookFox architects in Manhattan, you can almost leave the city behind.\n\nThe horseshoe-shaped work pods are plant-fringed havens, warmly lit by the late afternoon light. Terraces on three sides of the office are planted with native trees, vines and grasses and replete with bee apiaries that are tended by the employees, who are encouraged to work outdoors in season.\n\nThis unusual Midtown workplace, at 250 West 57th Street, was designed to be a showcase for a new kind of green building inspired by what architects call biophilic design.\n\nThe term, from the Greek for love of living things, was popularized by the Harvard biologist E.O. Wilson, who argues that humans are hard-wired by our evolutionary biology to be emotionally attracted to the natural world. Advocates of biophilic design say that to be called green, a building needs to do more than just use energy efficiently and have a minimal carbon footprint. Rather, it needs to be a health-promoting place for the people who live and work there.\n\nCookFox projects have included the iconic Bank of America Tower at One Bryant Park, which incorporates features like planted green walls and a wealth of natural materials. But the point is not just to spruce up urban offices with splashes of green, says the firm's co-founder, Richard Cook. It is to use principles of natural design to help bring the health benefits of the outdoors indoors.
The action thriller Proud Mary begins by trying to establish some retro cred, with a vintage Motown tune on the soundtrack (the Temptations' Papa Was a Rolling Stone, not thematically apt but rhythmically bubbling nevertheless) and a title typeface that recalls the one used in the 1974 blaxploitation picture Foxy Brown. Under the credits, Taraji P. Henson, as the title character, showers, dresses, puts on makeup and selects a bright blond wig from her wardrobe. Oh, and she also selects a formidable-looking handgun from the formidable arsenal behind her wardrobe.\n\nAfter which she goes on her mission, quickly dispatching a guy who barely gets a chance to gape at her wig. In a room elsewhere in the man's apartment, she sees a young boy, headphones blocking his hearing, obliviously playing a video game. This gives her pause.\n\nBut she doesn't intervene in the kid's life, not just yet. Instead, a year goes by, and Mary discovers the kid, Danny (Jahi Di'Allo Winston), is a runner for a Boston drug dealer referred to only as Uncle. After discovering the boy wounded and starving in an alley, she takes an unorthodox approach to adoption, rubbing out Uncle in a flash of anger.\n\nProud Mary, directed by Babak Najafi from a script by Steven Antin, John Stuart Newman and Christian Swegal, is a rather more somber affair than other movies in the same tradition. Although the plot mechanics are no more or less implausible than any such genre film. Mary is a hit woman for one drug cartel, Uncle was an operative for a rival one, and the scenario eventually spirals into a minor morass of misidentified killers and lethal paybacks.
LONDON — European Parliament members have joined the chorus of skeptics about daylight saving time who argue that the practice of springing our clocks forward and then turning them back every year does more harm than good.\n\nThe European assembly voted 384 to 152 on Thursday on a resolution calling for the European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, to evaluate the current system and if necessary, come up with a proposal for its revision.\n\nThe resolution was nonbinding but echoed global concerns about the possible hazards of changing the clocks. Increasingly, health experts have questioned whether it's worth the hassle to switch year after year.\n\nNumerous studies have failed to reach a conclusive outcome but indicate negative effects on human health, the European Parliament members wrote in their proposal, which was debated for an hour on Thursday.
In the circles that I move, I think there's almost unanimity of support for him, Mr. Smith said.\n\nBut Mr. Smith acknowledged that in Mr. Biden's absence, others were making moves in South Carolina. Mr. Smith said that after his defeat in November, he had heard from several contenders, including Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts — none of whom, he said, could count on scooping up Mr. Biden's network.\n\nThe entry of Mr. Biden would immediately upend the still-nascent primary: Ms. Warren joined the race last week and three dozen other Democrats are considering it. Mr. Biden could crowd out other establishment-aligned contenders like former Mayor Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans and former Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, given that Mr. Biden's donor base and supporters may overlap with some of their own. And Mr. Biden's allies are themselves mindful of another Democrat whose blue-collar credentials could pose a challenge to their own coalition: Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio.\n\n[With Elizabeth Warren visit, Iowans get the first taste of 2020.]\n\nMost of all, a Biden candidacy would also frame the primary around the question of whether Democrats prefer a familiar face and steady continuum of former President Barack Obama's center-left politics, or a generational change and turn to a more liberal, confrontational approach to Mr. Trump and the right.\n\nMr. Biden's supporters argue that Mr. Trump's incendiary conduct and norm-breaking presidency have so imperiled the country that only somebody with the stature and experience of a two-term vice president can bring back stability. And, they contend, Mr. Trump has diminished the importance of ideological differences within the Democratic Party.\n\nVariations in policy positions don't really matter because, to paraphrase the president, we are in a national emergency — but the national emergency is him, said Lou Frillman, who was a major fund-raising bundler for Mr. Obama's campaigns and is close to Mr. Biden. The vice president has all the qualities necessary to win, and I think he has all the qualities the country is going to so desperately need to bring us back from the edge.\n\nMost of all, Mr. Biden's allies contend, he would be the Democrat most likely to reclaim the battleground state voters who abandoned the party in 2016.\n\nIf you look at Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the labor folks who voted for Trump, they love him, former Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware said of Mr. Biden. He has a connection with these people.
As always with college aid and family financial behavior, there is a big difference between what the schools' formulas say about a family's ability to pay and what that family does in practice. The federal financial aid system, which governs things like Pell grants and federal loans — and which families access by filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or Fafsa — does not take home equity into account.\n\nA few hundred colleges, mostly the more expensive private ones, ask families applying for financial aid to fill out an additional form, known as the CSS Profile. It does ask about home equity. The schools take different approaches to baking that number into their overall equations for making financial aid offers, though many will also use your income to place a cap on the amount of home equity they factor in.\n\nIt isn't always easy to figure out how or if any individual college runs your home equity numbers, but if it doesn't provide a clear explanation on its financial aid website, you can try using the customized net price calculator that all schools provide. Start by entering all your information honestly, including your home equity. Then, do it again while setting your home equity to zero to see how or if the results differ.\n\nPaula Bishop, an accountant and financial aid consultant, has also assembled a spreadsheet listing many colleges' policies. You can find it and a detailed explanation of home equity financial aid formulas on the College Solution website, run by the educator and journalist Lynn O'Shaughnessy.\n\nIs it heartless for the schools to even consider home equity? After all, not every family has the income or creditworthiness to qualify for a home-equity loan or line of credit. Still, financial aid experts repeat the following like a mantra: An asset is an asset is an asset.
WINTER GARDEN, Fla. — Bryson DeChambeau raked one ball after another in front of him, making them soar a little higher in the air each time. Then he made them scream at a lower trajectory.\n\nBefore there was time to rub an eye and make sure the shot was real, DeChambeau hit another one. Same club. Same shot. The ball went into the sun and dropped again. Same place. Toss a beach blanket at his target, and all the balls would land atop it.\n\nDo you want them to go straighter? DeChambeau asked his audience with a wry chuckle.\n\nOn Tuesday, while Tiger Woods and a majority of the field at the PGA Tour's Farmers Insurance Open were preparing in San Diego, DeChambeau was thousands of miles away spreading the gospel of Cobra's new single-length irons — all the shaft lengths are 37½ inches — to hundreds of golf pros on a driving range at Orange County National Golf Club.\n\nThe PGA Merchandise Show is where every company promotes its latest and greatest innovations. Many touring pros from Bubba Watson to John Daly helped hawk products at the 64th annual gathering of more than 40,000 golf industry professionals, but only DeChambeau boasted that he was part of a movement that's going to literally revolutionize the golf industry.
The final stretch of President Trump's term kicked off on Monday with the Republican Party in disarray — and the president's media allies similarly divided over how to handle the crisis brought on by his fantasies of a rigged election.\n\nOn the Monday episode of the usually Trump-friendly Fox News morning show Fox & Friends, the host Brian Kilmeade challenged Mr. Trump's lawyers to produce any evidence of fraud. He also warned that pro-Trump protests planned for this week in Washington were the type of anarchy that doesn't work for anybody, Republicans or Democrats, in the big picture. His co-host Steve Doocy noted: So far, we haven't seen the evidence.\n\nOn the same program, Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican who has said she will object when Congress certifies the Electoral College vote on Wednesday, discussed the bombshell recording of a Saturday phone call in which President Trump tried to browbeat Brad Raffensperger, Georgia's secretary of state, into changing the state's vote count.
If you're using an old vase, wash it thoroughly because whatever's left over from your last batch of flowers has a lot of bacteria in it, said Chris Wien, a professor emeritus of horticulture at Cornell University. Those bacteria block water flow in the flowers' stems, causing your blooms to wilt sooner.\n\nRight away, cut off half an inch to an inch of the stems at a diagonal, using sharp scissors or a knife. Make sure to cut in a tub or under running water, which prevents air bubbles from getting into the stems and blocking the flow of water, said Amy Jo Detweiler, an associate professor of horticulture at Oregon State University. Remove any leaves or florets that would sit in the water, because those will cause bacterial buildup.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\nA Little Tender Loving Care\n\nIdeally, you should first put your flowers in water around 110 degrees (and your additives, of choice), and then keep the vase in a cool place for at least a couple of hours. This process, called hardening or conditioning, helps because warm water molecules move up the stems more quickly, while a cool environment minimizes water loss through the flowers' petals and leaves.\n\nThough you might intuitively want to place flowers by a window, direct sunlight can actually stress cut flowers more than helping them — remember, your blossoms are not really photosynthesizing anymore so they don't need sun to make food. Normal indoor lighting works just fine.\n\nChange the water at least once a week, recutting the stems and adding more preservative or food each time.\n\nWhat Didn't Work\n\nIn total, I kept my flowers for 10 days. Every day I randomly shuffled the flowers around, to ensure that positioning wouldn't explain the outcomes. On Day 5, I fully replaced the water and treatments for each vase.\n\nSo how did my treatments fare? In theory, soda, vinegar and aspirin should acidify the water so it more closely resembles the sap inside plant cells, helping the flowers take up fluid more easily. Vodka is thought to inhibit the production of ethylene, a gaseous hormone that causes flowers to mature and fruits to ripen. Copper, bleach and vinegar are antibacterial, and refrigerating should slow water loss and the breakdown of tissues.
Beauty of physique was never the point. Yet, to use a distinction made famous by the art historian Kenneth Clark in his classic study, The Nude, they were nude rather than naked. Something transcendent occurred that's truly rare when performers keep moving while in the altogether. (My mind turned especially to Degas's paintings of women in the bathroom.)\n\nAt times, the line of an arm or the through-the-body arc of a position became startlingly beautiful; and at times the strength of these women's movement — as when they forcefully rotated their upper bodies from the waist — was powerfully affecting. The early stages of Basketball didn't prepare you for the dance skills shown later — and that surprise was part of the work's spell. But it was drama rather than loveliness that kept Basketball so taut with interest.\n\nI was shocked only once — when Ms. Smith had dressed herself again (bra and skirt). Suddenly, she started to play a game of standard seduction, skillfully striking a series of conventionally flirty poses, as if to say Come hither and Don't you want me? This playacting at first felt dismaying, a denial of what had gone before; it was the only time they — deliberately — seemed psychologically distanced from each other.
Q. How do I turn off the password protection on my phone? It's annoying each time to re-enter it, and I realized that if I lose my phone and someone finds it, they won't have a way to contact me.\n\nA. If you added a passcode to your phone at some point, you can remove it by going into the device's settings and disabling the feature (after you enter the passcode to prove your identity). Keep in mind that doing so makes the personal information on your phone accessible to anyone who might find it — and could make the phone easier to steal if the wrong person takes it.\n\nOn an Android device, open the Settings icon on the home screen, select Security and then the Screen Lock option to get to the controls for turning off the passcode. (Steps may vary based on the version of Android you are using.)
HASTINGS, Australia — The evacuees walked down the gangway of the giant naval vessel to the dock, each carrying just a few items of luggage. Some held infants and others their dogs, whose legs were still shaky from the 20-hour voyage down the coast of Australia. They were weary, and their clothes smelled of smoke, but the terrible infernos were finally behind them.\n\nFour days after a bush fire ravaged the remote coastal town of Mallacoota, forcing people to shelter on the beach under blood-red skies, more than 1,000 stranded residents and vacationers arrived on Saturday in Hastings, a town near Melbourne.\n\nThe authorities said it was most likely the largest peacetime maritime rescue operation in Australia's history. It was also a symbol of a country in perpetual flight from danger during a catastrophic fire season — and the challenge the government faces in getting the blazes under control.\n\n[Update: 3 U.S. firefighters die in plane crash as Australia's blazes intensify.]\n\nSearing heat and afternoon winds propelled fires over large swaths of Australia on Saturday, adding to the devastation of a deadly fire season that has now claimed 24 lives. Thousands of people have been evacuated, while many towns and cities under threat were still smoldering from ferocious blazes that ripped through the countryside earlier in the week.
INDIANAPOLIS — Knicks Coach Jeff Hornacek has shuffled rotations like a deck of cards in recent weeks, searching for improved energy and chemistry even as victories have eluded his team.\n\nThe Knicks tried to give away another game Monday night against the Indiana Pacers. Their ball movement stalled, and a big lead evaporated. But Carmelo Anthony, whose ongoing saga with the team's front office seemed to recede for at least a few precious hours, drained a go-ahead jumper in the final minute to lift the Knicks to a 109-103 victory.\n\nIt was an important if ungraceful win for the Knicks (20-26), who arrived at Bankers Life Fieldhouse having lost 13 of their last 16 games. They will visit the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday night.\n\nThat's one of those ones where things aren't going well and you're losing close games, Hornacek said, and if you lose another one like that, the guys probably would've quit, called it a year.
Long before the name Matthew Specktor was inscribed on Samantha Culp's heart, it could be found beneath a short, sweet note inscribed on a page of Mr. Specktor's book, American Dream Machine, which she bought at a benefit at the Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles in June 2013.\n\nWith warmest wishes, Mr. Specktor, 54, wrote, and thanks, hope you enjoy.\n\nMs. Culp, 38, a Los Angeles-based freelance writer and producer, recalled suffering from jet lag that day as she had flown home two days earlier from Shanghai, where she spent a decade living and working as a journalist, art curator and consultant. She wrote for The South China Morning Post, and served as a consultant for cultural projects and institutions. I read his book and thought, 'Wow, this guy is an amazing writer,' said Ms. Culp, who graduated from Yale.\n\nHe had such apt observations of the strange beauty of our shared hometown, and also a similarly oblique connection to Hollywood that I do, growing up within it and seeing both its magic and its flaws, she said. It was exciting to discover a new writer whose work I really loved.\n\nMs. Culp was a producer for the Netflix crime documentary series Exhibit A in 2019 and for The Confession Tapes in 2017. Now in its second season, The Confession Tapes, which tells of wrongful convictions, was nominated for best episodic series by the International Documentary Association. She is also a fellow for the Power of Diversity Master Workshop run by the Producers Guild of America.
WASHINGTON — Things were on a clear course as far as President Trump's re-election campaign was concerned. The impeachment proceedings unfolding on Capitol Hill had proved to be a boost for volunteer recruitment and small-dollar donations. The year ended with a blockbuster jobs report and the unemployment rate falling to 3.5 percent, its lowest level since 1969.\n\nMr. Trump was ready to aggressively attack a Democratic field he and his advisers viewed as weak across the board. Few if any of the president's top campaign aides were looking to change the channel.\n\nBut Mr. Trump's decision to authorize the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, which he has described to friends and allies as a necessary action he was forced to take, has opened up a more uncertain political reality as the president enters an election year. That uncertainty was on display Tuesday night when Iran fired missiles at American forces in Iraq, in its first act of retaliation.\n\nSome advisers have highlighted to Mr. Trump the short-term lift the strike could give his re-election prospects, and his campaign has run nearly 800 distinct Facebook ads trumpeting the killing, according to Acronym, a progressive digital strategy group. The ads refer to Mr. Trump's leadership as commander in chief and direct voters to an Official Trump Military Survey, which acts as a portal to his campaign website.
If you have flooring you don't like — whether it's carpet, vinyl or unappealing wood — it can feel like there's no way to escape it, no matter how many rugs you pile on top. But if you have floors you love, walking across them can be a daily pleasure.\n\nThat's because the floor is the base upon which all other decorating decisions are built. Change your floors, and you change the character of your home. It's as simple as that.\n\nSo it's no surprise that new floors — specifically, hardwood floors — are at the top of many renovation wish lists. Not all wood floors, however, are equally appealing or appropriate for every space.
1. President Trump goes down to Georgia a day after the stunning revelation that he had asked its Republican secretary of state to find more than 11,000 votes to reverse the results of the election.\n\nGeorgia elections officials have received at least two requests for investigations into whether Mr. Trump has violated state laws on election interference. As of this afternoon, it appeared no such investigation had been opened. Above, Georgia's secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, who was told by Mr. Trump that he should change the vote count.\n\nThe president will appear tonight at a rally in Dalton, Ga., with two incumbent Republicans, Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, ahead of the state's two runoff races on Tuesday, which will determine which party controls the Senate. Here's what we know about the vote in Georgia so far.
212-731-1675, metmuseum.org\n\n'THE FACE OF DYNASTY: ROYAL CRESTS FROM WESTERN CAMEROON' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Sept. 3). Upstairs, the Michelangelos continue to knock 'em dead; downstairs, in the African wing, a show of just four commanding wooden crowns constitutes a blockbuster of its own. These massive wooden crests — in the form of stylized human faces with vast vertical brows — served as markers of royal power among the Bamileke peoples of the Cameroonian grasslands, and the Met's recent acquisition of an 18th-century specimen is joined here by three later examples, each featuring sharply protruding cheeks, broadly smiling mouths, and brows incised with involute geometric patterns. Ritual objects like these were decisive for the development of western modernist painting, and a Cameroonian crest was even shown at MoMA in the 1930s, as a sculpture divorced from ethnography. But these crests had legal and diplomatic significance as well as aesthetic appeal, and their anonymous African creators had a political understanding of art not so far from our own. (Farago)\n\nMILLENNIUM: LOWER MANHATTAN IN THE 1990S' at the Skyscraper Museum (through April). This plucky Battery Park institution transports us back to the years of Rudy Giuliani, Lauryn Hill and 128-kilobit modems to reveal the enduring urban legacy of a decade bookended by recession and terror. In the wake of the 1987 stock-market crash, landlords in the financial district rezoned their old skyscrapers for residential occupancy, and more than 20 towers were landmarked, including the ornate Standard Oil building at 26 Broadway and the home of Delmonico's at 56 Beaver Street. Battery Park City flowered; yuppies priced out of TriBeCa came down to Wall Street; a new Guggenheim, designed by a fresh-out-of-Bilbao Frank Gehry, nearly arose by South Street Seaport. From this distance the 1990s can seem almost like a golden age, not least given that, 16 years after 9/11, construction at the underwhelming new World Trade Center is still not finished. (Farago)\n\n212-945-6324, skyscraper.org\n\n'MICHELANGELO: DIVINE DRAFTSMAN AND DESIGNER,' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Feb. 12). A monument to a monument. With 133 drawings by the beyond-famous artist on loan from some 50 front-rank collections, this show is a curatorial coup and an art historical tour de force: a panoptic view of a titanic career as recorded in the most fragile of media: paper, chalk and ink. And it demands that you be fully present. Drawing is more than a graphic experience; it's a textural one, about the pressure of crayon and pen on a page; the subliminal fade and focus of lines; the weave and shadow-creating swells of surfaces. These are effects that can't be captured by a smartphone.\n\n(Holland Cotter)\n\n212-535-7710, metmuseum.org\n\n'THE VIETNAM WAR: 1945-1975' at the New-York Historical Society (through April 22). In contrast to the PBS series The Vietnam War, this jammed exhibition delivers historical data, a lot of it, quick-and-dirty, through labels, film clips, audio bytes and objects, some of which fall under a broad definition of art. Along with paintings by contemporary Vietnamese artists, there's graffiti-style drawing on combat helmets and Zippo lighters, and period design in album covers and protest posters. Words and images work together in murals labeled Home Front and War Front that put you in the middle of the war's primary issues and events. (Cotter)\n\n212-873-3400, nyhistory.org\n\nLast Chance\n\n'LOUISE BOURGEOIS: AN UNFOLDING PORTRAIT' at the Museum of Modern Art (through Jan. 28). The artist's frequently handworked prints provide the through line in this compact yet vivid survey. Organized thematically, it moves over six decades in light, circling rhythms, revisiting primordial themes of family and betrayal while incorporating occasional paintings and several sculptures. Ms. Bourgeois's final efforts resemble an environmental painting, tinged with love and blood. (Smith)
Meanwhile, legalization advocates have squelched discussion of the serious mental health risks of marijuana and THC, the chemical responsible for the drug's psychoactive effects. As I have seen firsthand in writing a book about cannabis, anyone who raises those concerns may be mocked as a modern-day believer in Reefer Madness, the notorious 1936 movie that portrays young people descending into insanity and violence after smoking marijuana.\n\nA strange disconnect has resulted.\n\nWith large studies in peer-reviewed journals showing that marijuana increases the risk of psychosis and schizophrenia, the scientific literature around the drug is far more negative than it was 20 years ago. Comparing two major reports from the National Academy of Medicine , the nonprofit group that advises the federal government on health and medicine, makes the difference clear.\n\nIn a report in 1999, the academy (then called the Institute of Medicine) reported that the association between marijuana and schizophrenia is not well understood. It even suggested the drug might help some people with schizophrenia. But in its next major report on marijuana, released in 2017, the academy reached a very different conclusion:  Cannabis use is likely to increase the risk of schizophrenia and other psychoses; the higher the use, the greater the risk.\n\nYet the change in the scientific consensus has gone unnoticed. Americans in general are far more likely to believe the drug is safe, and even medically beneficial, than they once were. As a result, support for legalization has doubled since 1999.\n\nMaking matters worse, the ways Americans use cannabis are changing in ways that further increase its risks.
Tennis got more than its share of undesirable events in 2016: Roger Federer's first surgery, Maria Sharapova's suspension for a doping violation, the knife attack on Petra Kvitova that left the future of her career in doubt.\n\nBut the sport also checked some long-empty boxes. Novak Djokovic won his first French Open to become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold all four major trophies at the same time. Serena Williams tied Steffi Graf's record for Grand Slam singles titles in the Open era by winning her 22nd. Argentina finally won its first Davis Cup, and Andy Murray became Sir Andy Murray, even if he sounded as if he could have happily waited quite a bit longer for the honor.\n\nWith the new season beginning in earnest with the Australian Open this week, what might 2017 bring?\n\nOne longtime observer's annual wish list:\n\nTennis needs to follow the lead of other sports and get better at prologue. A draw is too good an opportunity to waste, but for now, the major events are not taking full advantage. There should be more spectacle and, above all, more suspense. Consider the buzz generated by the draws for soccer's World Cup or the Champions League. Or by the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament selections in the United States.\n\nProfessional tennis can do better. At the Grand Slam events, cutting back to 16 seeds in singles from the current 32 would be the boldest way forward. There were 16 until 2001, when the United States Open successfully pushed for 32, with an eye toward increasing the chances that stars would still be in contention on the first weekend, when major television coverage then kicked in. The change was originally linked to an agreement to use surface-based seeding, but at this stage surface-based seeding exists only to a limited degree at Wimbledon, yet the 32 seeds remain.
Change is in the air at Caramoor, the summer music festival in Westchester, which said on Monday that its coming season would move both forward and backward in time — giving new prominence to 21st-century composers while replacing its respected bel canto opera offerings with earlier operas from the Classical and Baroque periods.\n\nThis summer's offerings will feature music by 22 living composers; the Caramoor debuts of new music ensembles including the Kronos Quartet and So Percussion; and a free outdoor performance of John Luther Adams's Inuksuit. It is the first Caramoor summer programmed by Kathy Schuman, the festival's new vice president for artistic programming and a former artistic administrator at Carnegie Hall.\n\nWhile we always love to welcome back favorites, I want to make sure we're staying current and keeping up with today's most exciting musicians and composers, she said in a statement.\n\nThe operatic landscape is shifting at the festival, which is held on a former estate in Katonah, N.Y. The festival ended its Bel Canto at Caramoor program last summer after 20 years; the organizer of that series, Will Crutchfield, is reinventing it as Teatro Nuovo at Purchase College, part of the State University of New York.
Q. A previous column explained how to download specific files from Google Photos, but I need to know how to upload a specific album to share with a family group. How do I do this?\n\nA. Google Photos can be set to automatically back up all the pictures you take on your smartphone or copy to your computer, so if you have this setting enabled, the pictures have already been uploaded to the online storage space that comes with your Google Account. You just need to select and sort the photos into the album you want to share before sending out a link to the family.\n\nEven if you are not using the automatic backup feature, you can manually upload selected photos you want to share online. If you have a folder of images on your computer that you want to upload to Google Photos through your web browser, log in at https://photos.google.com and drag pictures onto the browser window to transfer them. (As an alternative, you can click the Upload button at the top of the screen and navigate to the folder on your computer to add them.)
LONDON — President Trump's push for a border wall hints at a problem that populist leaders are facing across the Western world.\n\nAfter a year of setbacks, populist leaders and parties are trying to rejuvenate their fortunes by revitalizing the sense of crisis on which they thrive. But as with Mr. Trump's demand for a border wall — which has brought a two-week government shutdown — this may say more about populism's weakness than its strength.\n\nImmigration and terrorism crises, which aided populism's world-shaking rise in 2016, have waned. Populists have faced disappointing election results in Germany, the United States and even Poland, shattering the image of the movement's inevitability and its claims to represent true popular will.\n\nThe West's populist leaders and parties have grown defensive, retreating into ever-starker messages of us-versus-them. The approach excites their most dedicated followers. But it can be risky, forcing voters to pick sides at a moment when the populist right holds declining appeal.
Kuwait, which announced the opening on Monday, has also been serving as a mediator. Its foreign minister, Sheikh Ahmad Nasser al-Mohammad al-Sabah, said in a televised statement that the agreement between Saudi Arabi and Qatar would be a new page in brotherly relations.\n\nOfficials from Saudi Arabia did not immediately confirm that there was an agreement between the two countries.\n\nThe Gulf countries' decision in 2017 to cut ties with Qatar, severing diplomatic relations and suspending land, air and sea travel, forced the tiny monarchy into immediate crisis. Trade and commerce that used to flow smoothly around the Gulf fell apart; some families were abruptly left unable to see relatives who lived on the other side of the divide; thousands of people had to leave their homes practically overnight to return to Qatar or the other countries.\n\nSince then, however, Qatar has leaned on its enormous natural gas wealth to become more self-sufficient and build stronger relationships with both Iran and Turkey, another foe of the blockading countries, the United Arab Emirates in particular.\n\nCombined with the pressure from Washington, the path for negotiations grew clearer in recent months, with officials on both sides signaling that talks were progressing. And analysts said Saudi Arabia may have seen mending the break as a way to begin the kingdom's relationship with the incoming Biden administration, which has threatened to take a tougher line on Saudi Arabia, on a positive note.\n\nBut some analysts say there is little to suggest Qatar will change its behavior when it comes to the practices that most frustrate its neighbors — neither fully reining in the megaphone it uses to spread its message and pester its enemies, the Al Jazeera media network, nor pulling away from Iran and Turkey.\n\nGetting Qatar to modify its relationship with Turkey may prove wishful thinking, Hussein Ibish, an analyst at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, wrote in December. Given the number of issues likely to remain unresolved, there is significant potential for future discord and perhaps another crisis over Qatari policies sometime in the foreseeable future.
To the Editor:\n\nRe Will Pence Do the Right Thing?, by Neal K. Katyal and John Monsky (Op-Ed, Dec. 30):\n\nIt is truly sad that Mr. Katyal and Mr. Monsky felt compelled to educate us and to question whether Vice President Mike Pence will do the right thing and simply preside over the counting of the electoral votes. Is this what our nation has come to — wondering whether the vice president will abide by the people's will or try to subvert it to please his megalomaniac boss?\n\nThe fact that we even have to think and talk about this points to the corrosive actions by Donald Trump, his congressional Republican allies and the 74 million people who voted for him. Collectively, they are all responsible for nearly destroying our democracy.\n\nFortunately for us, as the authors write, any effort to change the vote is doomed to fail. Come Jan. 20, Joe Biden will be sworn as our next president, and hopefully Trumpism will end up in the dustpan of history.\n\nMichael Hadjiargyrou\n\nCenterport, N.Y.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nHere's my bet: Vice President Mike Pence will not do the right thing but instead will produce some tenuous rationale to avoid presiding over the electoral vote count on Jan. 6. Senator Charles Grassley, president pro tempore, a Republican who has already acknowledged Joe Biden's victory, will properly step in as presiding officer. The count will proceed and will be officially announced by Mr. Grassley.
Q. What is purgeable storage? I couldn't understand the explanation in the Community Discussion at Apple Support on this.\n\nA. In a nutshell, purgeable storage is hard-drive space the Mac can make available in an emergency — by automatically deleting files that you can always download again. For example, if you have the purge setting turned on and fill up your internal drive, leaving the system no space to work, the Mac will dump purchased iTunes videos. This is because you can freely download the material again later after you have deleted other files from the computer.\n\nThe file-purge option is part of the macOS Sierra system, and it can be helpful for Mac models with smaller-capacity internal flash drives. However, you need to turn on the Optimize Mac Storage setting to see the amount of space you regain from files the Mac considers worthy of purging in a pinch.\n\nImage When you elect to optimize the storage space, macOS Sierra displays an alert that explains which files will be purged if the computer's drive gets too full.\n\n\n\nCredit... The New York Times\n\nTo turn on the setting, go to the Apple menu in the top-left corner of the screen and choose About This Mac. In the box of system information that opens, click the Storage tab. The Storage screen displays a colored bar that illustrates the amount of hard-drive space taken up by various types of files on the computer, like Apps and Mail.
And while running big deficits might have once stoked fears about inflation — as too many dollars chased too few goods — price gains have been too low for comfort for years. Add to that the emergency needs prompted by the pandemic, and even the Fed's leader, who had long warned about the nation's debt load, has said this is a reasonable time to spend money.\n\nAs a general rule, it is important to be on a sustainable fiscal path, the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, a Republican, said at a news conference last month. From my way of thinking and many others', the time to focus on that is when the economy is strong and when unemployment is low, and taxes are, you know, are pouring in.\n\nThe political rethinking about the deficit — especially in times of economic weakness — is a stark change from earlier eras. In the 1990s, President Bill Clinton highlighted his success in cutting the deficit and creating a budget surplus as a political achievement for Democrats. Concerns about excessive federal spending and the national debt also helped fuel the ascent of the Tea Party in the late 2000s, giving rise to a new breed of Republican who succeeded in ushering in austere spending caps that continued to bedevil lawmakers. But after 2014, Republicans have joined Democrats in waiving those caps, and a bipartisan, bicameral deal struck in 2019 ensures their expiration this year.\n\nBut even as some economists and politicians become more comfortable with high public debt levels, others warn that they could create vulnerabilities down the road. If interest rates increase, it could cost the government more to keep up with those payments each year — either leaving less for other types of spending or requiring Congress to pile on an ever-growing debt load to keep up.\n\nRepublicans have often worried out loud about the deficit while passing policies that will have the effect of expanding it. For instance, tax cuts that cleared Congress earlier in Mr. Trump's administration were expected to increase the deficit by $1.9 trillion in the decade through 2028, based on a Congressional Budget Office analysis.\n\nBut the party has generally invoked fiscal responsibility to block bigger spending programs.\n\nRepublicans are happy to run up the deficit to cut taxes, but not happy to run up the deficit to spend more, said Michael Strain, the director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute.
The Carol Burnett Award is given to someone who like its namesake, Carol Burnett, has given us decades of laughter, tears and a new sense of what's possible. So I would like to read a list of things that tonight's recipient, Ellen DeGeneres, has personally given me. And some of these are spiritual and some of them are pieces of clothing I got to keep after doing impressions of her on her talk show: a road map for a way to be funny that is grounded in an expression of joy; two pairs of Stan Smith sneakers (that's one of the clothes ones); a desire to bring everyone together by laughing about the things we have in common; my best collared shirts; a sense of self.\n\nI have to explain that one more: In 1997, when Ellen's sitcom was in the height of its popularity, I was in my mother's basement lifting weights in front of the mirror and thinking, Am I gay? And I was, and I still am. But that's a very scary thing to suddenly know about yourself. It's sort of like doing 23andMe, and discovering that you have alien DNA. And the only thing that made it less scary was seeing Ellen on TV.\n\nShe risked her entire life and her entire career in order to tell the truth, and she suffered greatly for it. Of course, attitudes change, but only because brave people like Ellen jump into the fire to make them change. And if I hadn't seen her on TV, I would have thought, I could never be on TV. They don't let L.G.B.T. people on TV. And more than that, I would have gone on thinking that I was an alien and that I maybe didn't even have a right to be here. So thank you, Ellen, for giving me a shot. A shot at a good life, and thank you also for the sweater with a picture of the baby goat on it.
archived recording I was at a dinner in New York City one night with a bunch of friends, and I sat down at the table at an empty seat. And he came up behind me and said, I think you're in my seat. And I recognized him immediately.\n\n[music]\n\narchived recording 1 I was a very young actor new to Los Angeles. archived recording 2 It was my first job also out of college, and I was 24 years old. My passion all my life was to work in the film industry. archived recording 3 And he was completely — I mean, he's really charming when he wants to be. archived recording 4 We had been in touch about an audition for a Quentin Tarantino film, and that's when I met with him at the Peninsula. archived recording 5 He had his assistant call me at the last minute and say, Harvey can't meet you in the lobby. Harvey can't meet you in the cafe. Can you go up to his office, his hotel suite? archived recording 6 That's when he said, well, come and see me at my hotel. archived recording 7 And he told me, O.K., we're going to my room now. archived recording 8 I opened the door, and he just went straight into my bedroom. archived recording 9 He wanted to know if I was cool and if we were friends, and he just wanted to relax with me. archived recording 10 After some normal conversation — archived recording 11 He said, how about you just give me a massage? archived recording 12 He asked me if I'd give him a massage. archived recording 13 He asked me to give him massage. archived recording 14 Which I declined. archived recording 15 And I thought it would end there, but that's when he blocked the exit for me. archived recording 16 His whole affect changed, and he looked like a predator. archived recording 17 I just remember that feeling of having to fight off an invader. archived recording 18 If I would try to fight myself away from him, he would then move around to a place where he could block me in somewhere. And he's a big individual. archived recording 19 He just is very dominant, persuasive. archived recording 20 He's a very big guy. archived recording 21 He backed me into a dark room. archived recording 22 He led me to his bathroom. archived recording 23 He pushed me back against the bed. archived recording 24 Pleading that I just watch him masturbate. archived recording 25 He held me down, and he forced oral sex on me. archived recording 26 And I was petrified and terrified. archived recording 27 I pulled my arm away, finally, and headed to the door. He started following me and telling me that I could get a three-picture deal and that he would greenlight my script. But I had to watch him masturbate. archived recording 28 A nightmare — literally a nightmare.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe story of Harvey Weinstein was a story of patterns. Dozens of women — more than 80 — all telling a very familiar and eerily similar story of abuse and harassment by the famed movie producer. But this week, two years after that pattern of allegations was first reported in The Times by my colleagues Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, there are just two women at the center of the criminal case against him as his trial opens in Manhattan. Today, in Part 1, Megan Twohey on how we got from 80 to 2. It's Thursday, January 9. Megan, help us understand how, after these dozens of allegations against Harvey Weinstein, the charges that he's facing in this trial center on just two women.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nWell, after we broke our first Harvey Weinstein story, and then Ronan Farrow published his first story in The New Yorker, there were these dozens of women who came forward with accusations.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd there were three jurisdictions —\n\narchived recording Some major developments in the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment scandal, New York —\n\nmegan twohey\n\n— New York —\n\narchived recording — police say they are now investigating rape allegations —\n\nmegan twohey\n\n— Los Angeles —\n\narchived recording The L.A. County district attorney's office is determining if Weinstein should be charged.\n\nmegan twohey\n\n— and London —\n\narchived recording And the BBC is reporting police in England are now investigating an allegation against him as well.\n\nmegan twohey\n\n— that responded by launching criminal investigations. And that's because the vast majority of allegations that were coming out were centered in those three jurisdictions. But even as they launched these criminal investigations, there were questions about whether or not they would be able to bring criminal charges.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd why would that be, given the overwhelming number of these allegations that are now surfacing?\n\nmegan twohey\n\nWell, there are several reasons that explain that. First, a lot of these allegations were of inappropriate behavior, sexual harassment, which is illegal under civil law, but it's not a sex crime. You're never going to be prosecuted for it. Other allegations of actual sex crimes fell outside the statute of limitations for prosecution. And there were women who had really serious allegations who were reluctant to participate in a criminal investigation, let alone a prosecution. But from the beginning, New York, in particular, was very intent on bringing a prosecution.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd why is that?\n\nmegan twohey\n\nWell, that's because they had actually investigated Harvey Weinstein once before in 2015. That was the year that a model from Italy walked into a New York City police precinct and reported that Harvey Weinstein had groped her breast and tried to force his hand up her skirt during a work meeting at his office. And she worked closely with the police at that time. She actually wore a wire into a follow-up meeting with Weinstein that captured what sounded like a confession to at least some of what she had alleged.\n\narchived recording (ambra battilana gutierrez) What do we have to do here? archived recording (harvey weinstein) Nothing. I'm going to take a shower. You sit there and have a drink, water. archived recording (ambra battilana gutierrez) I don't drink. Can I stay on the bar? archived recording (harvey weinstein) No, you must come here now. archived recording (ambra battilana gutierrez) No. archived recording (harvey weinstein) Please? archived recording (ambra battilana gutierrez) No, I don't want to. archived recording (harvey weinstein) I'm not doing anything with you, I promise. archived recording (ambra battilana gutierrez) I know. archived recording (harvey weinstein) Now you're embarrassing me. archived recording (ambra battilana gutierrez) I'm sorry. I cannot. archived recording (harvey weinstein) No, come in here. archived recording (ambra battilana gutierrez) No, yesterday was kind of aggressive for me. archived recording (harvey weinstein) I know. archived recording (ambra battilana gutierrez) I need to know a person to be touched. archived recording (harvey weinstein) I won't do a thing. Please. I swear I won't. Just sit with me. Don't embarrass me in the hotel. I'm here all the time. Sit with me. I promise — archived recording (ambra battilana gutierrez) I know, but I don't want to. archived recording (harvey weinstein) Please sit there. Please. One minute. I ask you — archived recording (ambra battilana gutierrez) No, I can't. archived recording (harvey weinstein) Go to the bathroom. archived recording (ambra battilana gutierrez) Please, I don't want to do something I don't want to. archived recording (harvey weinstein) Go to the bath — hey, come here. Listen to me. archived recording (ambra battilana gutierrez) I want to go downstairs. archived recording (harvey weinstein) I'm not going to do anything, and you'll never see me again after this, O.K.? That's it. If you embarrass me in this hotel where I'm staying — archived recording (ambra battilana gutierrez) I'm not embarrassing you. archived recording (harvey weinstein) Just walk — archived recording (ambra battilana gutierrez) It's just that I don't feel comfortable. archived recording (harvey weinstein) Honey, don't have a fight with me in the hallway. archived recording (ambra battilana gutierrez) It's not nothing, it's — archived recording (harvey weinstein) Please, I am not going to do anything. I swear on my children. Please, come in. On everything. I'm a famous guy. archived recording (ambra battilana gutierrez) I'm feeling very uncomfortable right now. archived recording (harvey weinstein) Please come in now. And one minute. And if you want to leave when the guy comes with my jacket, you can go. archived recording (ambra battilana gutierrez) Why yesterday you touch my breast? archived recording (harvey weinstein) No, please. I'm sorry. Just come on in. I'm used to that. Come on — archived recording (ambra battilana gutierrez) You're used to that? archived recording (harvey weinstein) Yes, come in. archived recording (ambra battilana gutierrez) No, but I'm not used to that. archived recording (harvey weinstein) I won't do it again. Come on. Sit here. Sit here for a minute, please.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nBut in spite of that recording and the woman wanting them to prosecute, the district attorney's office declined to bring charges against Weinstein at that time. They said that they felt like a shifting account that she had provided about an alleged sexual assault in Italy years earlier would make her seem not credible on the witness stand. So then, in 2017, as the Harvey Weinstein story is exploding, this case comes back into public focus.\n\narchived recording D.A. Cyrus Vance Jr. was mobbed by reporters, who asked whether Weinstein's wealth and fame influenced his decision not to press charges.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nThere are so many questions about Cy Vance, the Manhattan district attorney, and why he didn't prosecute Harvey Weinstein in 2015.\n\narchived recording D.A. Vance, did you not have the evidence you need? Was this not a slam-dunk case? archived recording (cyrus vance jr.) If we had a case that we felt we could prosecute, and my experts felt we could prosecute, against Harvey Weinstein, we would have.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nA lot of people are accusing him, saying that he had succumbed to the power and influence of Weinstein —\n\narchived recording Critics say financial contributions by Weinstein's lawyers to Vance's campaign could have played a role in the D.A.'s decision.\n\nmegan twohey\n\n— and had allowed this alleged predator to slip through the cracks.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd so that is what left New York in a position, I guess, where, by 2017, they feel all this pressure to aggressively pursue these new allegations against Weinstein?\n\nmegan twohey\n\nThey're feeling a lot of pressure. And so even with all of those challenges to bringing a sex crimes charge, they are on the hunt for an allegation that will allow them to make an arrest.\n\nmegan twohey I'm going to put my headset on. lucia evans Oh, yeah. Megan, I just have some notes on my phone I'm just going to, like, keep open if I need them. megan twohey Sure, totally.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd so they quickly zoom in on this account of a sexual assault from 2004 that had been made in Ronan Farrow's New Yorker article by a woman named Lucia Evans.\n\nmegan twohey Just please — lucia evans O.K. megan twohey — please feel free to read at your — lucia evans Lucia Stoller, now Lucia Evans, was approached by Weinstein at Cipriani Upstairs, a club in New York, in 2004, the summer before her senior year at Middlebury College. Evans, who is now a marketing consultant, wanted to be an actress, and although she had heard rumors about Weinstein, she let him have her number. Weinstein began calling her late at night, or having his assistant call her, asking to meet. She declined, but said that she would do readings during the day for a casting executive. Before long, an assistant called to set up a daytime meeting at the Miramax office in Tribeca, first with Weinstein and then with a casting executive, who was a woman. I was, like, Oh, a woman. Great. I feel safe, Evans said. When Evans arrived for the meeting, the building was full of people. She was led to an office with exercise equipment in it and takeout boxes on the floor. Weinstein was there, alone. Weinstein told her that she'd be great in Project Runway, — the show, which Weinstein helped produce — but only if she lost weight. At that point, after that, is when he assaulted me, Evans said. He forced me to perform oral sex on him.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nWhat happened next, according to Lucia, is that Weinstein pulled his penis out of his pants, that he pulled her head down onto it. She said that she said over and over she didn't want to do this, to stop. And she said that Weinstein overpowered her.\n\nlucia evans I just sort of gave up.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo a clear allegation of a sex crime.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nA clear allegation of a sex crime and also one that falls within the statute of limitations — exactly what New York is looking for. And so within hours of that story being published, New York detectives are trying to find Lucia.\n\nlucia evans So a lot of different things happened very quickly, and it was very overwhelming. The N.Y.P.D. showed up at my parents' house. They live in upstate New York. And they said, Lucia has a prosecutable charge. And they were like, what are you talking about, you know? They were just kind of overwhelmed anyway, you know? And they said, we're worried about her safety, and we — where does she live? We want to talk to her.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nYeah.\n\nlucia evans And so they actually drove through the night to come to D.C. and showed up at my door the next morning. I was still in my pajamas, I think. So I just stayed in my pajamas that whole time and just drank a whole pot of coffee — a whole pot to myself. I just kept drinking coffee and —\n\nmegan twohey\n\nShe says that they told her immediately that they wanted her to participate in the criminal investigation.\n\nlucia evans They immediately wanted me to go on the record, because they said I was the only one that could put him in jail. megan twohey And how are you feeling in this moment? Are you feeling scared? Are you feeling nervous? Are you feeling — what is it like when, you know, several detectives show up at your door and come into your living room? lucia evans Yeah, I mean, it was the most surreal thing. I never conceived of this happening. I was one of the few, or maybe the only, people in that article that wasn't an actress, you know? And it was frightening to me, because I didn't do this for the press, obviously. I didn't do this for any kind of fame or fortune. And so I think I was scared for a few reasons. I was nervous about what it could do to my family, to — you know, I mean, I know what criminal proceedings can be like. I've seen a bunch of movies, and I've watched a lot of court TV. It's like, I know how this could go. And I think that the narrative has always been that victims are torn apart on the stand. And why would you do that to yourself? Why would you put yourself or your family through that? And all these things are kind of just running through my mind. And they were positioning it as a very empowering thing — like, oh, you can change society forever. You can change the laws. And of course, that made me a little excited, too. I was like, wow, you know, I would absolutely love to influence the law, and to empower victims, and to put him in jail. Like, that would be an incredible feeling, but also tempering that with my more rational side. Like, are you serious? First of all, I can't be the only one that can put him in jail. And also, you need to give me time to process this, you know? megan twohey So you finish your pot of coffee. lucia evans Yes. megan twohey You finish this conversation with them. How does it end? How do you guys part after that? lucia evans So they told us — my husband, who was there, and myself — to get out of town for a few weeks.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nThey tell her that they think that she's in danger and that Harvey Weinstein and any of his kind of associates could potentially come after her. So they really want to relocate her — officially relocate her to a safe location.\n\nlucia evans They didn't think I was safe there, just because I was easily traceable. And they were worried about my safety at that point, since I was the only one that could put him in jail, quote, unquote, that we knew of.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd so she and her husband packed their bags and moved into this house for two weeks, closer to New York City, as they decided what they were going to do next.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm. And what did she do?\n\nmegan twohey\n\nWell, she started weighing her options. She starts meeting with a variety of lawyers. And as she tells it, many of those lawyers are actually discouraging her from participating in the criminal case, telling her that she would be much better off just seeking to strike an out-of-court — like, basically a private out-of-court civil settlement with Weinstein in which she would receive money.\n\nlucia evans I met with lawyers who said, forget the criminal case. Just file a civil suit, you know what I mean? And that didn't feel right to me. And I didn't even know what that would entail at the time.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd why are the lawyers telling her that the civil route is better than this criminal prosecution?\n\nmegan twohey\n\nThey basically tell her that it's going to play out the way that she's seen it depicted on all those TV shows.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd that means it's going to be really ugly.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nYeah, it's going to be really ugly.\n\nlucia evans The narratives I heard the most often were, it's going to be a long, drawn-out, painful process. They're going to tear apart your background, your life. They're going to talk to everyone you've ever worked with, everyone you've ever been in a relationship with, find anything they can to discredit you. And it's hard on you. It's hard on your family. They'll go through your trash and find every single thing you've ever done in the past, and blow it up out of proportion, and shame you, and just ruin your life, basically. I just had this vision of myself just being left with nothing on the street. That's the narrative that I think still exists, but also that I was hearing at the time. It's really scary to hear over and over, and it starts to kind of become part of you. And you start to think, oh, this is what will happen if I do this, you know? How can you not feel like that?\n\nmegan twohey\n\nSo she's put off by these lawyers. And as she tells it, they're not the only people who are counseling her against participating in the criminal case. She says that she has friends and family members who are saying the same thing.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDon't do it.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nDon't do it.\n\nlucia evans The narrative that I heard a lot was, you've already done enough — and in a good way, not a negative way at all. But you've already done so much. Look at — the movement was starting to pick up steam at that point. Like, look at what you helped to reignite?\n\nmegan twohey\n\nYou did your part. You participated in the journalism, some of these first stories that are helping to ignite the #MeToo movement. You've done enough. But as Lucia tells it, something keeps pulling at her.\n\nlucia evans The criminal case was really kind of calling my name in a way right from the beginning, and I wanted to understand what that would be like. And I just wanted to be able to have the option to pursue it without having a lawyer say, it's not right for you. Don't do it. megan twohey And when you say that the criminal case was calling to you from the beginning, what do you mean? lucia evans I wanted this to continue to mean something to me and to mean something for other people. And it always kind of felt right to me deep down. And even though I struggled with it for so many months, and it was so hard to decide what to do, I just felt like it was the right thing to do, ultimately.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nSo she decides to meet with the prosecutor's office, which is a significant step, because the prosecutors are ultimately the ones who will decide whether or not to bring charges. And the lead prosecutor on the Weinstein case at the time was a woman named Maxine Rosenthal. And as Lucia tells it, she did not have a good experience with her.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhy?\n\nlucia evans I didn't feel comfortable talking to her, and I didn't have a lot of confidence in it. megan twohey What do you mean by that? What was — lucia evans I just remember there was one thing that she said that made me very uncomfortable. She referred to me and the other survivors as Harvey's girls. And at that point, I think I was just so blown away by that statement and just horrified that she could ever say that about — it doesn't even need an explanation about why that's so horrifying to say.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nSo listen, I can't speak to this particular prosecutor's conduct. What I can tell you is that she's a veteran sex crimes prosecutor who's known for being very hard-nosed and that Lucia wasn't the only person who was complaining about her. There were complaints coming from the police, from victims' rights advocates that she was not sensitive and that she was moving too slowly. I can't speak to whether or not those complaints were valid, but Rosenthal's boss is Cy Vance, the Manhattan prosecutor, the same one who had been criticized for not prosecuting Weinstein in 2015. And he decides that he's going to take Rosenthal off the case. And he puts in her place a veteran homicide prosecutor. Her name is Joan Illuzzi, and she's also known for being tough.\n\nlucia evans Joan would ask me tough questions, but I still felt good about it.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nBut Lucia says that she feels like she's on her side, that she's being tough to toughen her up.\n\nlucia evans She was definitely the bad cop, and I think she had to be, because she wanted to prepare me, right? But I felt like she respected me in a way that I didn't feel like I felt from Maxine. And I knew what she was doing. I was like, well, I want to be prepared for this trial. So if you think you have to be tough on me, that's totally fine.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nSo that's important for Lucia. And in another significant development, a new woman, a new accuser, is added to the criminal case.\n\nlucia evans Another thing that made me feel comfortable was the fact that there would be one other person who was involved. And that made me feel a lot more comfortable. Initially, it was just me for a long time. It just gave me a little more sense of community and just like I wasn't doing it alone.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd so finally, at this point, Lucia is ready to make a decision.\n\nlucia evans I went back home to D.C. And a while earlier, I made this list of all the reasons why I should do it and all the reasons why I shouldn't do it. And all the reasons why I shouldn't do it — I mean, there were so many reasons — fear for my safety, fear for my family, my reputation, my career — everything. All these things would just be ruined. And then on the other side, I had just written, because it feels right. I didn't really have much else to write on that side. It did feel like I could, at the very least, hopefully, put him in jail, this person that had assaulted so many people and harassed so many people. And I couldn't say no to the chance to do that, ultimately. This is the right thing to do. I'm going to do it.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nShe's in. She's willing to be part of criminal charges.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo at this point, New York is able to do what it's been trying to do ever since these allegations first came out.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nYes.\n\narchived recording (speaker 1) Are you sorry, Harvey? archived recording (speaker 2) Harvey, Harvey! archived recording (speaker 3) — who've accused you, Mr. Weinstein? archived recording (speaker 4) Harvey, you got anything to say?\n\nmegan twohey\n\nIn May of 2018, seven months after the police had first shown up on the door of Lucia's home, prosecutors bring charges here in New York against Harvey Weinstein. They charge him with a criminal sex act stemming from the encounter with Lucia. And they also charge him with rape stemming from the encounter with the second woman in the criminal case.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe'll be right back. So Megan, what happens after these charges against Weinstein are actually filed?\n\nmegan twohey\n\nLaw enforcement officials continue to build out this case, as they start to prepare to go to court. And Lucia says that she is, for the most part, feeling good about the process. But even with this new prosecutor in place, she says that she's confused about some aspects of what's going on.\n\nlucia evans They didn't ask me for a full list of people I had told until months and months in. I would think that you kind of start with, who have you talked to? Who knows about this? And I told them some people that either I had told, or knew of me going to the meeting with him, or something to that respect.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nShe says that she is confused by the fact that law enforcement officials are not reaching out to more of the potential witnesses for her charge — she says that she had provided them with a list of names, people in whom she had confided about the alleged attack — and that, even at this stage of the investigation, that they have not reached out to all of those people to talk to them. This is also a case that involves both prosecutors and the police. And she says that she's struck by the fact that they don't seem to be in sync.\n\nlucia evans So it seemed to be a very disjointed process with the D.A. and the N.Y.P.D. And they didn't seem to communicate very well right from the beginning and all the way through my time with them. So — megan twohey What do you mean by that, that the police and the prosecutors weren't communicating — lucia evans Yeah — megan twohey — effectively? lucia evans It just seemed like some things I had told to the police, the prosecutors weren't aware of or didn't remember when they would talk to me. They didn't even interview my husband until — they never did, actually. They never talked to my husband.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMegan, what's the significance of them not talking to her husband, exactly?\n\nmegan twohey\n\nWell, I mean, think about it. If you are trying to build a case, if you're trying to shore it up, presumably, you're going to want to talk to the people closest to that alleged victim, the people who have the most knowledge about her. So for law enforcement officials to have not talked to her husband at this point seems a little weird to her. But she says that she's not giving it that much thought. And then, one day in October 2018, Lucia is on a work trip in Hong Kong when she gets a call from her lawyer.\n\nlucia evans I was about to give a huge marketing presentation to a group of executives, and then I get a call from my lawyer saying that they were going to drop my charge.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nThe prosecutor's office contacted her attorney and said that there was new information that had come to light, and that they were preparing to drop her charge.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nYeah. And she says that she can't even process it right at that point, because she's got to give that work presentation.\n\nlucia evans I just had to shut off my emotions and just try to just pull myself together right after that, and pretend that it didn't happen. I told my family, and then I got on a flight back home with no Wi-Fi, thank goodness, and fell asleep. And when I woke up, I was being destroyed in the press. archived recording 1 We begin with one of the sex assault charges against disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, tonight, dropped. archived recording 2 Lucia Evans claims Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him in 2004. But new information revealed yesterday casts doubt on Evans's story. archived recording 3 The single charge was dropped after the Manhattan district attorney's office recently discovered new evidence from a witness that discounts Lucia Evans's previous accusations —\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd so as Lucia is learning about her charge being dropped, so, too, is the public. And in a lot of those news stories, it's presented as contradictory evidence that's come to light, evidence that undermines her allegation. Not surprisingly, Weinstein and his defense team seize on this new twist.\n\narchived recording His attorney, Benjamin Brafman, says he believes Evans lied about what happened. archived recording (benjamin brafman) Lucia Evans, who you will see from the documents released, has clearly, in our opinion, committed perjury on several occasions.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nFor months, they'd been arguing that all of these women were lying. And now, they're going out and making the claim that this entire criminal case is tainted, that it's completely unfair.\n\narchived recording (benjamin brafman) The case is not over, but I think it is permanently and irreparably damaged.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nThey're gleeful.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo her story seems to be falling apart.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nThat's how it appears.\n\nmegan twohey How did that affect you? Did you have to have conversations with your friends and family, and anybody that you work with? lucia evans Yeah. megan twohey Was this something that you had to talk about or address? lucia evans I mean, it was interesting, because before this happened, I had been meeting with lots of actresses who — I became a very popular figure for a month in there in the summer, because I was kind of representing all of Hollywood that wanted to send him to jail, but they were too afraid to do it themselves — some of them. I'm not speaking for all of them. But the actresses I spoke to all had very credible potential charges. But they had families and careers, and they couldn't do it. So I was kind of doing it for them. After my case is dropped, my friend group and that group whittled down to very few people who actually cared and wanted to know the truth and reached out to me. Some of them didn't know me personally, so I don't blame them for not reaching out. But some very clearly kind of severed ties with me, which was really hard and really hurtful. And I don't care if an actress comes into my life, and then she leaves again. I never fooled myself into thinking I was close with these women, these famous actresses, necessarily. But the ones — the women that have been with me since the beginning — that was really, that was really tough.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMegan, what happened here, exactly? What happened to this case? Because you've been describing law enforcement officials who, from day one, have been telling Lucia she's their best chance at bringing criminal charges against Harvey Weinstein. She finally signs on. She risks all that that entails. And then they handle it in this confusing way, and then they drop it.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nWell, what we now know is that prosecutors have spoken to a friend of Lucia's, actually the friend who was with her the very first time she met Weinstein. Lucia said that when she went to that work meeting at Harvey Weinstein's office after meeting him, that he sexually assaulted her, that he forced her to perform oral sex on him against her will. And this friend says that after that work meeting, Lucia told her that she had actually consented to perform oral sex on him, that she did that in exchange for the promise of acting jobs.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow. So a very different version of the story.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nRight, this friend is providing an account of an encounter with Weinstein that, if true, turns it back into a variation of one of the common stories about Weinstein, but one that cannot be subject to criminal charges.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhy is this only now coming to light?\n\nmegan twohey\n\nWell, one possibility is that this is an example of what can happen when there is a rush to prosecute. Well, we also now realize what we now know is that the lead detective in the case had apparently talked to this witness months before Weinstein was charged, and that she had shared this information with him. And prosecutors say that that detective did not share that information with them, the prosecutors.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSuggesting maybe he didn't want to bring them information that might hurt the case.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nSuggesting that he purposely withheld potentially complicating information from the case. Now, the detective says that he did tell the prosecutors this information. So that could also speak to what Lucia had complained about herself, that this entire investigation seemed to be plagued by the fact that the police and prosecutors were not in sync and communicating well with each other.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm. But if the detective had told prosecutors, it seems like that would only be further evidence of this desire to get this done, to bring these charges and overlook complicating information.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nRight, so that is another interpretation of this, that both the police and the prosecutors were aware of this complicating information and moved forward with bringing charges anyway.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, in that case, what would explain them dropping this case when they did?\n\nmegan twohey\n\nWell, with all of the finger-pointing that's gone on, it's hard to know, for certain, the answer to that question. But what seems likely is that prosecutors have realized, at this point, that this information is going to come to the attention of the defense and that it's likely to undermine the entire criminal charge. But I should say that Lucia insists that she never consented to oral sex with Weinstein, that she never told this friend otherwise, and that she explained that to the detective when he asked her about it months and months before.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMegan, what should we make of Lucia's experience?\n\nmegan twohey\n\nFor all the people who have been watching so many women come forward with allegations against Harvey Weinstein, watching what seems to be this overwhelming evidence of a pattern of predatory behavior, it shows how difficult it is to turn stories into criminal charges. Her account fell within the statute of limitations, it was alleging criminal conduct, and she was willing to participate.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight, to brave the spotlight and the scrutiny.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nExactly. And still, her charge was dropped.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo this is October of 2018. Where does that leave the case against Harvey Weinstein?\n\nmegan twohey\n\nSo in the lead-up to Lucia's charge being dropped, there was actually a third woman who was added to the criminal case here in New York. So after Lucia's charges dropped, there are still two women. But one of those women, one of those accusers, appears to also come with some potential complicating factors.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nLike what?\n\nmegan twohey\n\nWeinstein's legal team has produced emails between Weinstein and this woman that went on for years after the alleged attack. These emails appear extensive. They appear friendly. They even appear romantic at times.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nTomorrow, in Part 2, how the case against Weinstein moved forward after Lucia.\n\nmegan twohey Do you wish that you were still part of this case as we head into trial? lucia evans Honestly, yes, I do. I do wish I was. I put so much into this. And when it comes down to it, I do wish I was a part of it. And I also just don't want people to be discouraged from coming forward and doing it. So I would just hope people don't — people, despite all the things I've said about how hard it is, still decide to come forward, because that's literally the only hope that we have.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe'll be right back. Here's what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) Good morning. I'm pleased to inform you the American people should be extremely grateful and happy. No Americans were harmed in last night's attack by the Iranian regime.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Wednesday, in a televised address to the nation, President Trump backed away from further military confrontation with Iran, saying that Iran's retaliation for the U.S. killing of General Qassim Suleimani appeared to be over.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) Iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned, and a very good thing for the world.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat retaliation, about a dozen missiles that inflicted minimal damage to two U.S. bases in Iraq, seemed designed to satisfy Iran's desire for revenge without provoking a military response from the Trump administration. In his speech, Trump vowed to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, but in a gesture of conciliation said he was prepared to make peace with the country's leaders.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) Finally, to the people and leaders of Iran, we want you to have a future, and a great future — one that you deserve, one of prosperity at home and harmony with the nations of the world. The United States is ready to embrace peace with all who seek it.\n\nmichael barbaro
On the regulatory landscape, no issue has been more debated over the last few years than the Labor Department's fiduciary rule. Regardless of its uncertain fate under the new administration, the industry has already committed significant resources to instill greater accountability and best practices around advice delivery.\n\nEven if the rule is repealed, the Securities and Exchange Commission, perhaps in conjunction with Finra, is said to be contemplating its own proposal of new regulations that reconcile standards for retirement and nonretirement accounts.\n\nSome firms have said they will not backtrack on steps they had begun to put into effect in anticipation of narrow compliance with the Labor Department's fiduciary rule. The direction has already been set. Attempts to provide greater transparency and eliminate potential conflicts should proceed and should apply beyond retirement accounts. The investor experience and the professionalism of our industry will be enhanced to the benefit of everyone.\n\nCombined, these forces are fueling a move toward more scalable, technology-enabled, customized investment advice that is tied to an investor's unique goals. Firms are investing heavily in an advice-centric ecosystem with enhanced wealth management services and digital delivery tools. They are developing increasingly sophisticated approaches linking financial planning with portfolio construction and continuing management in a single end-to-end process. Legacy systems are being retooled or retired, and advisory programs that exist in separate silos are being consolidated to deliver a simpler, more cohesive investor experience.\n\nIn the future, the need for investment advice will increase. This next phase of evolution in financial advice delivery promises important benefits for all investors — specifically, greater access to professional investment management through lower minimums and new engagement models, lower-cost solutions and a focus on personal goals.\n\nThe advice industry also stands to benefit. The automation of routine processes will provide the efficiency and scale necessary to serve more investors — and important, the time to focus on the interpersonal elements of the adviser-investor relationship that cannot be replicated by technology.\n\nThe industry needs to recognize the drivers of change and take full advantage of the opportunities they present to enable expanded access to professional financial advice, increased levels of transparency and efficiency and a shared alignment of interests among firms, advisers and investors.
PARIS — In the latest of several scandals to test French attitudes toward sexual abuse of minors, a prominent political scientist, radio show host and television commentator has quit his media and university posts after being accused in a new book of committing incest with his teenage stepson more than 30 years ago.\n\nOlivier Duhamel, a French public intellectual, said in a Twitter post Monday that he had decided to step down as a result of personal attacks against him, and out of a determination to preserve the institutions in which I work. These included the Sciences Po university, where Mr. Duhamel, 70, headed the body overseeing the renowned Paris institution.\n\nCamille Kouchner, in a book called La familia grande to be published Thursday, said Mr. Duhamel persistently abused her twin brother, starting when he was 14, which would be considered incest under French law. In a statement to the daily Le Monde, the brother, who is identified in the book as Victor, said, I confirm that what my sister has written about the actions of Olivier Duhamel toward me is correct.\n\nAddressing Mr. Duhamel directly in the book, excerpts from which appeared in Le Monde, Ms. Kouchner writes: I am going to explain to you who sound off on the radio, you who offer the gift of your analysis to students, and strut about on TV stages. I am going to explain that you could, at least, have said sorry.
As a result, many Americans assume that Canadian whisky is boring and poorly made, a misconception that the industry's leaders are only now pushing back against.\n\nI think we've been apologizing for it too long, and haven't gone out to tell our story, said Don Livermore, the master blender at the Hiram Walker & Sons distillery in Windsor, Ontario. Canadians have been doing themselves a disservice for 80 years.\n\nCanadian whisky has done well in America; Crown Royal, made by Diageo at a plant in Manitoba, is the second-best-selling whiskey in the United States, behind Jack Daniel's.\n\nStill, for decades Canadian whisky has been stereotyped the same way Canada has been: as unassuming, a bit bland and averse to change. But these days the country is challenging those preconceptions, celebrating its diversity, its youthful spirit and its embrace of innovation. The same is happening with its whisky.\n\nDistilleries are sending their master blenders around the world to promote their product, and inviting tourists into their plants with new visitor centers. And they are creating flavorful and exciting new expressions: peppery whiskys made with 100 percent rye grain, like Lot 40; whiskys finished in port or rum barrels, like Pike Creek; and weird but delicious blends like Alberta Dark Batch, which combines 6- and 12-year-old Canadian rye with bourbon and sherry.\n\nPeople are looking for heavier, bolder styles of whiskey, Mr. Livermore said. I grew up on meat and potatoes, my kids are growing up on sushi. What I like about Canadian whisky is that we can adapt easily to changing tastes.\n\nThough he is probably too modest to claim credit, Mr. de Kergommeaux is part of Canadian whisky's success story. His book quickly became required reading for whiskey fans, and he became both prophet and proselytizer for the spirit's resurgence at seminars and festivals around the world.
Jenny Schlenzka, a curator at MoMA PS1, is about to move from one old school building to another. In February, she will become the artistic director of Performance Space 122 — known as PS122 in a nod toward the building's former use as a public school.\n\nMs. Schlenzka, 38, succeeds Vallejo Gantner, who announced in May that as soon as his replacement was found, he would step down from the organization, a downtown hub of innovative performance and the host of the annual Coil festival, which begins on Tuesday.\n\nAt PS1 — which is also in a former school building, this one in Long Island City, Queens — Ms. Schlenzka created the program Sunday Sessions, which featured performers like Ann Liv Young and Justin Vivian Bond. Before that, she was an assistant curator at PS1's affiliate, the Museum of Modern Art, where she worked with artists including the cerebral choreographers Jérôme Bel and Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker.\n\nShe will be the third artistic director in the history of PS122, which was founded in 1980, and is its first female leader. In an interview, Ms. Schlenzka said that it was time for more women to lead arts institutions, generally.
WASHINGTON — President Trump and Democratic congressional leaders dug in Wednesday for a lengthy partial shutdown in a newly divided government after a White House meeting — the first in 22 days — could not break an impasse over Mr. Trump's demands for billions of dollars for a border wall.\n\nDuring the contentious meeting in the Situation Room, Mr. Trump made his case for a wall on the southwestern border and rejected Democrats' proposals for reopening the government while the two sides ironed out their differences.\n\nI would look foolish if I did that, Mr. Trump responded after Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, posed the question to him directly, according to three officials familiar with the meeting who described it on the condition of anonymity. He said that the wall was why he was elected, one of the officials said.\n\nDemocrats were equally adamant, according to another official who was present for the discussion. Pressed by Vice President Mike Pence and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the incoming minority leader, they refused to budge from their offer to devote $1.3 billion to border security. The official also insisted on anonymity to describe the private conversation.
Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, told CNN on Friday that the United States would not follow Britain's lead in front-loading first vaccine injections, potentially delaying the administration of second doses.\n\nBritain announced a plan this week to delay second shots of its two authorized vaccines, developed by Pfizer and AstraZeneca, in an attempt to dole out to more people the partial protection conferred by a single dose.\n\nI would not be in favor of that, Dr. Fauci told CNN's Elizabeth Cohen, regarding altering dosing schedules for the vaccines authorized for use in the United States, made by Pfizer and Moderna. We're going to keep doing what we're doing.\n\nHis opinion was met with approval by some experts, including Dr. Eric Topol, a clinical trials expert at the Scripps Research Translational Institute in California, who tweeted, That's good because that it's following what we know, the trial data with extraordinary 95 percent efficacy, avoiding extrapolation and the unknowns.
A decade later, she's back at the Public — this time in Sarah Burgess's Kings as Kate, a Washington health-care lobbyist. Kate is trying to persuade a newly elected representative from Texas, Sydney Millsap (Eisa Davis), to support legislation that will benefit a rather unglamorous client, the American Podiatric Medical Association. (Now in previews, the show opens Tuesday, Feb. 20.)\n\nKate is feeling the heat: Washingtonian magazine has just released its list of top D.C. gay power couples under 45, and on it are Kate's ex-girlfriend Lauren (Aya Cash) and her wife.\n\nLater this year, Ms. Jacobs will appear alongside Melissa McCarthy in the movie Life of the Party. In a surprisingly emotional interview at the Public's Library restaurant, Ms. Jacobs, 35, talked about conquering her fears and why her role as Mickey in Netflix's Love, whose final season begins March 9, resonates. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.\n\nWhy the return to theater?\n\nI wanted to challenge myself again. I wanted the rigor of having to be word perfect, of not being able to pull the panic button and say Cut! When we did our first full run-though, something went wrong, and I instinctively looked over to Tommy [Kail], the director, like, Make it stop! Then I realized there's no stopping. So I've been cherishing both the sheer terror and the pleasure of letting it fly when you know so well what you're doing.\n\nKings is eye-opening to those of us who don't know much about lobbying.\n\nI've learned about broadening a bill to death, in which a lawmaker can publicly say they support something while privately reassuring the lobbyists and super PACs that they won't vote for it. That concept — of saying, I support this, but this bill doesn't go far enough, and I don't want to lose out on an opportunity for more comprehensive legislation down the line — I am now going to regard with suspicion.
On Dec. 30, Andrew Bosworth, a longtime Facebook executive and confidant of Mark Zuckerberg, wrote a long memo on the company's internal network.\n\nIn the post, titled Thoughts for 2020, Mr. Bosworth — who oversaw Facebook's advertising efforts during the 2016 election and is now in charge of the company's virtual and augmented reality division — admitted that President Trump's savvy use of Facebook's advertising tools very well may lead to his re-election. But he maintained that the company should not change its policies on political advertising, saying that doing so in order to avert a victory by Mr. Trump would be a misuse of power, comparing it to a scene from The Lord of the Rings.\n\nMr. Bosworth, who is seen by some inside Facebook as a proxy of sorts for Mr. Zuckerberg, also weighed in on a variety of issues that have vexed Facebook for the past few years, including data privacy scandals, Russian interference, political polarization and the debate over whether Facebook is healthy for society.\n\nHere is the full post as written:\n\nThe election of Donald Trump immediately put a spotlight on Facebook. While the intensity and focus of that spotlight may be unfair I believe it isn't unjust. Scrutiny is warranted given our position in society as the most prominent of a new medium. I think most of the criticisms that have come to light have been valid and represent real areas for us to serve our community better. I don't enjoy having our flaws exposed, but I consider it far better than the alternative where we remain ignorant of our shortcomings.\n\nOne trap I sometimes see people falling into is to dismiss all feedback when they can invalidate one part of it. I see that with personal feedback and I see it happening with media coverage. The press often gets so many details wrong it can be hard to trust the veracity of their conclusions. Dismissing the whole because of flaws in parts is a mistake. The media has limited information to work with (by our own design!) and they sometimes get it entirely wrong but there is almost always some critical issue that motivated them to write which we need to understand.\n\nIt is worth looking at the 2016 Election which set this chain of events in motion. I was running our ads organization at the time of the election and had been for the four years prior (and for one year after). It is worth reminding everyone that Russian Interference was real but it was mostly not done through advertising. $100,000 in ads on Facebook can be a powerful tool but it can't buy you an American election, especially when the candidates themselves are putting up several orders of magnitude more money on the same platform (not to mention other platforms).\n\nInstead, the Russians worked to exploit existing divisions in the American public for example by hosting Black Lives Matter and Blue Lives Matter protest events in the same city on the same day. The people who shows up to those events were real even if the event coordinator was not. Likewise the groups of Americans being fed partisan content was real even if those feeding them were not. The organic reach they managed sounds very big in absolute terms and unfortunately humans are bad at contextualizing big numbers. Whatever reach they managed represents an infinitesimal fraction of the overall content people saw in the same period of time and certainly over the course of an election across all media.\n\nSo most of the information floating around that is widely believed isn't accurate. But who cares? It is certainly true that we should have been more mindful of the role both paid and organic content played in democracy and been more protective of it. On foreign interference, Facebook has made material progress and while we may never be able to fully eliminate it I don't expect it to be a major issue for 2020.\n\nMisinformation was also real and related but not the same as Russian interference. The Russians may have used misinformation alongside real partisan messaging in their campaigns, but the primary source of misinformation was economically motivated. People with no political interest whatsoever realized they could drive traffic to ad-laden websites by creating fake headlines and did so to make money. These might be more adequately described as hoaxes that play on confirmation bias or conspiracy theory. In my opinion this is another area where the criticism is merited. This is also an area where we have made dramatic progress and don't expect it to be a major issue for 2020.\n\nIt is worth noting, as it is relevant at the current moment, that misinformation from the candidates themselves was not considered a major shortcoming of political advertising on FB in 2016 even though our policy then was the same as it is now. These policies are often covered by the press in the context of a profit motive. That's one area I can confidently assure you the critics are wrong. Having run our ads business for some time it just isn't a factor when we discuss the right thing to do. However, given that those conversations are private I think we can all agree the press can be forgiven for jumping to that conclusion. Perhaps we could do a better job exposing the real cost of these mistakes to make it clear that revenue maximization would have called for a different strategy entirely.\n\nCambridge Analytica is one of the more acute cases I can think of where the details are almost all wrong but I think the scrutiny is broadly right. Facebook very publicly launched our developer platform in 2012 in an environment primarily scrutinizing us for keeping data to ourselves. Everyone who added an application got a prompt explaining what information it would have access to and at the time it included information from friends. This may sound crazy in a 2020 context but it received widespread praise at the time. However the only mechanism we had for keeping data secure once it was shared was legal threats which ultimately didn't amount to much for companies which had very little to lose. The platform didn't build the value we had hoped for our consumers and we shut this form of it down in 2014.\n\nThe company Cambridge Analytica started by running surveys on Facebook to get information about people. It later pivoted to be an advertising company, part of our Facebook Marketing Partner program, who other companies could hire to run their ads. Their claim to fame was psychographic targeting. This was pure snake oil and we knew it; their ads performed no better than any other marketing partner (and in many cases performed worse). I personally regret letting them stay on the FMP program for that reason alone. However at the time we thought they were just another company trying to find an angle to promote themselves and assumed poor performance would eventually lose them their clients. We had no idea they were shopping an old Facebook dataset that they were supposed to have deleted (and certified to us in writing that they had).\n\nWhen Trump won, Cambridge Analytica tried to take credit so they were back on our radar but just for making [expletive] claims about their own importance. I was glad when the Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale called them out for it. Later on, we found out from journalists that they had never deleted the database and had instead made elaborate promises about its power for advertising. Our comms team decided it would be best to get ahead of the journalists and pull them from the platform. This was a huge mistake. It was not only bad form (justifiably angering the journalists) but we were also fighting the wrong battle. We wanted to be clear this had not been a data breach (which, to be fair to us, it absolutely was not) but the real concern was the existence of the dataset no matter how it happened. We also sent the journalists legal letters advising them not to use the term breech which was received normally by the NYT (who agreed) and aggressively by The Guardian (who forged ahead with the wrong terminology, furious about the letter) in spite of it being a relatively common practice I am told.\n\nIn practical terms, Cambridge Analytica is a total non-event. They were snake oil salespeople. The tools they used didn't work, and the scale they used them at wasn't meaningful. Every claim they have made about themselves is garbage. Data of the kind they had isn't that valuable to being with and worse it degrades quickly, so much so as to be effectively useless in 12-18 months. In fact the United Kingdom Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) seized all the equipment at Cambridge Analytica and found that there was zero data from any UK citizens! So surely, this is one where we can ignore the press, right? Nope. The platform was such a poor move that the risks associated were bound to come to light. That we shut it down in 2014 and never paid the piper on how bad it was makes this scrutiny justified in my opinion, even if it is narrowly misguided.\n\nSo was Facebook responsible for Donald Trump getting elected? I think the answer is yes, but not for the reasons anyone thinks. He didn't get elected because of Russia or misinformation or Cambridge Analytica. He got elected because he ran the single best digital ad campaign I've ever seen from any advertiser. Period.\n\nTo be clear, I'm no fan of Trump. I donated the max to Hillary. After his election I wrote a post about Trump supporters that I'm told caused colleagues who had supported him to feel unsafe around me (I regret that post and deleted shortly after).\n\nBut Parscale and Trump just did unbelievable work. They weren't running misinformation or hoaxes. They weren't microtargeting or saying different things to different people. They just used the tools we had to show the right creative to each person. The use of custom audiences, video, ecommerce, and fresh creative remains the high water mark of digital ad campaigns in my opinion.\n\nThat brings me to the present moment, where we have maintained the same ad policies. It occurs to me that it very well may lead to the same result. As a committed liberal I find myself desperately wanting to pull any lever at my disposal to avoid the same result. So what stays my hand?\n\nI find myself thinking of the Lord of the Rings at this moment. Specifically when Frodo offers the ring to Galadrial and she imagines using the power righteously, at first, but knows it will eventually corrupt her. As tempting as it is to use the tools available to us to change the outcome, I am confident we must never do that or we will become that which we fear.\n\nThe philosopher John Rawls reasoned that the only moral way to decide something is to remove yourself entirely from the specifics of any one person involved, behind a so called Veil of Ignorance. That is the tool that leads me to believe in liberal government programs like universal healthcare, expanding housing programs, and promoting civil rights. It is also the tool that prevents me from limiting the reach of publications who have earned their audience, as distasteful as their content may be to me and even to the moral philosophy I hold so dear.\n\nThat doesn't mean there is no line. Things like incitement of violence, voter suppression, and more are things that same moral philosophy would safely allow me to rule out. But I think my fellow liberals are a bit too, well, liberal when it comes to calling people Nazi's.\n\nIf we don't want hate mongering politicians then we must not elect them. If they are getting elected then we have to win hearts and minds. If we change the outcomes without winning the minds of the people who will be ruled then we have a democracy in name only. If we limit what information people have access to and what they can say then we have no democracy at all.\n\nThis conversation often raises the alarm around filter bubbles, but that is a myth that is easy to dispel. Ask yourself how many newspapers and news programs people read/watched before the internet. If you guessed one and one on average you are right, and if you guessed those were ideologically aligned with them you are right again. The internet exposes them to far more content from other sources (26% more on Facebook, according to our research). This is one that everyone just gets wrong.\n\nThe focus on filter bubbles causes people to miss the real disaster which is polarization. What happens when you see 26% more content from people you don't agree with? Does it help you empathize with them as everyone has been suggesting? Nope. It makes you dislike them even more. This is also easy to prove with a thought experiment: whatever your political leaning, think of a publication from the other side that you despise. When you read an article from that outlet, perhaps shared by an uncle or nephew, does it make you rethink your values? Or does it make you retreat further into the conviction of your own correctness? If you answered the former, congratulations you are a better person than I am. Every time I read something from Breitbart I get 10% more liberal.\n\nWhat does all of this say about the nature of the algorithmic rewards? Everyone points to top 0.1% content as being acutely polarized but how steep are the curves? What does the top 1% or 5% look like? And what is the real reach across those curves when compared to other content? I think the call for algorithmic transparency can sometimes be overblown but being more transparent about this type of data would likely be healthy.\n\nWhat I expect people will find is that the algorithms are primarily exposing the desires of humanity itself, for better or worse. This is a Sugar, Salt, Fat problem. The book of that name tells a story ostensibly about food but in reality about the limited effectiveness of corporate paternalism. A while ago Kraft foods had a leader who tried to reduce the sugar they sold in the interest of consumer health. But customers wanted sugar. So instead he just ended up reducing Kraft market share. Health outcomes didn't improve. That CEO lost his job. The new CEO introduced quadruple stuffed Oreos and the company returned to grace. Giving people tools to make their own decisions is good but trying to force decisions upon them rarely works (for them or for you).\n\nIn these moments people like to suggest that our consumers don't really have free will. People compare social media to nicotine. I find that wildly offensive, not to me but to addicts. I have seen family members struggle with alcoholism and classmates struggle with opioids. I know there is a battle for the terminology of addiction but I side firmly with the neuroscientists. Still, while Facebook may not be nicotine I think it is probably like sugar. Sugar is delicious and for most of us there is a special place for it in our lives. But like all things it benefits from moderation.\n\nAt the end of the day we are forced to ask what responsibility individuals have for themselves. Set aside substances that directly alter our neurochemistry unnaturally. Make costs and trade-offs as transparent as possible. But beyond that each of us must take responsibility for ourselves. If I want to eat sugar and die an early death that is a valid position. My grandfather took such a stance towards bacon and I admired him for it. And social media is likely much less fatal than bacon.\n\nTo bring this uncharacteristically long and winding essay full circle, I wanted to start a discussion about what lessons people are taking away from the press coverage. My takeaway is that we were late on data security, misinformation, and foreign interference. We need to get ahead of polarization and algorithmic transparency. What are the other big topics people are seeing and where are we on those?
Paul Westphal, the Basketball Hall of Fame guard who played for the Boston Celtics' 1974 N.B.A. champions, became a four-time All-Star with the Phoenix Suns and coached them to the league playoff final in 1993, died on Saturday. He was 70.\n\nWestphal, whose death was confirmed by the Suns, was found to have brain cancer in the summer of 2020. The team did not say where he died.\n\nWestphal was an outstanding shooter with both hands and a fine playmaker and defensive player. He played in the N.B.A. for 12 seasons, also with the Seattle SuperSonics and the Knicks. He was a head coach for all or part of 10 seasons, with the Suns, Seattle and the Sacramento Kings, and an assistant coach with the Dallas Mavericks and the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nHe was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass., as a player in 2019.
Brent Musburger is calling it a career at ESPN after being the play-by-play man in the booth at sporting events enjoyed by millions of Americans, most prominently when he was the lead voice for CBS Sports in the 1980s.\n\nMusburger, who is 77, said he was leaving active sportscasting to help his family get a sports handicapping business started and to use some of the millions of airline miles he has earned for recreational travel.\n\nHis last game will be the Kentucky-Georgia men's basketball game Tuesday night. That takes him back to Rupp Arena, where he called Villanova's upset over Georgetown in the final of the N.C.A.A. tournament in 1985.\n\nMusburger and ESPN said his comments about the Oklahoma football player Joe Mixon that were criticized as insensitive during the Sugar Bowl this month had nothing to do with his exit. On the broadcast, Musburger said that he hoped Mixon, who had been suspended for a year after punching a woman and breaking her jaw, would make the most of his second chance. He did not initially talk about Mixon's victim.
Ms. Napoleone recently gave an art tour of her home, wearing a baseball cap (bad hair day) and Yves Saint Laurent platform sandals (with dark pink socks). Above the living room fireplace is Nicole Eisenman's Saggy Titties (2007), the protuberant portrait of a topless woman whose breasts drop slightly below the edge of the canvas. Beside it is Margherita Manzelli's Neobros (1998), in which a woman with pigtails sits on a stool with her tights rolled down to her knees.\n\nThe bed in the middle of Ms. Napoleone's upstairs bedroom is also a commission: from Nanda Vigo, an Italian artist and designer who, in her early 80s, is finally getting more widespread recognition. It has a lit, mirrored frame and a fake-fur cover.\n\nMy collection is about liberating women, she explained. The following are edited excerpts from the conversation.\n\nWhy collect only female artists?\n\nI'm a feminist, believing in equal opportunities. I was aware of the fact that women artists were not considered for gallery or museum representation and were dismissed, underrepresented. I couldn't figure out why we were missing so much talent just because of gender. From the very first piece, I told myself: I'm going to create a collection only of female voices. I want to create a choir of voices of females who have been unheard, who have been silenced.\n\nCan you talk about the Nicole Eisenman work above your fireplace?\n\nIt's a matriarch, a female nude. It has the pretense of being important, in its size but also its presence, as would any portrait of a famous or important man. But it has a sense of humor — the smile, the eyes — and it's also so incredibly painted.
Since August, 256 players and 432 coaches and staff have tested positive for the virus. There are at least 6,000 people regularly being tested throughout the league, including about 2,500 players on rosters and practice squads.\n\nDuring the season, outbreaks on the Tennessee Titans and Baltimore Ravens forced the league to postpone games and shuffle schedules, including games that involved the Steelers. But the N.F.L. said the status of the Browns-Steelers game on Sunday had not changed. Bye weeks during the regular season gave the league room to move games, but there are no bye weeks in the playoffs.\n\nGiven the schedule we have now, we may not have the same flexibility that we had in the regular season, said DeMaurice Smith, the executive director of the N.F.L. Players Association.\n\nIn the meantime, the league and team will continue to conduct standard contact tracing to identify any possible high-risk close contacts, according to a statement from the league.\n\nWe obviously have more work to do with contact tracing and figuring out where the virus is coming from, Tretter said. We don't have all the answers yet.\n\nStefanski and the other coaches and players must be isolated from the team for a minimum of 10 days. If any players or other staffers are found to have had close contact with them, they would need to remain apart from the team for five days, after which they would be eligible to return to the team and play in the game.\n\nDuring their 24-22 victory over the Steelers, the Browns had six players on the Covid-19 reserve list who had either tested positive or had close contact with someone who had. The previous week, the Browns had played without any of their best wide receivers because of an outbreak on the team.
A historically high number of top movies had black directors last year, according to a sweeping study, released on Friday, that examined diversity behind the scenes and in studio boardrooms.\n\nWhile 2018 was a banner year for black directors — with 16 working on the top 100 films — 15 of those 16 directors were men; the one woman in that group was Ava DuVernay (A Wrinkle in Time). The overall figure was up from six black directors working on the top 100 films in 2017 and eight in 2007.\n\nWhile we do not see this finding mirrored among female or Asian directors, this offers proof that Hollywood can change when it wants to, said Stacy L. Smith, who wrote the report with the University of Southern California Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, which released it.\n\nIndeed, the remainder of the research showed little change for other ethnicity groups or for women. Surveying the 1,200 top-grossing films from 2007-18, researchers found that just over 4 percent had female directors, which meant that they were outnumbered by their male counterparts by a ratio of 22 to 1. And Asians represented just 3.6 percent of last year's top 100 grossing directors, a number that changed little over 12 years.
But achieving the goal of vaccinating 10 to 20 percent of the city is still a far way off. In the first 17 days of the vaccination rollout, about 88,140 people had received the first of two doses, the equivalent of about 1 percent of the city's population. Those vaccinated so far have overwhelmingly been hospital employees, residents and workers at nursing homes and the staff at certain health clinics.\n\nThe pace is worrying some experts. I do feel concern, said Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, an epidemiology professor at Columbia University. Despite months to prepare, there still seemed to be a steep learning curve when it comes to the nitty-gritty of how do you get it from the freezer to the arm as quickly as possible, she said. I think there are growing pains as people are picking up how to do this.\n\nThe first phase should have been the simplest, she added. We've started out with the easiest populations, an almost captive audience: nursing homes and hospital workers — you know who they are and where to find them.\n\nFor now, the vaccination effort does not resemble the sort of mass mobilization many imagined. New York City has yet to open any large vaccination sites. Instead, hospitals administered many of the first vaccinations to their employees. Hospitals have been encouraged to use each shipment of vaccines within a week, and the operation does not always have a race-against-the-clock feel.\n\nThe number of vaccinations plummets on weekends and all but stopped for Christmas Day, when more planes landed at Kennedy International Airport than vaccine doses were administered in New York City.\n\nThe vaccination program is now in its third week and has yet to accelerate dramatically, even as supply has begun to increase. More than 340,000 doses have been delivered to New York City so far.
MELBOURNE, Australia — The first two rounds of the Australian Open have let the outsiders in.\n\nTennys Sandgren, ranked 97th, said he watched Stan Wawrinka win the 2016 United States Open final in a bar.\n\nI was having a few beers, Sandgren said of Wawrinka's third major win. I was watching the tennis, thinking: That's insane — an inhuman level of tennis.\n\nOn Thursday, an undaunted Sandgren beat ninth-seeded Wawrinka with some ease, 6-1, 6-2, 6-4. He was able to dominate Wawrinka's signature backhand with his own, hitting eight winners to Wawrinka's two.\n\nWawrinka was far from his glimmering best, but Sandgren still had to contain his composure over the best-of-five match against an experienced champion who could have roared back at any point.
You wouldn't have to speak English to know that we, the Dokics, are not welcome, she writes. There's palpable annoyance that a Serbian refugee has been awarded a state tennis scholarship. Even though I have won everything, beaten everyone, am No. 1 in Australia in multiple age groups, it's evident that some parents don't think a foreign kid with an erratic father who rattles the fence to distract their children from serving correctly should be getting help from the Institute.\n\nDokic now contends that members of the news media who glibly covered her father's outbursts should have shown more concern for the teenage girl in his grips and understood that his private behavior was likely worse.\n\nMany in Australian tennis suspected that Damir Dokic was abusive, and some even said they saw bruises on Jelena's body.\n\nNow that she is opening up about the abuse she once denied, the tennis community is responding. In a statement after her book's release, Tennis Australia praised Dokic's courage and defended its actions during her playing days.\n\nThere were many in tennis at the time who were concerned for Jelena's welfare, and many who tried to assist with what was a difficult family situation, the federation said in the statement. Some officials even went as far as lodging police complaints, which, without cooperation from those directly involved, unfortunately could not be fully investigated.\n\nDokic now writes that persistent beatings occurred as she traveled the tour with her father — including one long session in Montreal in 1999 that left her nearly unconscious. She finally broke free from him in 2002, but she also lost his direction and discipline, which had brought her to the top of the sport.
These days, improvising on a football field gets you fired. But a shortened play clock would require it. Coaches would still control the basic strategy, but the players would control its application, communicating with one another more and engaging their otherwise static athletic minds, familiar mostly with obeying orders.\n\nA shortened play clock might also make obese linemen lose weight, since there'd be less standing around and more hustling. And since all players would be more tired, they would have less strength when delivering hits. Blows would become less deadly.\n\nThe quickened pace would also make concussed players easier to spot, and less able to conceal their symptoms, which they now do at all costs. The rest of us might consider the concussion debate a step in the right direction, but the players see it differently. Their career window to play in the N.F.L. is small. You fall in line. You don't bring attention to yourself. You follow instructions. Landing yourself in the concussion protocol, which can keep you off the field indefinitely, is a good way to lose your job, like it or not.\n\nThe N.F.L. train is dragged along by short bursts of manic energy: six seconds from the players and 40 for everyone else to pull up a seat and bang on the table. Every play is now viewed and reviewed and re-reviewed. Maniacal adherence to nearly indecipherable rules by aging men in heated booths causes mistakes to run in slow-motion loops. Outrage floods the wires. The game needs to speed up, for all of our sakes.\n\nThe threat that concussions pose to football is really a threat to its promoters. The game will live on despite them, and will morph to meet the sensibilities of an ever-changing national conscience. Forty seconds isn't what it used to be. These days, it's giving the delicate fingers too much time to dictate the action, too much time to steer players into oncoming traffic.\n\nFootball players are known to struggle with life after football. Some of this is because of injuries sustained while playing, but much of it is psychological. What do I do with myself in the real world? There's no huddle for me out here. We are making a generation of tough boys; it is true. But what good is toughness without brains?
To the Editor:\n\nIn Caught in Act, Evaders of Fare 'Don't Feel Bad' (front page, Dec. 25), we are introduced to several subway fare evaders who were made to feel  unhappy  or whose mood was ruined when issued summonses.\n\nThere is an utter disconnect between their actions and responsibilities. The cavalierly offered rationales mean nothing and don't change anything. Yes, there are many of us who experience problems while commuting and wish that the system functioned well, but breaking the law is not an answer; it only worsens the existing problems.\n\nMany of those who refuse to pay fares simply do so because it is too easy to do, period. Transit systems in other countries use methods of thwarting fare evasion that are effective, yet respectful. One major problem is that subway turnstiles, while nice-looking, are poorly designed for controlling access. Our current situation is, to no small degree, a product of design flaw.\n\nBurt Bloom\n\nBrooklyn\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nWhen someone vaults over a subway turnstile, or boards a bus through a rear door, it's generally not a maiden voyage. And when the police redirect their attention away from fare evasion, it sends a clear message that this form of crime (theft) is inconsequential. So no one should look the least bit shocked when fare evasion rockets from 1.8 percent to 3.2 percent of all riders. What to do?
A novel about permeability, In Every Moment We Are Still Alive captures the jumbled sensory experience of being profoundly, catastrophically overwhelmed. Malmquist achieves much of this through style. The linguistic contagion results in moments of deep pathos, as when Tom struggles to locate the language to tell her parents that Karin is dead, only to fall back on medical terminology: I don't know how to articulate it so I just repeat what Nygren said to me: The electrical activity in Karin's heart has stopped.\n\nTom is left with his grief and his newborn daughter. Jersey Girl, a heartwarming 2004 movie about death starring Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez, uses more or less the same setup. The comparison illustrates the degree to which this material risks cliché and sentimentality. But if sentiment is emotion's easily digestible expression, simple to contain and designed not to trouble, it's clear that Malmquist is explicitly interested in what can't be contained, what continues to trouble.\n\nThis novel travels off the map and into that territory. It exchanges the schematic ease of the sentimental for the uncharted depths of the emotional. Toward the end, Tom says, I miss Karin, but until this point there's virtually no mention of his feelings. At its conclusion, Tom hasn't recovered, isn't even bereaved, but instead exists in a pit of emotion so acute as to be without meaning. Watching his child at play and asleep, he confesses: I have never hated as I hate now, it has no direction, no meaning, and every time I try to understand it, attach words to it, define it, control it, I start crying so violently that I am afraid of waking her even if I am in a different room.\n\nWhat kind of emotional experience do we expect from a work of art? Once upon a time, we turned to art in search of catharsis, submitting to a rite of terror and purification, the workings of which were beyond our comprehension. But in the age of psychology and self-help, our expectations have shifted. Increasingly, we seek narratives that guide us through our fear, language that diagnoses and renders transparent, a timeline of redemption and resolution that's legible and coherent.\n\nImage\n\nMalmquist denies us that timeline. Even as he depicts the unpromising start of Karin and Tom's relationship, he utilizes the present tense: Karin has a friend with her when we meet that weekend in a bar on Odengatan. Helena is as tall as Karin, but slender. … Karin is unremarkable in comparison, and when they stand next to each other at the horseshoe-shaped bar and I can see their hips, Karin looks ungainly.\n\nOver the course of the novel, Karin emerges as a complex character, and the representation of her relationship with Tom is undistorted by either hindsight or nostalgia. This temporal collapse captures the nature of acute grief and trauma: It's not simply that Tom is unable to imagine a future without Karin, it's that he's unable to process the past as past. The effect is often jarring as disordered fragments from past and present are set against one another without signposts or connective tissue. In contemporary fiction, this technique is used infrequently enough for it to feel radical here, particularly in this sustained form.
With the death last month of the sociologist Zygmunt Bauman at age 91, the intellectual world lost a thinker of rare insight and range. Because his style of work was radically different from that of most social scientists in the United States today, his passing is an occasion to consider what might be gained if more members of our profession were to follow his example.\n\nMr. Bauman wrote scores of books and taught for many years at the University of Leeds, in England. He became a scholar to be reckoned with relatively late in his career. A major success came in 1989, at age 64, when he published a landmark study, Modernity and the Holocaust. Against the widespread view that the Holocaust reflected an anti-Semitic madness that had seized civilized Germany and thrown it back into an atavistic state, Mr. Bauman described the genocide as an all-too-characteristic creature of the modern era.\n\nThe early 20th century, he noted, had brought us large-scale factories, efficient systems of transport, huge enterprises with disciplined work forces and pseudoscientific ideologies like eugenics. These were essential elements, alongside anti-Semitism, of Hitler's mass slaughter. Mr. Bauman argued that we must not celebrate the achievements of the modern age without also paying attention to its dark side.\n\nModernity and the Holocaust was a work of theory and synthesis. He collected no data and had no methodology to speak of. That didn't make it any less of a powerful contribution.
What is a fashion magazine without photo shoots? Without those glossy images of models, photographed in glamorous locales and produced by a small army of hairstylists, makeup artists, editors and assistants?\n\nIt's a more environmentally friendly magazine, for one. Or so says Italian Vogue, which aims to make a statement about sustainability this month by omitting photo shoots.\n\nIn his January 2020 note to readers, Emanuele Farneti, the editor in chief, described what it takes to fill one issue of his magazine (in this example, the traditionally thick September issue) with original photographs:\n\nOne hundred and fifty people involved. About twenty flights and a dozen or so train journeys. Forty cars on standby. Sixty international deliveries. Lights switched on for at least ten hours nonstop, partly powered by gasoline-fuelled generators. Food waste from the catering services. Plastic to wrap the garments. Electricity to recharge phones, cameras …\n\nOwning up to this pollution was important to Mr. Farneti, particularly after he and the 25 other international Vogue editors made a pledge in December to help preserve our planet for future generations and show respect for our natural environment.
With so few male descendants left in the line of succession, Mr. Abe suggested on Friday that other branches of the former imperial family could be accorded a status that would allow men in their lines to ascend to the throne. The largest opposition party, the Democratic Party, has proposed changing the law to allow women to reign.\n\nUntil the 20th century, emperors kept concubines in order to ensure the birth of male heirs. No one has proposed reviving that practice.\n\nJapan is one of the few monarchies that do not allow women to reign. According to Naotaka Kimizuka, professor of European history and politics at Kanto Gakuin University, successors to the throne in the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Norway and Spain are all young women.\n\nWhile the Japanese stipulation that the throne must pass through the male line dates back to the Meiji era in the 19th century, historians trace the dawn of the imperial system to the fourth or fifth century, although Japanese myth traces the emperor's lineage back 2,700 years. In the 125 generations that have been recorded since, eight women were allowed to rule as empresses when no adult men were eligible at the time.\n\nAge or marital status ensured that these empresses did not bear children who would be fathered by men outside the imperial line, and they effectively served as placeholders until a man with a patrilineal claim came of age. The last empress, Gosakuramachi, reigned from 1762 to 1770 before her nephew succeeded her.\n\nIsao Tokoro, professor emeritus of legal history at Kyoto Sangyo University and an expert on the history of the imperial family, said that in the seventh and eighth centuries, Japanese law actually allowed women to reign as empresses. But that changed when Japan imported some tenets of government from China, adopting the concept of a male-only lineage for emperors. Even Japanese myth points to a female origin story for the imperial line: The first emperor, Jimmu, is said to have descended from the sun goddess Amaterasu 2,700 years ago.\n\nJapan will be laughed at in the world if we keep saying only men can inherit the throne, Mr. Tokoro said.
WASHINGTON — Democrats returned Representative Nancy Pelosi of California to the House speakership on Sunday for what may be her final term, handing a tested leader control of the slimmest majority in almost two decades as Washington prepares for a new Democratic president.\n\nThe nearly party-line vote punctuated an opening day marked more by precaution than pomp, as the 117th Congress convened under the threat of a deadly pandemic and awaited a pair of Senate runoffs in Georgia that will determine control of that chamber. Several House members sick with Covid-19 missed the session altogether and others cast their votes from behind a plexiglass enclosure specially constructed in a gallery overlooking the chamber.\n\nHer victory means that after two years as President Trump's most outspoken antagonist, Ms. Pelosi will now be responsible for trying to shepherd through Congress as much of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s agenda as possible.\n\nScripture tells us that to everything, there is a season: a time for every purpose under the heavens; a time to build, a time to sow, a time to heal, she said in a speech after winning the speakership. Now is certainly a time for our nation to heal. Our most urgent priority will continue to be defeating the coronavirus. And defeat it, we will.
This is definitely not the way that announcers in New Orleans — or, for that matter, commentators on the TNT network — will introduce the four-player lineup for the N.B.A.'s slam dunk contest on Saturday night.\n\nPlease welcome … Aaron Gordon, who has averaged 8.8 points per game in three seasons for the Orlando Magic …\n\nDerrick Jones Jr., who has scored a total of 11 points in seven games for the Phoenix Suns …\n\nGlenn Robinson III, with his 4.3-point average over five seasons for three different teams ...\n\nAnd DeAndre Jordan, the one name casual fans should know, with his per-game averages of 8.9 points and 10 rebounds in nine years with the titleless Los Angeles Clippers.
To the Editor:\n\nRe What's Going On in Our Prisons?, by Michele Deitch and Michael B. Mushlin (Op-Ed, Jan. 4):\n\nThe New York Times has consistently documented the gross abuses within our prisons, from the overuse of solitary confinement and its detrimental effects on inmates, to the horrific deaths of those under custody allegedly at the hands of correction officers.\n\nLast month, the New York Assembly's Committee on Correction held a hearing in which experts testified about the positive impact that independent oversight entities have on improving correctional settings and laid out models that work.\n\nThe need for change is clear. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo should heed the Op-Ed writers' call for the creation of such an entity in New York State prisons and include funding for it in the 2016-17 executive budget.\n\nDANIEL O'DONNELL\n\nNew York\n\nThe writer is chairman of the New York Assembly's Standing Committee on Correction.
The world is, as everyone knows, going to hell, but there's still the nervous thrill of waiting to see precisely which dark force will take us down. Will the economy collapse first, the ice sheets melt first, or chaos and war envelop us first?\n\nSo here's my antidote to that gloom: Let me try to make the case that 2018 was actually the best year in human history.\n\nEach day on average, about another 295,000 people around the world gained access to electricity for the first time, according to Max Roser of Oxford University and his Our World in Data website. Every day, another 305,000 were able to access clean drinking water for the first time. And each day an additional 620,000 people were able to get online for the first time.\n\nNever before has such a large portion of humanity been literate, enjoyed a middle-class cushion, lived such long lives, had access to family planning or been confident that their children would survive. Let's hit pause on our fears and frustrations and share a nanosecond of celebration at this backdrop of progress.
But the corners seemed to be coming up. The wheels were coming off. I thought, every day, about applying to graduate school. My job was running its course. There was no room to grow, and after three years the voyeuristic thrill of answering someone else's phone had worn thin. I no longer wanted to amuse myself with submissions from the slush pile, or continue filing author contracts and royalty statements in places where they did not belong, like my desk drawer. My freelance work, proofreading and copyediting manuscripts for a small press, was also waning in volume, because I had recently broken up with the editor who assigned it to me. The relationship had been stressful, but reliably consuming: the editor, several years my senior, had talked about marriage but wouldn't stop cheating. These infidelities were revealed after he borrowed my laptop for a weekend and returned it without logging out of his accounts, where I read a series of romantic and brooding private messages he exchanged with a voluptuous folk singer via the social network everyone hated. That year, I hated it extra.\n\nI was oblivious to Silicon Valley, and contentedly so. It's not that I was a Luddite—I could point-and-click before I could read. I just never opened the business section. Like anyone else with a desk job, I spent the majority of my waking hours peering into a computer, typing and tabbing through the days, the web browser a current of digital digression running beneath my work. At home, I wasted time scrolling through the photos and errant musings of people I should have long since forgotten, and exchanged endless, searching emails with friends, in which we swapped inexpert professional and dating advice. I read the online archives of literary magazines that no longer existed, digitally window-shopped for clothing I could not afford, and created and abandoned private, aspirational blogs with names like A Meaningful Life, in the vain hope that they might push me closer to leading one. Still, it never occurred to me that I might someday become one of the people working behind the internet, because I had never considered that there were people behind the internet at all.\n\nIn the manner of so many twentysomethings living in North Brooklyn at a time when an artisanal chocolate factory was considered a local landmark and people spoke earnestly about urban homesteading, my life was affectedly analog. I took photographs with an old, medium-format camera that had belonged to my grandfather, then scanned those photographs into my dying laptop, its internal fan whirring, to upload to my blogs. I sat atop busted amplifiers and cold radiators in Bushwick practice spaces, paging through back issues of prestige magazines, watching various crushes suck on hand-rolled cigarettes and finger their drumsticks and slide guitars, listening attentively to their noodling in preparation for my feedback to be solicited, though it never was. I went on dates with men who made chapbooks or live-edge wood furniture; one identified as an experimental baker. My to-do list always included archaic chores like buying a new needle for the record player I rarely used or a battery for the watch I never remembered to wear. I refused to own a microwave.\n\n[ Return to the review of Uncanny Valley. ]\n\nInsofar as I considered the technology industry of any importance to my own life, it was only because of circulating concerns specific to my professional world. An online superstore that had gotten its start in the nineties by selling books on the World Wide Web—not because the founder had a love of literature, but because he had a love of consumers, and consumptive efficiency—had expanded to become a digital bargain basement dealing in appliances, electronics, groceries, mass fashion, children's toys, cutlery, and various nonnecessities manufactured in China. Having conquered the rest of retail, the online superstore had returned to its roots and seemed to be experimenting with various ways to destroy the publishing industry. It had even gone so far as to start its own publishing imprints, which my literary friends scorned and derided as cheesy and shameless. We ignored the fact that we had many reasons to be grateful to the website, as the publishing industry was being kept afloat by bestselling novels about sadomasochism and vampires who fucked, hatched in the incubator of the online superstore's marketplace for self-published e-books. Within a few years, the founder, a chelonian ex–hedge funder, would become the wealthiest person in the world and undergo a montage-worthy makeover, but at the time we weren't thinking about him. All that mattered to us was that the site was responsible for half of all book sales, which meant it had wrested control of the most important levers: pricing and distribution. It had us in its grip.\n\nI did not know that the tech industry fetishized the online superstore for its cutthroat, data-driven company culture, or that its proprietary recommendation algorithms, which suggested vacuum cleaner bags and diapers alongside novels about dysfunctional families, were considered cutting-edge, admirable, and at the fore of applied machine learning. I did not know that the online superstore also had a lucrative sister business selling cloud-computing services—metered use of a sprawling, international network of server farms—which provided the backend infrastructure for other companies' websites and apps. I did not know that it was nearly impossible to use the internet at all without enriching the online superstore or its founder. I only knew that I was expected to loathe both, and I did—loudly, at any opportunity, and with righteous indignation.
Having reordered its domestic map, the N.F.L. may now set its sights on potentially placing a team in London, though significant logistical hurdles must still be addressed.\n\nThe Raiders tried to leave Oakland last year but failed to persuade the owners of other teams to let them build a new stadium in Southern California with the Chargers, who last week announced their move from San Diego to Los Angeles. So the Raiders owner Mark Davis, who also had talked with officials in San Antonio, began meeting with lawmakers in Nevada, who ultimately agreed to contribute $750 million in hotel taxes to help pay for a domed stadium that Davis wants to build in Las Vegas.\n\nLawmakers and business leaders in Oakland can still come up with an alternative plan to keep the Raiders, but time is running short. The City Council voted last month to give Fortress, an investment group, 60 days to persuade the Raiders to consider a plan to build a new stadium in Oakland.\n\nThe Bay Area, millions of stalwart fans and the business community are not giving up on keeping the Raiders here where they belong, Jim Wunderman, president and chief executive of the Bay Area Council, a business and public policy group, said in a statement. We continue to believe that a deal can be reached to build a modern stadium complex that the Raiders deserve and that benefits Oakland.\n\nWe urge the Raiders, the N.F.L. and Oakland to work together to find an agreement that can benefit everyone and avoid the disruption and pain of a costly move. Relocating a franchise with the deep roots and storied history that the Raiders have here in the Bay Area would be a disaster for the community.\n\nRaiders fans were not surprised at the move but were still angered by it.\n\nWhy would you rip a team out of a market that has supported you for more than four decades? said Jim Zelinski, a lifelong Raiders fan who helps run Save Oakland Sports. The Raiders mystique will be gone forever if they move to Las Vegas and play in an air-conditioned dome.
No matter how much free time you have this weekend, we have TV recommendations for you. Come back every Friday for new suggestions from our TV critic on what to watch.\n\nThis Weekend I Have … a Half-Hour, and I Love People\n\n'High Maintenance'\n\nWhen to watch: Friday at 11 p.m., on HBO.\n\nAdd it to your Watchlist\n\nThis hilarious, often poignant anthology series about a weed delivery guy (Ben Sinclair) returns for a new batch of episodes, more tender and revealing than ever. High Maintenance is as curious about its characters and their struggles as any show in living memory, and it covers an astonishing amount of ground in short segments. No stoner tendencies required, but you'll get more out of the show's quiet callbacks if you start with its early web episodes, available on HBO Go.\n\n—\n\n… an Hour, and I Love Sea Creatures
New Year's resolutions often mean doing more, like working out more or saving more for retirement. But one common thread we found was that if you want to lower your climate footprint, you can find some success in simply consuming less. And it will save you money, too.\n\nHang onto your phone\n\nTake, for example, your cellphone. Most of us hold onto them for only two years, but as we noted in November, producing a common smartphone released the equivalent of 178 pounds of carbon dioxide, about as much running a modern refrigerator for a year. That is one of the biggest reasons that the global carbon footprint of smartphones is projected to increase by 730 percent this decade.\n\nWhile some companies are making strides in reducing the environmental impact associated with producing our favorite mobile devices, hanging onto your phone for longer than two years is one way to make a difference.\n\nBuy less clothing\n\nAnother thing that's helpful to hold onto? Your old clothes. The amount of textile waste in the United States increased by more than 800 percent from 1960 to 2015, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

Credit Credit... Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times WASHINGTON — House Democrats returned Representative Nancy Pelosi of California to the speakership on Sunday for what may be her final term, handing a tested leader control of the slimmest House majority either party has faced in two decades. Ms. Pelosi secured 216 votes, narrowly topping the 209 of Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House Republican leader. She managed to keep defections to just a handful, winning over several Democrats who had opposed her two years ago when the party had a more comfortable majority. The nearly party-line vote punctuated an opening day marked more by precaution than pomp, as the 117th Congress convened for the first time under the threat of a deadly coronavirus pandemic that has rattled its ranks and the country. Several House members sick with Covid-19 missed the session altogether and others cast their vote from behind a plexiglass enclosure specially constructed in a gallery overlooking the chamber. After two years as President Trump's most outspoken Democratic antagonist, Ms. Pelosi will now be responsible for trying to shepherd through Congress as much of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s agenda as possible, while maintaining her party's majority ahead of next year's midterm elections. It will be no easy task. With her party in control of just 222 of 435 seats, Ms. Pelosi can afford to lose only a handful of Democrats on any given vote and faces a Republican opposition empowered by a better than expected showing in November's election. She will also have to contend with a health crisis that can sideline lawmakers at any moment. Scripture tells us that to everything, there is a season: a time for every purpose under the heavens; a time to build, a time to sow, a time to heal, Ms. Pelosi said after accepting the gavel. Now is certainly a time for our nation to heal. Our most urgent priority will continue to be defeating the coronavirus. And defeat it, we will.

Pete Marovich for The New York Times On the other side of the Capitol, the Senate convened an even more subdued opening day as both parties await a pair of runoff elections in Georgia on Tuesday that will determine which of them begins the year in control. The outcome could determine the fate of Mr. Biden's legislative goals on climate change, taxes and health care; his response to the coronavirus pandemic; and his ability to fill his cabinet and influential federal judgeships. Republicans currently have an edge, with 51 seats to Democrats' 48. Democrats would have to sweep both races to draw the chamber to a tie and effectively take control when Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, who would cast tiebreaking votes when needed, is sworn in with Mr. Biden on Jan. 20. With the coronavirus circulating rampantly, members-elect expected little of the pomp that usually accompanies Congress's initial convening. Lawmakers took the oath of office and voted for speaker in small groups, rather than all together in the normally boisterous hall of the House. The architect of the Capitol had even constructed a small plexiglass enclosure in one of the galleries overlooking the chamber so that three lawmakers in a protective quarantine could vote in person but not mingle on the House floor. Nor was there much promise that the partisan warfare that has seized the capital in recent years would soon subside with the new session. After they are sworn in, a growing cohort of Republican senators and House members plan to initiate a long-shot attempt on Wednesday to try to overturn Mr. Biden's victory and deliver a second term to Mr. Trump. The attempt will fail, but only after it cleaves the Republican Party in two and further erodes confidence in Mr. Biden's legitimacy among the president's most ardent supporters.\n\nTrump demands in a call that a Georgia official 'find' votes to overturn the election. President Trump has spent almost nine weeks making false conspiracy claims about his election loss. Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times WASHINGTON — President Trump demanded that Georgia's Republican secretary of state find him enough votes to overturn the presidential election, and vaguely threatened him with a criminal offense, during an hourlong telephone conversation with him on Saturday, according to audio excerpts from the conversation. Mr. Trump, who has spent almost nine weeks making false conspiracy claims about his loss to President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., told Brad Raffensperger, the state's top elections official, that Mr. Raffensperger should recalculate the vote count so Mr. Trump would win the state's 16 electoral votes. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have, Mr. Trump said on the call, a recording of which was obtained by The Washington Post, which published excerpts from the audio on its website Sunday. Because we won the state. Mr. Raffensperger rejected the president's efforts to get him to reverse the election results, which are set to be certified by Congress during a session on Wednesday. Some of Mr. Trump's allies in the House and the Senate have said they will object to the results of the elections in several states, including Georgia. But Mr. Raffensperger told Mr. Trump that he stood by the results. Well, Mr. President, the challenge that you have is the data you have is wrong, he said, according to the audio recording. During the call, the president offered several false conspiracy theories, including debunked charges that ballots in Fulton County were shredded and that voting machines operated by Dominion Voting Systems were tampered with and replaced. Ryan Germany, the legal counsel in Mr. Raffensperger's office, can be heard telling the president that such charges are untrue. You should want to have an accurate election. And you're a Republican, Mr. Trump told Mr. Raffensperger, who replied that we believe that we do have an accurate election. Mr. Trump responded: No, no, no, you don't, you don't have, you don't have, not even close. You guys, you're off by hundreds of thousands of votes. Then the president suggested that Mr. Raffensperger could be prosecuted criminally. You know what they did and you're not reporting it, the president said. You know, that's a criminal — that's a criminal offense. And you know, you can't let that happen. That's a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer. That's a big risk. The president confirmed the call in a tweet Sunday morning, claiming that Mr. Raffensperger was unwilling, or unable, to answer questions such as the 'ballots under table' scam, ballot destruction, out of state 'voters', dead voters, and more. He has no clue! In a response on Twitter, Mr. Raffensperger wrote: Respectfully, President Trump: What you're saying is not true. The truth will come out.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTrump plans to award nation's highest civilian honors to his most devoted defenders. Representative Devin Nunes during a television interview at the Russell Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill. Credit... Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times President Trump plans to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom in the coming days to two of his most outspoken Republican defenders in the House, Representatives Devin Nunes of California and Jim Jordan of Ohio, two officials familiar with his plans said. The award is the nation's highest civilian honor, meant to recognize exceptional contributions to national security, world peace or cultural and other significant endeavors. While presidents have bestowed the honor on members of Congress in the past, it has typically been granted at the end of a lawmaker's time in public service or in recognition for an unrelated achievement. In the case of Mr. Nunes and Mr. Jordan, however, Mr. Trump wants to honor the lawmakers for their leading roles in personally defending him against the F.B.I.'s investigation of Russian election interference and the House's impeachment inquiry, according to the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss plans not yet made public. Both investigations uncovered wrongdoing by the president and his advisers, but Mr. Trump viewed them as partisan witch hunts, demanding his party rally around him to fend them off. Mr. Nunes and Mr. Jordan enthusiastically answered the call, working in public and in private to dig up unflattering information about those investigating the president, including his own Justice Department, which they would then publicize, often with the help of the White House. The two took a similar approach when Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump based on his attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Joseph R. Biden Jr. Mr. Jordan, a pugnacious force in congressional hearings, became the face of Mr. Trump's defense on Capitol Hill, ultimately helping to win his acquittal in the Republican-controlled Senate. The work infuriated Democrats, but it made Mr. Nunes and Mr. Jordan heroes on the right and persuaded many in their party to follow suit. In 2018, Mr. Trump said that Mr. Nunes, then the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, ought to be awarded the Medal of Freedom or the Medal of Honor, which is reserved for military valor, based on his attempts to discredit the Russia investigation. That Mr. Trump is doing so now, even as he refuses to concede his election defeat, suggests that he recognizes his time in office is limited. Mr. Nunes will receive the honor in a ceremony on Monday, and Mr. Trump is likely to bestow it upon Mr. Jordan next week. The Washington Post first reported the awards. Nicholas Fandos and\n\nFormer defense secretaries warn: Using the military to settle the election would be 'unlawful' and 'unconstitutional.' In an op-ed, all 10 living former defense secretaries call for a smooth transition between administrations as President Trump refuses to accept his defeat in the November election. Credit... Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times All 10 living former defense secretaries warned in an op-ed on Sunday against involving the military in election disputes and urged leaders at the Defense Department to facilitate a smooth transition with the incoming administration. The op-ed, published by The Washington Post, was an extraordinary public statement from a group of officials who served presidents from both parties. Its signatories included President Trump's two Senate-confirmed defense secretaries, James N. Mattis and Mark T. Esper, as well as former Vice President Dick Cheney. The former defense secretaries weighed in with one voice as Mr. Trump continues to make baseless claims about the election and refuses to recognize his defeat. Our elections have occurred, they wrote. Recounts and audits have been conducted. Appropriate challenges have been addressed by the courts. Governors have certified the results. And the Electoral College has voted. The time for questioning the results has passed; the time for the formal counting of the Electoral College votes, as prescribed in the Constitution and statute, has arrived. In the op-ed, the former secretaries — who served under Mr. Trump and Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George Bush and Gerald R. Ford — said unequivocally that the military had no role to play in settling election-related controversies. Efforts to involve the U.S. armed forces in resolving election disputes would take us into dangerous, unlawful and unconstitutional territory, they wrote. Civilian and military officials who direct or carry out such measures would be accountable, including potentially facing criminal penalties, for the grave consequences of their actions on our republic. Retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser whom Mr. Trump recently pardoned, suggested on the conservative television network Newsmax last month that Mr. Trump could use the military to rerun the election in swing states, and later attended a meeting with the president at the White House. The former defense secretaries also called for cooperation at the Pentagon during the transition between administrations, an issue that President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his team have complained about. Last week, Mr. Biden said his transition team had faced obstruction from the Defense Department. In the op-ed, the former defense secretaries noted that transitions can be a moment when the nation is vulnerable to actions by adversaries seeking to take advantage of the situation, and they said it was critical that the transition at the Pentagon be carried out fully, cooperatively and transparently.\n\nPaul Ryan condemns party members' plot to reject Biden's election win. Former House Speaker Paul Ryan during his farewell speech at the Library of Congress in 2018. Credit... Erin Schaff for The New York Times WASHINGTON — Former House Speaker Paul D. Ryan on Sunday issued a rare statement condemning members of his own party for attempting to overturn President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s victory in the November election. As part of an attempt to defy the election results and indulge President Trump's attempts to remain in power, a dozen senators and more than 100 Republicans in the House have announced their intention to vote on Wednesday to reject electors chosen by the citizens. Efforts to reject the votes of the Electoral College and sow doubt about Joe Biden's victory strike at the foundation of our republic, Mr. Ryan wrote. It is difficult to conceive of a more anti-democratic and anti-conservative act than a federal intervention to overturn the results of state-certified elections and disenfranchise millions of Americans. The fact that this effort will fail does not mean it will not do significant damage to American democracy. Mr. Ryan's statement comes as some prominent Republicans are pushing back against plans from Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and others to turn a perfunctory session on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to ratify the results of the presidential election into a venue to amplify false claims about the election that have been repeatedly debunked by courts, election officials and Mr. Trump's own Justice Department. The Trump campaign had ample opportunity to challenge election results, and those efforts failed from lack of evidence, Mr. Ryan wrote. The legal process was exhausted, and the results were decisively confirmed. The Department of Justice, too, found no basis for overturning the result. If states wish to reform their processes for future elections, that is their prerogative. But Joe Biden's victory is entirely legitimate. Among those on Sunday who condemned the plot was the No. 3 House Republican, Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who sent a message to fellow Republicans saying that objecting to Mr. Biden's win would set an exceptionally dangerous precedent, threatening to steal states' explicit constitutional responsibility for choosing the president and bestowing it instead on Congress. This is directly at odds with the Constitution's clear text and our core beliefs as Republicans, Ms. Cheney wrote. A bipartisan group of centrist lawmakers, including a number of Republican senators — Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Mitt Romney of Utah — also urged their fellow party members to stand down. The 2020 election is over, the lawmakers wrote. All challenges through recounts and appeals have been exhausted. At this point, further attempts to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election are contrary to the clearly expressed will of the American people and only serve to undermine Americans' confidence in the already determined election results.

I'm encouraging my colleagues to object, David Perdue said on Sunday. This is something the American people demand right now. Credit... Nicole Craine for The New York Times Two days before runoff elections in Georgia that will determine control of the Senate, one of the Republicans on the ballot encouraged members of his party to overturn President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s victory in the November election. David Perdue, whose term as a senator ended on Sunday when the 116th Congress concluded its term, called on Republicans in the Senate to defy the results of the election and indulge President Trump's attempts to remain in power. I'm encouraging my colleagues to object, Mr. Perdue said on Fox News. This is something the American people demand right now. The other Republican in a runoff race on Tuesday, Senator Kelly Loeffler of Georgia, continued to repeatedly pledge loyalty to Mr. Trump. Ms. Loeffler, however, declined to directly answer questions about a plan backed by nearly a quarter of Senate Republicans to vote against ratifying the results of the presidential election absent a 10-day audit of returns in certain states. Speaking on Fox News Sunday, Ms. Loeffler said she was seriously looking at supporting the attempt to contest the election, but did not commit to it. Everything is on the table, Ms. Loeffler said. Every state in the country has certified the election results after verifying their accuracy, and judges across the country have rejected nearly 60 attempts by Mr. Trump and his allies to challenge the results. Attorney General William P. Barr acknowledged that the Justice Department had not uncovered any voting fraud that would have changed the results of the election. The senators involved in the plot have acknowledged that their effort was unlikely to succeed. Any such challenge must be sustained by both the House, where Democrats hold the majority, and the Senate, where top Republicans, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, have tried to shut it down. None of the senators supporting the effort have made a specific allegation of fraud, instead offering vague suggestions that some wrongdoing might have occurred and asserting that many of their supporters believe that it has. In a heated interview on NBC's Meet the Press, Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin and one of those supporting the effort, maintained that tens of millions of Americans did not view the election's result as legitimate. While he acknowledged that Mr. Biden won his state by 20,000 votes, he also asserted that there were issues in Wisconsin. The show's host, Chuck Todd, compared Republicans' claims of widespread voter fraud to an arsonist starting a fire, and told Mr. Johnson that he didn't have the guts to tell the truth that this election was fair. Chuck, this fire was started back in, you know, January of 2017, Mr. Johnson responded, criticizing what he perceived as bias in the news media throughout Mr. Trump's term and pointing to a tweet from a lawyer for the government whistle-blower whose concerns helped spur impeachment proceedings. On CNN's State of the Union, Stacey Abrams, a voting rights activist in Georgia, described as troubling efforts by Republicans to declare victory for someone who clearly lost the election. She made a distinction between what Republicans in the Senate planned to do and her own efforts in 2018, when she lost a bid for governor and refused to concede. I never challenged the outcome of the election, she said. I challenged the system that denied access to the right to vote. Appearing on MSNBC, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic majority leader, said the Republican effort would fail but would nonetheless be a sad day for democracy. It is just a tragedy that so many members of the House and the Senate are undermining the confidence in our democracy, he said. Our democracy itself that relies on the peaceful resolution of differences through elections. Luke Broadwater and\n\nPence welcomes lawmakers' push to overturn the election. Eleven Republican senators and senators-elect said they would join Senator Josh Hawley this week in challenging the results of the presidential election. Credit... Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times WASHINGTON — Vice President Mike Pence signaled support on Saturday for a Republican bid to overturn the election in Congress this week, after 11 Republican senators and senators-elect said that they would vote to reject President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s victory when the House and the Senate meet to formally certify it. The announcement by the senators — and Mr. Pence's move to endorse it — reflected a groundswell among Republicans to defy the results of the election and indulge President Trump's attempts to remain in power with false claims of voting fraud. Every state in the country has certified the election results after verifying their accuracy, many following postelection audits or hand counts. Judges across the country, and a Supreme Court with a conservative majority, have rejected nearly 60 attempts by Mr. Trump and his allies to challenge the results. And neither Mr. Pence nor any of the senators who said they would vote to invalidate the election has made a specific allegation of fraud, instead offering vague suggestions that some wrongdoing might have occurred and asserting that many of their supporters believe that it has. The senators' opposition to certifying Mr. Biden's election will not change the outcome. But it guarantees that an otherwise perfunctory session on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to ratify the results of the presidential election will instead become a partisan brawl, in which Republicans amplify specious claims of widespread election rigging that have been debunked for weeks even as Mr. Trump has stoked them. The spectacle promises to set a caustic backdrop for Mr. Biden's inauguration and reflects the polarized politics on Capitol Hill that will be among his greatest challenges. It will also pose a political dilemma for Republicans, forcing them to choose between accepting the results of a democratic election — even if it means angering supporters who dislike the outcome and could punish them at the polls — and joining their colleagues in displaying unflinching loyalty to Mr. Trump, who has demanded that they back his bid to cling to the presidency.\n\nAsian-Americans can tip elections, but for which party? Supporters at an Asian-American and Pacific Islander meet and greet with Jon Ossoff, a Democratic candidate for the Senate, in Suwanee, Ga., last week. Credit... Nicole Craine for The New York Times The message Asian-American voters sent in 2020 was clear: Seek us out, listen to what we tell you, and we can help you win. They turned out in record numbers. In Georgia, the increase in Asian-American voters was so significant in the general election that they could play a decisive role in the two Senate runoff races this week. And on the ballot itself, Asian-American candidates were more visible in national politics than ever, most notably with Kamala Harris, a woman of South Asian descent, becoming the vice president-elect. But the election also offered some caution for Democrats who have long assumed that increasing racial diversity in the United States will benefit them at the ballot box: Demographics alone are not destiny. Asian-American voters and Latino voters made clear that while they generally support Democrats, they do not do so at the same rate as Black voters, and remain very much up for grabs by either party. At the presidential level, Asian-Americans cast a record number of ballots in battleground states where Joseph R. Biden Jr. notched narrow victories. But a New York Times analysis showed that in immigrant neighborhoods across the country, Asian-American and Latino voters shifted to the right. Nationwide, preliminary data suggests that about one in three Asian-Americans supported President Trump — a slight uptick from his support in 2016. For many Democrats who still hope that greater Asian-American political involvement will benefit them, the election illustrated that the party must go after nonwhite voters with the same nuanced approach and level of urgency that has generally been reserved for white voters in swing states. There is a small but still significant bloc of voters that needs to be courted — and that courting needs to be maintained because we're going to have close elections, said Varun Nikore, the president of the AAPI Victory Fund, a super PAC focused on mobilizing Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders to vote for Democratic candidates. But he added: Things can go backward. You can't take the Asian vote for granted.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAtlanta's promise is tested in a year of political and racial tension. Thousands of protesters in downtown Atlanta demonstrating for racial justice. Credit... Joshua Rashaad McFadden for The New York Times For generations, the prevailing mythology of Atlanta has been that it is an undeniably Southern city that is also unlike the rest of the South, a place where the relentless pursuit of economic and social advancement meant casting aside much of the racial division and bitter history that have long dogged the region. But lately, that notion has been tested — by the pandemic; by violent encounters between African-Americans and the police; and by the fluctuating divide between metropolitan Atlanta and the much more conservative and traditional state surrounding it. The pandemic has laid bare gaps in access to opportunity and health care, as the virus has hit the African-American community especially hard. It has also galvanized ideological divides between the city and the state, as the mayor and governor sparred over adopting strict measures to curb the virus's spread. Protests forced many to examine the stubbornness of institutional racism. A meltdown during the summer primaries, with long lines and malfunctioning voting machines, stoked concerns over suppression. Those issues are certainly not Atlanta's alone. But again and again in recent months, the city emerged as an arena in which those tensions played out in vivid and revelatory ways. When Georgia votes on Tuesday, representatives of very different segments of Atlanta will play leading roles in this chapter of the city's history: the Rev. Raphael Warnock, the pastor of Dr. King's famed Ebenezer Baptist Church; and Jon Ossoff, a young media executive from the Atlanta suburbs, are the Democratic candidates. Kelly Loeffler, one of the Republican senators pushed into the runoff, is a wealthy businesswoman who is an owner of the city's professional women's basketball team and has an estate in the affluent Buckhead section of the city. The context of recent events has injected energy into the runoffs, which have already drawn enormous turnout. The election comes after Joseph R. Biden Jr. became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win Georgia in 28 years, a reflection of the party's growing strength in the state, driven overwhelmingly by voters in Atlanta and its suburbs, which together make up nearly half the state vote. It also follows the protracted campaign by President Trump to overturn his loss through recounts, legal challenges and a barrage of baseless allegations of fraud.\n\nThe moments that defined the 116th Congress. The most diverse Congress in the nation's history was sworn in two years ago during the longest government shutdown. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times WASHINGTON — On Sunday, the 116th Congress ended much as it began — filled with anticipation yet bitterly divided — having lurched through a cycle of once-in-a-generation moments packed into two years. The shuttering of the government for more than a month. The impeachment and trial of a president. The deadliest pandemic in a century and a multitrillion-dollar federal response. Even with a few legislative accomplishments, partisan gridlock forced lawmakers to punt on their hopes that they could be the ones to do difficult things. Still, Congress made history of a different kind, ushering in a new era of governing through technology during the pandemic. Here are some of the moments that defined the 116th Congress. Swearing In During a Shutdown With one of the largest classes of newly elected lawmakers in congressional history, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California became the first person in more than 60 years to reclaim the speakership after having lost it. Within hours of her election as speaker, Ms. Pelosi began calling votes on legislation to reopen government agencies that had been closed since late December 2018, as Mr. Trump demanded more money for the border wall that had been his signature campaign promise. But Senate Republicans refused to consider the measure, even before it cleared the House. It set the predicate that would hold firm for most of the Congress: Legislation triumphantly shepherded through by House Democrats would rarely be granted a vote on the Senate floor by Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader. An Impeachment, Then an Acquittal Ms. Pelosi would spend months pushing back on the notion of impeachment before changing course after the president was accused of wrongdoing. But in late August, an intelligence whistle-blower revealed that during a half-hour phone call in July, Mr. Trump had pressured Ukraine's leader to investigate Joseph R. Biden Jr., just as the president was withholding millions of dollars in military assistance for the country. Democrats who had resisted impeaching Mr. Trump swung into action, beginning five months of hearings and investigations that would yield additional details about Mr. Trump's pressure campaign on Ukraine and growing calls for his removal. The House voted to charge Mr. Trump with high crimes and misdemeanors, with Republicans unanimously opposed. It was the third impeachment of an American president in history. The outcome in the Senate was never in doubt, as most Republicans quickly concluded that his actions did not warrant his removal. Legislating in a Pandemic As the pandemic spread to the Capitol, lawmakers raced to complete a $2.2 trillion stimulus law. By the end of 2020, nearly 10 percent of Congress had contracted the coronavirus, temporarily hospitalizing at least two lawmakers and forcing a number of lawmakers to quarantine. Democrats moved to allow the House to vote remotely for the first time in the history of the chamber, instituting a system that would allow a lawmaker to have a colleague cast a vote for them by proxy if they were unable to travel. A Stimulus Deal Almost Derailed Republicans' showing in the November elections left Mr. Biden, who was declared the victor soon after, with a slim majority in the House and Democratic control of the Senate contingent on the outcomes of two runoff races in Georgia. The political stakes of the contests helped shift the monthslong debate over providing pandemic relief to millions of unemployed Americans, small businesses, schools and hospitals across the country, prodding leaders into negotiations over another package. Shortly after the election, a group of moderates began work on a compromise framework. They finally yielded a $900 billion deal that passed both chambers days before Christmas after several near-misses. Still, Mr. Trump threatened not to sign it, plunging the fate of the legislation into uncertainty and holding out the possibility of yet another government shutdown. Four days before the new year began, he signed it into law.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nChina's deal with the E.U. is both a rebuke of Trump and a sign of the challenges facing Biden.

A pledge to join other countries in reducing carbon emissions to fight global warming. Now, an investment agreement with the European Union. China's leader, Xi Jinping, has in recent weeks made deals and pledges that he hopes will position his country as an indispensable global leader, even after its handling of the coronavirus and increased belligerence at home and abroad have damaged its international standing. In doing so, he has underlined how difficult it will be for President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. to forge a united front with allies against China's authoritarian policies and trade practices, a central focus of the new administration's plan to compete with Beijing and check its rising power. The image of Mr. Xi joining Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, President Emmanuel Macron of France and other European leaders in a conference call on Wednesday to seal the deal with the European Union also amounted to a stinging rebuke of the Trump administration's efforts to isolate China's Communist Party state. The deals show the leverage Mr. Xi has because of the strength of the Chinese economy, which is now the fastest-growing among major nations as the world continues to struggle with the pandemic. It was also yet another demonstration of how China pays little or no diplomatic cost for abuses that violate European values. The Europeans finalized the investment agreement, for example, a day after the European Union publicly criticized the harsh prison sentence handed down to a Chinese lawyer who reported on the initial coronavirus outbreak in the city of Wuhan. China had to make only modest concessions to overcome increasingly vocal concerns about China's harshest policies, including the crackdown on Hong Kong and the mass detentions and forced labor of Uighurs in Xinjiang, the western Chinese region. China's vast economic and diplomatic influence, especially at this time of global crisis, means that countries feel they have little choice but to engage with it, regardless of their unease over the character of Mr. Xi's hard-line rule. The investment agreement must be ratified by the European Parliament before it can take effect, and it faces signification opposition that could derail it. Claire Fu contributed research.
2. When I became a member of the guild\n\nHanging from the zipper of my camera bag is a small, bronze key. It grants me access to the backdoor of the Christian IV's Guild clubhouse in the Danish city of Aalborg. Over the past year, I've accumulated soccer jerseys, paintings and a handwritten poem about an Italian horse, but this key, a symbol of my membership in a Danish society with roots in World War II, has to be the oddest gift. How I got it is just one of many examples of how dropping your guard and letting strangers into your life can lead to experiences far outside the realm of conventional tourism.\n\nIt started with Kit Sorensen, a friend twice-removed, who I met on my first afternoon in Aalborg. By the evening, she had taken off work for the remainder of the week to show me around. She took me out for pickled fish and aquavit, the straight-to-your-head spirit that Danes insist on drinking with lunch. Together, we explored World War II bunkers and the city-within-a-city of Fjordbyen. Sensing that I craved a home-cooked meal, she invited me to her family's house, where I made even more friends — and got invited by a stranger to join the Christian IV's Guild because he felt that I had what it takes.\n\nWhen traveling alone, it's up to you how alone you really are. Sit at a bar and take a break from your phone and in minutes you'll be getting a laundry list of things to do from a local — as I did in Munich, in Danang, in Tunis. You might be invited to their homes — as I was in Georgia, Puerto Rico, Bulgaria. In a quiet bar in the small Japanese city of Takamatsu you might find yourself the only customer, going on a deep dive into salsa and New Orleans jazz with a cat-loving bartender who you would have never known if you hadn't smiled and said hello.\n\nThere are walls that as a man traveling alone I didn't have to put up. Being ethnically ambiguous was also, it turns out, my superpower, blending into the streets of so many places around the world, walking home at night and not even getting a second glance from locals. One's experience of the world so often depends on one's identity, and I can only speak to mine. At the same time, I believe that, in general, travelers will encounter kindness far more often than hostility. An open mind, a willingness to learn and an acknowledgment of our own ignorance about a new place or culture flings the doors that separate us wide open. Just ask all my new pen pals.
In the late 1970s, the United Aut­­­­­omobile Workers union had a brazen idea. During negotiations for a new contract, members asked Chrysler to give workers representation on its board, a practice called co-determination that had been germinating all over Europe.\n\nThe proposal was far outside the bounds of management-labor relations in America at the time, and Chrysler was initially immovable. But the union had helped secure a federal loan for the company, which shielded it from bankruptcy, and management eventually relented. In 1980, Chrysler's chief executive, Lee Iacocca, nominated the U.A.W. leader Douglas Fraser to the board as a reward.\n\nBut the presence of a single labor representative on a 17-member board did not translate into meaningful results for workers. At one point, Mr. Fraser did vote against a plush executive pay package, but he was the only nay. He stepped down in 1984, and Chrysler eliminated the union seat altogether in 1991. Only a handful of other companies tried worker representation, the unions didn't fight for it, and the American experiment in co-determination was over before it began.\n\nIn today's Gilded Age — when chief executives are making well over 300 times what the typical worker brings home in pay — the idea is getting new life. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who recently announced her bid for president, introduced a bill last year to give workers the right to vote for two-fifths of all corporate board seats, with a companion bill in the House by Representatives introduced by Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico. A similar bill by Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin would entitle workers to elect one-third of the seats.
WASHINGTON — President Trump's relentless effort to overturn the result of the election that he lost has become the most serious stress test of American democracy in generations, one led not by outside revolutionaries intent on bringing down the system but by the very leader charged with defending it.\n\nIn the 220 years since a defeated John Adams turned over the White House to his rival, firmly establishing the peaceful transfer of authority as a bedrock principle, no sitting president who lost an election has tried to hang onto power by rejecting the Electoral College and subverting the will of the voters — until now. It is a scenario at once utterly unthinkable and yet feared since the beginning of Mr. Trump's tenure.\n\nThe president has gone well beyond simply venting his grievances or creating a face-saving narrative to explain away a loss, as advisers privately suggested he was doing in the days after the Nov. 3 vote. Instead, he has stretched or crossed the boundaries of tradition, propriety and perhaps the law to find any way he can to cling to office beyond his term that expires in two weeks. That he is almost certain to fail and that President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. will be inaugurated on Jan. 20 does not mitigate the damage he is doing to democracy by undermining public faith in the electoral system.\n\nMr. Trump's hourlong telephone call over the weekend with Georgia's chief election official, Brad Raffensperger, pressuring him to find enough votes to overturn Mr. Biden's victory in that state only brought into stark relief what the president has been doing for weeks. He has called the Republican governors of Georgia and Arizona to get them to intervene. He has summoned Michigan's Republican Legislature leaders to the White House to pressure them to change their state's results. He called the Republican speaker of the Pennsylvania House multiple times seeking help to reverse the outcome there.
Greetings Earthlings! This is your planet and its moon as seen from Mars, some 127 million miles away.\n\nThis composite image, which was released by NASA on Friday, was created using a special camera aboard the agency's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which is a spacecraft orbiting about 180 miles above the red planet. The camera is called the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment. It provides scientists with detailed views of the Martian surface so they can better study geological features like its volcanoes and gullies, as well as scope out potential landing sites for future missions.\n\nIt's the biggest telescope ever sent to another planet, said Alfred McEwen a planetary geologist at the University of Arizona and the principal investigator of HiRise. Dr. McEwen said that the image was taken while NASA researchers were trying to calibrate the camera. NASA knows precisely what color the moon's near side is, so when it wants to calibrate HiRise, it points it at the moon and takes some images. NASA then analyzes the pictures and if the colors appear off it can correct the calibration.\n\nThe moon is boring. It doesn't change, it's relatively bland and it doesn't have all of these variations or changing clouds. It's a good calibration target, Dr. McEwen said. The Earth is a bad calibration target with all its variability like clouds and such, but it makes a pretty picture.
Under Coryell with the Chargers, Fouts became a star in an offense that didn't emphasize running the ball, which was the standard approach in that era. To create mismatches, Coryell didn't set up players in the exact spots and roles prescribed in textbooks.\n\nBefore the snap, he had players moving. After the snap, he had Fouts throw, throw and throw the ball, farther and more often than any team before. Those Chargers even threw to the usually neglected tight end position, where they had the future Hall of Famer Kellen Winslow. The Chargers' passing game became so distinctive that it gained a nickname: Air Coryell.\n\nMy best argument for why Don Coryell should be in the Hall of Fame is this: Ask yourself, how did the game get to the point where 4,000 yards is the norm now and where this three-, four-, five-wide-receiver stuff is the norm, and passing more than running is the norm? Fouts said. That was Don Coryell.\n\nCoryell brought life to the Chargers, who hadn't had a winning season in nearly a decade before he showed up, and his explosive offense — Fouts said the players considered any game under 40 points disappointing — rallied the city around the team. Finally, San Diego had a franchise to be proud of, and the Chargers were winning in style: They led the league in passing for six straight seasons, from 1978 through 1983, and then did it again in 1985.\n\nBefore Coryell, things were rough, Fouts said. We were drawing 25-30,000, and most of them were booing the quarterback. He helped turn things around, and Charger power was born. You hear about love affairs, and it was kind of like that. It was special.\n\nMindy Lewis, Coryell's daughter, remembers her father, who died in 2010, as the city's saint. She recalled bumper stickers reading Coryell for President and Coryell Saves.
South Korea will send a delegation to negotiate the release of a ship and its 20-member crew after the vessel was seized by Iranian forces, officials said on Tuesday, the latest development in a provocation by the government in Tehran, which has been economically isolated by U.S. sanctions.\n\nIranian officials said the ship was detained in the Persian Gulf by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps because it had violated environmental protocols and was polluting the sea, according to Iranian state news agencies. The ship was carrying 7,200 tons of chemicals, mostly methanol, according to the South Korean company that owns it, which has denied that it was polluting the waters.\n\nThe tensions come as Tehran has sought to pressure the government in Seoul to release about $7 billion in revenues from oil sales that remain frozen in South Korean banks since the Trump administration tightened sanctions on Iran.\n\nBut they also follow recent escalation of tensions between the United States and Iran as President Trump's term draws to a close. Iran said on Monday that it was starting to increase nuclear enrichment levels at a key facility to 20 percent, a step closer to developing the capacity to produce a nuclear weapon. The Pentagon said on Sunday that it had directed the aircraft carrier Nimitz to remain in the Middle East, days after it had ordered the ship to return home, because of Iranian threats against Mr. Trump and other American officials.
LONDON — Producing more of the same is what the Six Nations Championship, the biggest event in European rugby union, is mostly about.\n\nThis year's tournament starts Saturday and stretches over five of the next seven weekends to a conclusion on March 18. Its appeal rests on a sense of continuity dating from 1883, when the so-called home nations — England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales — competed in the first set of matches, and to France's entry in the event in 1910, when it became known as the Five Nations Championship. Italy joined in 2000.\n\nBut the 15 matches this year will offer something different. It is not just the introduction of bonus points for teams that score four or more tries in an 80-minute match, or lose by fewer than 7 points. The real novelty will be evident the first time a tackling player's hands stray near a ball carrier's neck and head.\n\nIt is not that the rules have been changed. Tackling an opponent around the head or neck has long been illegal. The change is in the refereeing practice, which follows new guidelines issued by World Rugby, the game's governing body.
MindNode handles formatting of the nodes and their arrangement on the page for you. You just have to type in your ideas and tap on the screen a few times as you create a new map. The app keeps out of your way, so it doesn't interrupt your thought processes.\n\nThe interface is minimal, and previously entered information can be edited easily, either by changing what you wrote or moving ideas to a new position on the screen. You are not limited to text-only mind maps either, since you can drop images onto the page as extra visual cues.\n\nThe app offers different color themes so users can change how their mind maps appear. MindNode is relatively expensive at $10.\n\nMind Vector is another decent mind-mapping app, available for iOS and Android. It has features similar to MindNode's, but it produces bolder, more colorful maps. You can even choose images as backgrounds.
To the Editor:\n\nRe Trump Imperils the Planet (editorial, Dec. 28):\n\nThis editorial is correct about the destructiveness of President Trump's actions on climate change. It accurately and poignantly portrays the status of the climate change movement. It is buttressed with historical and scientific fact. It impassionedly appeals to our hearts, minds and souls.\n\nUnfortunately, however, it misses what would be most effective — namely, removing the corrupt power of oil companies and other wealthy interests over government. This power is exerted through the legal bribery of public officials with lobbying and other money by the rich heads of private industries. And that problem could be fixed by rewriting campaign finance law.\n\nNo matter how persuasive the pro-climate argument, no matter how great a majority of the public can be convinced to support climate change action, that action will not happen so long as government officials depend for their political livelihood on the fossil fuel industry.\n\nArt Saluk\n\nPembroke Pines, Fla.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nThank you so much for your powerful and insightful editorial. In 20 or 30 years we can look back on climate change and see if we should have done more about it sooner.
So much death, laments King Theoden in Tolkien's The Two Towers. The question he asks next is one that I too struggle to answer, What can men do against such reckless hate? Because it's just not possible to delete messages for every terrible thing the world contains.\n\nSometimes I think about John Lennon's sweet song Across the Universe and its refrain, Nothing's going to change my world. It's a strangely transcendent lyric, but when I hear it now, the words sometimes make me sad, given that Lennon's world was indeed changed by a deranged young man with a .38 Special.\n\nOften that's been my first response to hate — to obstinately declare that my sense of the world cannot be changed, even by violence. Sometimes, this means insulating myself from obscenities, as when I deleted that racist voice mail. That can be a good strategy for self-care.\n\nOther times, I fear it means putting my head in the sand, denying the very reality of the terrible things that hatred has brought about.\n\nAn even worse response — which I'm also guilty of — is to answer hate with hate. On Twitter, for example, I'm hardly generous, especially when it comes to responding to people who think it's clever to diminish my humanity. Am I embarrassed by some of the things I've tweeted — and written — in the heat of the moment? Yes.\n\nOf course, fighting back is only natural when people attack you. A better response would be to try to open hearts. There are many ways of going about this, including getting involved in communities that seek to illuminate the human spirit, communities like Barnard.\n\nAnother thing we can do is to gather together in defiance of the darkness. On Sunday, tens of thousands of New Yorkers did just that, at a rally against anti-Semitism. Events such as these can bring about the very thing Tessa Majors tried to do in her short life — the tethering of one soul to another.
It has been an emotional start to the new year for Rocio Rebollar Gomez and her family.\n\nOn Thursday, after 31 years in the United States, a country where she had built a life and raised three children, including a son now in the United States Army, Ms. Gomez was deported to Tijuana, Mexico, where she had little family left.\n\nThat son, Second Lt. Gibram Cruz, 30, who has been in the Army for five years and rushed to be with her the day after Christmas, said he was shocked at the way his mother was treated and called the actions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement completely inhumane.\n\nMs. Gomez, 51, was previously scheduled to self deport and that plan was known to ICE, the family's lawyer, Tessa Cabrera, said on Friday.\n\nInstead, as the family went to an ICE office to discuss her case, Ms. Gomez was taken across the border to Tijuana without a chance to say goodbye, Ms. Cabrera said.
The Yankees learned on Thursday that Domingo German, the young pitcher who led the team in victories last season, will be suspended until early June under Major League Baseball's domestic violence policy.\n\nThe league announced that German, 27, had accepted an 81-game, unpaid suspension stemming from an incident in September involving German and his girlfriend, with whom he has at least one child, at his residence in Yonkers. No criminal charges were filed against German, who has agreed not to appeal the suspension.\n\nGerman was placed on administrative leave last Sept. 19 as M.L.B. began an investigation, and he did not appear in any regular season or postseason games for the rest of the year. He was held out of 18 games during the investigation, making him ineligible for the Yankees' first 63 games this season. The Yankees' 64th game is scheduled for June 5.\n\nBecause he has already missed one postseason for the violation, German will be allowed to participate if the Yankees qualify for the 2020 postseason (though he will not be permitted to play in spring training games).
GANGNEUNG, South Korea — It was their first outing as a team together, and it was a rout.\n\nThe unified Korean women's hockey team, which skated onto the ice bearing the heaviest symbolic weight of the Pyeongchang Games, lost, 8-0, to Switzerland on Saturday night.\n\nAs the only sports team competing here with athletes from both North and South Korea, the women's ice hockey players had come to represent hopes of a breakthrough in a geopolitical standoff that has stirred fears of nuclear conflict on the divided peninsula.\n\nWith South Korea's president, Moon Jae-in, watching from the stands with Kim Yong-nam, the North's ceremonial head of state, and Kim Yo-jong, the only sister of Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, the diplomatic agenda driving the unified team was never in doubt.\n\nJong Su-hyon, a North Korean player, said at a news conference after the game that playing in front of top leadership of both countries was the greatest honor for me.
Obesity is linked to prostate cancer, scientists know, but it's not clear why. On Monday, researchers reported a surprising connection.\n\nWhen prostate cancers lose a particular gene, they become tiny fat factories, a team at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston reported in a paper published in Nature Genetics.\n\nThen the cancers spread from the prostate, often with deadly effect. Prostate cancers that have not lost that gene also can spread, or metastasize — in mice, at least — but only if they have a ready source of fat from the diet.\n\nThat finding suggests that dietary fat can substitute for the loss of the gene, fueling prostate cancer. Moreover, the investigators found, an obesity drug that blocks fat production can make metastatic prostate cancers regress in mice and prevent them from spreading.
A few years ago, when I was self-employed and had recently had my second child, my husband went combing through my credit card statements, looking for tax deductions that I'd missed. I'm financially disorganized at the best of times, and with a baby and a toddler, I was barely even trying to keep track of my business expenses. So it's not surprising that I hadn't noticed the hundreds of dollars of weird recurring bank charges that my husband discovered.\n\nIt turned out I'd been signed up for a dubious program that purported to protect users' credit in certain emergency situations. My bank had been accused of fraudulent practices in connection with it and fined $700 million by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the government agency that was Senator Elizabeth Warren's brainchild. I tried, maddeningly, to seek redress from the bank — cycling through phone trees, screaming at automated operators. No one could tell me how I'd been enrolled in the program, or for how long.\n\nEventually, I turned to the C.F.P.B. itself, filling out a simple form on its website. A few weeks later, I was notified that the bank had been deducting money from my account for years, and I was being refunded more than $11,000. Having financed my own maternity leave, I badly needed the money.\n\n[Listen to The Argument podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]
To the Editor:\n\nRe The Patriarchy of Alcoholics Anonymous, by Holly Whitaker (Op-Ed, Dec. 28):\n\nFor anyone who has attended more than a handful of A.A. meetings, Ms. Whitaker's opinion that the organization is patriarchal makes little sense. While it was founded by a group of men nearly a century ago, today's A.A. is nonhierarchical and run by diverse groups of neighborhood volunteers, including many women.\n\nMoreover, Ms. Whitaker mischaracterizes the central tenet of A.A.'s philosophy entirely when she writes that it is designed to break people down. To the contrary, it raises people up through group therapy and community support.\n\nTo support her argument, Ms. Whitaker cavalierly claims that one of the 12 steps is admitting powerlessness but conveniently fails to explain that the step is actually We admitted we were powerless over alcohol and that our lives had become unmanageable, which changes the meaning of the phrase entirely. Going to A.A. is not a sign of weakness in any sense.\n\nIndeed, walking into my first A.A. meeting was the single bravest thing I have ever done. I was in a terrible emotional place and I shared my story, publicly breaking into tears. The outpouring of support that I received from the others moves me to this day. Random people gave me their phone numbers and made sure to take mine. They called and texted me for weeks just to make sure I was doing O.K. The experience will renew your faith in humanity.
Among the many questions raised by the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, perhaps the most pressing is, Why? Yes, General Suleimani was responsible for hundreds of American deaths, and he may have been planning another attack on United States forces. But the greater concern, raised by people from Tucker Carlson on the right to Elizabeth Warren on the left, is how this provocative act fits into America's overall interests — in other words, our grand strategy.\n\nDisturbingly, it's a bit of a trick question. America doesn't really have a grand strategy. What we do have, a patchwork of doctrines left over from the Cold War, fails to match our abilities, our national goals and the changing shape of global threats and opportunities.\n\nAmerica desperately needs a new grand strategy — a concise, high-level vision for our role in the world. Without one, we are just wasting lives and resources.\n\nThe lack of a useful grand strategy has been apparent for a long time. Shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks, one of us, Ms. Field, at the time an Army officer, was dispatched to Central Command to help prepare for the invasion of Iraq, a country that wasn't involved in the assault on our cities. She wondered what objective would lead us to target a third party a thousand miles from Afghanistan. What overarching plan, what strategy, justified such a major undertaking? Four tours of duty overseas never revealed the answer to her.
WASHINGTON — This article is a collaboration between ProPublica and The New York Times.\n\nA year and a half after receiving a detailed complaint from tribal leaders, the Education Department plans to investigate their accusations that the Wolf Point School District in Montana discriminates against Native American students.\n\nIn a Dec. 28 letter, sent hours after The New York Times and ProPublica published an investigation into racial inequities in the district, the department's Office for Civil Rights notified the lawyer representing the tribal executive board of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in eastern Montana that it would look into the complaint. The board includes members of the Assiniboine and Sioux tribes. Native American and mixed-race students make up more than three-quarters of Wolf Point's enrollment.\n\nAccording to the letter, the investigation will focus on whether Wolf Point schools discipline Native students more harshly than white students, shunt them into remedial programs without appropriate cause, and deny them special education evaluations and services.\n\nThe department said it would also examine whether the district failed to respond to a parent's accusations that a Native student was racially harassed. The student was not identified in the tribal complaint or in the letter.
SAN FRANCISCO — A common belief among tech industry insiders is that Silicon Valley has dominated the internet because much of the worldwide network was designed and built by Americans.\n\nNow a growing number of those insiders are worried that proposed export restrictions could short-circuit the pre-eminence of American companies in the next big thing to hit their industry, artificial intelligence.\n\nIn November, the Commerce Department released a list of technologies, including artificial intelligence, that are under consideration for new export rules because of their importance to national security.\n\nTechnology experts worry that blocking the export of A.I. to other countries, or tying it up in red tape, will help A.I. industries flourish in those nations — China, in particular — and compete with American companies.
This is how we're taught to count as children: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Yet our innate grasp of quantities isn't linear. We're more likely to experience the world in ratios, like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16. It's easier for us to see the difference between one and two marbles than 15 and 16 of them.\n\nIn this way, we're a lot like certain types of bats who have shaped the evolution of the plants they pollinate by making proportional judgments about what they're willing to eat. That's the finding of a study published in Science on Thursday. The study set out to answer an old evolutionary riddle: How do plants pollinated by bats get away with offering nectar in much lower sugar concentrations than the bats prefer? It turns out the plants are just giving the bats what they appear to want.\n\nGiven a choice through experiments, bats choose syrupy nectars, with 60 percent sugar — but the plants they pollinate in the wild produce watery nectars with 20 percent sugar.\n\nMaybe it's the plants enforcing a dilute nectar that they prefer on the animals — or maybe it's the bats exerting selection pressure, said York Winter, a professor of cognitive neurobiology at Humboldt University, and one of the study's authors.
Roy J. Glauber, a theoretical physicist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2005 for using quantum theory to explain the field of optics and how light interacts with matter, laying the foundation for the field of quantum optics, died on Dec. 26 in Newton, Mass. He was 93.\n\nHis son, Jeffrey, confirmed the death. He said his father had entered Newton Wellesley Hospital that morning having difficulty breathing. No specific cause was given.\n\nDr. Glauber's seminal work addressed an area of research that had been largely ignored in quantum physics. For much of the first half of the 20th century, physicists had concentrated on trying to understand the nature of matter, neglecting the field of optics. That began to change with the development of the laser in 1960. Physicists wanted to understand how it worked vis-à-vis quantum mechanics, the mysterious rules that govern subatomic particles.\n\nFor his part, Dr. Glauber became intrigued by an experiment, performed in 1956 by the British astronomers Robert Hanbury Brown and Richard Q. Twiss, to measure the apparent angular diameter of visible stars. (The angular size of a star is essentially how large the dot of light appears in the night sky.) The two scientists had set up two detectors, which received photons and sent them to a central device for measurements.
Industry insiders and experts said that Mr. Gallimard was the most aggressive publisher in the quest for top awards.\n\nBéatrice Duval, the head of Le Livre de Poche, France's biggest paperback publishing house and a former editor at Gallimard, said that Gallimard's business strategy largely focused on winning prizes.\n\nAt Grasset, Mr. Nora said he began weaning his company off the business model of prizes when he took over two decades ago. Back then, Grasset used to give generous advances to authors who were jurors to secure their loyalty — a practice that eventually attracted the attention of the tax authorities, because the authors often did not bother delivering manuscripts.\n\nNot that it necessarily bothered Grasset. You had somebody who knew that he hadn't honored a contract with you — who was morally indebted to you, a fact that increased your influence over him, Mr. Nora said.\n\nToday, while publishers might lower an author's future advances after poor sales, they would refrain from doing so in the case of an author who sits on a jury, Mr. Nora said.\n\nThe advance won't be lowered or indexed to sales because he belongs to a jury, Mr. Nora said.\n\nThere was not enough talent in France's small literary world to establish a jury system with new judges very year, Mr. Nora said. He suggested that changing a third of each jury every five years would be more feasible and bring in new faces.\n\nBut Ms. Duval said that, more than anything else, it was the literary establishment's resistance that made it impossible to adopt juries that would change every year.
Employee B is a model employee, even more hardworking and independent than A — with lots of initiative. Employee A had said she'd like to return to work in early 2017, most likely in the spring. She just sent me an email stating that because of family gatherings, she would like to return a month later. Basically, that means she'll be on a leave of absence for four months. During the last year she took several weeks' leave to go see distant family, putting me at an inconvenience.\n\nI am torn. Should I simply accede to her wishes as to when she returns, and let Employee B go then? I have been considering keeping Employee B for two and a half hours a week and letting A return for two and a half hours a week. This may seem like a paltry number of hours, but our library is only open a few days a week, and this is a very small town.\n\nCan you give me some guidance as to what is appropriate in this situation? Name Withheld\n\nYou and your employee had a mutual expectation that you'd take her back after her maternity leave on the same terms. Absent a good reason, you owe it to her to respect that expectation. This isn't a legal point: A lawyer could tell you what legal obligations you may or may not have. But it's particularly important to respect your ethical obligations to employees when they have no legal recourse. To do otherwise is to abuse your power over them.\n\nYour ethical obligation survives only as long as she seeks to return within a reasonable time, to be sure. If she announced she was taking another job for a period or going off around the world before returning, your obligations would disappear. But all she's asking for is an extra month or so of time off. As you have a temporary replacement who can stay on, this isn't going to inconvenience you: Indeed, you'll have someone you prefer in the job for a while longer. So it's hard to see why you should refuse her this additional time in these circumstances, even if it isn't what you agreed to.\n\nBut Employee B is better, in your view, and that's surely the real issue. It's why you're tempted to insist on new terms of employment. You think Employee A's request for time off with the family (with its reminder that she has inconvenienced you by doing this before) gives you an excuse not to respect your earlier understanding.\n\nIt doesn't. You could play hardball and tell her that she can come back for the full four hours only if she comes back at the time you originally agreed. But that's difficult to justify, given that, as I say, she's asking you to vary the terms of the agreement in a way that is actually to your advantage. This doesn't mean that you can't make staffing changes down the road. But the onus on a manager is to manage expectations.
Read our updates and analysis from the Golden Globes ceremony.\n\nAfter the Golden Globes hosts Sandra Oh and Andy Samberg delivered a mostly safe opening, going out of their way to praise the work of Hollywood, Oh ended the first segment on an emotional note about improvements in diversity in the film and television industry.\n\nSeveral films in the spotlight this awards season feature women and people of color. Oh's hosting gig is itself a barrier breaker: she is the first Asian woman to front a major awards show in the United States.\n\nOh told the crowd, I wanted to be here to look out into this audience and witness this moment of change. And I'm not fooling myself. I'm not fooling myself. Next year could be different. It probably will be. But right now, this moment is real.\n\nBefore Oh's remarks turned earnest, she and Samberg started off with a bit in which he read Oh's lines off the teleprompter. That evolved into Samberg's newfound understanding about whitewashing in Hollywood, a term that usually refers to white actors being given a part initially written for a person of color.\n\nSAMBERG: Now, I know we are up here joking. But on a serious note, this year, we saw incredible work like Black Panther, Crazy Rich Asians, If Beale Street Could Talk, Roma, Pose, BlacKkKlansman, and many more. And they are not just here tonight because they resonated with audiences Hollywood often ignores, they are here because they told stories that resonated with everyone. And that is truly a beautiful thing. OH: Wow, Andy, can I just say that you just read all of my lines off the teleprompter? SAMBERG: What? No, those were mine. Here, let me keep going. When I was growing up in Canada, the daughter of Korean immigrants, O.K. You know what? You are right. That was totally your stuff. Oh, my God. I just totally whitewashed your speech. That's how it happens. OH: That's not how it happens. SAMBERG: What an amazing learning experience for me. OH: O.K. would you stop talking? SAMBERG: You got it. OH: But if I could take a moment here, in all honesty: I said yes to the fear of being on this stage tonight because — because I wanted to be here to look out into this audience and witness this moment of change. And I'm not fooling myself. I'm not fooling myself. Next year could be different. It probably will be. But right now, this moment is real. Trust me, it is real. Because I see you. And I see you. All of these faces of change. And now so will everyone else.\n\nHere's the full list of winners.
On the first day of deer hunting season, Stephen Tucker, a 27-year-old farmer in Tennessee, shouldered his muzzleloader and aimed at a whitetail with an extraordinary rack, one so big that it would be a world record if his aim was true.\n\nThe antlers, a spectacular protrusion of bones that splayed into dozens of points, were the stuff of hunting lore. The buck had clearly lived long and lived well.\n\nI've never ever seen anything like that, Tucker said.\n\nHe pulled the trigger.\n\nWhen I squeezed, all that went off was the primer cap, he said. The deer fled.\n\nTwo days later, though, on Nov. 7, Tucker got another chance when he spotted the deer at dawn. This time, he got his buck. It was big, but how big? I thought maybe a state record, but not a world record, he said.
