{"original": "she managed to keep defections to just a handful, winning over several democrats who had opposed her two years ago when the party had a more comfortable majority. the nearly party-line vote punctuated an opening day marked more by precaution than pomp, as the 117th congress convened for the first time under the threat of a deadly coronavirus pandemic that has rattled its ranks and the country. several house members sick with covid-19 missed the session altogether and others cast their vote from behind a plexiglass enclosure specially constructed in a gallery overlooking the chamber. after two years as president trump's most outspoken democratic antagonist, ms. pelosi will now be responsible for trying to shepherd through congress as much of president-elect joseph r. biden jr.'s agenda as possible, while maintaining her party's majority ahead of next year's midterm elections. it will be no easy task. with her party in control of just 222 of 435 seats, ms. pelosi can afford to lose only a handful of democrats on any given vote and faces a republican opposition empowered by a better than expected showing in november's election. she will also have to contend with a health crisis that can sideline lawmakers at any moment. scripture tells us that to everything, there is a season: a time for every purpose under the heavens; a time to build, a time to sow, a time to heal, ms. pelosi said after accepting the gavel. now is certainly a time for our nation to heal.", "augmented": []}
