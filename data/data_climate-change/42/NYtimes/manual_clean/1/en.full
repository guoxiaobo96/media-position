But lately, that notion has been tested — by the pandemic; by violent encounters between African-Americans and the police; and by the fluctuating divide between metropolitan Atlanta and the much more conservative and traditional state surrounding it. The pandemic has laid bare gaps in access to opportunity and health care, as the virus has hit the African-American community especially hard. It has also galvanized ideological divides between the city and the state, as the mayor and governor sparred over adopting strict measures to curb the virus's spread. Protests forced many to examine the stubbornness of institutional racism. A meltdown during the summer primaries, with long lines and malfunctioning voting machines, stoked concerns over suppression. Those issues are certainly not Atlanta's alone. But again and again in recent months, the city emerged as an arena in which those tensions played out in vivid and revelatory ways.

Several House members sick with Covid-19 missed the session altogether and others cast their vote from behind a plexiglass enclosure specially constructed in a gallery overlooking the chamber. After two years as President Trump's most outspoken Democratic antagonist, Ms. Pelosi will now be responsible for trying to shepherd through Congress as much of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s agenda as possible, while maintaining her party's majority ahead of next year's midterm elections. It will be no easy task. With her party in control of just 222 of 435 seats, Ms. Pelosi can afford to lose only a handful of Democrats on any given vote and faces a Republican opposition empowered by a better than expected showing in November's election. She will also have to contend with a health crisis that can sideline lawmakers at any moment. Scripture tells us that to everything, there is a season: a time for every purpose under the heavens; a time to build, a time to sow, a time to heal, Ms. Pelosi said after accepting the gavel. Now is certainly a time for our nation to heal.", "augmented": []}

While I have been a strong critic of tech, and it is easy to chew over what's gone wrong — it makes for a large meal — I think it is more helpful, as 2020 dawns, to put forth five predictions that I hope will allow us to live more peacefully with the tech that we love and hate.", "augmented": []}

This is something the American people demand right now. Credit... Nicole Craine for The New York Times Two days before runoff elections in Georgia that will determine control of the Senate, one of the Republicans on the ballot encouraged members of his party to overturn President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s victory in the November election. David Perdue, whose term as a senator ended on Sunday when the 116th Congress concluded its term, called on Republicans in the Senate to defy the results of the election and indulge President Trump's attempts to remain in power. I'm encouraging my colleagues to object, Mr. Perdue said on Fox News. This is something the American people demand right now. The other Republican in a runoff race on Tuesday, Senator Kelly Loeffler of Georgia, continued to repeatedly pledge loyalty to Mr. Trump. Ms. Loeffler, however, declined to directly answer questions about a plan backed by nearly a quarter of Senate Republicans to vote against ratifying the results of the presidential election absent a 10-day audit of returns in certain states. Speaking on Fox News Sunday, Ms. Loeffler said she was seriously looking at supporting the attempt to contest the election, but did not commit to it. Everything is on the table, Ms. Loeffler said.", "augmented": []}

I get that the forces of cynicism, manipulation and hate are forever on the digital march, but I am convinced that there is money to be made in appealing to our weariness with how our tech lives have been shaped. There are ways to foster digital interaction that do not have to incite rage. The reason much of social media feels so toxic is it has been built for speed, virality and attention grabbing rather than for context and accuracy. While it seems impossible to imagine a new kind of social-network product in the shadow of Facebook, TikTok, for all its controversy as a Chinese-owned company, has been a runaway success (the first big social success since Snapchat arrived in 2011), and there is room for more. There are opportunities to create new forms of communication that give the advantage to users — by strictly enforcing behavior standards and eliminating anonymity, and most of all, with advertising-based business plans that are not predicated on taking advantage of our personal data.", "augmented": []}

It wasn't so much that I planned on swimming into mid-November in a lake in Northern California at 3,017 feet, as I just kept going every single day and over time, the water kept getting colder and colder. It was around Oct. 26 where I started to feel that I was doing something unusual and brave and at times painful. My first thought every morning was resentment that my day had this big hard part in the middle of it. But even as the air and water got colder, it didn't get worse, it got better. My body started to get used to it. The big hard part of my day became the best thing in it. My first thought every morning became swimming. And then I would just lie there smiling stupidly into the dark."}

It's unlike anything else I have ever felt in my entire life, and it is just a moment every day when I feel too good to remember that things are bad. And then, honestly, I spend the rest of the day recovering from it, not hyper-focusing on a million tasks, not being free from anxiety, not feeling ready to conquer things. I take a long bath and often fall asleep, and at some point manage to do the work required of me, but it's basically a whole day lost to 20 minutes of extreme pleasure, and that's fine with me."}

{"original": "Do you think conditions have improved for women in STEM fields since you entered the arena? Things have gotten better. The National Science Foundation has a program called Advance, where instead of just trying to hire individual women, you actually try to change the culture, like instead of dropping individual salmon in the stream, we're actually trying to change ecosystems so that more salmon will survive. I did that for five years, and we managed to go from having both the teaching and research faculty at Lamont go from having single-digit numbers of women to having double digits. We still don't see women in as many leadership positions as I'd like, and the harassment issue is probably one of the reasons we lose so many women in the pipeline in particular. Considering the cultural conversation, this is our chance to see if we can address those problems within science and to sit down and say: What have we let go by? What have we not spoken up about? And how can we make it so we can understand what our code of conduct is going to be?"}

Maybe at another time in human history I would have cared, but at this point, I'm like, what does good for you even mean?
