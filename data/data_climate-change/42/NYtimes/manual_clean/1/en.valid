and before long we were back out there every day, in that beautiful water. it wasn't so much that i planned on swimming into mid-november in a lake in northern california at 3,017 feet, as i just kept going every single day and over time, the water kept getting colder and colder. it was around oct. 26 where i started to feel that i was doing something unusual and brave and at times painful. my first thought every morning was resentment that my day had this big hard part in the middle of it. but even as the air and water got colder, it didn't get worse, it got better. my body started to get used to it. the big hard part of my day became the best thing in it. my first thought every morning became swimming. and then i would just lie there smiling stupidly into the dark.
a trade pact with 14 other asian nations. a pledge to join other countries in reducing carbon emissions to fight global warming. now, an investment agreement with the european union.
do you think you're a role model for young women entering the field? part of it is making sure people are connected sufficiently with their planet, to want to make sure it's still here as a home for us. if we're going to understand how our planet really works, we need everybody on deck to understand how to respond to it. the planet's going to survive — the question is, will we?
i thought that i was never going to swim with my friends again, which was ridiculous, because of course climate change doesn't happen all at once. the horrors would recede, regroup and advance again with new strength, and there was no law saying we couldn't go swimming through it all.
the lake is not my source of strength or my fountain of youth. i swim in the cold water because it feels good, and i will keep doing it for that reason, until one of us is no longer here.
climate change has made severe cold spells like the one that recently gripped the northeast far less common than they used to be, a team of researchers has found.
your skin is cold, but inside, you are warm, and safe-feeling, so that the cold is just a sensation, and not a misery. it's unlike anything else i have ever felt in my entire life, and it is just a moment every day when i feel too good to remember that things are bad. and then, honestly, i spend the rest of the day recovering from it, not hyper-focusing on a million tasks, not being free from anxiety, not feeling ready to conquer things. i take a long bath and often fall asleep, and at some point manage to do the work required of me, but it's basically a whole day lost to 20 minutes of extreme pleasure, and that's fine with me.
what are the most important things that humans can do now in order to not destroy the planet? we have to accept responsibility for our role. i am trying to keep track of what my carbon impact is this year — america produces about 20 metric tons per person a year. we also have to encourage all sorts of people to go into science and engineering, because some of the solutions will involve new technologies.
your stance seems to run counter to the attitude that the planet is beyond help and there's not much more we can do. do you think you're more optimistic than most? being pessimistic isn't going to get us there. we have to take action. i've been helping review the national climate assessment report, which provides an in-depth look at how climate change affects the country, and it's fascinating to see how different the impact is in different regions. people are starting to organize at the level at which they live, and that's probably what gives me hope. new york and california are significant economies and have shown that their governments can act.
do you think conditions have improved for women in stem fields since you entered the arena? things have gotten better. the national science foundation has a program called advance, where instead of just trying to hire individual women, you actually try to change the culture, like instead of dropping individual salmon in the stream, we're actually trying to change ecosystems so that more salmon will survive. i did that for five years, and we managed to go from having both the teaching and research faculty at lamont go from having single-digit numbers of women to having double digits. we still don't see women in as many leadership positions as i'd like, and the harassment issue is probably one of the reasons we lose so many women in the pipeline in particular. considering the cultural conversation, this is our chance to see if we can address those problems within science and to sit down and say: what have we let go by? what have we not spoken up about? and how can we make it so we can understand what our code of conduct is going to be?
china's leader, xi jinping, has in recent weeks made deals and pledges that he hopes will position his country as an indispensable global leader, even after its handling of the coronavirus and increased belligerence at home and abroad have damaged its international standing.
i think it's funny that whenever people talk about swimming in cold water they immediately start talking about how good it is for you. oh that's so good for your immune system, it's good for your heart, it's good for your skin, it's good for your circulation, good for your anxiety. maybe at another time in human history i would have cared, but at this point, i'm like, what does good for you even mean? two months ago i saw the sun disappear, and it will not be the last time, so, forgive me if i feel like the good for you ship has sailed.
in doing so, he has underlined how difficult it will be for president-elect joseph r. biden jr. to forge a united front with allies against china's authoritarian policies and trade practices, a central focus of the new administration's plan to compete with beijing and check its rising power. the image of mr. xi joining chancellor angela merkel of germany, president emmanuel macron of france and other european leaders in a conference call on wednesday to seal the deal with the european union also amounted to a stinging rebuke of the trump administration's efforts to isolate china's communist party state.
the deals show the leverage mr. xi has because of the strength of the chinese economy, which is now the fastest-growing among major nations as the world continues to struggle with the pandemic.
for the first minute in very cold water, your brain just goes on a vacation. (cue several million people googling cold water near me.) you are nothing except a body experiencing itself. i laugh at this stage, i laugh like my guts are going to fall out of my body, then scream. it's so cold, and yes, that is hard. but it doesn't last that long, and you can feel the unpleasantness of the cold melding with the pleasantness of it until it is all pleasantness, until all you feel is bliss.
the reason is straightforward: the arctic has warmed so much — twice as fast in recent decades than other parts of the world — that when polar air descends to lower latitudes, the cold snaps are warmer on average. so a spell of extremely cold weather like the recent one is rare, about 15 times rarer than a century ago, the scientists said.
