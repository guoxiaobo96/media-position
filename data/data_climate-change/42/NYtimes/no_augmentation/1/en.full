Joshua Rashaad McFadden for The New York Times For generations, the prevailing mythology of Atlanta has been that it is an undeniably Southern city that is also unlike the rest of the South, a place where the relentless pursuit of economic and social advancement meant casting aside much of the racial division and bitter history that have long dogged the region. But lately, that notion has been tested — by the pandemic; by violent encounters between African-Americans and the police; and by the fluctuating divide between metropolitan Atlanta and the much more conservative and traditional state surrounding it. The pandemic has laid bare gaps in access to opportunity and health care, as the virus has hit the African-American community especially hard. It has also galvanized ideological divides between the city and the state, as the mayor and governor sparred over adopting strict measures to curb the virus's spread. Protests forced many to examine the stubbornness of institutional racism. A meltdown during the summer primaries, with long lines and malfunctioning voting machines, stoked concerns over suppression. Those issues are certainly not Atlanta's alone. But again and again in recent months, the city emerged as an arena in which those tensions played out in vivid and revelatory ways.

{"original": "Many Jews did convert--some at knifepoint, others to advance themselves. The story about Professor Daniel Chwolson illustrates the latter phenomenon. Chwolson, a Russian intellectual of the nineteenth century, had converted from Judaism to Russian Orthodoxy as a young man, but he continued to fight against anti-Semitism. This led a Jewish friend to ask him why he had converted: Out of conviction, the great man said. What conviction? his Jewish friend inquired. Chwolson responded: Out of a firm conviction that it would be far better to be a professor in St. Petersburg than a Hebrew school teacher in Shklop. Yet despite the material advantages of conversion, most Jews resisted it. Clearly, those Jews--who sacrificed so much--remained Jewish not only in reaction to their enemies. More than our fabled stiff-neckedness was involved. There are substantive principles that Jews have been so stubborn about--that we have been willing to fight and even die for. For Jews who define their Jewishness in theological terms, it is easy to find that principle: It is God's will. For the large number of Jews who are skeptical about being God's chosen people, the principle is more elusive, but it is palpable to most of us, though difficult to articulate. It is a disturbing reality, however, that for a great many Jews, their Jewish identity has been forged and nurtured by our external enemies who have defined us as victims of their persecution.", "augmented": []}

As the result of skyrocketing rates of intermarriage and assimilation, as well as the lowest birth rate of any religious or ethnic community in the United States, the era of enormous Jewish influence on American life may soon be coming to an end.

In a prediction that reflects an approach to the survival of Judaism strikingly similar to that of the founder of the Lubavitch Hasidim, Herzl warned that if our Christian hosts were to leave us in peace ... for two generations, the Jewish people would merge entirely into surrounding races. Albert Einstein agreed: It may be thanks to anti-Semitism that we are able to preserve our existence as a race; that at any rate is my belief.

In Saturday's call, which was made public by Mr. Raffensperger's office, Mr. Trump vaguely threatened to the secretary of state that he would incite wrath — and discourage Republicans from voting — if he did not get his way. You're going to have people just not voting, said Mr. Trump, hinting at a dark outcome for politicians, like Mr. Rasffensperger, who opposed him. They don't want to vote, they hate the state. They hate the governor, and they hate the secretary of state. Mr. Raffensperger, in an interview on ABC's Good Morning America, said of the taped one-hour call that Mr. Trump did most of the talking.

Adriana Zehbrauskas for The New York Times A group of international experts advising the World Health Organization has recommended that the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine be administered as recommended by its manufacturer, in two doses given three to four weeks apart. However, it concluded that countries that have limited supplies of the vaccine and are concerned about the level of transmission of the virus could delay the second dose for up to six weeks. That delay would help maximize the number of individuals benefiting from a first dose, the group's chairman, Dr. Alejandro Cravioto, said at a news conference on Tuesday. We have to be a bit open to these types of decisions that countries need to make according to their own epidemiological situations, he added. The decision followed what Katherine O'Brien, director of the W.H.O.

She's thinking maybe that sort of tweaks the political calculus that McConnell is facing and persuades him that he's really going to have to make some of these concessions if he wants to have his conference united among Republicans on how a trial looks. The other factor here is that Pelosi knows that the president is extremely eager for the Senate phase of this trial, where he envisions having a parade of people come and publicly defend him and ultimately getting vindicated by the Senate in a quick and decisive vote. So part of this calculation, I think, is maybe the president is going to lean on McConnell to say, let's just get this done.

Probably three of my favorite albums in the entire history of the world. I should have known that a long time ago. But that said, the series is — it's very arch and stylized. It sort of seems like a little bit Wes Anderson-y. It has a lot of these linguistic jokes. Like, there's a running joke about the difference between literally and figuratively. It's pretty dark and macabre. And yet my kids, who are six and eight — five and seven when we started watching it — they absolutely loved it. I could use it to coerce all sorts of good behavior. Like, we're not going to watch another episode until everybody is bathed and brushed their teeth. And it worked like a charm. I keep hoping that there's another series that we would all enjoy as much. I haven't been able to find anything.", "augmented": []}

Mr. López-Gatell said he had incorrectly reported that a single-dose vaccine that had undergone phase three trials in Mexico by Chinese-Canadian firm CanSino was approved, according to The Associated Press. The United States and the European Union have indicated that they are unlikely to authorize the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine until at least February. When given in two full-strength doses, the regimen authorized by Britain, AstraZeneca's vaccine showed 62 percent efficacy in clinical trials — considerably lower than the roughly 95 percent efficacy achieved by Pfizer and Moderna's shots. No one who received the vaccine in the clinical trials developed severe Covid-19 or was hospitalized. Much of the world is looking to AstraZeneca in part because it has set more ambitious manufacturing targets than other Western vaccine makers. It has said that it expects to make up to three billion doses this year — a haul that, at two doses per person, would be enough to inoculate nearly one in five people worldwide. The company has pledged to make the vaccine available at cost around the world until at least July 2021, and in poorer countries into perpetuity.

The payments could indirectly affect what you pay in state income taxes in a handful of states, where federal tax is deductible against state taxable income, as our colleague Ann Carrns wrote. Read more. Are my unemployment benefits taxable? Mostly. Unemployment insurance is generally subject to federal as well as state income tax, though there are exceptions (Nine states don't impose their own income taxes, and another six exempt unemployment payments from taxation, according to the Tax Foundation). But you won't owe so-called payroll taxes, which pay for Social Security and Medicare. The new relief bill will make the first $10,200 of benefits tax-free if your income is less than $150,000. This applies to 2020 only. (If you've already filed your taxes, watch for I.R.S. guidance.) Unlike paychecks from an employer, taxes for unemployment aren't automatically withheld. Recipients must opt in — and even when they do, federal taxes are withheld only at a flat rate of 10 percent of benefits. While the new tax break will provide a cushion, some people could still owe the I.R.S. or certain states money. Read more. I worked from home this year. Can I take the home office deduction?

The way we do this varies — we eat black-eyed peas, or fling open the windows, or run into an icy ocean — but the idea is always the same. On this night, we put something behind us and seal it off, so it is part of the past. And then we try to begin again. It is difficult to imagine any year when our need of this ritual has been greater. Many of us have lost those dearest to us, and absorbed those losses in isolation. Livelihoods have been wiped away like vapor from a window. And yet, without the fireworks, the giddiness of crowds, we have never been so constrained in our rituals. That does not mean we are not celebrating. Inside lighted rooms, we raised glasses to the people who sacrificed for us, to the triumphant performance of our health care workers, and to a thousand small kindnesses already receding from memory.", "augmented": []}

The coronavirus vaccine was manufactured free of porcine materials, Sinovac, the Chinese vaccine maker, wrote to Indonesia's state-owned vaccine manufacturer in July.

A vaccine laced with the smallest amount of pork DNA could dissuade some followers of Islam from inoculation in Indonesia, the country with the world's largest Muslim population. Sinovac took months to provide more information, which came only this week. The Chinese company's delayed response has been yet another challenge in Indonesia's already fragile vaccine rollout. With the highest number of coronavirus infections in Southeast Asia, the country is eager to drum up support for its goal of inoculating 181.5 million adults within 15 months.

We gather now in this consequential chamber to inaugurate another chapter in our roller coaster representative government. May we, of the 117th Congress, refuel the lamp of liberty.

As their names are called, in alphabetical order, the chair will administer their oaths of office. Mr. Booker. Mrs. Capito. Please raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear that you will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that you bear true faith and allegiance to the same, that you take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion, and that you will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office upon which you're about to enter, so help you God?

From within a virtual Notre-Dame Cathedral — a resurrected, reimagined version of the fire-gutted treasure — the city livestreamed a computer-generated concert and light show, with no one actually inside the cavernous landmark, and no crowd outside. Most people now living have never seen a year that Europe, like much of the world, was so eager to bid good riddance to — or so unable to send off with any fanfare. Vaccines are the first real rays of hope, but the coronavirus still reigns unchecked, a new variant is stoking new fears, and much of the continent is under some form of lockdown. Concerts? Canceled. Crowds and parties? Banned. Staying out all night? Don't even think about it.

Apu Gomes/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images California's daily coronavirus case tallies remain around four times what they were during the state's summer surge, and officials predict that the aftereffects of a December surge linked to holiday gatherings will worsen as the winter drags on. After new infections — driven by Thanksgiving travel and gatherings, then Christmas festivities — resulted in a surge unlike any the state had yet seen, the trajectory of its new cases has leveled off somewhat in the early days of 2021. But there are more than twice as many Covid-19 patients in California hospitals now as there were a month ago, and many intensive care units in the state have been overflowing. At least six people in the state have also been found to be infected with the new, more transmissible variant of the virus first identified in Britain. The state is also facing an oxygen shortage for patients, and it has deployed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the California Emergency Medical Services Authority to help deliver and refill oxygen tanks.

Instead, she moved to San Francisco with her husband in the late 1960s and raised their five children as a stay-at-home mom. But as they grew up, Pelosi decided to enter the fray. Pelosi quickly rose through the ranks of the California Democratic Party, earning a reputation as a star fund-raiser, and in 1987 she won a seat in Congress. Through the '90s Pelosi navigated the party in Washington, becoming leader in 2003. Thank you all very much. Since then, she's raised millions for the Democrats.

World Experts Aided Project Fourteen American authorities, including two Nobel Prize winners, were aided in selecting contents for Time Capsule II by International Advisory Sub-Committees in Europe, Far East-Oceania, Latin America and African-Middle East. Their task was to create a lasting record of the major achievements and events in human activity over the past 25 years. The result is a collection of material from more than 475 references, including encyclopedias, magazines, newspapers, technical papers, pamphlets, catalogs, transcripts, and 29 texts written especially for the capsule by international experts. The bibliography of contents fills 70 typewritten pages. In point of time, the documentation runs from Albert Einstein's 1939 letter to President Roosevelt, alerting him to the dawn of the atomic age, to the seven-day Gemini flight of Astronauts L. Gordon Cooper and Charles Conrad. Voices of famous world leaders and modern music are preserved on special recordings made of nickel.

Read more. Are my unemployment benefits taxable? Mostly. Unemployment insurance is generally subject to federal as well as state income tax, though there are exceptions (Nine states don't impose their own income taxes, and another six exempt unemployment payments from taxation, according to the Tax Foundation). But you won't owe so-called payroll taxes, which pay for Social Security and Medicare. The new relief bill will make the first $10,200 of benefits tax-free if your income is less than $150,000. This applies to 2020 only. (If you've already filed your taxes, watch for I.R.S. guidance.) Unlike paychecks from an employer, taxes for unemployment aren't automatically withheld. Recipients must opt in — and even when they do, federal taxes are withheld only at a flat rate of 10 percent of benefits. While the new tax break will provide a cushion, some people could still owe the I.R.S. or certain states money. Read more. I worked from home this year. Can I take the home office deduction?

The urging from business leaders came on a volatile day for financial markets and just a day before runoff elections in Georgia, which will determine whether Republicans or Democrats control the Senate. Coronavirus cases are surging, and vaccinations are taking more time than hoped. Business leaders took issue with Washington's new divide at a moment of grave uncertainty. Our duly elected leaders deserve the respect and bipartisan support of all Americans at a moment when we are dealing with the worst health and economic crises in modern history, the business leaders wrote. There should be no further delay in the orderly transfer of power. The statement, which was organized by Partnership for New York City, a business advocacy organization, came on the same day that Thomas J. Donohue, the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, issued a statement urging certification of the vote.

Biden Jr. campaigned in Atlanta on Monday on behalf of the two Democratic candidates, Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock, for Georgia's Senate runoff election on Tuesday. I've said it before, getting America vaccinated will be one of the most difficult operational challenges this nation has ever faced, but we've known it for the last months. This administration has gotten off to a God awful start. The president spends more time whining and complaining than doing something about the problem. I don't know why he still wants the job, he doesn't want to do the work. As our opposition friends are finding out, all power flows from the people, from the people. That's our history. That's our law. That's our tradition. That's our Constitution. That's our democracy. Politicians cannot assert, take or seize power. Power is given, granted by the American people alone. I know this campaign, this campaign has been exhausting. You put the hard work in over the last few years to get to this moment. It's been intense. It's been non-stop. But I'm asking you to give everything you've got one more day, one more day. And that one more day, this is not hyperbole, you can change America.", "augmented": []}

And for a lot of Democratic members, particularly the ones in Trump-friendly districts, it was a pretty hard vote. It was a pretty politically difficult thing to do. And so having just taken this very high-profile and politically risky vote to do what they said they thought was right, if they then don't follow through with the process, it looks pretty bad.", "augmented": []}

California was already short on hospital beds before the pandemic, and I.C.U. capacity in a large swath of the state has been nonexistent for weeks.

SAG-AFTRA, the union representing 160,000 industry workers, was joined by groups representing producers and advertisers in calling for an in-person production halt on Sunday. Their statement noted that even if workers do not contract the virus, they are still at risk of injury from stunts, equipment failures, or falls.

They insist on focusing on the oys rather than the joys of Judaism, as Rabbi Moshe Waldoks put it. This is understandable, in light of the long history of persecution. Like an individual victim of a violent crime who sees his assailant around every corner, the Jewish people have been traumatized by our unrelenting victimization at the hands of Jew-haters. It is impossible for anyone who did not personally experience the Holocaust, or the other repeated assaults on Jewish life throughout our history, to comprehend what it must have been like to be victimized by unrelenting persecution based on primitive Jew-hating. We continue to see anti-Semitism even where it has ceased to exist, or we exaggerate it where it continues to exist in marginalized form. Indeed, some Jewish newspapers refuse to print, and some Jewish organizations refuse to acknowledge, the good news, lest they risk alienating their readerships or losing their membership. For example, in November of 1996 I saw a fundraising letter from a Jewish organization which claimed that anti-Semitism ... appears to be growing more robust, more strident, more vicious--and more `respectable.' Well-intentioned as this organization is, it seeks support by exaggerating the threats we currently face and by comparing them to those we faced during the Holocaust.", "augmented": []}

It doesn't take much for this thickening to become an actual blockage. The sense of embroilment usually comes without any knowledge of what has caused it: Often the first sign of it is an increase in awareness of the individual identity of other drivers. The forward-flying host begins to be differentiated; cars that seemed anonymous and distant become closer and more familiar; a web of recognition begins to form itself. The phase of community that follows — lacking any redeeming narrative or central event — is more or less indistinguishable from mutual entrapment. In this context, the difference between a car and a person is not entirely clear. Moments earlier, the car was the disguise for, and the enlargement of, the driver's will.

Run with strength and play with great poise. He's a great leader, very natural. Got an incredible skill set. Great presence in the pocket. And he's, without question, their leader on offense, so everything goes through him. Of Olave, a favored receiver for Fields: Can take the top off the defense, very savvy. Really understands the ball and can make all the competitive plays. He's got speed, length, size, toughness, savviness. Olave, of course, might not be the only issue for Clemson.

We must begin to fill the Yiddisher cup with the kind of useful Jewish knowledge that will assure both our success and our survival.

Biden Jr. to forge a united front with allies against China's authoritarian policies and trade practices, a central focus of the new administration's plan to compete with Beijing and check its rising power. The image of Mr. Xi joining Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, President Emmanuel Macron of France and other European leaders in a conference call on Wednesday to seal the deal with the European Union also amounted to a stinging rebuke of the Trump administration's efforts to isolate China's Communist Party state. The deals show the leverage Mr. Xi has because of the strength of the Chinese economy, which is now the fastest-growing among major nations as the world continues to struggle with the pandemic.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "How the Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine Works Two shots can prime the immune system to fight the coronavirus. The experts also concluded that while there is not yet enough safety data to be able to recommend the Pfizer vaccine for pregnant women, there are situations where the benefit of vaccination of a pregnant woman outweighs the potential risks, such as health workers at high risk of exposure, Dr. Cravioto said. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last month authorized the Pfizer vaccine for emergency use for individuals 16 and older, including pregnant women. Though the vaccine was not tested in pregnant women or in those who were breastfeeding, some experts said the virus itself poses greater risks to pregnant women than the new vaccine, and noted that vaccines have been given to pregnant women for decades and have been overwhelmingly safe. Dr. Cravioto also said that the vaccine should be offered regardless of whether a person has previously been infected by the virus. However, in situations of limited vaccine supply, people whose infections have been documented may choose to delay getting vaccinated until close to six months after their infections, in order to make the vaccine more available to others. At the news conference, the W.H.O. 's director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also revealed that a separate team of international experts who were expected to go to Wuhan, China this week to conduct a long-awaited investigation into the origins of the pandemic had been delayed; two of the members had already departed their home countries.", "augmented": []}

Ritual objects like these were decisive for the development of western modernist painting, and a Cameroonian crest was even shown at MoMA in the 1930s, as a sculpture divorced from ethnography.

The shuttering of the government for more than a month. The impeachment and trial of a president. The deadliest pandemic in a century and a multitrillion-dollar federal response. Even with a few legislative accomplishments, partisan gridlock forced lawmakers to punt on their hopes that they could be the ones to do difficult things. Still, Congress made history of a different kind, ushering in a new era of governing through technology during the pandemic. Here are some of the moments that defined the 116th Congress. Swearing In During a Shutdown With one of the largest classes of newly elected lawmakers in congressional history, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California became the first person in more than 60 years to reclaim the speakership after having lost it. Within hours of her election as speaker, Ms. Pelosi began calling votes on legislation to reopen government agencies that had been closed since late December 2018, as Mr. Trump demanded more money for the border wall that had been his signature campaign promise.

Some of them didn't know me personally, so I don't blame them for not reaching out. But some very clearly kind of severed ties with me, which was really hard and really hurtful.

We want those vaccines in peoples' arms, Mr. Cuomo said. New York lags behind other large states in distributing the vaccine, and Mr. Cuomo is facing pressure to fast-track the vaccinations as deaths and hospitalizations continue to rise in the state. Mr. Cuomo told reporters about the new penalties during a news conference at which he estimated that about 300,000 people in the state had been inoculated so far. In a call with reporters later on Monday, Mr. Cuomo announced that a case of a more contagious virus variant first identified in Britain had been found in New York State. Mr. Cuomo said the state had conducted about 5,000 tests for the British variant and that this was the first known case.", "augmented": []}

As you saw, we have almost 200 hospitals. If one hospital isn't performing, we can use other hospitals. I do have a problem with the hospitals saying they're going to participate, receiving a scarce vaccine and not administering it. But I have not heard any explanation other than it's only been three weeks and not everybody comes in every day. And people have different shifts — you know, it's all the bureaucracy.

But nationalized politics alone strips away the many little points of common ground that cut across polarizing lines of ideology and help make bargains and compromise possible.

Paul Ellis/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed a strict new national lockdown on Monday as Britain's desperate race to vaccinate its population risked being overtaken by a fast-spreading variant of the coronavirus that was on track to overwhelm the nation's beleaguered hospitals. After several days of frighteningly high and escalating case numbers, Mr. Johnson ordered schools and colleges in England to shift to remote learning. He appealed to Britons to stay at home for all but a few necessary purposes, including essential work and buying food and medicine. The decision was a fresh setback for Mr. Johnson, coming at a time when the arrival of two vaccines appeared to provide a route out of the crisis after nine fraught months and fierce criticism of his handling of the pandemic. On the day that the first doses of a vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford were administered, the good news was drowned out by the reintroduction of the type of sweeping restrictions used last spring when the pandemic first threatened to run out of control. In recent weeks, a new, highly transmissible variant of the virus has taken hold in London and southeast England, prompting an alarming spike in case numbers and putting hospitals under acute pressure.", "augmented": []}

Ronen Zvulun/Reuters JERUSALEM — The Israeli government announced on Tuesday that it would tighten its lockdown as coronavirus cases in the country have climbed rapidly over the past week. In late December, Israel entered into its third nationwide lockdown, but much of the public has since flouted restrictions, prompting health experts to call for tougher enforcement. The government still has not published a comprehensive list of the newest restrictions, but cabinet ministers confirmed that it decided to shutter schools except for those that provide special education and serve youth at risk. In a short joint statement, the prime minister's office and the Health Ministry said the new measures would take effect on Friday and would remain in place for two weeks. They also said that access to flights abroad would be limited. The government still needs to formally approve the measures, but it is expected to do so in the coming 24 hours. In addition, Israel's Parliament, the Knesset, is required to vote on the restrictions.

Last summer, two W.H.O. experts were allowed into China to negotiate the terms of the investigation, but they did not go to Wuhan. The Chinese government has yet to release crucial information about its own internal investigations into the virus's origins, including data from animal samples taken in and around Wuhan. Most scientists say the virus probably jumped to humans from an animal, probably a bat. They say that solving the mystery of its origin is critical to preventing future pandemics and helping to develop vaccines and treatments.

The absences were part of a long-running clash between teachers and administrators that is complicating the district's efforts to resume in-classroom instruction for the first time since March 2020. Chicago Public Schools, the nation's third largest district with some 340,000 students, is planning to welcome prekindergarten students and some special education students back to schools next week, followed by kindergarten through eighth-grade students on Feb. 1. The students' families can choose to have them return or to continue with remote learning; about 37 percent have chosen to return. The district's plan has run into relentless opposition from the Chicago Teachers Union, which argues that virus transmission remains too high in many neighborhoods and that the district's safety measures are inadequate.

The talk is usually preceded by a social hour and followed by a question period. I estimate that I have been asked more than a thousand questions by concerned Jews. I have received more than ten thousand letters and phone calls from Jewish men, women, and children. I have also been teaching young students, many of them Jewish, for a third of a century. I have served as faculty adviser to the Harvard Jewish Law Students Association, have been an active participant in Hillel, and have spoken to Jewish student groups at many colleges and universities around the world. Over these years, I have discussed virtually every Jewish issue--from God to intermarriage to Israel to anti-Semitism to Jewish feminism--with thousands of students. These questions, letters, calls, and discussions have given me an extraordinary window into the fears, hopes, and beliefs of a wide assortment of Jews. It has been quite an education. I think I understand what is on the minds and in the souls of many Jews, of all ages, and I try to address myself to these concerns in this book.", "augmented": []}

No surprise he ran in a touchdown for Clemson with 5:01 left in the first quarter. Clemson is up, 14-7. Etienne holds the Football Bowl Subdivision record for the most games with a touchdown (46) and the Atlantic Coast Conference record for total rushing touchdowns and overall touchdowns (70 rushing TDs, 78 total). He is also one of 12 players in F.B.S. history with 4,000 receiving yards and 1,000 rushing yards in a career. He has rushed for 4,929 yards at Clemson, including 9 yards at the Sugar Bowl. He needs 71 yards to become the first to run for 5,000 yards in A.C.C. history — a mark he could hit if he matches his season average tonight.

Butch Dill/Associated Press Clemson, ordinarily sharp in virtually every way on the football field, is in trouble in New Orleans. Yes, it's only halftime. Yes, Trevor Lawrence is a quarterback whose offense can work rapid wonders. But the scoreboard says Ohio State is in front, 35-14, and a 21-point deficit to the third-ranked Buckeyes is hardly the scenario that the Tigers wanted. And they've lost a crucial defender, James Skalski, to targeting. So with Ohio State leading at the intermission, here are a few quick takeaways. All eyes on Justin Fields: The Ohio State quarterback struggled off the field in the wake of the hit that led to Skalski's disqualification and retreated to a medical tent. He returned to the game, but his availability and condition in the second half could prove important if Clemson resurrects its offense and poses a significant threat. At halftime, Fields was 16-for-18 with his passes and had thrown for 223 yards. The Buckeyes also have a highlight-reel worthy running game: Ohio State ran for 171 yards in the first half.

Credit Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times WASHINGTON — Democrats returned Representative Nancy Pelosi of California to the House speakership on Sunday for what may be her final term, handing a tested leader control of the slimmest majority in almost two decades as Washington prepares for a new Democratic president. The nearly party-line vote punctuated an opening day marked more by precaution than pomp, as the 117th Congress convened under the threat of a deadly pandemic and awaited a pair of Senate runoffs in Georgia that will determine control of that chamber. Several House members sick with Covid-19 missed the session altogether and others cast their votes from behind a plexiglass enclosure specially constructed in a gallery overlooking the chamber. Her victory means that after two years as President Trump's most outspoken antagonist, Ms. Pelosi will now be responsible for trying to shepherd through Congress as much of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s agenda as possible. Scripture tells us that to everything, there is a season: a time for every purpose under the heavens; a time to build, a time to sow, a time to heal, she said in a speech after winning the speakership.

With Ohio State on the verge of scoring early in the third quarter, Mike Jones Jr. intercepted Justin Fields's tipped pass in the end zone, extinguishing a drive that had moments earlier appeared poised to give the Buckeyes a 28-point lead. But with Clemson still down by 21, Trevor Lawrence, one of the modern game's finer quarterbacks, stood behind his offensive line, seemingly as unfazed as ever, and got to work. He started with a 13-yard slant pass to E.J. Williams, a freshman wide receiver. Then a pass to Amari Rodgers for a nine-yard gain. Brannon Spector reached midfield when he caught an eight-yard pass. And so on. Ultimately, on the ninth play of the drive, Cornell Powell rumbled into the end zone, his left hand gripping the ball and extending it over the goal line. 35-21, Ohio State.

After the failure of lighter lockdown measures in November — under which both schools and most shops had remained open — the German authorities had set stricter rules in mid-December. Those restrictions, which were set to expire Jan. 10, cut short the pre-Christmas shopping period, discouraged family gatherings over the festive season and curtailed celebrations for New Year's Eve. In a recent YouGov poll, two thirds of German respondents said that they approved of an extension to the lockdown. About 24 percent also said that they thought the restrictions should be tightened, according to the poll, commissioned by the German news service DPA. On Monday, the health authorities in Germany registered 11,897 new infections and 944 deaths.

Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times President Trump is sending mixed messages ahead of Georgia's runoff elections on Tuesday, prioritizing personal grievance over the party's drive to win the state's two seats and imperiling Republican control of the Senate. The president is fixated on his loss in Georgia, an obsession that can be explained by two powerful and concurrent motivations — one psychological, one impelled by calculation and grounded in political reality, people close to him said. For starters, Mr. Trump simply cannot believe he lost a once-red Southern state — and cannot comprehend that his own unpopularity hastened a political realignment already taking place in the swing state. At the same time, he is very much in touch with the reality that he holds sway over party's right wing, and sees the runoff as a valuable moment of final political leverage as president. Over the past week, he has whipsawed from supporting the Senate candidates, albeit tepidly, to griping about the legality of the runoffs, far more passionately. The president, who will appear with the incumbent Republicans, Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, in Dalton, Ga. on Monday, wrote on Twitter late Friday that the runoff was illegal and invalid, but then urged his supporters a day later to get ready to vote on Tuesday.", "augmented": []}

Usually, hundreds of thousands line the parade route, watching an array of groups in often-outlandish costumes march through the city. City officials did not issue any permits and said they hoped that protesters would avoid unsafe behavior. This is not the first time the city's traditional celebration has been enveloped in controversy.

We might have to bring a few in, in the next winter for example — that is possible — because winter will benefit the virus, Professor Whitty said.

In a notice published on Monday, the F.D.A. warned of the risk of false results, particularly false negative results, with the Curative SARS-Cov-2 test, which in the Capitol is a self-administered nasal swab and typically produces a result within 12 hours. The warning outlined multiple risks to a patient with a false negative result, including delayed or lack of supportive treatment, lack of monitoring of infected individuals and their household or other close contacts for symptoms resulting in increased risk of spread of Covid-19 within the community. Curative's test is based around a laboratory technique called polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R. — typically considered the gold standard of coronavirus diagnostics. P.C.R.-based tests carry a reputation for high accuracy, making the problems with Curative's product somewhat unusual. Other tests, such as rapid antigen tests, which can run in just minutes, are typically more prone to returning incorrect results.

And when I moved to Los Angeles, it was a culture shock in many ways. And so I figured one thing had to go, and the brown wasn't going anywhere. So the British accent as a nine-year-old girl had to go. And I ended up after school every day watching a lot of television. And I watched the television to learn the American accent and learn American culture. And that really was, I think — now that I look back, I mean, it was very — I really sort of disappeared into television a lot, of just learning so much about America.", "augmented": []}

Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:17 - 0:00 transcript 'Everybody's Vote Did Count,' Top Georgia Election Official Says Gabriel Sterling, a top election official in Georgia, delivered a scathing refutation on Monday of President Trump's false claims of voter fraud. The secretary wants me to make clear that everybody's vote is going to count. Everybody's vote did count. I want to make that abundantly clear. If you care about, you know, the values and direction of the nation you want to see, it is your obligation to turn out and vote tomorrow — be you a Democrat or Republican. However right now, given the nature of the president's statements and several other people who have been aligned with him previously, have literally had a rally saying protest and don't vote, we are specifically asking you and telling you, please turn out and vote tomorrow. The president's legal team had the entire tape. They watched the entire tape, and from our point of view, intentionally misled the State Senate, voters and the people in the United States about this. It was intentional. It was obvious, and anybody watching this knows that — anyone watching it knows that. That's why we released the entire tape for people to watch. We've seen nothing in our investigations of any of these data claims that shows there are nearly enough ballots to change the outcome.", "augmented": []}

It would have been really nice to just be told, it's going to be almost as if you were going to die. Post-surgery recovery, that was a lot longer than I thought. And there were a lot more unexpected things that happened. Like the vaginal walls were really irritated, which nobody could really explain. I was forever bleeding, like every day for half a year. And nobody could tell me why or whether it was going to stop. Just before I got pregnant, I'd finished my master's.

Credit Credit... Lena Mucha for The New York Times Chancellor Angela Merkel and state governors in Germany agreed on Tuesday to extend the nationwide lockdown by three weeks, until at least the end of January, and to tighten restrictions amid high rates of coronavirus cases and deaths and the fear that a more contagious variant of the virus could spread in Germany. The measures we have adopted today are drastic, Ms. Merkel said in a news conference after the meeting. They are not just a continuation of what we did before Christmas. Given the situation, they are tougher. Under the extended lockdown rules, members of a household cannot meet more than one person from another household, and cultural sites and all but essential shops are closed. Schools and child care centers are also closed, though some school buildings remain open for children whose parents cannot supervise them at home. Ms. Merkel and the governors also agreed to limit movement to 15 kilometers from home for people living in areas in which there are more than 200 new infections a week per 100,000 people.", "augmented": []}

Johnny Milano for The New York Times The minute before midnight in Times Square was almost unrecognizable as New York City closed out one of the most difficult and wrenching years in its history. This time there were dozens — not hundreds of thousands — of voices counting down from 10 seconds. Confetti still rained down, but the multicolored strips landed primarily on the pavement rather than people's shoulders. Instead of a steady rumble of cheers and screams, there were infrequent cries of happiness amid the booms of fireworks. But the muted celebration did not ruin the palpable excitement of visitors in the area. Alexis Hurley of Hell's Kitchen grew emotional on a nearby street as midnight approached. This has honestly been the worst year of my life and a lot of my friends' lives, Ms. Hurley said. It's just this relief and hope that things will get better. In the hour before 2021 started on the East Coast, Pitbull, Jennifer Lopez and Andra Day were announced to the stage at Times Square to relative silence.

As correctional institutions have been battered by coronavirus infections and deaths, the number of cases reported in has risen by nearly 84 percent in the last two months, according to a Times analysis of the data from some 2,600 prisons, jails and immigration detention centers. There are now 88 facilities that have had at least 1,000 infections, according to the database. Local jails and state prison systems have been so devastated by the virus that they have resorted to the drastic strategy of shutting down completely and transferring inmates elsewhere. Experts say the jails and prisons that stay open will probably become even more crowded, unsanitary and disease ridden, and the transfers are likely to help the virus proliferate both inside and outside the walls. At the same time, some states, like California and Washington, have begun vaccinating older and medically vulnerable prisoners.

Early verdict: The Sugar Bowl will not be a rerun of Friday's Rose Bowl. Clemson and Ohio State have been playing for less than 14 minutes in New Orleans. They're tied at 14 apiece. For College Football Playoff context, Alabama and Notre Dame combined for 45 points across 60 minutes in Texas, where the Rose Bowl was played because of public health restrictions in California. It was always a safe bet that we'd see plenty of scoring in the Sugar Bowl — what else would you expect with Justin Fields and Trevor Lawrence starting at quarterback? — but these drives are efficient. (When Ohio State and Clemson met last season, Clemson prevailed 29-23.) In the first quarter of Friday's game, Clemson's scoring drives took fewer than three minutes each. Ohio State proved even speedier with one touchdown, taking 72 seconds to score. By the standards of this game, the Buckeyes languished their way to a second touchdown, taking nearly three and a half minutes. And it's been feast or famine so far for both teams: They've either scored touchdowns or gone three-and-out. Read more", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Every state in the country has certified the election results after verifying their accuracy, and judges across the country have rejected nearly 60 attempts by Mr. Trump and his allies to challenge the results. Attorney General William P. Barr acknowledged that the Justice Department had not uncovered any voting fraud that would have changed the results of the election. The senators involved in the plot have acknowledged that their effort was unlikely to succeed. Any such challenge must be sustained by both the House, where Democrats hold the majority, and the Senate, where top Republicans, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, have tried to shut it down. None of the senators supporting the effort have made a specific allegation of fraud, instead offering vague suggestions that some wrongdoing might have occurred and asserting that many of their supporters believe that it has. In a heated interview on NBC's Meet the Press, Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin and one of those supporting the effort, maintained that tens of millions of Americans did not view the election's result as legitimate. While he acknowledged that Mr. Biden won his state by 20,000 votes, he also asserted that there were issues in Wisconsin.

A victory for Napoleon held the promise of prosperity, first-class citizenship, freedom of movement, and an end to discrimination and persecution. A victory for the czar would keep the Jews impoverished and miserable. The great Hasidic rabbi Shneur Zalman--the founder of the Lubavitch dynasty--stood up in his synagogue on the first day of Rosh Hashanah to offer a prayer to God asking help for the leader whose victory would be good for the Jews. Everyone expected him to pray for Napoleon. But he prayed for the czar to defeat Napoleon. In explaining his counterintuitive choice, he said: Should Bonaparte win, the wealth of the Jews will be increased and their [civic] position will be raised. At the same time their hearts will be estranged from our Heavenly Father. Should however our Czar Alexander win, the Jewish hearts will draw nearer to our Heavenly Father, though the poverty of Israel may become greater and his position lower.", "augmented": []}

Audra Melton for The New York Times With control of the U.S. Senate at stake, more than four million Georgians cast ballots in Tuesday's runoff contests, surpassing the number of votes cast in the state during the 2016 presidential race, state election officials said. More than three million of those votes were cast early or by absentee ballot, with more than 1.2 million people turning out at the polls on Tuesday, Gabriel Sterling, a top election official in Georgia, said during a news conference late on Tuesday night. Mr. Sterling said that the Election Day voter turnout was more than we anticipated and that the counting was expected to continue into Wednesday. Brad Raffensperger, Georgia's secretary of state, told CNN late on Tuesday night that about 200,000 votes were still waiting be counted. As was the case in the November election, election officials said, the votes waiting to be counted came from DeKalb and Fulton counties in Metro Atlanta, as well as other areas that favored Democrats. The surge in turnout capped a two-month heated runoff in a swing state that had long favored Republicans but where the changing electorate, particularly in the suburbs, helped Democrats make momentous strides.

Contee III of the Metropolitan Police Department said the police had received information that people intended to show up to the demonstrations armed, a violation of local firearm laws. Mr. Trump is expected to appear at the rally on Wednesday and has encouraged his supporters to travel to Washington for the event. Some of Mr. Trump's allies, including the conspiracy theorist and conservative radio host Alex Jones and some associates who recently received a pardon from the president, spoke to hundreds of people who crowded into the city's Freedom Plaza on Tuesday, one day before Congress begins the formal counting of the Electoral College votes. A spokeswoman for the Eighty Percent Coalition, which was publicizing the event on Tuesday, did not return requests for comment. Tensions already began to escalate on Tuesday night, with some of Mr. Trump's supporters clashing with police near Black Lives Matter Plaza, videos of the confrontation showed. The police used pepper spray to repel some of the demonstrators.", "augmented": []}

A small handful of precincts received court-ordered brief extensions because of problems earlier in the day. We're expecting votes to be counted somewhat faster than they were in November, because a new rule required Georgia election officials to begin processing early mail-in ballots at least a week before election day. This means that, while officials weren't allowed to count anything before the polls closed, they should have already finished a great deal of the work of opening envelopes, verifying signatures and so forth. Because of this, it is possible — but not guaranteed! — that we'll know who won tonight. That said, be very cautious about interpreting early results. Because votes cast before Tuesday are expected to be disproportionately Democratic and votes cast on election day are expected to be disproportionately Republican, a candidate who appears to be significantly behind at the beginning of the night could very well catch up by the end.", "augmented": []}

Lynsey Weatherspoon for The New York Times ATLANTA — Georgia's Election Day voters braved a bracing January chill on Tuesday, arriving at polling places to make their choices in two Senate runoff races that are among the most consequential in recent American history. In liberal-leaning Atlanta, Whitney Leonard, 24, walked out of the West Hunter Street Baptist Church in a precinct in the West End neighborhood. Ms. Leonard said she voted for the Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock. But she said she was not beholden to the party. Ms. Leonard said she felt that President Trump had proved himself immature and erratic, and she believed that Democrats taking control of the Senate was crucial to undoing the damage he had caused. Before the presidential election in November, Ms. Leonard had never voted. Now, Ms. Leonard, who was previously incarcerated, said she was going to vote whenever the opportunity presented itself. You don't know how much of a privilege it is to vote until it's been taken away from you, she said.

Asian-American voters and Latino voters made clear that while they generally support Democrats, they do not do so at the same rate as Black voters, and remain very much up for grabs by either party.

Raphael Warnock, the pastor at the storied Ebenezer Baptist Church, in a hard-fought runoff contest that became roiled by President Trump's false claims of voter fraud in the state.

It represented a landmark breakthrough for African-Americans in politics as well as for Georgia: He became the first Black Democrat elected to the Senate from the South.

Losing balance costs speed, and long practice is needed to attain this skill. But once it is mastered, the skier can speed across the landscape, almost floating above the snow.

California has deployed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the California Emergency Medical Services Authority to deliver and refill oxygen tanks. In Los Angeles County, emergency workers have been told to conserve oxygen and administer the minimum amount of oxygen to keep patients' oxygen saturation level at or just above 90 percent. (A level in the low 90s or below is a concern for people with Covid-19.) Officials in the most populous U.S. county have said a person is being infected every six seconds in the county and one in five residents currently tested was infected with Covid-19. Your bubble is not as safe as you think it is, the department tweeted. Gov. Gavin Newsom has warned that the worst was somehow yet to come: a surge on top of a surge driven by post-holiday infections. As of Tuesday evening, 4,374 people with Covid-19 had died in the preceding two weeks, compared with 3,202 in the two weeks before that.", "augmented": []}

It is hard to say how long it will take to count all of them. Credit... Lynsey Weatherspoon for The New York Times All eyes were on mail-in ballots when general election results were tallied in November. And now, with control of the Senate hinging on two runoff elections in Georgia, it is no surprise that mail-in ballots are getting attention again. Here is what we know about when they will be counted: Mail-in ballots could not be counted before the polls closed, even if they arrived before election day. But many ballots have already been processed, meaning envelope signatures and addresses have been verified, though the tallying of the votes themselves only began Tuesday night. Of course, it is hard to say how long it will take for all of the mail-in ballots to be counted. First, some mail-in ballots may not have been received yet. Although most Georgians had to get their ballots in by the time the polls closed at 7 p.m. Eastern, military and overseas voters have three additional days for their ballots to be received, as long as they mailed them by Tuesday. Second, some counties will count their mail-in ballots faster than others. So when will all the mail-in ballots actually be counted? Only time will tell. Read more", "augmented": []}

It was really nice having nice hair. It was wavy and long. And there was more of it. And I had beautiful nails. That was really nice. The come down from that, not so nice.

The airbag that cushions the driver in the event of a collision does not have its exterior equivalent to cushion the thing being collided with. Yet in its weight and hardness, its velocity and power, the car is a more or less invincible aggressor. Nothing soft and living stands a chance against it. When cars were first invented, the number of people and animals they hit was proportionately extremely high: The car was not yet a reality that could be anticipated and avoided, to such an extent that early cars had to have a person walking in front of them waving a red flag.

(A level in the low 90s or below is a concern for people with Covid-19.) In the pandemic's brutal logic, more cases inevitably translates to more suffering and deaths. As of Monday night, 4,258 people with Covid-19 had died in the preceding two weeks, compared with 3,043 in the two weeks before that. This is a deadly disease, this is a deadly pandemic, Gov. Gavin Newsom told reporters on Monday. It remains more deadly today than at any point in the history of the pandemic. There has been some progress. California's daily average of 38,086 cases per day over the past week represents a decrease of 11 percent from the average two weeks earlier, for example. And although Covid-19 hospitalizations have increased by 18 percent over the past two weeks, to 20,618, Governor Newsom said that represents a slight flattening of the curve. But the state's last major Covid-19 surge, over the summer, only produced around 10,000 infections on its worst days. And in Los Angeles County, the latest crisis has stretched the health care system so thin that incoming patients at one hospital were recently being instructed to wait in an outdoor tent.

Erin Scott for The New York Times The Food and Drug Administration late Monday criticized an idea floated by one of the administration's top vaccine officials for stretching the limited number of Covid-19 vaccine doses, saying that a proposal for half-doses of the Moderna vaccine was premature and not rooted solidly in the available science. The agency's statement, posted on its website Monday night, exposed a fissure between Trump administration officials about whether they can somehow economize vaccine supplies in order to inoculate more people quicker. Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech are the only companies so far whose vaccines are authorized for emergency use in the United States, and together they can deliver only enough doses to vaccinate 185 million Americans by the end of June. On Sunday, Moncef Slaoui, the scientific leader of Operation Warp Speed, the administration's vaccine development program, said that federal officials and Moderna were discussing possibly halving each of Moderna's two doses — effectively giving recipients the equivalent of one full dose. He said data from Moderna's clinical trials demonstrated that people between the ages of 18 and 55 who received two 50-microgram doses showed an identical immune response to the two 100-microgram doses.", "augmented": []}

An online superstore that had gotten its start in the nineties by selling books on the World Wide Web—not because the founder had a love of literature, but because he had a love of consumers, and consumptive efficiency—had expanded to become a digital bargain basement dealing in appliances, electronics, groceries, mass fashion, children's toys, cutlery, and various nonnecessities manufactured in China. Having conquered the rest of retail, the online superstore had returned to its roots and seemed to be experimenting with various ways to destroy the publishing industry. It had even gone so far as to start its own publishing imprints, which my literary friends scorned and derided as cheesy and shameless. We ignored the fact that we had many reasons to be grateful to the website, as the publishing industry was being kept afloat by bestselling novels about sadomasochism and vampires who fucked, hatched in the incubator of the online superstore's marketplace for self-published e-books.

Around the world, inoculation efforts in many countries are rolling out slower than promised, even as the count of new infections soars and record numbers flood hospitals, placing a double burden on health care providers who have also been tasked with leading the vaccination push. And a more contagious variant spreading widely in England and detected in dozens of other countries threatens to give the virus an even greater advantage. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that England would be locked down until inoculations reached the four most vulnerable groups: residents in nursing homes and those who care for them, everyone over the age of 70, all frontline health and social care workers, and everyone who is clinically extremely vulnerable.

The videoconference was adjourned and was expected to be continued on Tuesday. The main issue in the meeting was whether to allow members of the group to raise oil production in February. During a difficult meeting in December, the group, known as OPEC Plus, reached a compromise that permitted production to increase by 500,000 barrels a day starting Jan. 1, instead of a previously agreed two million barrels a day. The group also agreed to meet monthly to consider whether further increases were warranted. The first of those monthly meetings, on Monday, highlighted differences in the group.

But other members, led by Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, are pushing to proceed cautiously.

Nickelodeon Thanks to a new agreement between ViacomCBS and Hulu, the streaming platform controlled by the Walt Disney Company, there will soon be another way to watch Nickelodeon's SpongeBob SquarePants and MTV's Ridiculousness. When CBS reunited with the cable and film giant Viacom at the end of 2019, after a decade apart, executives who swung the deal promised that the combined company would become a bigger player in digital media. ViacomCBS took another step toward that goal on Monday with the announcement that it had struck a deal to add 14 cable networks to Hulu Live TV. The 14 networks — a group that includes Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, BET Her, TeenNick and NickToons — will join Hulu Live alongside corporate siblings like Pop TV and the CW, which were already available on the service under a previous arrangement between CBS and Hulu. When it comes to streaming, ViacomCBS has mainly focused on supplying films and TV series to other companies. That strategy is expected to shift slightly this year, when the company will introduce Paramount+, a platform named after the company's struggling movie studio."}

Glyn Kirk/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images On the first working day after Britain left the European Union's single market and customs union, the traffic trickling through the country's busiest port was running smoothly. So far, the imposition of customs declarations for British exporters, the first in decades, hasn't led to the delays some had predicted. But the transition has been made easier by low levels of truck traffic. The Eurotunnel and ferry operators, which carry trucks across the English Channel, said boats and trains were running on time on Monday. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said on Sunday that 98 percent of the trucks heading to mainland Europe via Dover and nearby terminals had the documents they needed. But traffic numbers were low because of the New Year's Day holiday and weekend. The amount of goods flowing between the two countries was also low because companies had stockpiled last year amid uncertainty about whether London and Brussels would sign a trade deal and eliminate potential tariffs by Dec. 31, the end of the Brexit transition period. Much of Britain is also under strict business and social restrictions to curb the pandemic."}

By reducing his stake in Herbalife, the investor will also give up five board seats held by his designees. Credit... Karsten Moran for The New York Times The billionaire financier Carl Icahn has begun to cash out of his nearly decade-long bet on the nutritional food supplements company Herbalife, an investment that survived both regulatory review and a prominent — though unsuccessful — challenge by another activist investor. Herbalife said late on Sunday that it would buy back about $600 million worth of stock held by Mr. Icahn, who has been the company's biggest shareholder since 2013. Doing so would also mean that he will give up five board seats held by his designees. The move, which will reduce Mr. Icahn's stake to 6 percent from 13 percent, caps an investment success few could have foreseen in late 2012, when the billionaire first poured money into Herbalife. At the time, Mr. Icahn pushed back against a campaign by William A. Ackman, the manager of the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, who had prominently accused the company of being an illegal pyramid scheme on the verge of being shut down. Mr. Ackman shorted Herbalife shares, wagering that their price would fall to zero, eventually pouring $1 billion into his bet. Herbalife denied the accusations, and Mr. Icahn became one of several hedge fund managers to bet against Mr. Ackman."}

Radovan Stoklasa/Reuters Shareholders of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and PSA, the French maker of Peugeot, Citroën and Opel cars, voted on Monday to merge as the companies try to survive a transition to electric vehicles. The new company, called Stellantis, would be the world's fourth-largest carmaker based on vehicle sales during the first nine months of 2020 and would employ 400,000 people. Executives of Fiat Chrysler and PSA agreed to merge at the end of 2019 and have been working out the details and securing regulatory approval since then. But the new company faces major challenges. Neither Fiat Chrysler nor PSA has a strong presence in China, the world's largest car market, and they have been slow to introduce electric vehicles. Both companies have been hard hit by the pandemic. PSA's vehicle sales were down 30 percent in the 11 months through November, while Fiat Chrysler sold 30 percent fewer cars and trucks in the nine months through September, the most recent reporting period.

Even after a decline of as much as 10 percent on Monday, the price of Bitcoin is up so far this year to about $31,000, adding to a furious rally at the end of 2020 that pushed the cryptocurrency near $30,000 a coin, a level it breached over the weekend.

Inmates can petition to have their hearing dates moved up; his most recent hearing was just a year and a half earlier.

Biden Jr. boarded his plane at the New Castle County Airport in Wilmington, Del., on Monday. Republicans plan to attempt to disrupt certification of Mr. Biden's electoral votes on Wednesday. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times Chief executives and other leaders from many of America's largest businesses on Monday urged Congress to certify the electoral vote on Wednesday to confirm Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s presidential victory. Attempts to thwart or delay this process run counter to the essential tenets of our democracy, they said in a statement. Included in the list of 170 signers were Laurence D. Fink of BlackRock, Logan Green and John Zimmer of Lyft, Brad Smith of Microsoft, Albert Bourla of Pfizer, and James Zelter of Apollo Global Management. Over the weekend, President Trump called Georgia's Republican secretary of state in an effort to subvert the election results. On the call, which was recorded, the president pressured the official to find enough votes to overturn Mr. Biden's victory. The president's demand raised questions about whether he violated election fraud statutes, lawyers said, though a charge is unlikely. President-elect Biden won the Electoral College, 306 to 232, and the popular vote was 81.2 million for Mr. Biden to Mr. Trump's 74.2 million."}
