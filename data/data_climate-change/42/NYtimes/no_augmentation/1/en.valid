the day after robert mueller's congressional testimony, steve lohr came out with an article on how the personal data held by tech companies is not just a privacy concern but a wealth and power concentration concern, too.
consumers are often unaware of the many uses of their data. so far, privacy concerns have been the main focus of scrutiny. but the attention of lawmakers is starting to turn to the concentration of data wealth in the hands of a few companies.
the morning after the house impeachment vote, karen weise published an investigation into how amazon controls the many businesses that rely on it.
some guy we had never talked to gave us a call and was like, 'we have changed the rules,' said charlie cole, who runs tumi's online business. he pushed back, but wasn't successful. it was like talking to a brick wall, he said. they want to be able to control everything.
cade metz went to bhubaneswar, india, to show the lives of the people who are training computers to replace people. he wrote a nuanced, human piece that reveals the frenzy of work behind algorithms that seem seamless.
in facilities like the one i visited in bhubaneswar and in other cities in india, china, nepal, the philippines, east africa and the united states, tens of thousands of office workers are punching a clock while they teach the machines.
jack nicas and keith collins exposed the way apple's algorithms kept apple services ranked high in the app store. midway through the reporting, the algorithm changed. apple representatives told jack that the change was not an admission of wrongdoing but a way to handicap themselves to make it easier for their competitors.
if you searched for podcast in may 2018, you would have had to scroll through as many as 14 apple apps before finding one made by another publisher.
just as the holidays were kicking off, adam satariano had a tale from the faroe islands, at the edge of the world, a new battleground for the u.s. and china. the photos by ben quinton are especially stunning.
no location is now too small for the united states and china to focus on as they tussle over the future of technology. the faroe islands, whose proximity to the arctic gives it added military importance, joins countries across europe caught in the middle of the two superpowers over huawei, the crown jewel of the chinese tech sector.
davey alba, the tech team's new reporter on disinformation, wrote about how facebook's chief executive, mark zuckerberg, told congress that the company would share a huge amount of data related to disinformation. it didn't happen as promised.
as a result, researchers say, the public may have little more insight into disinformation campaigns on the social network heading into the 2020 presidential election than they had in 2016.
during summer's long vacation-filled months, brian chen wrote a confessional: i shared my phone number. i learned i shouldn't have.
for most of our lives, we have been conditioned to share our phone numbers with businesses and acquaintances without hesitation. in august, i learned this was a bad idea.
natasha singer profiled baroness beeban kidron, a member of britain's house of lords who is fighting big tech on behalf of children's privacy.
the idea that it's o.k. to nudge kids into endless behaviors, just because you are pushing their evolutionary buttons — it's not a fair fight, lady kidron told me, as she sat a few tables away from a facebook policy executive. it's little timmy in his bedroom versus mark zuckerberg in his valley.
and last but not least, daisuke wakabayashi profiled luigi zingales, a professor from the famously free-market university of chicago who is now leading calls for regulating tech.
my conclusions may surprise some people who identify chicago faculty, especially the economic and financial faculty, with a certain ideology. chicago faculty, however, abide to a method, not an ideology, mr. zingales said.
happy new year! may all your best work go viral in 2020, if only in your heart.
the 2019 golden globes didn't want any trouble.
the previous two years, the usually bubbly event found itself responding to upheavals in politics and in the power structure of hollywood. this year a big issue hanging over the awards ceremony was another awards ceremony: the oscars, which is still without a host after a search that included the naming and quick unnaming of kevin hart, after objections to the comedian's history of homophobic jokes.
the hosts, sandra oh and andy samberg, kicked off their opening monologue declaring that they were the only two people left in hollywood who haven't gotten in trouble for saying something offensive and announcing that one lucky audience member will! host! the oscars!
[read our analysis from the golden globes ceremony | browse the list of winners]
their opener, amiable if a little stiff, played on the idea of aggressive niceness, roasting stars in the room with compliments. even one of the zingers, a joke by oh about hollywood's casting white actors as asian characters, produced a cheerfully penitent i'm sorry! from emma stone, who played a part-asian character in aloha.
previous american administrations had resisted striking general suleimani directly, either because of operational concerns or out of fear that killing him could destabilize the region further and lead to all-out war between the united states and iran.
at least once, though, israeli officials ran the possibility of attacking him up their command structure. that was in february 2008, while israeli and american intelligence operatives were tracking mr. mugniyah, the hezbollah commander, in the hopes of killing him, according to senior american and israeli intelligence officials. operatives spotted the hezbollah commander talking with another man, who they quickly determined was mr. suleimani.
excited by the possibility of killing two archenemies at once, the israelis phoned senior government officials. but prime minister ehud olmert denied the request, as he had promised the americans that only mr. mugniyah would be targeted in the operation.
perhaps more than any other individual, general suleimani was the foil for american plans in iraq, which like iran is predominantly shiite.
after the united states invaded iraq in 2003, iranian militiamen and their iraqi allies fought a clandestine war against american troops, launching rockets at bases and attacking convoys. the militias also played a large part in inflaming sectarian tensions that led to iraq's civil war in 2006 and 2007 between shiites and sunnis, leading president george w. bush to order a troop surge there.
general suleimani and other leaders of his generation were shaped by the brutal war between iran and iraq in the 1980s, a conflict so cruel, with trench warfare and chemical weapons, that some compared it to the devastation of world war i. nearly a million people died on both sides, and general suleimani spent much of that war on the front lines.
in new delhi and neighboring states, slowing winds have made air pollution worse, india's meteorological department said. in the early hours of new year's day, pollution levels in the capital soared to levels more than 20 times what the world health organization considers safe.
the fog is often so blinding that drivers cannot see cars slowing down in front of them, causing accidents and highway pileups. in december, hundreds of flights and trains were delayed or canceled because of low visibility.
last week, six people were killed in the city of noida, near new delhi, after their car skidded off the road. investigators blamed heavy fog.
in neighboring bangladesh, a prolonged cold spell that started in november has left at least 50 people dead, including 17 children, according to ayesha akhter, a medical officer in dhaka, the capital.

climate change has made severe cold spells like the one that recently gripped the northeast far less common than they used to be, a team of researchers has found.
the reason is straightforward: the arctic has warmed so much — twice as fast in recent decades than other parts of the world — that when polar air descends to lower latitudes, the cold snaps are warmer on average. so a spell of extremely cold weather like the recent one is rare, about 15 times rarer than a century ago, the scientists said.

i have been with the same company for 20 years, rising through the ranks in that time. however, i have been planning to leave, and even started working toward a professional certification in another field. then my supervisor got promoted, and most colleagues assumed that, based on my position and experience, i would be the replacement. every bone in my body told me not to apply — but every friend, family member and colleague (especially the ones who knew i was plotting an escape) said i would be passing up an opportunity to make my résumé look better. i applied, and got the job. i can't stand it. there are not enough hours in the week to get everything done, and i end up doing my work poorly and neglecting my family in the process. my supervisor says i knew what i was getting into. but now i want out even more. i finished that certification, but is it best to wait a year before i bail? if not, how do i explain a short stint in a new position to potential employers, without sounding negative? — anonymous
if you cannot stand your job, you should be looking for a new one, as actively as possible. don't waste time being hard on yourself. it's often the case that someone who has decided to switch fields entirely must overcome the urge to delay making such a big move.
and sure, in retrospect, you probably should have trusted your instinct and ignored everyone else. but that's hindsight. it's often good to get the advice of others who know you and your situation and who might be able to offer a useful perspective. maybe you would have regretted it if you hadn't given the new position a shot. who knows?
the point is that now you know: taking the promotion was a mistake. not only are you unhappy, but it sounds like your supervisor and your family aren't pleased, either. why prolong this a single minute longer than necessary? if you're really ready to jump to a new path, get on with it!
to answer questions about a short stint on your résumé, just tell the truth, but with a forward-looking focus: you had been planning this change for a while and delayed it when you were offered a promotion. but that has only underscored your certainty that it's time to move on, and you're way more excited about what lies ahead in your new chosen field.
inspecting the tiny roundworms caenorhabditis briggsae and caenorhabditis nigoni through a microscope, you'd have trouble telling them apart. both are about a millimeter long and transparent. on the evolutionary tree, they're closer together than horses and donkeys.
the key distinction between the two nematodes is their sex lives. sex in c. nigoni takes place between a male and female. but only a small minority of c. briggsae are males. the rest are hermaphroditic females that reproduce by self-fertilizing, or selfing. they have evolved the ability to produce sperm that merge with their own eggs.
this sexual switch may have caused profound changes at the genetic level for c. briggsae. in a study published last week in science, biologists reported that c. briggsae lost thousands of genes — a staggering quarter of its genome — since it diverged from c. nigoni a million years ago.
many of these genes had been around, and were presumably needed, for tens of millions of years or longer, said eric haag, a biology professor at the university of maryland, college park, and an author of the paper. in the blink of an eye, they disappeared. he and his co-authors believe that a large portion of the genes shed are related to male reproduction.
patrick was/is suicidal, she wrote, adding: i am grateful that you are trying to expose this problem in these horrific times. we need not be anonymous.
i had met sandy only in passing at the dunkin' donuts when she dropped off patrick for our interview, but she was clearly at her wit's end, having been enmeshed in his addiction for so long.
as a reporter, i was struck not only by her pain but also by her willingness to be identified. so often, people whose loved ones are addicted are ashamed and afraid of being stigmatized. when someone decides to go public, it is a godsend, as it helps combat accusations of fake news and shows that, as sandy said in the article, we are your neighbors.
from there, the family drama of coping with addiction overtook the original story about new hampshire. the times assigned the photographer todd heisler to work with me, and the family allowed us to witness their grueling intervention with patrick in july.
several people have asked how that worked. journalists often worry that their mere presence will change people's behavior and render it inauthentic. in this case, the family members, all of whom were in extremis, were so focused on their own difficulties that they hardly noticed us. and we were discreet. no klieg lights. no microphones. we blended into the background and kept our mouths shut.
the white house sent congress on saturday a formal notification under the war powers act of the drone strike ordered by president trump this week that killed maj. gen. qassim suleimani, two congressional officials said.
the notification, required by law within 48 hours of introducing american forces into armed conflict or a situation that could lead to war, has to be signed and then sent to congress, according to the officials with knowledge of the plan.
lawmakers expected the document to publicly lay out the white house's legal justification for the strike on general suleimani, iran's top security commander, who officials have said has been behind hundreds of american deaths over the years. but the notification first sent to congress late saturday afternoon only contained classified information, according to a senior congressional aide, likely detailing the intelligence that led to the action. it is unclear whether the white house will send a separate, unclassified document.
speaker nancy pelosi said in a statement saturday evening that the notification raises more questions than it answers, including serious and urgent questions about the timing, manner and justification of the administration's decision to engage in hostilities against iran.
dr. berns's main research pertains to dogs and the inner workings of the canine brain, but after learning more about tasmanian tigers, he became fascinated by the beasts.
with their slender bodies, long snouts and sharp teeth, tasmanian tigers looked as if they could be related to dogs, wolves or coyotes. but actually they are separated by more than 150 million years of evolution. it is a classic example of convergent evolution, in which two organisms that are not closely related develop similar features because of the environment they adapted to and the ecological role they played.
to better understand thylacines, dr. berns spent two years tracking down two preserved tasmanian tiger brains, one at the smithsonian institution and the other at the australian museum. their brains, like those of all marsupials, are very different from the brains of placental mammals. the biggest difference is that they lack a corpus callosum, which is the part of the brain that connects the left and right hemispheres.

a concert for island relief at radio city music hall (jan. 6, 7 p.m.). as the caribbean region continues its recovery from the devastating effects of hurricane maria and hurricane irma, musicians are stepping up their relief efforts. a solo set by dave matthews and a performance by the trey anastasio band — two modern jam-band masters, appearing without their usual troupes — are the main attractions at this all-star benefit concert for puerto rico and the united states and british virgin islands. but the most meaningful performance may come from hurray for the riff raff, the band led by the bronx-raised singer-songwriter alynda segarra, whose recent album, the navigator, is a complex expression of puerto rican realness.
gunn-truscinski duo at union pool (jan. 9, 8 p.m.). this instrumental duo's work is based on a simple idea: the guitarist steve gunn plays languid, dreamy notes while the drummer john truscinski keeps an understated beat. the two musicians have found ample inspiration in this format, releasing three albums together, most recently the well-received bay head in late 2017. at the right time and in the right settings — including, perhaps, this brooklyn date, free with rsvp — mr. gunn and mr. truscinski's music is transportive.
the killers at barclays center (jan. 9, 8 p.m.). in an era short on arena-level rock 'n' roll heroes, the killers perform a valuable service simply by continuing to exist. the group's fifth album, wonderful wonderful, is a good example: it's a fun listen, and it provides a welcome excuse for the band's frontman, brandon flowers, to strut through a decade-plus of killers hits at concerts like this one in brooklyn.
long neck at the silent barn (jan. 5, 8 p.m.). lily mastrodimos, formerly of the archly named punk band jawbreaker reunion, shifted her focus to this new project around the same time the real jawbreaker reunited after a 20-year split. the change has proved apt, giving ms. mastrodimos room to show off her honed skill as a songwriter. the jokey air of her previous group is gone on long neck's new album, will this do?, due out later this month, and this performance at the bushwick community arts space the silent barn is a good choice for fans of emotionally direct indie rock. with coping skills, mallrat and leia campbell.

the #metoo movement has swept across television and movie studios, investment banks and factory floors, fundamentally remaking the thinking around gender and harassment.
has it also swept into a corner of one of the country's biggest celebrations of irish heritage?
for the first time since its founding shortly after the revolutionary war, a group that puts on a formal dinner to raise money for charity just before the st. patrick's day parade in new york city will allow women to attend.
specifically, the society of the friendly sons of st. patrick in the city of new york is inviting the wives, daughters, sisters, mothers, aunts, nieces and female cousins, friends and colleagues of our members to its dinner at the new york hilton.
it has taken only 235 years. and it has only been 30 years since a woman led the st. patrick's day parade as grand marshal for the first time.
say hello to riley. he is a good boy.
riley, a 12-week-old weimaraner, is hardly the first pup to have job responsibilities far beyond fetch and sit and get off the couch.
but he appears to be the first to be trained specifically to detect moths and other pests that could damage high-value artwork in a museum.
it's really a trial, pilot project. we don't know if he's going to be good at it, said katie getchell, the deputy director of the museum of fine arts in boston. but it seems like a great idea to try.
no technology is as powerful at detecting scents as the nostrils of dogs, which have long been trained to use their superior schnozzes to sniff out explosives, cadavers, bed bugs, ants and cancer, among other things.

in chinese restaurants are closing. that's a good thing, the owners say. amelia nierenberg and quoctrung bui look at the connection between the decline in chinese restaurants across america and the economic mobility of the second generation. in this lesson, you will consider businesses that make up your own community and ideas of success among different generations and families.
scroll through the featured article and choose one of the three graphs or charts to analyze. instead of looking at the title and description to make sense of the graph, try focusing on the axes and the content of the graph itself. then, use these three questions from our what's going on in this graph? feature to help you interpret the graph:
what do you notice? if you make a claim, tell us what you notice that supports that claim.
what do you wonder? what are you curious about that comes from what you notice in the graphs?
what's going on in this graph? write a catchy headline that captures the graphs' main idea.
as you read the article, see if your interpretation of the graph is similar or different from how it is used in the article.
read the article, then answer the following questions:
1. what do the yelp statistics reveal about the changing number of chinese restaurants in metropolitan areas? using the graph, determine how those changes compare to the changing numbers of other types of restaurants in major cities?
2. why does jennifer 8. lee, a former new york times journalist, say that it is a success that these restaurants are closing? generally, what are some of the difficulties that immigrant-owned restaurants face and how are those different from the reasons that chinese-owned restaurants are closing?
panasonic admits it struggled with how to acknowledge the sl-1200's history and fans.
there was a lot of debate, mr. morishita said. would we keep the name? would we change the design? in the end, he said, the company decided the turntable was too iconic to change drastically. the latest version, the sl-1200g, has an upgraded motor and a few other touches, but is otherwise the same as the players that technics made in decades past.
the main difference is in the marketing. instead of sponsoring d.j. contests, technics has hired a german classical pianist, alice sara ott, to be its global brand ambassador and provided an sl-1200g to abbey road studios, of beatles fame. serene connoisseurship, not sweaty nightclubs, is the theme.
listening to records is like tea ceremony, or flower arranging, said michiko ogawa, director of the technics division. she added that music recorded by live musicians showed off technics's hi-fi qualities best.
panasonic is hardly the first company to try to change a product's image, though most marketing makeovers are aimed in the other direction — turning old and fusty into young and hip. think not your father's oldsmobile or the rebranding of old spice cologne for younger men. in a world where hip-hop and dance music have become worldwide phenomena, sought after by marketers of everything from energy drinks to running shoes, it is in some ways remarkable that an authentic part of the culture has turned its back.
it's unusual in that you've had relatively positive associations and decided to disown that, said ravi dhar, a professor of marketing at yale.
when the brand already has an image that is associated with certain groups, if you try to move away from it, it's risky, he said. but for them, the associations weren't positive for the market they're targeting.
what are the most important things that humans can do now in order to not destroy the planet? we have to accept responsibility for our role. i am trying to keep track of what my carbon impact is this year — america produces about 20 metric tons per person a year. we also have to encourage all sorts of people to go into science and engineering, because some of the solutions will involve new technologies.
your stance seems to run counter to the attitude that the planet is beyond help and there's not much more we can do. do you think you're more optimistic than most? being pessimistic isn't going to get us there. we have to take action. i've been helping review the national climate assessment report, which provides an in-depth look at how climate change affects the country, and it's fascinating to see how different the impact is in different regions. people are starting to organize at the level at which they live, and that's probably what gives me hope. new york and california are significant economies and have shown that their governments can act.
do you think conditions have improved for women in stem fields since you entered the arena? things have gotten better. the national science foundation has a program called advance, where instead of just trying to hire individual women, you actually try to change the culture, like instead of dropping individual salmon in the stream, we're actually trying to change ecosystems so that more salmon will survive. i did that for five years, and we managed to go from having both the teaching and research faculty at lamont go from having single-digit numbers of women to having double digits. we still don't see women in as many leadership positions as i'd like, and the harassment issue is probably one of the reasons we lose so many women in the pipeline in particular. considering the cultural conversation, this is our chance to see if we can address those problems within science and to sit down and say: what have we let go by? what have we not spoken up about? and how can we make it so we can understand what our code of conduct is going to be?
do you think you're a role model for young women entering the field? part of it is making sure people are connected sufficiently with their planet, to want to make sure it's still here as a home for us. if we're going to understand how our planet really works, we need everybody on deck to understand how to respond to it. the planet's going to survive — the question is, will we?
re the american dilemma: why do we still watch football? feb. 4:
like many others, i made plans to take part in an american tradition last sunday and gather with friends to watch the super bowl.
many of my friends are guys i played high school football with in north jersey in the 1970s, including one who has been paralyzed since the age of 16, when his neck was broken on the opening kickoff of the third game of our junior year.
i saw it happen from the sideline, about 20 feet away. i watched him lie on the field face down for what seemed like an eternity, not moving, until he was taken away by an ambulance. i cried in my bedroom for hours after that game, and i was numb for the rest of the weekend. but when school let out monday afternoon, i went to my gym locker, changed into my uniform, and joined the rest of the team on the field for practice.
it doesn't seem logical, as i write this, that i would still be a huge fan of football, or that my disabled friend, who has lived a life of immeasurable pain and hardship because of the football injury, would be one, too. but i am, and so is he, and so is everyone else who gathered around the tv last week to watch the game.
smith, a baldheaded black man with a short, graying beard and a nose that looks as if it had been broken more than once, worked as a cook in san quentin prison. he hadn't had a serious disciplinary violation in two decades but was denied parole in each of his eight hearings since becoming eligible in 1996, receiving three-year denials each time. (every parole denial comes with a prescribed length of time — three, five, seven, 10 or 15 years — before the inmate is allowed to try again.) inmates can petition to have their hearing dates moved up; his most recent hearing was just a year and a half earlier. since then, he had studied the transcript carefully, highlighting the parts that told him what he needed to do to increase his chances of parole. he had to participate in self-help groups that focused especially on three things: gangs, overcoming criminal thinking and the suffering of crime victims. the commissioners, he felt, were trying to help him. i know exactly what she was trying to tell me, he said, referring to the commissioner who presided over his last hearing. she's trying to make sure that i don't go out there and fall into the hands of the same people that i dealt with when i came here, which is understandable.
smith had gone to some of the recommended groups, but he hadn't taken to them the way morgan had. he wasn't particularly introspective by nature, and he had trouble presenting a board-friendly narrative of his life or remembering the definition of jargony self-help words like prosocial. in conversation, he tended to skitter away from the traumatic events that might have explained how he wound up committing crimes — the best friend who was killed by a speeding car right in front of him when he was 5, his father's absence, his stepfather's emotional abuse of his mother, the varsity football career that ended when he got hit by a car in high school. the way i was brought up, some things you just don't speak on, he told me.
he preferred to talk about other matters: his plans for the future with his grown daughter and 9-year-old granddaughter and goddaughter; his ignorance of the basics of the modern world after so long in prison (he didn't know, he confessed, how to use a microwave oven); the old friends who were law-abiding citizens now. the story he had to tell was straightforward: he'd been a hardheaded young man once, but he had been a model inmate for more than two decades. now he hoped to return to his old neighborhoods and talk to youngsters who were as hardheaded as he used to be. i want to go back out there, he said. i want to help bring my community back up.
neither his good intentions nor his clean prison record were enough to get him a parole date, however. i'm getting denied for what we consider as being little things — you know, insight, you're not showing remorse, he told me over the phone shortly before his ninth parole hearing. those little things, of course, were the very things the parole board considered paramount, but a lot of the board's preoccupations seemed illogical to smith. it had taken him a long time to understand why the authorities considered his group of associates to be a gang — a word he associated with large criminal organizations — or why he would be guilty of murder when the victim was shot by someone else. he said he thought about terry brown's murder every day, but it was hard to access his feelings sometimes, particularly in the hearing room. each time he went before the board, smith ended up tongue-tied and inarticulate. but was that indicative of the future danger he posed to the public?
the parole process is like threading a needle — the people who have come out through the parole board are extraordinary people, says rummel, who has represented hundreds of lifers in their parole hearings. we could swing the door a little wider. they don't have to be a-plus human beings. they could be b-plus human beings.
smith's ninth parole hearing was on may 9, 2018. he sat at a table with his state-appointed lawyer, marc gardner, his back to a window whose vertical blinds, wavering in the breeze, offered tantalizing glimpses of the sparkling san francisco bay. his feet tapped nervously beneath the table. the presiding commissioner, patricia cassady, pressed him for explanations, just as previous commissioners had: why had he been a bully in school? why had he liked fighting? why did he join a gang?
smith's answers were short and uninformative. he spoke with his forehead furrowed, his expression pained and puzzled, as the commissioners guided him through various episodes of childhood delinquency — stealing bikes, cutting school — until they arrived at the crime he was incarcerated for, the botched attempt at a revenge killing of a rival gang member. smith's crew had been trying to sneak up on the apartment where the man was hiding out, but smith, who said he didn't know much about firearms, had accidentally fired his weapon into the ground, triggering the shootout. brown was hospitalized for 15 months before he died.
durham, n.c. — the release last month of making a murderer, a 10-part documentary from netflix, capped a year in which popular culture's portrayal of the criminal justice system seems to have shifted. out with the old tropes about truth-seeking investigators and tidy resolutions; in with the disquieting, dysfunctional reality of many courtrooms and police stations.
the documentary, which has captivated viewers and critics, chronicles the trials of steven avery and his nephew brendan dassey for the 2005 killing of teresa halbach. its depiction of alleged police corruption and prosecutorial bias has inspired some viewers to quip that they hope they are never arrested in manitowoc, wis., the county where the two men were convicted. but what happened to them happens to low-status criminal defendants across the country all the time.
searing images of law enforcement abuses in chicago, cleveland and elsewhere have eroded the public's trust in police power on the street. at the same time, serialized true-crime programs, such as making a murderer and the first season of the podcast serial, are bringing the failures of due process into focus: careless police work, flawed forensics, forceful interrogations, unreliable witnesses and the woeful condition of state-funded criminal defense.
it takes hours rather than seconds to appreciate this procedural violence. that hasn't stopped listeners and viewers. serial was downloaded some 75 million times. (netflix doesn't release any audience statistics, but making a murderer has generated widespread discussion in social and traditional media.) yet after the shows are over, audiences still hunger for narrative resolution. reddit users have written thousands of posts about making a murderer, weighing evidence and acting as armchair detectives trying to find the true perpetrator. petitions seeking pardons for mr. avery and mr. dassey have gathered 380,000 signatures. a spinoff from the serial podcast, sponsored by the defendant's lawyers, updates listeners on appellate claims and advocates for a retrial.
i don't think so. you couldn't help but be surprised — beyond surprised — at the response. it was a pleasurable sensation that people were talking about it, that it made an impression on people. it made a lot of people angry. sometimes i couldn't believe it was that important to people.
with the 20th anniversary coming, are you ready for another round of is tony dead or not?
i've got to say i'm just bored with it. i also feel like, jesus, there were 86 episodes and you're fixated on that? can't we talk about something else?
you did an interview with the directors guild of america in 2015 that extensively broke down the final sequence. was that an attempt to just put the whole thing to bed?
might have been. i really don't recall my reasons. i was trying to provide a context.
is it frustrating that even after that, many people don't seem to want to take you at your word?
it's frustrating. it makes me use bad words. but it's not surprising, you know? and i don't have any statistics to prove it, but i think it's become more accepted as time has gone on.
i think the point isn't whether or not tony was killed. it's the uncertainty that's the point, and the way the scene's crazy tension makes us aware of the passage of time and how choices shape the brief bit of life we get. most people can't control when or how they die, but the choices are ours. is that totally off base?
the average time of a nine-inning game last season was 3 hours 5 minutes, the highest on record and nine minutes longer than in 2015. that was manfred's first year as commissioner, when he made pace-of-play a priority. but the players quickly learned that the league and the umpires were not really forcing them to stay in the box or deliver pitches at a brisker pace. the pace reverted to a crawl.
the biggest factor, though, is that players are increasingly incentivized to take more time. in the age of analytics, teams cultivate power hitters and power pitchers, and the amateur ranks churn out plenty every year. strikeouts and homers reached record highs last season, and walks are rising again, too. that means more pitches, which means more relievers, which means more time.
the 2017 season included 1,196 more home runs, 1,756 more walks and 2,658 more strikeouts than the 2015 season. the number of pitches per nine-inning game rose from 283 to 292 in the same period. no wonder games were nine minutes longer.
guys are working the count; nobody's trying to just put the ball in play. everybody wants to lift and launch and hit home runs, said jim kaat, the mlb network analyst and former pitcher. so home runs, walks and strikeouts kind of dominate the game, and that's going to make for a more boring game in terms of action on the bases. it's really a three-hour home run derby, in a lot of cases.
kaat pitched 25 seasons in the majors, through 1983, when teams averaged 2 hours 36 minutes to play nine innings. it was a different game in many ways. kaat was among his generation's best pitchers but averaged only 4.9 strikeouts per nine innings for his career. last year, only one pitcher who made at least 25 starts, andrew cashner, averaged fewer. (naturally, cashner is an unsigned free agent.)
between 1973 and 1980, kaat started 11 nine-inning games that took no more than 1 hour 40 minutes. he had 31 strikeouts and 7 walks — total — in those 11 games.
our objective was to trust your stuff and make them put the ball in play, kaat said. now, you see fear of contact, deep counts, more pitches, and hitters diving into the ball and swinging at will.
a trade pact with 14 other asian nations. a pledge to join other countries in reducing carbon emissions to fight global warming. now, an investment agreement with the european union.
china's leader, xi jinping, has in recent weeks made deals and pledges that he hopes will position his country as an indispensable global leader, even after its handling of the coronavirus and increased belligerence at home and abroad have damaged its international standing.
in doing so, he has underlined how difficult it will be for president-elect joseph r. biden jr. to forge a united front with allies against china's authoritarian policies and trade practices, a central focus of the new administration's plan to compete with beijing and check its rising power. the image of mr. xi joining chancellor angela merkel of germany, president emmanuel macron of france and other european leaders in a conference call on wednesday to seal the deal with the european union also amounted to a stinging rebuke of the trump administration's efforts to isolate china's communist party state.
the deals show the leverage mr. xi has because of the strength of the chinese economy, which is now the fastest-growing among major nations as the world continues to struggle with the pandemic.
i think that we can expect more of this in the future now that the line's been crossed, said peter r. mansoor, a retired army colonel and a former aide to mr. petraeus, who is now a professor at ohio state university. i'm not sure it's healthy for civil-military relations.
the risk, colonel mansoor said, is that whether the criticism is deserved or not, future presidents may be less willing to trust their senior officers, thinking they'll turn on them once they're out of uniform, or they may be less willing to promote officers who are very competent but perhaps independently minded.
while mr. mattis's resignation was the first over a major national security issue by a leading cabinet member since 1980, when cyrus vance quit as secretary of state, his conflict with mr. trump was hardly the first time that there have been clashes between civilian and military officials.
in 2006, a number of retired military officers publicly rebuked defense secretary donald h. rumsfeld for his handling of the iraq war. in 1993, president bill clinton was at odds with military officials over allowing gay men and lesbians in the military. and there was a hefty amount of distrust between president barack obama and military officials over the administration's approach to iraq and afghanistan.
during the 2016 presidential campaign, michael t. flynn, a retired army lieutenant general, led chants of lock her up! about hillary clinton at the republican national convention, while john r. allen, a retired marine general, as a speaker at the democratic national convention, questioned mr. trump's ability to be the commander in chief.
but peter feaver, a former national security council official under mr. clinton and president george w. bush who now teaches political science at duke university, said mr. trump has taken these clashes to a new level.
we've never had a president who was as insensitive to the norms and taboos of the military, mr. feaver said. people like mcchrystal, people like mcraven and the others are responding to the president's breaking of these taboos.
no american president has ever dared risk the american civil-military relationship for less cause or with such childish malice, tom nichols, a professor at the naval war college, wrote in the atlantic after the mcchrystal tweets.
speaking to reporters on tuesday, wright looked more like himself than he did after the 2016 surgery. he said he hoped his neck problem was resolved. now he needs at-bats and innings in the field to make up for the lost time.
wright hit well when he returned in 2015, and displayed some power. in his limited 2016 season, he did not hit for average and struck out at an alarming rate. in addition, he was making sidearm throws from third base, with not that much velocity on the ball. although wright said he does not know how much the neck injury affected his throwing, collins said there was no doubt in his mind that wright's neck and nerve discomfort affected his shoulder — and his throwing.
wright said he was now near the end of a shoulder-exercise program, designed to strengthen small muscles that atrophied after the neck surgery. he said he hoped to begin a throwing schedule this week that will gradually intensify. he knows there will be rust to knock off in all aspects of his game, he said, but he hopes he can be ready for opening day on april 3.
this is a fun time to be a met, he said, and i want to be a part of this winning season we're going to have.
collins said the mets might get wright into spring training games sooner this year than in 2016 so the team can see what he is capable of. wright said he would be forthright with collins about his physical condition to avoid potential setbacks.
wright may have to try his hand at first base, depending on how much throwing ability he eventually demonstrates. for the moment, at least, he still views himself as a third baseman.
but now millions of dollars in grants are on hold after one mexican-american and two white business owners sued the state, arguing that the fund for black residents discriminated against them.
the dispute in oregon is the latest legal skirmish in the nation's decades-long battle over affirmative action, and comes in a year in which the pandemic has starkly exposed the socioeconomic and health disparities that african-americans face. it has unfolded, too, against the backdrop of the black lives matter movement, with institutions across america — from corporations to city councils — acknowledging systemic racism, and activists demanding that meaningful steps be taken to undo racial inequities.
politicians, social scientists and jurists have long clashed over how far the government and institutions should go to repair the harm caused by racial discrimination — and the extent to which past racism should influence today's decisions. in creating the oregon cares fund, lawmakers took the rare step of explicitly naming a single racial group as the beneficiary, arguing that black residents have been subjected to unique discrimination that put them at a disadvantage during the pandemic.
over the decades, various remedies to address discrimination have been met with legal challenges. supreme court rulings have established that race-based policies are constitutional only if they achieve a compelling governmental interest and are narrowly tailored to do so. the court has most notably allowed race to be used as a factor in college admissions to achieve student diversity. but the court in recent decades has also sided against one of the original rationales for affirmative action policies — to undo past discrimination and its lingering effect.
you have to show that there's this really close nexus between why you're using race and the outcome you're seeking, said melissa murray, a professor of law at new york university. and i think here it's going to be a real question as to whether funding just black businesses through this cares fund is actually the only way that you could address the problems that black oregonians have experienced during this particular period.
it has not been clear how our bodies manage this trick.
some years ago, scientists did discover one of the likely mechanisms, which involves leptin, a hormone released by fat cells. in broad terms, when people add fat, they produce more leptin, which then jump-starts processes in the brain that reduce appetite and should cause their bodies to drop that new weight.
but obviously this system is not perfect or no one would hold on to added pounds.
so for the new study, which was published this month in proceedings of the national academy of sciences, an international group of researchers began to wonder whether there might be other processes at work.
to find out, they first gathered groups of mice and rats. they chose both species, hoping that, if any results were common to each, this might indicate that they also could occur in other mammals, including, potentially, us.
then the scientists implanted tiny capsules into each rodent's abdomen. some contained weights equaling about 15 percent of each animal's body mass. others were empty.
in effect, some of the animals had just gained a big chunk of weight.
the scientists then left the rodents alone to deal with these added ounces as they would. and their bodies quickly went to work. within two days, the animals containing the weighted capsules were eating less and after two weeks, had generally lost almost as much weight as the capsules contained.
after winning the a.f.c. championship for only the second time in their history, the bengals lost, 20-16, to walsh's 49ers in super bowl xxiii. the 49ers sealed the victory when montana tossed a 10-yard touchdown pass to john taylor with 34 seconds remaining. (the bengals have never returned to the super bowl.)
known as a fiery and hard-driving coach willing to go against the grain, wyche made waves for another, more embarrassing reason two years later. in october 1990, the n.f.l. fined wyche $27,000, a record for a coach, for preventing a female reporter, denise tom of usa today, from entering the team's locker room. he was unrepentant, saying that women shouldn't be able to walk in on players while they were naked.
no amount of fine will force me to change my conviction on this matter, he told reporters. we need to find a way for women to have a decent and open access to all these athletes. the commissioner feels like it's more important to fine me than to seek another solution.
wyche had been fined twice before, once for knocking a microphone out of a reporter's hand and once for barring all reporters from the team's locker room after a loss. the third fine, though, came just weeks after another reporter, lisa olson of the boston herald, complained that she had been surrounded by several naked players in the new england patriots' locker room and verbally abused.
wyche's willingness to buck convention extended to the field. he ran up the score on opponents, once ordering an onside kick even though his team was ahead 45-0. he was also outspoken. he criticized fans in cleveland for throwing debris on the field and implored fans in cincinnati to stop throwing snowballs.
after a 3-13 finish in 1991, wyche, with several years remaining on his contract, left cincinnati for tampa, where he coached the buccaneers for four seasons. though he led the bengals during one of the franchise's more successful stretches, he had only a 61-66 record there (plus 3-2 in the playoffs) and a 23-41 record in tampa.
he was quarterbacks coach for the buffalo bills in 2004 and 2005, then moved to pickens, where he volunteered as a quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator for the town's high school team.
it seems highly unlikely that the 121.92-meter home run would gain any more traction now than it did during baseball's flirtation with metric distances on outfield fences in the 1970s. and a television audience might be more confused than delirious if it was announced that stephen curry had just hit a buzzer-beater from 10.67 meters instead of 35 feet.
the hoariest of clichés also appear safe, too. football is in no danger of becoming a game of centimeters.
but track and field long ago loosened its ties to the feet and inches of the british imperial system, and among track events, only the seldom-run mile persists as a revered imperial distance.
yet within american track and field there are conflicting views about how pervasive the metric system should become. one side calls the imperial system antiquated and says it should be abandoned in favor of international uniformity. the other side says familiarity is needed to preserve history and maintain relevance for a sport that is robust in participation but struggles for spectator interest outside of the olympics.
the metropolitan museum of art has probably made itself popular with no one by announcing it will soon impose a mandatory admission fee of up to $25 on visitors who don't live in new york state. but given financial realities — a multimillion-dollar deficit that will not disappear by itself — the new policy, announced on thursday, is as understandable as it is regrettable.
for decades, the met followed a pay-as-you-wish tradition, suggesting a $25 payment from every adult but not requiring it. if you wished to put up much less, so be it. in recent years, the share of museumgoers paying the full freight shrank as the suggested price rose to $25 from $12. in 2004, 63 percent of adults paid in full. in 2017, the figure shriveled to 17 percent. the system simply isn't successful anymore, said daniel weiss, the met's president and chief executive. he said his institution is the only major museum anywhere that relies on voluntary fees and doesn't get most of its revenue from the government.
so starting in march, non-new yorkers will have to pay $25, though students and the elderly will be charged, respectively, $12 and $17. the only exceptions are students from connecticut and new jersey. pay as you wish remains in place for them. the same goes for new yorkers. in effect, they will be carded, forced to produce identification — a driver's license, a library card, a bank statement — that shows their address.
the new system is in line with prices charged at some other institutions, like the museum of modern art. it's not expected to produce torrents of new money for the met, though. mr. weiss put the projected extra revenue from non-new yorkers between $6 million and $11 million. new york city's government — which has given the new policy its blessing and contributes more than $27 million a year to help cover the museum's operating expenses — spends $6 million every 35 minutes or so.

welcome. a group of friends and i used to gather for brunch every year on new year's day, and at the end of the meal, we'd each write a resolution on a slip of paper and put it in a hat. then everyone drew from the hat, each receiving a random resolution, an assignment for the year from someone else at the table.
the resolution might be practical, something the person writing it hoped to do themselves: fold your clothes every night when you take them off, sign up for voice lessons. or it might be something ridiculous: one year i drew, every morning when you wake up, stick your arms out at your sides, wiggle your fingers and say, it's showtime!
we were trying to add some whimsy to resolution-making, to make entertaining a self-improvement practice that can sometimes feel punishing. as a result we were nudged out of our comfort zones (the friend who drew the voice lessons resolution actually took some lessons, something he wouldn't have done otherwise). since we hadn't come up with the resolutions ourselves, they seemed like fun challenges rather than aspirations in pursuit of which we could fall short. (it took about a month for it's showtime to fade from my morning schedule, but i still do it every now and then: a silly, theatrical flourish to start the day.)
for 2021, why not go gentle on the resolutions, keeping in mind that your nerves might be frayed, your zest for a life overhaul a bit depleted? just as, earlier in the pandemic, i suggested making tiny changes in your day in order to create a routine instead of adopting a rigid schedule, you might look at resolutions as ways to tinker with your habits, not to totally replace them.
the timing and outlook for the president's impeachment trial were already murky. in a pair of votes in december, the house impeached mr. trump for abuse of power and obstruction of congress. the charges stem from his bid to pressure ukraine to investigate his political rivals, while withholding nearly $400 million of military aid.
ms. pelosi has refused to transmit the charges against mr. trump to the senate, in a bid to give senate democrats more leverage as they try to force republicans to agree to call administration witnesses and gain access to more documents. the president blocked administration officials from testifying in the house inquiry and refused to turn over documents that impeachment investigators requested, prompting the obstruction charge.
now, the question is whether the coming debate on iran will affect the calculations by democrats and republicans strategizing over the terms and length of a trial.
democrats on the left argue that the impulses that led mr. trump to strike general suleimani are themselves grounds for his removal.
the issues are connected, said representative ro khanna, democrat of california, who sponsored legislation to block mr. trump from launching an unauthorized strike against iran. it shows the same reckless pattern of policymaking that he engaged in with ukraine. it's no longer a matter of standing up for the rule of law and the constitution. this is a matter of safeguarding our national security and peace because a president that disregards constitutional processes can pose a huge risk to stability and peace.
senators spent the year-end holidays preparing for the impeachment trial, a showdown over the fate of mr. trump's presidency that could consume parts of january and february.
lawmakers and aides close to ms. pelosi say she has not yet made up her mind on how or when to proceed, and said foreign policy would not affect her thinking. a decision could come as soon as this week, when house lawmakers reconvene on tuesday and the speaker holds a series of meetings with her leadership team.
i thought that i was never going to swim with my friends again, which was ridiculous, because of course climate change doesn't happen all at once. the horrors would recede, regroup and advance again with new strength, and there was no law saying we couldn't go swimming through it all.
and before long we were back out there every day, in that beautiful water. it wasn't so much that i planned on swimming into mid-november in a lake in northern california at 3,017 feet, as i just kept going every single day and over time, the water kept getting colder and colder. it was around oct. 26 where i started to feel that i was doing something unusual and brave and at times painful. my first thought every morning was resentment that my day had this big hard part in the middle of it. but even as the air and water got colder, it didn't get worse, it got better. my body started to get used to it. the big hard part of my day became the best thing in it. my first thought every morning became swimming. and then i would just lie there smiling stupidly into the dark.
for the first minute in very cold water, your brain just goes on a vacation. (cue several million people googling cold water near me.) you are nothing except a body experiencing itself. i laugh at this stage, i laugh like my guts are going to fall out of my body, then scream. it's so cold, and yes, that is hard. but it doesn't last that long, and you can feel the unpleasantness of the cold melding with the pleasantness of it until it is all pleasantness, until all you feel is bliss.
your skin is cold, but inside, you are warm, and safe-feeling, so that the cold is just a sensation, and not a misery. it's unlike anything else i have ever felt in my entire life, and it is just a moment every day when i feel too good to remember that things are bad. and then, honestly, i spend the rest of the day recovering from it, not hyper-focusing on a million tasks, not being free from anxiety, not feeling ready to conquer things. i take a long bath and often fall asleep, and at some point manage to do the work required of me, but it's basically a whole day lost to 20 minutes of extreme pleasure, and that's fine with me.
i think it's funny that whenever people talk about swimming in cold water they immediately start talking about how good it is for you. oh that's so good for your immune system, it's good for your heart, it's good for your skin, it's good for your circulation, good for your anxiety. maybe at another time in human history i would have cared, but at this point, i'm like, what does good for you even mean? two months ago i saw the sun disappear, and it will not be the last time, so, forgive me if i feel like the good for you ship has sailed.
the lake is not my source of strength or my fountain of youth. i swim in the cold water because it feels good, and i will keep doing it for that reason, until one of us is no longer here.
the trump administration and members of congress pressured the new york stock exchange on tuesday to remove china's three major state-run telecommunications companies from the exchange.
the stock exchange late monday had reversed its original plans, announced last week, to delist the companies to comply with an executive order from the administration aimed at stopping american investment in companies linked to the chinese military.
monday's sudden reversal by the exchange sowed confusion and reflected the ongoing fighting within the trump administration about how hard a line to take against china during president trump's final days in office. treasury secretary steven mnuchin has been pushing for greater accommodation for chinese companies, while officials in the department of defense have argued that the companies in question must be delisted for national security reasons.
the big board said late on monday that it had halted plans to delist the companies after consulting with the treasury department. the about-face came a week after the exchange said it would stop the trading of shares in china unicom, china telecom and china mobile by jan. 11 in response to a trump administration executive order that blocked americans from investing in companies tied to the chinese military.
can ballet express a modern view of the sexes? in the western contemporary world, women and men often hold equal status at work, as leaders, as voters, as breadwinners. this kind of equality, however, is precisely what ballet cannot show.
instead, it creates an either-or dualism from the difference between man and woman. he does most of the partnering (traditionally, all of it). she rises onto point. when he does the same (seldom), the effect is comic. the foot is a relatively tiny part of the body; yet its significance becomes colossal.
the meanings that flow from ballet are not only about gender. yet the use of pointwork places the woman on a different level of being.
and so ballet remains a sexist view of the world — one that privileges the woman, certainly, but on terms that let her shine only by doing what no man can. should we agree with the choreographer george balanchine (1904-83) that ballet is woman? or do we qualify this, as the choreographer pam tanowitz (born in 1969) has recently done, by saying that ballet is a man's idea of woman?
change in the auto industry is merciless. several years ago, more than a few analysts and journalists predicted that volvo would go the way of plymouth, oldsmobile, mercury and scion, all shuttered brands. volvo, once an independent swedish company, was a part of ford for a spell, and during that period its designs and engineering grew old. too little change can be lethal.
then in 2010, volvo was sold to the zhejiang geely holding group, a chinese company. somehow, chinese investment has produced the most swedish volvos ever. skoal!
looking more scandinavian than a trip to ikea, the all-new s90 sedan starts with a solid foundation. it, like the company's wildly successful xc90 s.u.v., rides on volvo's innovative structural platform, called scalable product architecture, or spa. the only fixed component is the section from the front axle to the firewall (which separates the cabin from the engine bay). all other points — the wheelbase, front and rear overhangs and width — can be lengthened or shortened. think lego.
now for volvo, building many of its vehicles, from the coming midsize s60 sedan to the three-row xc90, starts with a trip to the spa for the engineers. that saves money. how swedish.
after getting just their second win in eight games, the buffalo sabres credited the victory to a solid team effort.
evander kane and justin bailey scored 1 minute 42 seconds apart around the first intermission on tuesday, leading the buffalo sabres to a 4-1 victory over the rangers at madison square garden.
zemgus girgensons and jack eichel also scored for buffalo, and anders nilsson stopped 24 shots for the sabres. sam reinhart had two assists, extending his career-best points streak to seven games.
we played a pretty simple game for 60 minutes and had success, eichel said. at times this season, we've gotten away from our game. you can see in the third period, we didn't really give them much at all. a lot of pucks were north and in their zone and it seemed like we played with it in their zone.
interest in their plans has been intense, given that history and the seagram building's architectural significance. the partners are best known for the lavish, sometimes over-the-top food and design at downtown restaurants like carbone and dirty french.
this much they do know: the grill, their grand, retro steakhouse in the former grill room, is scheduled to open in april, with mr. carbone as its executive chef. no firm opening date has been set for the pool, the modern, japanese-influenced seafood restaurant in the former pool room, where mr. torrisi will be the executive chef.
major food will also renovate and reopen the more casual space downstairs, formerly called brasserie, though the group has it on the back burner for now.
the menus for the grill and the pool have been drafted, and the partners gather regularly with other members of their team to test dishes in a specially built kitchen on the ground floor of their first restaurant, torrisi italian specialties, which they closed two years ago.
they have tried several incarnations of the smoked goose and duck terrine. one was slightly leaner, the foie at its center shaped into a perfect cylinder. is there booze in the figs now? mr. torrisi asked. maybe, his tone suggested, there should be.
evernote is a good example. it includes an export notes feature, but it only lets you export notes into two formats that are compatible with just a few other note-taking apps. microsoft's note-taking app onenote, along with apple's notes app, can easily import evernote records. but if your app of choice is something else, such as google keep, you will have to manually paste your notes in the new app.
flickr is also difficult to part ways with. getting out your photos requires lots of manual labor: you have to download all the photos, which can take a significant amount of time if you have thousands of high-resolution images, and then upload them to a new photo service.
when companies don't provide convenient tools to export your data, look elsewhere by doing a quick web search for solutions. there are plenty of people in the same boat as you, and chances are they have written scripts, or lightweight programs, to automatically pull out your data for you.
if there is no convenient way to export your data, sometimes it doesn't hurt to just take out what is most important to you. perhaps you don't need five-year-old notes from evernote anymore, so you could just manually paste your latest memos and get a fresh start with a different app.
on the bright side, you can learn a lot from a tough breakup with an app — which can be especially useful when looking for a replacement.
the biggest lessons: pick a tool that supports a wide array of formats instead of proprietary ones. and before you commit to a new app, make sure it is as easy to get out as it is to get in.
ditching apple's calendar app was fairly easy. all my calendar data was already stored online and apple's app supports calendars from multiple online services including google, microsoft and facebook. the key was finding an app that also supported those services but performed better.
michael zorc, the team's technical director, was disappointed. but he also knew such a day would come: pulisic had never been shy about his ambition to play in england.
so dortmund and pulisic quickly set about moving forward with parallel goals: the club hoping to maximize the value of an attractive young asset still under its control, the player trying to make sure his dream move landed him in the right place.
there was a lot of trust in these talks, said zorc, who said multiple clubs expressed interest in pulisic and that at least one other premier league team was willing to pay dortmund's final asking price.
his transfer will bring an end to three remarkable years at dortmund. as a 17-year-old, he broke into the club's first team and promptly became the youngest non-german to score a bundesliga goal. but his rise slowed somewhat this season as injuries and the emergence of other young players diminished pulisic's playing time. zorc said he suspected the transfer negotiations had distracted pulisic this season — maybe his mind was not so clear — but hopes the resolution will have a positive effect on the field. pulisic agrees.
i feel much, much clearer in my head now that all this is passed, he said about making the deal public.
pulisic has five more months to contribute at dortmund, which leads the bundesliga with 42 points — 6 ahead of bayern munich — through 17 games. after that, he will continue his development at chelsea, a club not particularly known for nurturing young players.
still, it was not lost on pulisic — or his father, mark, who worked closely with him to evaluate his transfer destination — that chelsea's roster situation, with several forwards potentially moving on this summer, could work in his favor.
from the minute we arrived in india, i had to let go. i had to stop worrying because i couldn't worry anymore — it is impossible to worry about everything i might need to worry about in india: contaminated water, mosquitoes that may carry dengue or malaria, traffic that often follows no rules. against all of that, did it really matter if my daughter had gained three ounces or five?
the next day, in mumbai, i went to a fancy baby shop to buy cribs, ready to spend a few hours weighing the pros and cons of various options. with the baby strapped to me in a carrier and an iced coffee in my hand, i marched in to the shop and said, i'd like to see your options for cribs, please.
this one, the salesperson said. i ordered it and left the shop within 10 minutes.
i myself was born in india and had a perfectly safe and sound upbringing here but, in the eternal battle of nature versus nurture, my surroundings in brooklyn seemed to be affecting me more than my own childhood or my mother's suggestions that i calm down. her advice was impossible for me to hear in my new york environment, surrounded by my fellow mothers whose days are ruled by feeding apps. when i showed my indian grandmother the feeding app on my phone, instead of marveling at it and saying she wished she'd had such a thing when she was a young mother, she just laughed at me and took a long sip of her coconut water.
i had been nervous about making this big trip with our newborn daughter because to leave our little neighborhood of brooklyn and travel across the world and set up a different life felt too daunting. babies are challenging: in a cruel failure of evolution, adults require five hours of uninterrupted sleep in order to function and newborn babies need to feed every three hours.
they say babies thrive on routine and i had just begun to find mine in brooklyn, but it was a perfectly crafted rhythm with no space for deviation or change. i have the luxury of working from home so i was feeding her as soon as the baby-feeding app beeped and i put her down for naps at exactly the same time every day.
my baby, who loved 22 out of the 24 hours it took us to get to mumbai, doesn't seem to be too bothered about her routine being disrupted so far. she loves all the people in india and reaches for them faster than i can swoop in and force them to cover themselves with antibacterial gel.
she's had a stomach upset already but didn't seem nearly as troubled by it as i was. we went out to dinner with friends who have a 7-month-old and both babies stayed awake for part of the dinner and then fell asleep in their strollers. when we got home we transferred her to her crib and she kept sleeping peacefully.
a steep stairway leads to the cramped basement, half of which once served as a drying room, mr. huang said as he walked into the room, which is still encased with metal panels. mr. hong used to hang items on rows of pegs, and used a gas stove to heat the space for drying.
with no washing machines in the shop, the huangs outsource much of the bulk laundry work. but for rush requests, ms. huang piles the clothing in a handcart and does it herself at a nearby laundromat.
the huangs have known many of their customers for decades, though usually by the ticket number stamped inside their garments instead of by name.
customer 89, for example, is senator chuck schumer, who lives in the neighborhood.
on a recent weekday, customer 762 walked in.
it's funny, i've been coming here all these years, and i don't even know their names, said customer 762, whose non-laundry name is sheldon jacobson. mr. jacobson, 70, a retired city worker, has been coming to the shop for 40 years, since when mr. hong owned it. i'm amazed they're still here, he said.
another customer dropped off his laundry and mr. huang said, c-20 — nice man.
outside the shop, customer c-20 said that his name was mike mellor and that he had been getting his shirts done at san toy since 1974. that day, he had dropped off a bundle of sheets and shirts.

in the spring, progressive said it had given customers premium credits of 20 percent for april and may, a payout totaling about $1 billion. asked about a possible second refund, a company spokesman, ronald f. davis, said in an email that progressive had lowered auto rates in more than 40 states from april through december and would continue to monitor our driving and claims data to determine where additional actions are warranted.
insurers over all have returned about $14 billion to auto customers because people are driving less, said james lynch, chief actuary and senior vice president of research and education at the insurance information institute, an industry group. the industry has been flexible about working with strapped customers on payments during the pandemic, he said, and has contributed $280 million to charitable endeavors related to the coronavirus.
the insurance industry has had a challenging year in other ways, mr. lynch said, with significant claims related to hurricanes and wildfires. yet, he said, the industry has done as much to help people out as anyone.
robert passmore, a claims expert at the american property casualty insurance association, said in an email that insurers had been responding to the change in driving patterns. an industry auto premium index was down 7 percent in october and 6 percent in november, reflecting decreases in response to the falloff in claim frequency, he said.
that means that in general, personal auto rates are lower than they were a year ago, mr. passmore added.
insurance relief offered in the spring typically shaved 15 to 25 percent off customers' premium payments for one or more months, according to a report in october from the national association of insurance commissioners, a group of state regulators.
but a report published by u.s. pirg's education fund affiliate, examining relief given by the 10 top insurers in each state, found that most hadn't given customers more than half of one month's premium. over all, they were pretty stingy, ms. murray said.
mr. gutierrez, 47, started thinking about these issues when he was a student and discovered two formative books: this bridge called my back helped him find a voice for his own rage and passion when he was part of the group queer nation; and sally banes's terpsichore in sneakers, which chronicled artists from the 1960s collective judson dance theater, got him pondering the perceived division in dance between identity and personal exploration on the one hand and abstraction and formalism on the other.
using predominantly white casts in europe changed everything. we were playing with a lot of the same formal ideas, he said, but something else was coming up for me. it wasn't that it didn't work. it was just that i realized it felt like any investigation around abstraction or improvisation or form would probably just be read as that.
he wanted to go deeper, and that's when it hit him: what it would be like to work with a group that was all latin american?
in the opening section, which is improvisation based, the dancers work with materials, including a ladder, stools and clamps, as well as pieces of fabric, which they drape over their bodies and carry throughout the space. at times, it really does feel like a bridge is being built and torn down over and over again. all the while, the dancers show their skin, their flesh, their sweat.
to mr. gutierrez, the pieces of fabric conjure different images, like color block painting and brazilian tropicália. sometimes they become boundaries, he said. sometimes they become a shape of a discarded thing. there's not a lot of reverence. it's not like, 'oh this beautiful canvas.' there's even a tent city illusion.
within this painterly setting — tuçe yasak's lighting manages to change the temperature from hot to cool — the performers generate and manipulate the sound. they move speakers. they stop it suddenly by closing a laptop. is it building, is it growing? mr. gutierrez said. sometimes yes, sometimes no.
still, there are some very real consequences here.
historic sites like the african burial ground and grant's tomb are closed. gateway national recreation area, a national park with locations in queens, brooklyn, staten island and new jersey, is open, but with no visitor services. and if you're itching for a piece of hamilton history, try the hamilton lottery, because his home in upper manhattan is closed.
gerald quaye, an air traffic controller at kennedy airport, is not getting paid but still reports to work. if the shutdown extends past this week, mr. quaye said he is unsure how he will pay his mortgage. i've never been late and i've never defaulted, he said on friday, and hopefully, it doesn't get to that point.
other closed historical sites: federal hall, saint paul's church, eleanor roosevelt's home, franklin roosevelt house, the vanderbilt mansion and women's rights national historical park, among others.
closed museums: national museum of the american indian heye center and cooper hewitt.
open, but without visitor services: appalachian trail, sagamore hill, and the upper delaware scenic and recreational river. enjoy those restrooms.
open, because of state funding: ellis island (where governor cuomo had his inauguration) and the statue of liberty.
which is what thompson and lowry and george and beal will be trying to do on saturday night, along with four others: devin booker, eric gordon, wayne ellington and tobias harris. the dunk contest, meanwhile, now relies on lesser-known, and often younger, players because of the longstanding reluctance of stars to participate. only one all-star, victor oladipo of the indiana pacers, is participating in the contest this year. derrick jones jr., who came in second in last year's dunk contest, had played in only seven n.b.a. games when he competed in 2017. and the 2017 winner, glenn robinson iii, was the 40th pick in the 2014 draft.
in the dunk contest, if you are having lebron and paul george, it would be very popular, said clyde drexler, who, when he was an active player, took part in both the dunk and the 3-point contest. a lot of guys are afraid to get in the dunk contest because they may not win and it'll hurt their brand.''
the n.b.a. has taken steps to try to revamp the dunk contest. it has, at different times, changed the number of competitors, allowed first-round byes and then taken them away, changed the scoring system, added and then taken away a wheel that selects what dunk a player should perform and incorporated fan voting. in contrast, the rules for the 3-point competition, which began in 1986, have stayed largely the same.
nevertheless, notes michael bass, the chief spokesman for the n.b.a., the dunk contest remains the highest-rated event on the saturday night of all-star weekend, even if the 3-point contest is drawing bigger-name players. maybe we will see that change over time,'' he added. the interest in the 3-point-shooting contest has certainly taken off.''
even with that surge in interest, there is talk of altering the 3-point format. knicks coach jeff hornacek, a former 3-point contest participant, has suggested holding separate contests for big men and guards. fraser has wondered about the possibility of adding a deeper, half-court shot that would be worth more points. miller excitedly detailed why the league should have a former 3-point contest winner team with a current n.b.a. shooter in an old-school/new-school competition.
this is the one way you would get me out of retirement to participate: have a legend — ray allen, dell curry, dale ellis — team up with the current guys, miller said. i would go first, he would go second. people want to see ray allen. people would want to see larry bird. i think that would be hot.
ms. collins was right about the first part: mr. trump did learn a pretty big lesson. he learned that he can break the law and undermine democracy with impunity. he learned that he can do the political equivalent of shooting someone in the middle of fifth avenue, and he won't lose the support of republicans. so, naturally, he pulled the trigger again.
this time, many republicans have again swarmed to the president's defense. as of monday night, more than 140 house members and at least 13 senators were expected to object to electoral vote results on wednesday, when congress officially counts the ballots. that is, more than 150 republican lawmakers have signed on to reject the votes of tens of millions of americans.
on what grounds are they taking this stupefying step? overwhelming evidence of voting fraud and irregularities, they claim. when called to present such evidence in a court of law, however, they've got nothing. in dozens of lawsuits filed over the past two months, mr. trump's lawyers and allies have been unable to document more than a few isolated cases of fraud in any state, much less the hundreds of thousands of cases in multiple states that would be necessary to change the outcome. that's no surprise in an election that was praised by election officials as the most secure in american history.
there are lawmakers who understand the grave danger in what their colleagues are doing. several republican senators — including ms. collins, lisa murkowski of alaska, bill cassidy of louisiana and mitt romney of utah — have urged congress to move forward and certify mr. biden's victory. in choosing any other path, warned senator tom cotton of arkansas, congress would take away the power to choose the president from the people, which would essentially end presidential elections and place that power in the hands of whichever party controls congress. the senate majority leader, mitch mcconnell, has also urged his colleagues not to object.
in a sense, this is all political theater. every state long ago certified its vote totals without contest. on monday, gabriel sterling, a top georgia election official, publicly and painstakingly debunked every one of mr. trump's claims of fraud. this is all easily, provably false, he said. the objectors know this; many won their own seats on the same ballots that they are attempting to invalidate. what they are really objecting to is the fact that mr. trump lost.
but there are many americans who believe their claims who are not in on this disingenuous, cynical game — and who believe that their votes for mr. trump are the ones being invalidated. that mistrust will have consequences that extend far beyond wednesday's certification, including the creation of a generational myth of a stolen election, the discrediting of mr. biden's presidency from the outset and the passage of stricter voting laws that target democratic-leaning voters, under the guise of electoral integrity.
that's a big problem, because a republic works only when the losers accept the results, and the legitimacy of their opponents. all the more reason to commend republican officials like mr. raffensperger and mr. sterling — and the handful of republican congress members who have spoken out, however wanly, about mr. trump's scheme — for resisting the immense corruption and pressure from their leaders.
if only that weren't extraordinary in the republican party today.
but wait. there's more to escaped alone than this sustained backyard idyll. at regular intervals, the stage goes black, and when the light returns it's in the form of two vast, illuminated red rectangles, one within the other, crackling and burning in the dark. mrs. jarrett stands before them, all by herself, delivering reports of a future in which nature, poisoned beyond endurance, has run amok.
these bosch-like accounts are grotesque and whimsical, painting landscapes of destruction from the basic vocabularies of both contemporary culture and ages-old apocalyptic imagery. stories of life-devouring flood, famine and pestilence are woven with references to such seemingly trivial phenomena as television cooking shows and selfies.
here, for example, is mrs. jarrett on the devastation wrought by a wind developed by property developers: buildings migrated from london to lahore, kyoto to kansas city, and survivors were interned for having no travel documents. some in the whirlwind went higher and higher, the airsick families taking selfies in case they could ever share them. shantytowns were cleared. pets rained from the sky. a kitten became famous.
the reality within the surrealism of such descriptions is what makes them stick to your memory. (i saw escaped alone at the royal court theater in london a year ago, and its images seem to have been in my bloodstream ever since.) ms. bassett delivers these monologues not in the ominous style of some otherworldly oracle but in the matter-of-fact, common-woman manner of her character.
as extreme as these visions are, they also feel ineffably linked to the more everyday worries and make-believe speculations (what bird would you like to be?) that have been shared by sally, lena and vi. and there turns out to be more than meets the eye (or ear) to these women, too, as we learn by carefully calibrated degrees what it is that keeps them awake at night.
the play's combination of theatrical technique and untrammeled imagination, and of the personal and the universal, make you understand why ms. churchill is regarded by many (rightly, i think) as the most dazzlingly inventive living dramatist in the english language. no one in theater these days is better at exploding and reassembling traditional modes of language and storytelling.
escaped alone is a fairy tale of sorts, as were ms. churchill's earlier the skriker and far away. this magnificent writer's latest variation on that form reaffirms such tales' power to warm us even as they warn of the unspeakable dangers in the wide, dark world beyond.
stocks sink as traders eye georgia senate elections this briefing has ended. follow our latest coverage of markets, business and the economy.
stocks on wall street sink in their steepest decline since october. wall street began the year with a tumble on monday, with the s&p 500 suffering its steepest decline in more than two months as it retreated from record territory. analysts traced the sell-off to a number of factors, including political jitters stemming from tuesday's runoff election in georgia — which will determine control of the u.s. senate — concerns about a resurgent coronavirus, and the simple need for investors to take a breather after a stretch of sizzling gains. it wasn't clear that the slump would continue into tuesday. stocks in asian markets were steady early on tuesday, while futures markets suggested that wall street would stabilize when it opens. the index fell 1.5 percent, its sharpest drop since late october. stocks that have been most sensitive to investor sentiment about the coronavirus pandemic led the decline. shares of royal caribbean cruises, wynn resorts, marriott international and carnival were all down by 5 percent or more.
major benchmarks in europe also gave up most of their early gains on monday, though they managed to stay in positive territory for the day. the stoxx europe 600 index rose 0.7 percent, and the ftse 100 index in britain gained 1.7 percent. after europe's markets closed on monday, prime minister boris johnson imposed a strict new national lockdown as a more contagious variant of the coronavirus threatened to overwhelm the nation's beleaguered hospitals. the variant is now present in the united states, where coronavirus cases and deaths have reached records in recent days. monday's retreat also came after the s&p 500 rallied more than 16 percent in 2020, defying the economic crisis and the human catastrophe of the pandemic, as the federal reserve stepped in to support financial markets, congress spent trillions on unemployment and business support programs, and vaccinations began, showing a sustainable way out of the pandemic. but investors have always had to contend with the still-spreading coronavirus pandemic, the risk of new lockdowns and political turmoil in the united states. on tuesday, two runoff senate elections in georgia will settle control of the upper house of congress, and finally determine how hard it will be for president-elect joseph r. biden jr. to move forward on his agenda. in the wake of the presidential election in november, investors had begun to anticipate that republicans would retain control of the senate, giving them the ability to limit the biden administration's ability to raise taxes or increase regulation.
that view had also helped lift stocks at the end of last year, but monday's trading showed investors had grown less confident in a republican win on tuesday. the market fears the democrats taking both of those seats, said julian emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at the brokerage firm btig. he said that investors have been closely watching prediction markets give greater chances to that outcome in recent days. it's basically now a tossup as to what the outcome is going to be tomorrow, after the republicans being heavily favored.
new york stock exchange pressured to push ahead and delist 3 chinese firms a china telecom office in shanghai. the new york stock exchange said monday that it had halted plans to delist china telecom, china unicom and china mobile. credit... alex plavevski/epa, via shutterstock the trump administration and members of congress pressured the new york stock exchange on tuesday to remove china's three major state-run telecommunications companies from the exchange. the stock exchange late monday had reversed its original plans, announced last week, to delist the companies to comply with an executive order from the administration aimed at stopping american investment in companies linked to the chinese military. monday's sudden reversal by the exchange sowed confusion and reflected the ongoing fighting within the trump administration about how hard a line to take against china during president trump's final days in office. treasury secretary steven mnuchin has been pushing for greater accommodation for chinese companies, while officials in the department of defense have argued that the companies in question must be delisted for national security reasons. the big board said late on monday that it had halted plans to delist the companies after consulting with the treasury department. the about-face came a week after the exchange said it would stop the trading of shares in china unicom, china telecom and china mobile by jan. 11 in response to a trump administration executive order that blocked americans from investing in companies tied to the chinese military.
speculation that the reversal was facilitated by mr. mnuchin drew backlash from some china hawks in congress on tuesday. the days of wall street and china benefiting at the expense of american workers and industry has to end, senator marco rubio, republican of florida, said on twitter. he said such a move would be an outrageous effort to undermine president trump's executive order. the department of defense also assailed the decision, issuing a statement to bloomberg news on tuesday that said keeping the companies on the exchange strengthens them and promotes intelligence collection activities by the communist party of china. shortly after releasing the statement, however, the pentagon retracted it. a pentagon spokeswoman had no comment. the treasury department had no comment about whether mr. mnuchin had encouraged the exchange to halt the delistings, and on tuesday, as he was setting off on an international trip, mr. mnuchin wanted the exchange to move ahead with its plan to remove the companies. a senior administration official said mr. mnuchin called stacey cunningham, president of the n.y.s.e. group, on tuesday to voice his objection to the decision not to delist. a new york stock exchange spokesman had no comment on the call. the scope of the president's executive order has been a subject of debate. according to a person familiar with the matter, the stock exchange withdrew its plan to delist the chinese companies after determining that the language was ambiguous and that it was unclear whether the companies were required to be removed.
if the treasury department clarifies that the order applies to those companies, the exchange will move forward with the delisting, this person said. another administration official said an interagency discussion was taking place on tuesday evening about updating the order to make clear that it applied to the chinese telecom companies. the stock exchange's statement on monday did not give a reason for the decision, though it alluded to the ambiguity of the order and said the move came in light of further consultation with relevant regulatory authorities. the exchange said its regulatory department would continue to evaluate the applicability of the order to the telecommunications companies. the delisting would have had little practical impact on the companies, which also have shares listed in hong kong and are state-owned. still, the disappearance from the american exchange had hefty symbolic value for worsening economic ties between china and the united states. alan rappeport and

more than 170 business executives urge congress to certify biden's win. president-elect joseph r. biden jr. boarded his plane at the new castle county airport in wilmington, del., on monday. republicans plan to attempt to disrupt certification of mr. biden's electoral votes on wednesday. credit... doug mills/the new york times chief executives and other leaders from many of america's largest businesses on monday urged congress to certify the electoral vote on wednesday to confirm joseph r. biden jr.'s presidential victory. attempts to thwart or delay this process run counter to the essential tenets of our democracy, they said in a statement. included in the list of 170 signers were laurence d. fink of blackrock, logan green and john zimmer of lyft, brad smith of microsoft, albert bourla of pfizer, and james zelter of apollo global management. over the weekend, president trump called georgia's republican secretary of state in an effort to subvert the election results. on the call, which was recorded, the president pressured the official to find enough votes to overturn mr. biden's victory. the president's demand raised questions about whether he violated election fraud statutes, lawyers said, though a charge is unlikely. president-elect biden won the electoral college, 306 to 232, and the popular vote was 81.2 million for mr. biden to mr. trump's 74.2 million.
members of the president's party are divided over whether to accept that he lost the election: while top republicans, such as mitch mcconnell, the senate majority leader, have pushed back on a futile attempt in congress to reject the results, about a dozen senators and senators-elect have lined up behind president trump's bid to hold on to power. the urging from business leaders came on a volatile day for financial markets and just a day before runoff elections in georgia, which will determine whether republicans or democrats control the senate. coronavirus cases are surging, and vaccinations are taking more time than hoped. business leaders took issue with washington's new divide at a moment of grave uncertainty. our duly elected leaders deserve the respect and bipartisan support of all americans at a moment when we are dealing with the worst health and economic crises in modern history, the business leaders wrote. there should be no further delay in the orderly transfer of power. the statement, which was organized by partnership for new york city, a business advocacy organization, came on the same day that thomas j. donohue, the head of the u.s. chamber of commerce, issued a statement urging certification of the vote. efforts by some members of congress to disregard certified election results in an effort to change the election outcome or to try a make a long-term political point undermines our democracy and the rule of law and will only result in further division across our nation, mr. donohue wrote.
the united states of america faces enormous challenges that not only require an orderly transition of administrations, but the focus of the incoming biden administration and the new congress, and cooperation across party lines, he continued. we urge congress to fulfill its responsibility in counting the electoral votes, the trump administration to facilitate an orderly transition for the incoming biden administration, and all of our elected officials to devote their energies to combating the pandemic and supporting our economic recovery.
haven, the health care venture of amazon, berkshire and jpmorgan, is shutting down. haven, the joint venture of amazon, berkshire hathaway and jpmorgan chase that was formed three years ago to explore new ways to deliver health care to the companies' employees, is disbanding, according to a statement posted on its website. it will cease its operations at the end of february. the haven team made good progress exploring a wide range of health care solutions, as well as piloting new ways to make primary care easier to access, insurance benefits simpler to understand and easier to use, and prescription drugs more affordable, brooke thurston, haven's spokeswoman, said in a statement. haven aimed to improve how people gain access to health care by pulling together the know-how and scale of three of the largest employers in america. its formation sent shock waves through the markets, driving health insurers' stocks lower as investors wagered that the power of the three behemoths combined would completely upend the country's health care delivery system by testing new ideas on more than a million employees. in a note to employees on monday announcing haven's end, jamie dimon, the chief executive of jpmorgan chase, said the three companies would continue to share information. we'll collaborate less formally going forward as we each work to design programs tailored to specific needs of our individual employee populations and local markets, he wrote.
haven worked best as an incubator of ideas, a place to pilot, test and learn — and a way to share best practices across our companies, mr. dimon added. emily flitter and
'spongebob squarepants' moves from pineapple under the sea to hulu live. nickelodeon, home to spongebob squarepants, is among 14 cable networks that will join hulu live tv. credit... nickelodeon thanks to a new agreement between viacomcbs and hulu, the streaming platform controlled by the walt disney company, there will soon be another way to watch nickelodeon's spongebob squarepants and mtv's ridiculousness. when cbs reunited with the cable and film giant viacom at the end of 2019, after a decade apart, executives who swung the deal promised that the combined company would become a bigger player in digital media. viacomcbs took another step toward that goal on monday with the announcement that it had struck a deal to add 14 cable networks to hulu live tv. the 14 networks — a group that includes comedy central, mtv, nickelodeon, bet her, teennick and nicktoons — will join hulu live alongside corporate siblings like pop tv and the cw, which were already available on the service under a previous arrangement between cbs and hulu. when it comes to streaming, viacomcbs has mainly focused on supplying films and tv series to other companies. that strategy is expected to shift slightly this year, when the company will introduce paramount+, a platform named after the company's struggling movie studio.
it will be an expanded version of cbs all access, the streamer best known for star trek: picard, jordan peele's reboot of the twilight zone, and the stand, a limited series based on stephen king's 1978 novel of survivors battling it out after a pandemic wipes out most of humanity. hulu live is a $65-a-month streaming alternative for cord-cutters with roughly four million subscribers. youtube tv, a streaming competitor to hulu live, signed a similar distribution deal with viacomcbs in may 2020.

bitcoin's furious rally continues into 2021. a bitcoin a.t.m. in hong kong. the price of bitcoin is up so far this year to about $31,000, from below $4,000 in march. credit... kin cheung/associated press bitcoin is surging. even after a decline of as much as 10 percent on monday, the price of bitcoin is up so far this year to about $31,000, adding to a furious rally at the end of 2020 that pushed the cryptocurrency near $30,000 a coin, a level it breached over the weekend. in march, it was trading below $4,000. the euphoria stands in contrast to regulatory doubts about cryptocurrencies. digital money enthusiasts have been submitting comments to the treasury department on a proposed new disclosure requirement for certain crypto transactions aimed at closing money laundering regulatory gaps. the deadline for comments is monday, and more than 3,500 submissions are already in. the blockchain association sent treasury secretary steven mnuchin a letter requesting more time to consider the rule, arguing that difficult and momentous issues were being handled hastily. eight house lawmakers also wrote to mr. mnuchin, asking that the review period be extended by several weeks. the staggering 2020 rally highlights bitcoin's speculative appeal but also expectations of its lasting value to some investors. the run that has lifted bitcoin to its current price came as some big institutions said they would begin to buy or allow use of bitcoin.
in may, paul tudor jones, one of wall street's best-known hedge fund managers, said he had put almost 2 percent of his portfolio in bitcoin. he said the cap on bitcoin production made it an attractive alternative to the declining value of traditional currencies, which he thought was inevitable as central banks printed more money to encourage an economic recovery.
in july, the office of the comptroller of the currency, an american regulator, said this summer that banks would be allowed to hold cryptocurrencies for customers.
in august, microstrategy, a software company in virginia, said it bought $250 million of bitcoin to store some of the cash it had in the corporate treasury.
in october, square said it was putting $50 million of its corporate cash into bitcoin. in 2018, square also began offering the digital currency on the cash app, its phone app that people use to send money between friends and family.
soon after square did, paypal announced in october that it would allow people to buy and hold bitcoin and a few other cryptocurrencies. of course, none of that offers any indication of how high bitcoin could go, or when this rally may end. the last time this kind of speculative fever hit the cryptocurrency — in 2017 and 2018 — it doubled in value before halving again in just a few months.
opec and russia fail to agree on oil production levels. an oilfield in the irkutsk region of russia. the prospect of opec, russia and other oil producing countries opening taps could quickly depress oil prices. credit... vasily fedosenko/reuters officials from opec, russia and other major oil-producing countries were unable on monday to reach agreement on whether to allow further increases in oil output in the face of reduced demand from the pandemic. the videoconference was adjourned and was expected to be continued on tuesday. the main issue in the meeting was whether to allow members of the group to raise oil production in february. during a difficult meeting in december, the group, known as opec plus, reached a compromise that permitted production to increase by 500,000 barrels a day starting jan. 1, instead of a previously agreed two million barrels a day. the group also agreed to meet monthly to consider whether further increases were warranted. the first of those monthly meetings, on monday, highlighted differences in the group. producers like russia, iraq and the united arab emirates have their reasons for wanting to lift production. but other members, led by saudi arabia, the de facto leader of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries, are pushing to proceed cautiously. with the pandemic worsening in europe and the united states, the saudi-led bloc figures the demand for oil remains relatively weak, and rising production would probably lead to falling prices.
in a speech opening the meeting, prince abdulaziz bin salman, the saudi oil minister and chairman of the opec plus meetings, called on officials to avoid the temptation to slacken their resolve. at the risk of being seen as a killjoy, he said, i want to urge caution, even in this generally optimistic environment. the members are still keeping about seven million barrels a day, or about 7 percent of global supply in normal times, off the market. the prospect of opening taps could quickly depress oil prices.
a trickle of trucks continues to ease britain into life outside the e.u. a police officer in the port of dover, england, checks a driver's coronavirus test on monday before allowing the truck onto a ferry. credit... glyn kirk/agence france-presse — getty images on the first working day after britain left the european union's single market and customs union, the traffic trickling through the country's busiest port was running smoothly. so far, the imposition of customs declarations for british exporters, the first in decades, hasn't led to the delays some had predicted. but the transition has been made easier by low levels of truck traffic. the eurotunnel and ferry operators, which carry trucks across the english channel, said boats and trains were running on time on monday. grant shapps, the transport secretary, said on sunday that 98 percent of the trucks heading to mainland europe via dover and nearby terminals had the documents they needed. but traffic numbers were low because of the new year's day holiday and weekend. the amount of goods flowing between the two countries was also low because companies had stockpiled last year amid uncertainty about whether london and brussels would sign a trade deal and eliminate potential tariffs by dec. 31, the end of the brexit transition period. much of britain is also under strict business and social restrictions to curb the pandemic.
dfds, a ferry operator at the port of dover, said that on jan. 1 and jan. 2, 1,351 vehicles went through the port, about 40 percent of the volume on those dates last year. some in the logistics industry are concerned that when stockpiles have been used up and trade increases to more normal levels, the full scale of changes at the border will be revealed. even a relatively small percentage of unprepared drivers could cause disruption and congestion as drivers and the companies that own the goods on board adjust to all the new paperwork that is needed, from customs forms to safety certificates and driver permits. it is a mountain of paperwork that we have never had to do before, rod mckenzie, the managing director of the road haulage association, told lbc radio on monday. companies are saying that the forms are onerous and complicated, mr. mckenzie said. he also warned of invisible queues, in which trucks never leave the depot because companies haven't completed paperwork on time or truck drivers haven't gotten coronavirus tests, hampering supply chains. we haven't really started yet, he said. truck drivers are required to show a negative coronavirus test result, received within 72 hours, before they can cross the border into france. the british government has set up testing centers near the border and at points across the country, but some drivers have been turned away for not having the result.
this testing requirement is in place until at least jan. 6 but there hasn't been a decision on whether remove it.

carl icahn sells a $600 million chunk of his stake in herbalife. carl icahn at the dealbook conference in 2015. by reducing his stake in herbalife, the investor will also give up five board seats held by his designees. credit... karsten moran for the new york times the billionaire financier carl icahn has begun to cash out of his nearly decade-long bet on the nutritional food supplements company herbalife, an investment that survived both regulatory review and a prominent — though unsuccessful — challenge by another activist investor. herbalife said late on sunday that it would buy back about $600 million worth of stock held by mr. icahn, who has been the company's biggest shareholder since 2013. doing so would also mean that he will give up five board seats held by his designees. the move, which will reduce mr. icahn's stake to 6 percent from 13 percent, caps an investment success few could have foreseen in late 2012, when the billionaire first poured money into herbalife. at the time, mr. icahn pushed back against a campaign by william a. ackman, the manager of the hedge fund pershing square capital management, who had prominently accused the company of being an illegal pyramid scheme on the verge of being shut down. mr. ackman shorted herbalife shares, wagering that their price would fall to zero, eventually pouring $1 billion into his bet. herbalife denied the accusations, and mr. icahn became one of several hedge fund managers to bet against mr. ackman.
such was mr. icahn's conviction that he raised his stake in the company in 2013, becoming its largest shareholder and most vocal defender. the investment led to a memorable shouting match between mr. icahn and mr. ackman live on cnbc that devolved into a televised airing of grievances — and transfixed wall street traders. (the level of the debate's eloquence may have been encapsulated by mr. icahn likening his rival to a crybaby in the schoolyard. the two later buried the hatchet.) mr. ackman was forced to concede defeat in 2018, quietly closing out the last of his short position after a federal review of herbalife led to an enforcement action that fell far short of shutting down the company. mr. icahn, however, held onto his stake for years, selling his shares over time. it has proved to be profitable as well: the investor said in 2018 that he had collected a $1 billion return on his investment. in a statement late on sunday, mr. icahn said that the time for activism has passed at herbalife.
peugeot and fiat chrysler to merge, creating the fourth-largest carmaker. a psa assembly line in slovakia last year. the merger with fiat chrysler automobiles is intended to help both companies make the transition to electric vehicles. credit... radovan stoklasa/reuters shareholders of fiat chrysler automobiles and psa, the french maker of peugeot, citroën and opel cars, voted on monday to merge as the companies try to survive a transition to electric vehicles. the new company, called stellantis, would be the world's fourth-largest carmaker based on vehicle sales during the first nine months of 2020 and would employ 400,000 people. executives of fiat chrysler and psa agreed to merge at the end of 2019 and have been working out the details and securing regulatory approval since then. but the new company faces major challenges. neither fiat chrysler nor psa has a strong presence in china, the world's largest car market, and they have been slow to introduce electric vehicles. both companies have been hard hit by the pandemic. psa's vehicle sales were down 30 percent in the 11 months through november, while fiat chrysler sold 30 percent fewer cars and trucks in the nine months through september, the most recent reporting period. the pandemic has made the rationale for the merger even more compelling, mr. elkann said. jack ewing and
istanbul — for 17 years, president recep tayyip erdogan won elections by offering voters a vision of restoring the glories of turkey's ottoman past. he extended his country's influence with increased trade and military deployments, and he raised living standards with years of unbroken economic growth.
but after a failed 2016 coup, mr. erdogan embarked on a sweeping crackdown. last year, the economy wobbled and the lira plunged soon after he won re-election with even greater powers. as cronyism and authoritarianism seep deeper into his administration, turks are voting differently — this time with their feet.
they are leaving the country in droves and taking talent and capital with them in a way that indicates a broad and alarming loss of confidence in mr. erdogan's vision, according to government statistics and analysts.
in the last two to three years, not only have students and academics fled the country, but also entrepreneurs, businesspeople, and thousands of wealthy individuals who are selling everything and moving their families and their money abroad.
to make ballet contemporary again, modern music and modern sensibilities are needed. and lo! thursday night at new york city ballet brought two world premieres, entirely unalike, each to new music, each distinctly reflecting the world we inhabit today: the shimmering asphalt, choreographed by pontus lidberg to a commissioned score by david lang, and the times are racing, by justin peck (the company's resident choreographer since 2014) to recorded music by dan deacon. warm ovations greeted both.
deservedly. both are distinct, skilled, arresting. yet they're hard to grasp on a single viewing: more immediately striking as authoritative exercises in style than as absorbing worlds to inhabit. each is sophisticated; there's plenty of detail and structural complexity here to reward later visits. but are they as accomplished in substance as they are in manner? it's good that they remain in repertory into february and then return in may.
mr. peck's the times are racing (24 minutes long) — an excitingly now piece in the way it catches the mood of 21st-century urban protest and the evening's biggest hit with the audience — is danced in sneakers; its dancers are otherwise dressed (by humberto leon) in a motley assortment of urban wear — shorts, jeans, raincoats, t-shirts — as well as a leotard or two. the dance style, with a strong emphasis on currents of motion through the upper body, informal posture and gesture, as well as sequences of tap, makes this work a young relation to such dances as jerome robbins's n.y. export: opus jazz and a number of early pieces by twyla tharp (deuce coupe and ocean's motion, for example).
