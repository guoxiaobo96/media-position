(no blood for oil is the defining jeffersonian attitude toward all our middle eastern misadventures.) the jacksonian tendency, more common on the right than on the left, is toward a pugilistic nationalism that's wary of all international entanglements but ready for war whenever threats arise. (more rubble, less trouble is the essential jacksonian credo.) since neither tendency has that much purchase in the imperial capital, it's a safe bet that at any given moment in washington, d.c., elites in both political parties will be trying to mobilize jacksonian or jeffersonian sentiment to achieve hamiltonian or wilsonian ends.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "yes, not everything trump has done fits mead's paradigm — but a great deal of what makes him different from previous presidents is plainly jacksonian. a hamiltonian wouldn't have saber-rattled so wildly against north korea; a wilsonian wouldn't be so subsequently eager for a deal with such an odious regime. a hamiltonian wouldn't be as eager for an extended trade war with china; a wilsonian would speak out more clearly against beijing's human rights abuses instead of just treating them as one more bargaining chip. trump's bureaucracy-impeded attempts to pull out of syria and afghanistan are patently jacksonian; likewise his disdain for his predecessor's negotiations on climate change. his eagerness to pardon war criminals and threaten war crimes, meanwhile, are jacksonianism at its worst.", "augmented": []}

(if you've already filed your taxes, watch for i.r.s. guidance.) unlike paychecks from an employer, taxes for unemployment aren't automatically withheld. recipients must opt in — and even when they do, federal taxes are withheld only at a flat rate of 10 percent of benefits. while the new tax break will provide a cushion, some people could still owe the i.r.s. or certain states money. read more. i worked from home this year. can i take the home office deduction? probably not, unless you're self-employed, an independent contractor or a gig worker.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "all sorts of things can cause the traffic to stop: an accident, a scene at the side of the road. it's often surprising how minor these dramas are, compared to the size and extent of their consequences. their power is cumulative; it arises from the number of people exposed to the incident, however trivial. i once talked to a man who specialized in patterns of traffic flow, and he showed me a set of diagrams illustrating how the merest distraction in one place, something so small that it would cause passers-by to briefly glance at it and therefore unconsciously decrease their speed, could over time result in the whole motorway coming to a standstill in another place miles away.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "so the one thing i agree with you about, ross. i guess part of it is a place of concern, that people think that they're going to be vaccinated, and yet the pandemic is still raging and they don't know if they can really spread it. but i actually think that the messaging to people in general should be, that you can foresee the end of this. not that this is your life forever.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "right. no, this is what i have in mind, right? that if we get to summer and a big share of the population is vaccinated and caseloads have dropped away to basically nothing, summer camp should not require masks for kids. things like that. and maybe they just will, and i'm too deep in the twitter bubble or blue state bubble. but that's what i'm hoping for. i want people to accept normalcy if, god willing, it returns. all right, so that's a dose of semi-optimism. and then to close us out, michelle, do you have a recommendation for listeners in the new year?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "yes. so i am going to recommend — it's not new, but it was new to me — the netflix series a series of unfortunate events, which is the first series that my kids and i have ever both enjoyed about equally. that i've been able to watch with my kids and say, don't watch it without me because i want to see the next episode. obviously, it's based on the book by lemony snicket, which, incidentally, i recently found out that lemony snicket is really daniel handler who played the accordion on 69 love songs by the magnetic fields. probably three of my favorite albums in the entire history of the world. i should have known that a long time ago. but that said, the series is — it's very arch and stylized. it sort of seems like a little bit wes anderson-y. it has a lot of these linguistic jokes. like, there's a running joke about the difference between literally and figuratively. it's pretty dark and macabre. and yet my kids, who are six and eight — five and seven when we started watching it — they absolutely loved it. i could use it to coerce all sorts of good behavior. like, we're not going to watch another episode until everybody is bathed and brushed their teeth. and it worked like a charm. i keep hoping that there's another series that we would all enjoy as much. i haven't been able to find anything.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "this book is a call to action for all who refuse to accept our demographic demise as inevitable. it is a demand for a new jewish state of mind capable of challenging the conventional wisdom that judaism is more adaptive to persecution and discrimination than it is to an open, free, and welcoming society--that jews paradoxically need enemies in order to survive, that anti-semitism is what has kept judaism alive. this age-old perspective on jewish survival is illustrated by two tragic stories involving respected rabbinical leaders.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the first story takes place in 1812, when napoleon was battling the czar for control of the pale of settlement (the western part of czarist russia), where millions of jews were forced to live in crowded poverty and under persecution and discrimination as second-class subjects. a victory for napoleon held the promise of prosperity, first-class citizenship, freedom of movement, and an end to discrimination and persecution. a victory for the czar would keep the jews impoverished and miserable. the great hasidic rabbi shneur zalman--the founder of the lubavitch dynasty--stood up in his synagogue on the first day of rosh hashanah to offer a prayer to god asking help for the leader whose victory would be good for the jews. everyone expected him to pray for napoleon. but he prayed for the czar to defeat napoleon. in explaining his counterintuitive choice, he said: should bonaparte win, the wealth of the jews will be increased and their [civic] position will be raised. at the same time their hearts will be estranged from our heavenly father. should however our czar alexander win, the jewish hearts will draw nearer to our heavenly father, though the poverty of israel may become greater and his position lower.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this remarkable story is all too typical of how so many jewish leaders throughout our history have reasoned about jewish survival. without tsuris--troubles--we will cease to be jewish. we need to be persecuted, impoverished, discriminated against, hated, and victimized in order for us to retain our jewishness. the chosen people must be denied choices if judaism is to survive. if jews are given freedom, opportunity, and choice, they will choose to assimilate and disappear.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the story recurs, with even more tragic consequences, on the eve of the holocaust. another great eastern european rabbi, elchanan wasserman--the dean of the rabbinical college in baranowitz, poland--was invited to bring his entire student body and faculty to yeshiva college in new york or to the beis medrish letorah in chicago, both distinguished orthodox rabbinical colleges. he declined the invitations because they are both places of spiritual danger, for they are run in a spirit of freethinking. the great rabbi reasoned, what would one gain to escape physical danger in order to then confront spiritual danger? rabbi wasserman, his family, his students, and their teachers remained in poland, where they were murdered by the nazis.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i call the approach taken by these rabbis the tsuris theory of jewish survival. under this theory, the jews need external troubles to stay jewish. nor has this fearful, negative perspective on jewish survival been limited to ultra-orthodox rabbis. many jewish leaders, both religious and secular, have argued that jews need enemies--that without anti-semitism, judaism cannot survive. theodor herzl, the founder of political zionism and a secular jew, believed that our enemies have made us one ... it is only pressure that forces us back to the parent stem. in a prediction that reflects an approach to the survival of judaism strikingly similar to that of the founder of the lubavitch hasidim, herzl warned that if our christian hosts were to leave us in peace ... for two generations, the jewish people would merge entirely into surrounding races. albert einstein agreed: it may be thanks to anti-semitism that we are able to preserve our existence as a race; that at any rate is my belief. jean-paul sartre, a non-jew, went even further, arguing that the sole tie that binds [the jewish people together] is the hostility and disdain of the societies which surround them. he believed that it is the anti-semite who makes the jew.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if the tsuris theory of jewish identity, survival, and unity is true, then jews are doomed to live precariously on a pendulum perennially swinging in a wide arc between the extremes of persecution and assimilation. as the pendulum swings away from the scylla of persecution, it inevitably moves toward the charybdis of assimilation. in this reactive view, jews have little power over their ultimate destiny. our enemies always call the shots, either by persecuting us, in which case we fight back and remain jewish, or by leaving us alone, in which case we assimilate. the only other alternative--the one proposed by herzl--is for all jews to move to israel, where they control their own destiny. but most jews will continue to ignore that option, certainly if our hosts continue to leave us in peace in our adopted homelands. in this respect, aliyah (emigration) to israel has also been largely determined by our external enemies, since most jews who have moved to the jewish homeland have done so in reaction to anti-semitism and persecution in their native countries.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "historically, therefore, there has been some descriptive truth to this pendulum view of persecution alternating with assimilation. jews have retained their jewish identity, at least in part, because of tsuris. our enemies herded us into ghettos, created pales of settlement, discriminated against us, excluded us from certain livelihoods while pressing us into others. we stuck together and remained jews, resisting as best we could the persecution by our enemies.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but there is more--much more--to jewish identity than collective self-defense. there is something important that is worth defending. after all, until anti-semitism changed from religious bigotry to racial bigotry--roughly near the end of the nineteenth century--persecuted jews generally had the option of conversion. unlike hitler, our religiously inspired persecutors--the crusaders, the inquisitors, martin luther, and the pogromists--did distinguish between jews who converted to christianity and jews who did not. indeed, it was precisely their religious mission to convert the jews, by whatever methods it took.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "many jews did convert--some at knifepoint, others to advance themselves. the story about professor daniel chwolson illustrates the latter phenomenon. chwolson, a russian intellectual of the nineteenth century, had converted from judaism to russian orthodoxy as a young man, but he continued to fight against anti-semitism. this led a jewish friend to ask him why he had converted: out of conviction, the great man said. what conviction? his jewish friend inquired. chwolson responded: out of a firm conviction that it would be far better to be a professor in st. petersburg than a hebrew school teacher in shklop. yet despite the material advantages of conversion, most jews resisted it. clearly, those jews--who sacrificed so much--remained jewish not only in reaction to their enemies. more than our fabled stiff-neckedness was involved. there are substantive principles that jews have been so stubborn about--that we have been willing to fight and even die for. for jews who define their jewishness in theological terms, it is easy to find that principle: it is god's will. for the large number of jews who are skeptical about being god's chosen people, the principle is more elusive, but it is palpable to most of us, though difficult to articulate. it is a disturbing reality, however, that for a great many jews, their jewish identity has been forged and nurtured by our external enemies who have defined us as victims of their persecution.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, after two millennia of persecution and victimization, we may well be moving into a new era of jewish life during which we will not be persecuted or victimized. if this comes to pass, we will need to refocus our attention on defining the positive qualities of jewish life that ought to make us want to remain jews without help from our enemies. we must become positively jewish instead of merely reacting to our enemies.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if herzl's and sartre's entirely negative view of the reason for jewish survival were to persist even as we enter this new era of equality and acceptance, then judaism would not deserve to endure. if jewish life cannot thrive in an open environment of opportunity, choice, freethinking, affluence, success, and first-class status--if we really do need tsuris, czars, pogroms, poverty, insularity, closed minds, and anti-semitism to keep us jewish--then jewish life as we know it will not, and should not, survive the first half of the twenty-first century. we have been persecuted long enough. the time has come to welcome the end of our victimization without fear that it will mean the end of our existence as a people. we must no longer pray for the czar's victory out of fear that the end of our collective tsuris and the success of individual jews will mean the failure of judaism.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i believe that jewish life can thrive in the next century, not despite the end of institutional anti-semitism, the end of jewish persecution, and the end of jewish victimization, but because of these positive developments. the ultimate good news may be that the denouement of negative judaism--jewish identification based largely on circling the wagons to fend off our enemies--compels us to refocus on a more positive and enduring jewish identification, which will be more suitable to our current situation and the one we will likely be facing in the twenty-first century, when jews will have the unconstrained choice whether to remain jewish or to assimilate. we may be entering a true jewish golden age, during which we will prove, once and for all, that jews do not need enemies to survive. to the contrary: we can thrive best in an open society where we freely choose to be jews because of the positive virtues of our 3,500-year-old civilization.", "augmented": []}

(kaddish is the prayer for the dead.) but reports of the death of judaism may be premature--if we can change the way we think, and act, about jewish survival. if we refuse to change, if we accept the current demographic trends as intractable, then jewish life in america may indeed be doomed.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "in chapters 5, 6, and 7, i explore the most frequently proposed solutions to the problem of assimilation. to those who are sure that return to religion is judaism's only salvation, i say, get as many to return as you can. maybe you are right. but we cannot rely exclusively on your solution, because maybe you are wrong. maybe not enough jews will become religious. maybe religion--at least as currently defined and practiced--is not the wave of the future for most young intellectuals. maybe there is a strand of judaism that can survive and thrive without exclusive dependence on theology and ritual. after all, the yiddish secularism that flourished between the beginning of the jewish enlightenment (haskalah) and the second world war was an authentic jewish culture, which was destroyed by external forces. political zionism, which grew largely out of that culture, remains an authentic jewish civilization of enormous importance to the survival of judaism. today's influential american jewish community is largely secular.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "to those who look to israel as judaism's sole salvation, i say, keep trying to get jews from throughout the diaspora to make aliyah. maybe you are right. but we cannot count on zionism and aliyah alone, because maybe you are wrong. maybe most jews will want to remain where they and their families have established a comfortable home. maybe they will not come to israel. maybe israel will not endure forever as a jewish state. maybe it will normalize--as theodor herzl put it--and become like most other states, which began as religious but became secular and multicultural over time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "to those who believe that an emphasis on jewish ethics will be enough to transmit the essence of judaism to our children, i say, maybe you are right. certainly many jews, especially secular jews, agree with you and hope you are right. but beyond broad generalities, it is difficult to distill from the highly diverse jewish sources a few programmatic essences that are easily transmittable from generation to generation, without living the kind of jewish lives that our grandparents lived.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "to those who say that jewish fund-raising, charity, and defense organizations are the answer, i say, work on, raise money, build buildings, elect officers, bestow honors, monitor anti-semitism, support israel. but do not count on it to ensure the jewish future, because maybe the next generation will not be as attracted to these institutions as the post-holocaust generation was.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "to those who say that jewish education is the key to jewish survival, i say, you are undoubtedly right. whatever the essence or essences of judaism may be, they are in large part, at least, to be discovered and rediscovered in our books, in our history, and in our approach to learning. but we cannot count on all jews, so many of whom are busy with their successful careers, to become jewishly educated, especially since jewish education today is controlled almost entirely by the religious component of jewish life and has been one of the great failures of the american jewish community.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in the final chapter, i propose a series of steps that i believe we must take in order to safeguard the jewish future. we must change the nature of american jewish life in fundamental ways if we are to survive the new threats to our continuity as a people. these changes must make us more adaptive to the reality that we can no longer define ourselves--and our children--by reference to our past victimization and persecution. we must adopt a new, more positive, jewish identity based on a 3,500-year-old tradition of education, scholarship, learning, creativity, justice, and compassion. but first we must figure out a way to make this diverse library of jewish knowledge accessible and useful to generations of jews who are abysmally ignorant of their remarkable tradition. the famed yiddisher cup (khop)---jewish head--is only half full: the typical jewish college graduate is extraordinarily well educated about general subjects, but goes through life with a kindergarten understanding of judaism. we must begin to fill the yiddisher cup with the kind of useful jewish knowledge that will assure both our success and our survival. to do this, we will have to loosen the monopolistic hold that rabbis now have over jewish education, so that we can begin to compete effectively in the marketplace of ideas for the minds and hearts of our jewish youth.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "unless we begin to make use of our competitive advantage--as teachers, communicators, scholars, advocates, and strategists--we will lose our children and grandchildren to the seductive drift toward assimilation and away from jewishness. the fundamental changes we must make will require a reordering of our priorities away from an almost exclusive focus on defending jews against external enemies and toward new ways of defending ourselves and our children against self-destruction through assimilation. we will have to educate our children differently, allocate our charitable giving differently, select our leaders differently--even define our very jewishness differently. jewish life will have to become less tribal, more open, more accepting of outsiders, and less defensive.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "when i describe some of the multiple roads we must take if we are to maximize our chances for survival, i think of a variation of the old story of the rabbinical judge who, after hearing a wife's complaints about her husband, says, my daughter, you are right, and, after hearing the husband's complaints, says, my son, you are right. when his student observes, rabbi, they can't both be right, he replies, my son, you are right. under my variation, the rabbi responds to his student, no, you are wrong. they can both be right. to the differing and sometimes inconsistent approaches to jewish survival, i would say, you may all be right. don't you dare tell each other that you are wrong. nobody has a monopoly on the truth about the jewish future. everything that may work must be tried.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "but one of the things you did was unscripted television local language productions and, again, basically non-english shows. you also had your — probably one of your first more deep experiences with data, and so the idea of netflix decides what we're all going to watch. was that something you thought about it? would the whole world watch, say, indian matchmaking, another show you're responsible for, if it wasn't served to us at the top of the app? could you contrast algorithms and creativity because you had come from the creative background here at a company where algorithms are very important?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so when i came into the company, so it was interesting. so unscripted, we had to launch the unscripted group. we know there's tons of audience all over the world for many different kinds of unscripted shows. we hadn't had unscripted shows. so there was no data. there was no algorithm. there was no data to say this kind of show will work. but we just knew from, if you look at the audience and where interests are, that we were just going to take bets. and those are all gut, and intuition, and working with very experienced unscripted people in making shows. i'd say i think when i came in, it was interesting to see the amount of data and just the sophistication of it. and globally who was watching how many things in each country was interesting. but commissioning television shows, unscripted or scripted, is all about gut and intuition. it has to be a human — it's a human call because a writer walks in. they pitch a show. and it has to be whether you think you believe in the vision of the show, because there's not any data or algorithm that would have ever suggested or proven out that a limited series about a female chess prodigy would ever be —", "augmented": []}
{"original": "yes, queen's gambit — that would ever capture the hearts, minds, and viewing hours as it did. so it's a good tool when we license. it's a good tool to have data, algorithm for personalization on the shows you see. great. commissioning television shows has to be about human judgment.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "all right, talk about queen's gambit since you brought it up. so that was, from what i understand, a movie. scott frank thought it was going to be a movie. and then the decision was to cut it up into a limited series, essentially. why did that strike you since you were responsible? what was it about that?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it was a great book. and there were themes in there. people root for underdogs. people do like and are fascinated by genius, the idea of watching somebody genius at something. so there were themes in there that seemed like, ok, those could really resonate, that — because in a way, you would probably think, which would make sense, initially that chess would be narrow or limiting in some way as far as an audience. but her journey — and it was based on the books, so the material was there, and the book is a great book— really made sense to champion that. but even in that, on every kind of data, that's just not an obvious thing — this should be a big hit. and it just captured people. and she's extraordinary in it. and scott frank did such a beautiful job.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "so the advantage that disney definitely has, and even warner brothers, they've been at this for a long time — 100 years. they've been at it for a long time. they have i.p. they have catalog. they have those franchises. and for us, we've been in it for seven years and making original content. so now we have stranger things. and we have the witcher. and we're growing our own, hopefully, i.p., and franchises, and original content. and so we're going to continue to do that around the world. money heist, la casa de papel definitely franchise for the company and growing what that is. so i think for us, it's to continue to do that. and again, creators have great experience. and then you hope you get their repeat business. they come back to work with you again. and i think for all of us, it really — you have to win, just like you're saying about what you watch, the consumer every day. next year, i hope we still have more shows that you like than somebody else has. and i do think ultimately competition is good for consumers because i do think it keeps all of us trying to make the best shows, pushing forward, taking risks on content still. so i do think net net, it's great to have competition.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "and she can just do this, hold the articles of impeachment back from the senate pretty much indefinitely?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "yes. there is no rule that says that the house, once it has voted to impeach a president, has to send over the articles of impeachment. she could just sit on them. but there is a big risk to that. the house has just taken what it has characterized as urgent and historic vote to impeach the president. and for a lot of democratic members, particularly the ones in trump-friendly districts, it was a pretty hard vote. it was a pretty politically difficult thing to do. and so having just taken this very high-profile and politically risky vote to do what they said they thought was right, if they then don't follow through with the process, it looks pretty bad.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "well, that is the million-dollar question that everyone immediately began speculating on as soon as he came out with the statement. and there's a few theories. democrats' favorite theory is, ironically enough, that this person who they have detested as a super-hawk and a loyalist to trump might actually be the hero who has really damaging things to say about the president, who will be the one who had direct conversations with him in a way that could tie president trump to what he is accused of in the impeachment articles. because remember, during the impeachment inquiry, they were not able to get access to any of the people who had direct conversations with the president about linking aid to investigations or any of the other key accusations that they were making. so bolton could do that. there is another possibility too, which is that he, having been a part of the national security council at the white house, is very keen to make it clear that he did not agree with some of these decisions that the president was making, particularly with regard to withholding military aid from ukraine. and since we already know from our colleagues' own reporting that he actually had meetings with the president trying to talk him out of freezing military aid to ukraine, he wants to essentially flesh out that picture, that the president was going in one direction and he couldn't stop it.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "well, i think it really sort of proved out her thesis, which was there was no downside in waiting. because as it turns out, the pressure has mounted. now, instead of sort of a theoretical discussion about what if we wanted to call witnesses, senators are faced with the prospect of an actual human being who a lot of people want to hear from as a witness actually coming forward and saying yes, i will appear if subpoenaed. so it is a more concrete thing that they're facing. and that makes the negotiation that still has to happen, between chuck schumer and mitch mcconnell about the terms of this trial, a lot more complicated.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "and the democrats are where they were, which is protesting and complaining and saying they don't want to go forward with a trial until they are assured of at least the possibility that they are going to get to call witnesses and possibly ask for new documents as well, as part of this process. but it's also put the moderate republicans and some of the folks who were up for re-election under intensified pressure. because while they are willing to go along, it seems for now, with starting a trial without committing to witnesses, it's not at all clear what they're going to do when they're faced with the actual question, which they will be at some point, of should we subpoena john bolton or not? should we issue subpoenas for other people or shouldn't we? and that's a question that will really affect what kind of a trial president trump has in the senate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so you're saying that even if the republicans come up with rules for a senate trial that does not commit them to having new witnesses, that it's still somehow possible that someone like john bolton might get called in the middle of this trial?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "right. so how it would work from here on out is that at some point, nancy pelosi would send the articles of impeachment over to the senate. the trial would begin. each side would give its opening statements. and then at any time, a democratic senator or one of the democratic impeachment managers from the house could move to call a witness. and that would lead to a vote. and that is a vote that could put a lot of moderate republicans or, rather, the few moderate republicans there are in the senate in a really tight spot.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and who are those moderate senators? and how many of them are required to vote to have someone like john bolton end up testifying?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "well, this is a tricky question. it would take four republicans to side with the democrats, who control 47 votes, in order to make the majority that would be necessary to do something like this. and that's because normally, in the senate, you have the vice president, who breaks ties. but in an impeachment setting, the chief justice of the supreme court presides over a senate trial.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "so for now, it seems like this strategy is working?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "well, at the moment, it's looking like it panned out pretty well. it might produce some new revelations in a trial that we never really expected to produce much in the way of new revelations. this has been a very predictable process from start to finish. in the house, everyone knew that the house was going to vote on the articles of impeachment, and then the senate was going to quickly move to acquit president trump with no muss, no fuss. and now it looks like, well, the acquittal is not really in doubt. but the path that gets you there is a lot more windy and a lot more uncertain. and that is a place that did not look likely, even a couple of weeks ago. so, you could say that this has paid off for the democrats, because it's at least opened the door to a bit more of a thorough process than they thought they were going to get. but the longer you wait to start a trial, the less control you have over the events surrounding what else is going to be going on in the world when the impeachment trial unfolds. and that was really demonstrated last week when another issue that has nothing to do with impeachment began to overshadow all of this. and that was the strike that president trump took against qassim suleimani, the iranian general in iraq. and that has totally rejiggered the conversation, reordered the priorities for the moment on capitol hill.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "he's filling up a tanker with water. he's got a hose and a pump, and he's desperately trying to ward off these flames, which are meters high.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "jason then i heard a helicopter, and he's just hovering around, hovering around, and then he just stayed around. and i was like, hmm, that's good. and then all of a sudden, i heard another helicopter. it was another small one. and then they both were hovering around. and then yeah, the big one turned up, and —", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it's a water bomber, an aircraft that can drop massive amounts of water. and one of these water bombers soaks her property and saves it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "livia albeck-ripka so you're the hero that defended the property. how does it feel? jason oh, it was good. good that it's still standing, you know, that it's still here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wow. so she got incredibly lucky.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "right. but even now, they're not completely in the clear.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "livia, you're describing a series of good samaritans who have risked a lot to save these animals, but the problem, i have to imagine, is far greater than any number of good samaritans could possibly solve.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "right. i mean, these people are battling these immense changes to australia's landscape on a tiny, tiny scale. and they can't save australia's wildlife on their own, but it is mainly volunteers who are battling these blazes and their impacts. and that touches on a deep frustration throughout the country that i've seen in my reporting, that it's falling on people like jason, like susie, to protect australia in this disaster, and that the government of australia isn't doing enough.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "yeah, i think for those people who are experiencing these impacts firsthand, and for those who are watching them play out online, on their tvs around australia, this is one of the first times we're really experiencing as a country what climate change feels and looks like, just how apocalyptic it can be, and just how much our ecosystems can be devastated. and so for these people, they're really hoping that this is a moment where the government is finally going to act and change its policies around this issue.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "well, she started weighing her options. she starts meeting with a variety of lawyers. and as she tells it, many of those lawyers are actually discouraging her from participating in the criminal case, telling her that she would be much better off just seeking to strike an out-of-court — like, basically a private out-of-court civil settlement with weinstein in which she would receive money.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lucia evans i met with lawyers who said, forget the criminal case. just file a civil suit, you know what i mean? and that didn't feel right to me. and i didn't even know what that would entail at the time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and why are the lawyers telling her that the civil route is better than this criminal prosecution?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "they basically tell her that it's going to play out the way that she's seen it depicted on all those tv shows.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and that means it's going to be really ugly.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "yeah, it's going to be really ugly.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lucia evans the narratives i heard the most often were, it's going to be a long, drawn-out, painful process. they're going to tear apart your background, your life. they're going to talk to everyone you've ever worked with, everyone you've ever been in a relationship with, find anything they can to discredit you. and it's hard on you. it's hard on your family. they'll go through your trash and find every single thing you've ever done in the past, and blow it up out of proportion, and shame you, and just ruin your life, basically. i just had this vision of myself just being left with nothing on the street. that's the narrative that i think still exists, but also that i was hearing at the time. it's really scary to hear over and over, and it starts to kind of become part of you. and you start to think, oh, this is what will happen if i do this, you know? how can you not feel like that?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so she's put off by these lawyers. and as she tells it, they're not the only people who are counseling her against participating in the criminal case. she says that she has friends and family members who are saying the same thing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lucia evans the narrative that i heard a lot was, you've already done enough — and in a good way, not a negative way at all. but you've already done so much. look at — the movement was starting to pick up steam at that point. like, look at what you helped to reignite?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you did your part. you participated in the journalism, some of these first stories that are helping to ignite the #metoo movement. you've done enough. but as lucia tells it, something keeps pulling at her.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lucia evans the criminal case was really kind of calling my name in a way right from the beginning, and i wanted to understand what that would be like. and i just wanted to be able to have the option to pursue it without having a lawyer say, it's not right for you. don't do it. megan twohey and when you say that the criminal case was calling to you from the beginning, what do you mean? lucia evans i wanted this to continue to mean something to me and to mean something for other people. and it always kind of felt right to me deep down. and even though i struggled with it for so many months, and it was so hard to decide what to do, i just felt like it was the right thing to do, ultimately.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so she decides to meet with the prosecutor's office, which is a significant step, because the prosecutors are ultimately the ones who will decide whether or not to bring charges. and the lead prosecutor on the weinstein case at the time was a woman named maxine rosenthal. and as lucia tells it, she did not have a good experience with her.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lucia evans i didn't feel comfortable talking to her, and i didn't have a lot of confidence in it. megan twohey what do you mean by that? what was — lucia evans i just remember there was one thing that she said that made me very uncomfortable. she referred to me and the other survivors as harvey's girls. and at that point, i think i was just so blown away by that statement and just horrified that she could ever say that about — it doesn't even need an explanation about why that's so horrifying to say.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so listen, i can't speak to this particular prosecutor's conduct. what i can tell you is that she's a veteran sex crimes prosecutor who's known for being very hard-nosed and that lucia wasn't the only person who was complaining about her. there were complaints coming from the police, from victims' rights advocates that she was not sensitive and that she was moving too slowly. i can't speak to whether or not those complaints were valid, but rosenthal's boss is cy vance, the manhattan prosecutor, the same one who had been criticized for not prosecuting weinstein in 2015. and he decides that he's going to take rosenthal off the case. and he puts in her place a veteran homicide prosecutor. her name is joan illuzzi, and she's also known for being tough.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lucia evans joan would ask me tough questions, but i still felt good about it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but lucia says that she feels like she's on her side, that she's being tough to toughen her up.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lucia evans she was definitely the bad cop, and i think she had to be, because she wanted to prepare me, right? but i felt like she respected me in a way that i didn't feel like i felt from maxine. and i knew what she was doing. i was like, well, i want to be prepared for this trial. so if you think you have to be tough on me, that's totally fine.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so that's important for lucia. and in another significant development, a new woman, a new accuser, is added to the criminal case.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lucia evans another thing that made me feel comfortable was the fact that there would be one other person who was involved. and that made me feel a lot more comfortable. initially, it was just me for a long time. it just gave me a little more sense of community and just like i wasn't doing it alone.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and so finally, at this point, lucia is ready to make a decision.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lucia evans i went back home to d.c. and a while earlier, i made this list of all the reasons why i should do it and all the reasons why i shouldn't do it. and all the reasons why i shouldn't do it — i mean, there were so many reasons — fear for my safety, fear for my family, my reputation, my career — everything. all these things would just be ruined. and then on the other side, i had just written, because it feels right. i didn't really have much else to write on that side. it did feel like i could, at the very least, hopefully, put him in jail, this person that had assaulted so many people and harassed so many people. and i couldn't say no to the chance to do that, ultimately. this is the right thing to do. i'm going to do it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "she's in. she's willing to be part of criminal charges.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "in may of 2018, seven months after the police had first shown up on the door of lucia's home, prosecutors bring charges here in new york against harvey weinstein. they charge him with a criminal sex act stemming from the encounter with lucia. and they also charge him with rape stemming from the encounter with the second woman in the criminal case.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we'll be right back. so megan, what happens after these charges against weinstein are actually filed?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "law enforcement officials continue to build out this case, as they start to prepare to go to court. and lucia says that she is, for the most part, feeling good about the process. but even with this new prosecutor in place, she says that she's confused about some aspects of what's going on.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lucia evans they didn't ask me for a full list of people i had told until months and months in. i would think that you kind of start with, who have you talked to? who knows about this? and i told them some people that either i had told, or knew of me going to the meeting with him, or something to that respect.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "she says that she is confused by the fact that law enforcement officials are not reaching out to more of the potential witnesses for her charge — she says that she had provided them with a list of names, people in whom she had confided about the alleged attack — and that, even at this stage of the investigation, that they have not reached out to all of those people to talk to them. this is also a case that involves both prosecutors and the police. and she says that she's struck by the fact that they don't seem to be in sync.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lucia evans so it seemed to be a very disjointed process with the d.a. and the n.y.p.d. and they didn't seem to communicate very well right from the beginning and all the way through my time with them. so — megan twohey what do you mean by that, that the police and the prosecutors weren't communicating — lucia evans yeah — megan twohey — effectively? lucia evans it just seemed like some things i had told to the police, the prosecutors weren't aware of or didn't remember when they would talk to me. they didn't even interview my husband until — they never did, actually. they never talked to my husband.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "megan, what's the significance of them not talking to her husband, exactly?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "well, i mean, think about it. if you are trying to build a case, if you're trying to shore it up, presumably, you're going to want to talk to the people closest to that alleged victim, the people who have the most knowledge about her. so for law enforcement officials to have not talked to her husband at this point seems a little weird to her. but she says that she's not giving it that much thought. and then, one day in october 2018, lucia is on a work trip in hong kong when she gets a call from her lawyer.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lucia evans i was about to give a huge marketing presentation to a group of executives, and then i get a call from my lawyer saying that they were going to drop my charge.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the prosecutor's office contacted her attorney and said that there was new information that had come to light, and that they were preparing to drop her charge.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "yeah. and she says that she can't even process it right at that point, because she's got to give that work presentation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lucia evans i just had to shut off my emotions and just try to just pull myself together right after that, and pretend that it didn't happen. i told my family, and then i got on a flight back home with no wi-fi, thank goodness, and fell asleep. and when i woke up, i was being destroyed in the press. archived recording 1 we begin with one of the sex assault charges against disgraced movie mogul harvey weinstein, tonight, dropped. archived recording 2 lucia evans claims weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him in 2004. but new information revealed yesterday casts doubt on evans's story. archived recording 3 the single charge was dropped after the manhattan district attorney's office recently discovered new evidence from a witness that discounts lucia evans's previous accusations —", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and so as lucia is learning about her charge being dropped, so, too, is the public. and in a lot of those news stories, it's presented as contradictory evidence that's come to light, evidence that undermines her allegation. not surprisingly, weinstein and his defense team seize on this new twist.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "archived recording his attorney, benjamin brafman, says he believes evans lied about what happened. archived recording (benjamin brafman) lucia evans, who you will see from the documents released, has clearly, in our opinion, committed perjury on several occasions.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "archived recording (benjamin brafman) the case is not over, but i think it is permanently and irreparably damaged.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so her story seems to be falling apart.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "megan twohey how did that affect you? did you have to have conversations with your friends and family, and anybody that you work with? lucia evans yeah. megan twohey was this something that you had to talk about or address? lucia evans i mean, it was interesting, because before this happened, i had been meeting with lots of actresses who — i became a very popular figure for a month in there in the summer, because i was kind of representing all of hollywood that wanted to send him to jail, but they were too afraid to do it themselves — some of them. i'm not speaking for all of them. but the actresses i spoke to all had very credible potential charges. but they had families and careers, and they couldn't do it. so i was kind of doing it for them. after my case is dropped, my friend group and that group whittled down to very few people who actually cared and wanted to know the truth and reached out to me. some of them didn't know me personally, so i don't blame them for not reaching out. but some very clearly kind of severed ties with me, which was really hard and really hurtful. and i don't care if an actress comes into my life, and then she leaves again. i never fooled myself into thinking i was close with these women, these famous actresses, necessarily.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but the ones — the women that have been with me since the beginning — that was really, that was really tough.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "megan, what happened here, exactly? what happened to this case? because you've been describing law enforcement officials who, from day one, have been telling lucia she's their best chance at bringing criminal charges against harvey weinstein. she finally signs on. she risks all that that entails. and then they handle it in this confusing way, and then they drop it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "well, what we now know is that prosecutors have spoken to a friend of lucia's, actually the friend who was with her the very first time she met weinstein. lucia said that when she went to that work meeting at harvey weinstein's office after meeting him, that he sexually assaulted her, that he forced her to perform oral sex on him against her will. and this friend says that after that work meeting, lucia told her that she had actually consented to perform oral sex on him, that she did that in exchange for the promise of acting jobs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wow. so a very different version of the story.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "right, this friend is providing an account of an encounter with weinstein that, if true, turns it back into a variation of one of the common stories about weinstein, but one that cannot be subject to criminal charges.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "why is this only now coming to light?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "well, one possibility is that this is an example of what can happen when there is a rush to prosecute. well, we also now realize what we now know is that the lead detective in the case had apparently talked to this witness months before weinstein was charged, and that she had shared this information with him. and prosecutors say that that detective did not share that information with them, the prosecutors.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "suggesting maybe he didn't want to bring them information that might hurt the case.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "suggesting that he purposely withheld potentially complicating information from the case. now, the detective says that he did tell the prosecutors this information. so that could also speak to what lucia had complained about herself, that this entire investigation seemed to be plagued by the fact that the police and prosecutors were not in sync and communicating well with each other.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mm-hmm. but if the detective had told prosecutors, it seems like that would only be further evidence of this desire to get this done, to bring these charges and overlook complicating information.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "right, so that is another interpretation of this, that both the police and the prosecutors were aware of this complicating information and moved forward with bringing charges anyway.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "well, in that case, what would explain them dropping this case when they did?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "well, with all of the finger-pointing that's gone on, it's hard to know, for certain, the answer to that question. but what seems likely is that prosecutors have realized, at this point, that this information is going to come to the attention of the defense and that it's likely to undermine the entire criminal charge. but i should say that lucia insists that she never consented to oral sex with weinstein, that she never told this friend otherwise, and that she explained that to the detective when he asked her about it months and months before.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "megan, what should we make of lucia's experience?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "for all the people who have been watching so many women come forward with allegations against harvey weinstein, watching what seems to be this overwhelming evidence of a pattern of predatory behavior, it shows how difficult it is to turn stories into criminal charges. her account fell within the statute of limitations, it was alleging criminal conduct, and she was willing to participate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "right, to brave the spotlight and the scrutiny.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "exactly. and still, her charge was dropped.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so this is october of 2018. where does that leave the case against harvey weinstein?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so in the lead-up to lucia's charge being dropped, there was actually a third woman who was added to the criminal case here in new york. so after lucia's charges dropped, there are still two women. but one of those women, one of those accusers, appears to also come with some potential complicating factors.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "megan twohey do you wish that you were still part of this case as we head into trial? lucia evans honestly, yes, i do. i do wish i was. i put so much into this. and when it comes down to it, i do wish i was a part of it. and i also just don't want people to be discouraged from coming forward and doing it. so i would just hope people don't — people, despite all the things i've said about how hard it is, still decide to come forward, because that's literally the only hope that we have.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "mr. bosworth, who is seen by some inside facebook as a proxy of sorts for mr. zuckerberg, also weighed in on a variety of issues that have vexed facebook for the past few years, including data privacy scandals, russian interference, political polarization and the debate over whether facebook is healthy for society.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "here is the full post as written:", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the election of donald trump immediately put a spotlight on facebook. while the intensity and focus of that spotlight may be unfair i believe it isn't unjust. scrutiny is warranted given our position in society as the most prominent of a new medium. i think most of the criticisms that have come to light have been valid and represent real areas for us to serve our community better. i don't enjoy having our flaws exposed, but i consider it far better than the alternative where we remain ignorant of our shortcomings.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one trap i sometimes see people falling into is to dismiss all feedback when they can invalidate one part of it. i see that with personal feedback and i see it happening with media coverage. the press often gets so many details wrong it can be hard to trust the veracity of their conclusions. dismissing the whole because of flaws in parts is a mistake. the media has limited information to work with (by our own design!) and they sometimes get it entirely wrong but there is almost always some critical issue that motivated them to write which we need to understand.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it is worth looking at the 2016 election which set this chain of events in motion. i was running our ads organization at the time of the election and had been for the four years prior (and for one year after). it is worth reminding everyone that russian interference was real but it was mostly not done through advertising. $100,000 in ads on facebook can be a powerful tool but it can't buy you an american election, especially when the candidates themselves are putting up several orders of magnitude more money on the same platform (not to mention other platforms).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "instead, the russians worked to exploit existing divisions in the american public for example by hosting black lives matter and blue lives matter protest events in the same city on the same day. the people who shows up to those events were real even if the event coordinator was not. likewise the groups of americans being fed partisan content was real even if those feeding them were not. the organic reach they managed sounds very big in absolute terms and unfortunately humans are bad at contextualizing big numbers. whatever reach they managed represents an infinitesimal fraction of the overall content people saw in the same period of time and certainly over the course of an election across all media.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so most of the information floating around that is widely believed isn't accurate. but who cares? it is certainly true that we should have been more mindful of the role both paid and organic content played in democracy and been more protective of it. on foreign interference, facebook has made material progress and while we may never be able to fully eliminate it i don't expect it to be a major issue for 2020.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "misinformation was also real and related but not the same as russian interference. the russians may have used misinformation alongside real partisan messaging in their campaigns, but the primary source of misinformation was economically motivated. people with no political interest whatsoever realized they could drive traffic to ad-laden websites by creating fake headlines and did so to make money. these might be more adequately described as hoaxes that play on confirmation bias or conspiracy theory. in my opinion this is another area where the criticism is merited. this is also an area where we have made dramatic progress and don't expect it to be a major issue for 2020.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it is worth noting, as it is relevant at the current moment, that misinformation from the candidates themselves was not considered a major shortcoming of political advertising on fb in 2016 even though our policy then was the same as it is now. these policies are often covered by the press in the context of a profit motive. that's one area i can confidently assure you the critics are wrong. having run our ads business for some time it just isn't a factor when we discuss the right thing to do. however, given that those conversations are private i think we can all agree the press can be forgiven for jumping to that conclusion. perhaps we could do a better job exposing the real cost of these mistakes to make it clear that revenue maximization would have called for a different strategy entirely.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cambridge analytica is one of the more acute cases i can think of where the details are almost all wrong but i think the scrutiny is broadly right. facebook very publicly launched our developer platform in 2012 in an environment primarily scrutinizing us for keeping data to ourselves. everyone who added an application got a prompt explaining what information it would have access to and at the time it included information from friends. this may sound crazy in a 2020 context but it received widespread praise at the time. however the only mechanism we had for keeping data secure once it was shared was legal threats which ultimately didn't amount to much for companies which had very little to lose. the platform didn't build the value we had hoped for our consumers and we shut this form of it down in 2014.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the company cambridge analytica started by running surveys on facebook to get information about people. it later pivoted to be an advertising company, part of our facebook marketing partner program, who other companies could hire to run their ads. their claim to fame was psychographic targeting. this was pure snake oil and we knew it; their ads performed no better than any other marketing partner (and in many cases performed worse). i personally regret letting them stay on the fmp program for that reason alone. however at the time we thought they were just another company trying to find an angle to promote themselves and assumed poor performance would eventually lose them their clients. we had no idea they were shopping an old facebook dataset that they were supposed to have deleted (and certified to us in writing that they had).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "when trump won, cambridge analytica tried to take credit so they were back on our radar but just for making [expletive] claims about their own importance. i was glad when the trump campaign manager brad parscale called them out for it. later on, we found out from journalists that they had never deleted the database and had instead made elaborate promises about its power for advertising. our comms team decided it would be best to get ahead of the journalists and pull them from the platform. this was a huge mistake. it was not only bad form (justifiably angering the journalists) but we were also fighting the wrong battle. we wanted to be clear this had not been a data breach (which, to be fair to us, it absolutely was not) but the real concern was the existence of the dataset no matter how it happened. we also sent the journalists legal letters advising them not to use the term breech which was received normally by the nyt (who agreed) and aggressively by the guardian (who forged ahead with the wrong terminology, furious about the letter) in spite of it being a relatively common practice i am told.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in practical terms, cambridge analytica is a total non-event. they were snake oil salespeople. the tools they used didn't work, and the scale they used them at wasn't meaningful. every claim they have made about themselves is garbage. data of the kind they had isn't that valuable to being with and worse it degrades quickly, so much so as to be effectively useless in 12-18 months. in fact the united kingdom information commissioner's office (ico) seized all the equipment at cambridge analytica and found that there was zero data from any uk citizens! so surely, this is one where we can ignore the press, right? nope. the platform was such a poor move that the risks associated were bound to come to light. that we shut it down in 2014 and never paid the piper on how bad it was makes this scrutiny justified in my opinion, even if it is narrowly misguided.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so was facebook responsible for donald trump getting elected? i think the answer is yes, but not for the reasons anyone thinks. he didn't get elected because of russia or misinformation or cambridge analytica. he got elected because he ran the single best digital ad campaign i've ever seen from any advertiser. period.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "but parscale and trump just did unbelievable work. they weren't running misinformation or hoaxes. they weren't microtargeting or saying different things to different people. they just used the tools we had to show the right creative to each person. the use of custom audiences, video, ecommerce, and fresh creative remains the high water mark of digital ad campaigns in my opinion.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the philosopher john rawls reasoned that the only moral way to decide something is to remove yourself entirely from the specifics of any one person involved, behind a so called veil of ignorance. that is the tool that leads me to believe in liberal government programs like universal healthcare, expanding housing programs, and promoting civil rights. it is also the tool that prevents me from limiting the reach of publications who have earned their audience, as distasteful as their content may be to me and even to the moral philosophy i hold so dear.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "this conversation often raises the alarm around filter bubbles, but that is a myth that is easy to dispel. ask yourself how many newspapers and news programs people read/watched before the internet. if you guessed one and one on average you are right, and if you guessed those were ideologically aligned with them you are right again. the internet exposes them to far more content from other sources (26% more on facebook, according to our research). this is one that everyone just gets wrong.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the focus on filter bubbles causes people to miss the real disaster which is polarization. what happens when you see 26% more content from people you don't agree with? does it help you empathize with them as everyone has been suggesting? nope. it makes you dislike them even more. this is also easy to prove with a thought experiment: whatever your political leaning, think of a publication from the other side that you despise. when you read an article from that outlet, perhaps shared by an uncle or nephew, does it make you rethink your values? or does it make you retreat further into the conviction of your own correctness? if you answered the former, congratulations you are a better person than i am. every time i read something from breitbart i get 10% more liberal.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what does all of this say about the nature of the algorithmic rewards? everyone points to top 0.1% content as being acutely polarized but how steep are the curves? what does the top 1% or 5% look like? and what is the real reach across those curves when compared to other content? i think the call for algorithmic transparency can sometimes be overblown but being more transparent about this type of data would likely be healthy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what i expect people will find is that the algorithms are primarily exposing the desires of humanity itself, for better or worse. this is a sugar, salt, fat problem. the book of that name tells a story ostensibly about food but in reality about the limited effectiveness of corporate paternalism. a while ago kraft foods had a leader who tried to reduce the sugar they sold in the interest of consumer health. but customers wanted sugar. so instead he just ended up reducing kraft market share. health outcomes didn't improve. that ceo lost his job. the new ceo introduced quadruple stuffed oreos and the company returned to grace. giving people tools to make their own decisions is good but trying to force decisions upon them rarely works (for them or for you).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in these moments people like to suggest that our consumers don't really have free will. people compare social media to nicotine. i find that wildly offensive, not to me but to addicts. i have seen family members struggle with alcoholism and classmates struggle with opioids. i know there is a battle for the terminology of addiction but i side firmly with the neuroscientists. still, while facebook may not be nicotine i think it is probably like sugar. sugar is delicious and for most of us there is a special place for it in our lives. but like all things it benefits from moderation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "at the end of the day we are forced to ask what responsibility individuals have for themselves. set aside substances that directly alter our neurochemistry unnaturally. make costs and trade-offs as transparent as possible. but beyond that each of us must take responsibility for ourselves. if i want to eat sugar and die an early death that is a valid position. my grandfather took such a stance towards bacon and i admired him for it. and social media is likely much less fatal than bacon.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "to bring this uncharacteristically long and winding essay full circle, i wanted to start a discussion about what lessons people are taking away from the press coverage. my takeaway is that we were late on data security, misinformation, and foreign interference. we need to get ahead of polarization and algorithmic transparency. what are the other big topics people are seeing and where are we on those?", "augmented": []}
