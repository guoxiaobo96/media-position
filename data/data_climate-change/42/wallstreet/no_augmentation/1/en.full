The company will continue to analyze the results and expects to discuss them with the Food and Drug Administration, he said, noting the company's $114 million cash balance.

Now it's double its value of what I paid for it because it was such a great location and it was the right spot. I kind of knew it in the back of my head, but I haven't forgotten that lesson: sometimes if you don't know what to do, do nothing. Sit the market out a little. Unless you really need it to pay your mortgage, it will come back. It may not come back in the exact same time you want, but the market will come back, especially real estate. It was a dumb decision.

People who are taking a lot of meaning from the slope of the yield curve, I think, need to consider what it means to be in a different monetary policy framework — which is that Europe, Japan and the United States have a balance sheet that intentionally was suppressing long rates. So the signal value probably isn't quite the same, but it is a reason to your earlier question about why financial conditions haven't tightened more because the balance sheets are likely to only come down gradually over time. Now you could do it differently, and if you want to see the long end of the market go up quickly I can certainly imagine policies of central banks in some part of the world deciding to sell long-term securities would have the impact of pushing up the yield curve.

My own view is that we would be better off having a little more flexibility than having a specific inflation target. I would much rather have an inflation range – something more like 1.5%-3%. And that during times where interest rates were likely to be low because labor force growth was quite low and productivity was quite low, that would be a time that I would actually like a higher level of inflation so I would like to be higher in the range during that period. And during periods of very high productivity then we could be lower. And the reason for that is – and it is partly a financial stability concern – that the current framework where we have low productivity and low population growth and not much immigration, is an environment where we are going to hit the zero lower bound too frequently. And I do think that has significant consequences – both because monetary policy becomes less effective when we can't move short-term interest rates, and I also think that it changes investor and household behavior when you start having periods of prolonged interest rates that are very low and unchanged. So I would like to avoid those kind of outcomes occurring in future recessions and so I think it is a good time to be discussing what is the right framework to reduce that probability.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Shares of theater chain AMC Entertainment Holding Inc. AMC, +3.24% were down more than 2% in premarket trade on Wednesday after being downgraded to sector perform from outperform at RBC Capital Markets. RBC analysts wrote in a note that their tepid view of the 2018 box office and AMC's high leverage make for a challenging combination for the company. We'd likely get more bullish on AMC if the box office outlook (given its leverage) and, or there was traction on the international IPO, lead analyst Leo Kulp wrote. As was evidenced in 2017, AMC's leverage makes it very susceptible to changes in multiple. We estimate a one point EV/EBITDA multiple change has a 36% impact on the stock price. While this is a positive in an up year for the box office, the uncertainty around the 2018 box office makes us more conservative. Kulp expects that the 2018 box office will be flat compared with 2017, which was down slightly from the last two years. They said they see fewer big event films being released this year, and instead more non-sequel content, which could be a negative or a positive depending on how the shift in the box office is received. Shares of AMC have declined more than 59% in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% is up more than 21% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% is up nearly 28%."}
