i was raised in a world in which i believe that there has to be a belief that people can grow, change and learn — and know better, rhimes said. i mean, not if you've committed a crime. i feel like you need to go pay — do your time for your crime, but i do believe people have to be able to grow, change and learn from their mistakes. at a certain point, there has to be room for reconciliation.

to the extent you have capital losses this year or capital loss carryovers from earlier years, selling winners by year-end will not result in any tax hit. in particular, sheltering net short-term capital gains with capital losses is a tax-smart move because net short-terms gains will otherwise be taxed at your higher ordinary income rate of up to 37%, plus another 3.8% if the niit bites. ouch.

real estate becomes particularly compelling when framed against higher inflation. for example, the 10-year treasury tmubmusd10y, 1.696% currently yields about 2.5%. if inflation over the next decade averages more than that, those investing in the 10-year today will be guaranteed to lose money. to put that in context, consider that the consumer price index (cpi) over the last 12 months rose 2.1%; it won't take much of an uptick in inflation for a 10-year treasury purchased today to produce a negative real return.

first, while index funds and exchange traded funds now approach 30% of stock market assets, their turnover is so small compared to that of active investors that they account for less than 5% of trading, and trading is what sets prices. (it is worth pointing out that some etfs can see enormous turnover so the trading is shifting from individual names to etfs themselves.)

if your business pays nonemployee compensation aggregating to $600 or more to a single payee (payment recipient) in a calendar year, the business must file a form 1099-misc to report the payments. similarly, employers must report wages paid to employees on form w-2. previously, these forms were required to be filed with the irs and social security administration (ssa) by the last day of february or by march 31 if filed electronically. copies were required to be supplied to payees and employees by january 31 of the following year. recent legislation moved up the deadline for filing with the irs and ssa to jan. 31 of the following year. so the irs/ssa filing deadline for forms 1099-misc and w-2 that show payments made last year is jan. 31, 2017. this rapidly approaching due date applies whether you submit the forms on paper or electronically.
the traditional free dining promotion has some significant limitations. the promotion is only available for certain dates and hotels in may through august, and guests must stay at least four nights to qualify. and because travelers with free dining must also pay full price for their rooms and park hopper tickets, they could actually lose out on possibly better savings through getting a separate discount on their hotel room from disney, buying their park tickets through an authorized re-seller or staying at a non-disney hotel, said tom bricker, who owns disneytouristblog.com. you can do a number of things that can save you money, bricker said.

it is possible to financially benefit from that fame, but the returns are minimal for most people. lane estimates that former contestants can make about $2,000 to $3,000 for appearances at bars or other venues, and promoting products on personal social media accounts usually doesn't add up to a livable salary unless you've gained more than a million followers. it's not a way to make a living, it is more of a supplemental way to get something out of being on the show.

bear markets are nothing like bull markets. the buy-on-the-dip strategy that worked in a bull market does not work in bear markets. bull markets are slow-moving and methodical, and you may get many days in a row that are green. bear markets, however, are violent and volatile. you can short-sell almost every rally. rallies are short-lived while the declines last longer. in a bear market, nearly every buy-on-the-dip purchase turns red. in a bear market, there is absolutely no stock or individual portfolio that is impervious to the pain of being long.

rosengren: just having the data from the spring time roll off – we had the wireless prices changes, there were a couple other changes in prices that i think were tied to individual markets that really were not tied to overall inflation and so i think once we get to the spring time we're going to be seeing numbers much closer to 2%. in addition, we have pretty tight labor markets already, and if we continue to grow faster than potential, those labor markets are going to get even tighter. if we start seeing unemployment rates below 4%, that's a pretty tight labor market. you're already hearing lots of stories, i think, in some of the tight markets about the difficulty of getting labor and one way to respond to that is to offer higher wages to try to attract people either in the local market or from outside the local market. these things take time. they don't happen overnight. that's why there are long and variable lags in monetary policy. i do expect that over time it will have that impact. we'll see more wage pressures and we'll see with time more inflation.
capacity isn't just a question of homes for sales, but also units for rent. rents are already extremely unaffordable in some of the 20 cities. in spotsylvania county in northern virginia, for instance, the average worker would need to devote 75.5% of their wages to rent, according to figures from attom data solutions. but renters there won't necessarily be able to buy ahead of amazon's entrance to avoid rent hikes, as rents and home prices alike are rising faster than salaries.

the nature of this threat (nice place you got here, hate to see anything happen to it … or to you) won't be lost on anyone familiar with mobster movies. trump's take on the tough-guy cliché wasn't particularly coherent, but it met the trope's two basic requirements. it was both clear enough to be unmistakable, and vague enough to minimize his own exposure to criminal prosecution.

it is no secret that millions of americans have become disillusioned with our political process. they don't vote. they don't believe much of what comes out of washington. they don't think anyone is there representing their interests. in my view, one of the reasons for that deep disillusionment is the widespread understanding that our criminal justice system is broken and grossly unfair – and that we do not have equal justice under the law. the average american sees kids being arrested and sometimes even jailed for possessing marijuana or other minor crimes. but when it comes to wall street executives, some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in this country, whose illegal behavior caused pain and suffering for millions – somehow nothing happens to them. no police record. no jail time. no justice.

right now, about 64% of inmates in state and federal prison are academically qualified to take college courses, according to the report, but most don't have access to these programs and even if they do, they likely can't afford the tuition, dizerega said.in 2014, the latest year for which data is available, just 9% of incarcerated people received a certificate from a higher education institution while in prison.

timeshares and recreational vehicles often are pitched as a way to save on future vacations. anyone who has owned either knows that's not necessarily true. first-time rv buyers, for example, often underestimate the costs of maintaining, repairing and fueling their rigs. timeshare newbies can be gobsmacked by rising annual fees, the hassles of trading their units and the difficulty of shedding unwanted timeshares.
twitter's twtr, -1.79% loud and devoted user base was quick to bemoan that such a change — expected to be announced by the end of march — would spoil the brevity and speed of the real-time service. the character limit that forces users to pen snappy tweets could give way to the longer essays found on facebook fb, -0.06% , for example. it could transform twitter into more of a public blogging platform rather than one that is succinct and well-suited to quips and breaking news headlines.

the other is a naturally occurring illusion: the proximity of dow 20,000. the dow jones industrial average djia, -0.46% has been above 19,000 since november, and countless news stories have focused on its flirtation with the 20,000 barrier, which might be crossed by the time this commentary is published. whatever happens, dow 20,000 will still have a psychological impact on markets.

3) decline in mortality improvements since 2005. the decline could be attributed to the exhaustion of the positive effects of the cardiovascular drugs and technology. that is, once everyone at risk of heart disease is already taking a statin, further dissemination cannot increase the rate of mortality improvement. similarly, the gains from the decline in male smoking have mostly run their course, although the gains in the decline in female smoking continue. and the negative effects of obesity are hampering improvements in mortality.

it's also easy to think spending upfront will motivate you to hit the gym often and get your money's worth, says kevin volpp, director of the center for health incentives and behavioral economics at the university of pennsylvania. but he says it's common to get a few months into the contract and view the money that's been spent as a sunk cost, which is no longer very motivating. while you're deciding whether or not to schlep to the gym on a busy weekday in june, you probably won't be considering the money you dropped on a membership in january.

sometimes our illusions about money can be harnessed for good. the save more tomorrow program, created by economists richard h. thaler and shlomo benartzi, has people commit to increasing their retirement contributions starting one year in the future. in the economists' initial study, workers who agreed to save future dollars nearly quadrupled their savings rate in four years.
on the other hand, parents or others who would rather not be cosigners on accounts may view the discontinued practice as a good thing, schulz said; cosigners are taking the risk that the applicant they are cosigning for will pay his or her bill responsibly, as to not damage the co-signer's credit. eliminating the option of cosigners may take away that risk and responsibility.

communication also suffers. we once expressed ourselves using body language, scent, tone and inflection in our voices, but contemporary social networking limits us to abbreviations, cute pictures and 280 characters per post. this isn't how humans are meant to communicate effectively, and it's no wonder that social-media platforms have become a hotbed for division, conflict and mutual mistrust.
in divorce situations, one spouse or ex-spouse may become legally obligated to make payments to the other party. since these payments are often substantial, locking in tax deductions for the payer has often been a substantial issue. before the new tax cuts and jobs act (tcja), payments that met the tax-law definition of alimony could always be deducted by the payer for federal income tax purposes. and recipients of alimony payments always had to report the payments as taxable income.

though the chinese government made some critical misjudgments early on, one thing it did right was to warn the rest of the world that the virus was transmissible, airborne, and controllable only through drastic and immediate measures. the countries that ignored the warning have since suffered the most, both economically and in human terms. meanwhile, the countries that demonstrated social solidarity in controlling their outbreaks have been able to reopen their economies, though not necessarily their borders.
many commentators have attributed china's success to totalitarianism, but a country's system of government is not really the deciding factor. far more important is whether political leaders are willing to trade short-term economic pain and quotidian conveniences for the safety of their citizens. in new zealand and australia—both vibrant democracies—bold leadership and strong governance brought new infections down almost to zero, and political leaders like new zealand prime minister jacinda ardern were rewarded accordingly at the ballot box.

if you look at the chart above, you will notice that the bulk of the money is in government money market funds. those particular types of money market funds generally have much higher account minimums (from $100,000 to $1 million), suggesting the funds are not retail investors. (those would be the smaller balances of prime retail funds.)
the average fund fees for actively managed funds still dwarf those of index funds and etfs by about 400%, give or take. that means these fund firms are still raking in way more money in fees than their low-cost counterparts. you're going to have to pry that revenue from their cold, dead hands in most cases. my guess is we'll see a lot of captains in the fund world go down with their ship as many firms will die off or get bought out. but they'll still be earning a decent living in the meantime.
and if you're not investing in an employer-sponsored account (after all, only 14% of employers offer such plans, according to the u.s. census bureau) consider a roth ira, which more forgivingly allows investors to use those assets for an emergency should a situation arise. as opposed to other accounts, like a 401(k) plan, that place penalties on individuals who withdraw money from these accounts, investors can take money out of a roth ira penalty-free so long as they only take out the money they invested, and not the investment earnings of those assets. some 30 year olds, like packer, have numerous accounts. packer and his wife, for instance, have been maxing out their 401(k) plans and roth iras for a few years.

helping the youngest workers today understand the importance of securing their long-term financial well-being is an investment that will yield significant benefits. how soon and for how long an individual saves is important because of the power of compound interest. for example, compare a person saving $100 a month starting at age 27 with a person saving the same amount starting at age 37. the first will have contributed just one-third more by age 67, but would accumulate twice as much in savings, assuming a 6% annual rate of return.

to a lesser extent, investors will also be watching the bottom line. profits have never been the top priority as amazon spends aggressively on growth, but it's noteworthy that the highly profitable amazon web services division is what previously drove real earnings for shares. however, after leveling off overall spending in 2016 it was off to the races again in 2017 thanks to both the acquisition of whole foods, a big investment in a kentucky cargo hub and other efforts.

january is a natural time to take stock of your financial life, and to dream big dreams about 2018. could this be the year you make the leap to homeownership? or will you make a big change and trade in your mortgage payment for a landlord? while the housing market has slowly recovered from its dip in the 2000s, blind faith in housing gains has not. homeownership rates hit a 50-year low in 2015, and first-time home buyers are now waiting a record six years to move from renting to buying. in fact, young adults looking to upgrade out of their one-bedroom apartments are increasingly renting single-family homes rather than buying. single-family rentals — either detached homes or townhomes — make up the fastest-growing segment of the housing market, according to the urban institute.

in this example, if you were to contribute 5% of your salary, or $3,750 a year, to your 401(k) account, your employer would also contribute $3,750 a year. contributions are typically made every pay period. the bottom line is: each of your contributions would earn an immediate 100% return — a doubling of your initial investment. you will need to check to see how long it takes for the employer's contribution to be vested. this means you may lose recent matching contributions if you change employers. for some companies, after an initial vesting period, all employer matching contributions are immediately vested.

millennials have a lower level of financial literacy than older workers. many of the most important financial decisions, including investing in higher education, saving for retirement, and purchasing a home, are made early in adult life. addressing common budget challenges young workers might face such as paying off student loans, mortgages, and credit card debt, could help them save for retirement. for example, it is not necessarily true that a young worker cannot or should not save for retirement if they carry any debt. while it certainly makes sense to pay off a high-interest loan, a young adult may be better off in the long run putting some money away for retirement while also paying down a low-interest student loan. providing opportunities to focus on the bigger picture of financial wellness can help workers better navigate these competing financial demands while encouraging planning and budgeting for unexpected expenses.

private equity funds and hedge funds have historically been structured as limited partnerships. under prior law, so-called carried interest arrangements allowed private equity fund and hedge fund managers to give up their right to receive current fees for their services and instead receive an interest in future profits from the private equity/hedge fund partnership. these arrangements are often called carried interests because the private equity/hedge fund manager doesn't pay anything for the partnership profits interest. also, the private equity/hedge fund manager is not taxed on the receipt of the carried interest because it's not considered a taxable event.
the other challenges include that cannabis companies need to be well-capitalized but are unable to access capital in the form of capital markets or bank loans. cannabis is still illegal at the federal level, where it is classified as a schedule i drug, putting it in the same class as heroin and cocaine. as long as the federal prohibition is in place, companies can't have bank accounts at federally insured institutions, and they can't sell product across state lines.

you could do that, but a judge is likely to notice your sudden generous payments towards your mortgage and car loan, and could even penalize you for them. that's the kind of surreptitious action that has gone against others years after the fact. in 1996, a california woman won $1.3 million in the lottery and filed for divorce 11 days later. she didn't tell her husband or anyone else about her windfall, and two years later her husband found out about it (they always do) and sued her. superior court judge richard denner ruled that she acted out of fraud or malice and awarded her husband all of her winnings. had she been honest, they both would have walked away with half.

economists are not very good at predicting how large deviations will be. and there are some underlying reasons for why you might see valuation differences. one would be that if you really think we're in a low-interest-rate environment. that means valuations, will, on average, be higher. so the question is, do you think that is a permanent phenomenon or a temporary phenomenon? and obviously when you are talking about stocks, but also to some extent commercial real estate, the tax code matters, and we've just had a tax code change. so those kinds of effects can have an impact on valuation. but i would say that real estate, like other asset classes, are now showing to be a bit higher than what they've been historically and that continues to be a little bit of a concern for me.

rosengren: that's accurate. financial conditions have not tightened significantly with the increase in short-term interest rates. part of that is the stock market has gone up quite a bit and exchange rates and some of these other variables are being affected by a stimulative fiscal policy. so even while we're tightening with monetary policy, in some sense we have a more stimulative fiscal policy and over the course of the year people didn't know what, if any, tax change would occur. and now we know a tax change has actually occurred, so we now have a stimulative environment from the fiscal policy side that we didn't necessarily know was going to happen, so short-term interest rates have tightened but the long rate tmubmusd30y, 2.417% is a little less than 2.5% right now. i would expect over time that it will gradually increase as we unwind our balance sheet and as it becomes clear that inflation really is picking up towards our 2% goal and that the tight labor markets are starting to have an impact on wages and prices over time.

in most divorce cases, especially in california which is a community property state, couples are instructed to divide their shared assets down the middle (in monetary terms) and, as part of that settlement, they're allowed to keep what they own personally, such as clothing and jewelry. in your state, you take out of the marriage what you brought into it, but this grows more complicated when a home has appreciated during a marriage and/or when marital assets were used to pay the mortgage (even though, in this case, your husband never actually worked). i'm not against your giving a little money to your parents if they need it for a specific reason, but not to hide it before your divorce is over. if you do have to split those savings, $10,000 is a small price to pay for your freedom.

halliburton co. hal, -5.05% shares rose 1.2% in premarket trade monday after the company reported higher-than-expected fourth-quarter profit and revenue. the company reported a loss of $825 million, or a loss of 94 cents per share, after a loss of $153 million, or a loss of 17 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. the latest results include charges relating to tax reform in the u.s. and venezuela receivables, the company said. adjusted earnings-per-share were 53 cents, compared with the factset consensus of 46 cents. revenue rose to $5.9 billion from $4.0 billion, above the factset consensus of $5.6 billion. halliburton said it recorded an aggregate $882 million in non-cash discrete tax charges in the fourth-quarter as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017, which is a provisional amount that is subject to change. the company also said it continues to have delays in collecting payments on receivables from its primary customer in venezuela. halliburton shares have risen 22% over the last three months, compared with a 9% rise in the s&p 500 spx, -1.48% and a 11.8% rise in the dow jones industrial average djia, -0.46% .

of course, my decision stings because i literally could not have chosen a better stock. remember, netflix is up about 3,400% since the start of 2008. for comparison's sake, google parent alphabet inc. googl, -2.92% is up a mere 139.1% over that period, while apple inc. aapl, -3.39% is up 324%, a quadrupling in value that has made it the largest u.s. company by market cap. amazon.com inc. amzn, -3.44% is up 774.1% over this period; it has also become one of netflix's biggest rivals in the online streaming space, a category that barely existed nine years ago. among the other quadruple-digit percentage gainers, tesla motors inc. tsla, -6.93% is up 1,139.9%, although it only went public in june 2010. (too rich for my blood, i told a friend in 2012, right before it jumped 344% in the subsequent year.)
moreover, that 5% or 6% comes with a heap of short-term risk. while foreign stocks still appear reasonably priced, u.s. shares are richly valued based on price-earnings multiples, the shiller p/e, tobin's q and dividend yields. are you prepared for a 30% or 40% short-term decline in share prices? faced with that risk, i suspect many folks wouldn't mind notching a guaranteed 4% by paying down their fixed-rate mortgage.

it isn't surprising to me that we're tightening up at the short-end but the fact that monetary policy both here and abroad has been pushing down on the long rate means that this is going to be a little bit different exit strategy than what we've historically seen. we haven't had a bloated balance sheet around the world in previous periods. people who are taking a lot of meaning from the slope of the yield curve, i think, need to consider what it means to be in a different monetary policy framework — which is that europe, japan and the united states have a balance sheet that intentionally was suppressing long rates. so the signal value probably isn't quite the same, but it is a reason to your earlier question about why financial conditions haven't tightened more because the balance sheets are likely to only come down gradually over time. now you could do it differently, and if you want to see the long end of the market go up quickly i can certainly imagine policies of central banks in some part of the world deciding to sell long-term securities would have the impact of pushing up the yield curve. i'm not advocating that. but i think it is an intentional policy. it is not as if this is an unanticipated outcome.

i just love the heart of our city, the kindness that is shown towards others. starting a business, you never really know how people are going to show up and support you. when i asked for customers and asked for people to help support me, they totally did, no questions asked. the hearts of the people here are really genuine. they want the best for you, not like, 'i hope this person doesn't make it.'
the expensive myth of active management
but it is not just trump's proposed tax changes that plausibly affect market psychology. the u.s. has never had a president like him. not only is he an actor, like ronald reagan; he is also a motivational writer and speaker, a brand name in real estate, and a tough deal maker. if he ever reveals his financial information, or if his family is able to use his influence as president to improve its bottom line, he might even prove to be successful in business.
this question is perhaps the most important of all. nothing is worse than saving for years to retire early, burning bridges in your career, and then discovering that you're bored. consider well before that happens what you will do with your new-found time in early retirement. what will excite you about getting out of bed every day? how often will you check things off of your bucket list? what do you want your contribution to the world to be?

the start of a new year naturally creates incentive for making changes. days that seem like transition points motivate people to take advantage of the fresh-start effect, research shows. birthdays, the beginning of a semester, and the start of a new week all fall under this new transition time. researchers at the wharton school came to this conclusion after they discovered that visits to the university fitness center spiked during these turning points.
a report by the official monetary and financial institutions forum on the yuan and the multi-currency reserve system stated in january 2013: after six years of gradual appreciation against the dollar — amounting to 30% in nominal terms since 2005, as part of china's modification of the currency peg — the renminbi no longer seems fundamentally undervalued against the dollar. for much of this period, markets treated the renminbi as a one-way bet. however, over the course of 2012 and 2013, repeated periods of slight weakness indicated that this view would have to change.

the current spread between the effective funds rate and 10-year treasury is about 30 basis points. historically, a spread that narrow has been either a precursor to inversion (the fed ignores the signal and keeps raising rates) or the start of a capitulation (the fed realizes the error of its ways and begins to ease aggressively).
whether rouhani steps down or not, it is now apparent that the status quo cannot continue indefinitely — indeed, perhaps not for very much longer. iranians were told that the nuclear deal concluded in 2015 would lift them out of economic hardship. but, thanks partly to persistent corruption — iran ranks in the lowest quartile globally in this area — annual inflation exceeds 10%, and youth unemployment stands at 25%. according to gallup, only citizens of iraq and south sudan are more pessimistic about their future.
thirtieth birthdays are an excellent time to take stock of your future funds, especially as short-term financial obligations solidify, such as continuing to pay off the last of student loans, living on your own (or maybe starting a potentially three-decade stretch of mortgage payments) and raising children. millennials, the generation 20s to mid-30-year-olds fit into, have delayed marriage and home ownership from happening in their 20s (as was the norm decades ago). now 57% of today's 30- year-olds are or have been married, 47% are living with a child and a third are homeowners, according to the united states census bureau.

that's a whole lot to take in during a year when the number of breweries in the u.s. skyrocketed past 4,100 to pre-prohibition heights (if non pre-prohibition breweries per capita). even after spending more than a year with our eyes and ears on the industry and our feet planted in breweries, brewpubs, storage coolers and brewers' conferences, we took away one big lesson: there's still a whole lot to learn about the beer industry in the united states. however, here are some of the other takeaways that we think are going to serve us, brewers, distributors and beer drinkers well in 2016.

in 2008, the taxpayers of this country bailed out wall street because we were told they were too big to fail. yet, today, 3 out of the 4 largest financial institutions (jp morgan chase, bank of america and wells fargo) are nearly 80 percent bigger than before we bailed them out. incredibly, the six largest banks in this country issue more than two-thirds of all credit cards and more than 35 percent of all mortgages. they control more than 95 percent of all financial derivatives and hold more than 40 percent of all bank deposits. their assets are equivalent to nearly 60 percent of our gdp. enough is enough.

9. if you were not invested in the stock market and were waiting for it to settle down, i would ask what are you waiting for? and how will you know it's time to get in?
yes. first, every rally in a bear market has no traction. in a bull market, rallies will hold for days or weeks. now we're getting sharp one-day wonders that fail. every hope is dashed. that is a strong characteristic of a bear market. second, the nyse tick is registering no institutional activity on the buy side. every rally is a chance for mutual funds to lighten positions. and this is only january. wait until people look at their january statements. many will be shocked.
with that in mind, it's time to consider moves that will lower your 2020 tax bill, and hopefully position you for tax savings in future years too.

(each time my hypothetical investment doubled, i told myself that the stock would surely begin a downtrend the second i jumped in.)

this strategy also coincides with a long-established tendency of republican party leadership, since the 1970s, to run up federal budget deficits when they are in power and then return to fiscal conservatism when the democrats take office. and finally, there are also some true believers in high republican places; mitch mcconnell used some of these in the senate to tell trump no can do just before the election, when trump leaned on republican senators to reach a deal with the democrats on the heroes 2.0 covid stimulus bill. trump backed off, perhaps calculating that a fight with senate republican leadership just before the elections was not worth the risk.

it may seem strange to look ahead to 2018 so early in 2017, but it makes sense for long-term investors because some themes can take a long time to play out. banks, for example, are expected to become much more profitable as interest rates rise, because rates on their loan portfolios will increase faster than their funding costs. so long-term investors — those making commitments of at least three years — really do need to take a longer-range look at earnings expectations.

trump lost georgia by 11,779 votes. to pressure this state official to do his bidding, trump brandished the threat of criminal prosecution. he claimed – falsely, baselessly and ridiculously – that georgia's ballots were corrupt even as he was trying to corrupt them himself:
the downside of using the reconciliation procedure is it could take longer than democrats want and its use would require the bill to be more narrow in scope than they would prefer.

i love my uncle. my tweet yesterday had nothing to do with family, mcdaniel, who dropped the maiden name romney after assuming her rnc post, said on fox and friends. i would have done this to any freshman incoming senator, and i would have said, 'hey, let's focus on the real issues here, which are the democrats, who are proposing dangerous policies for our country. and let's remind americans about the good things that have come out of the trump administration.'
president trump: really? how many people do that? you mean they moved out and then they said, ah, all the hell with it, i'll move back in? you know, it doesn't sound like a very normal – like you mean they moved out, and, what, they missed it so much that they wanted to move back in? you know, it's like – (laughs) – it's crazy.

like a doctor or lawyer, people usually come to the moneyologist when there's something wrong, so we're not catching people at their best when they're fighting over estates or plotting against their stepchildren. there were many instances of people who did want to do the right thing, like this lady who wants to know how to disperse $150,000 she received from her ex-husband's pension. or this mother who didn't want to receive anything from her abusive ex-husband's estate.

(who expects their investments to rise by a factor of 30?) i didn't want to invest in netflix because i had analyzed and found value in its price-to-earnings and enterprise-value-to-sales ratios; i couldn't have even defined those terms back then. i was simply a voracious movie watcher, and netflix's dvd-by-mail system was not only more convenient than blockbuster (remember blockbuster?), but came with a vastly superior selection.

that doesn't mean that we set new speculative-market records every day. stock-price movements tend to approximate what economists call random walks, with prices reflecting small daily shocks that are about equally likely to be positive or negative. and random walks tend to go through long periods when they are well below their previous peak; the chance of setting a record soon is negligible, given how far prices would have to rise. but once they do reach a new record high, prices are far more likely to set additional records – probably not on consecutive days, but within a short interval.

it's hard to be careful, though, when it's difficult or impossible to predict what that care will ultimately cost. medical providers charge wildly different amounts for the same treatments, and what they charge may be wildly different from what they'll actually accept. (witness the recent $16,800 bill we got for a colonoscopy that insurance finally settled, in full, for $350.) what high-deductible plans can do is cause people to put off seeing the doctor, which ultimately can result in much bigger bills for treatment.

selling too early. when you're younger and you start making more money you start investing more. i flip houses and i bought this one house [in east hampton] right before the market crashed in 2008 and it was sort of a multimillion-dollar purchase. instead of holding it — which i probably could have — i got really nervous and i sold it. i said, 'i have to sell it; everything is falling apart.' now it's double its value of what i paid for it because it was such a great location and it was the right spot. i kind of knew it in the back of my head, but i haven't forgotten that lesson: sometimes if you don't know what to do, do nothing. sit the market out a little. unless you really need it to pay your mortgage, it will come back. it may not come back in the exact same time you want, but the market will come back, especially real estate. it was a dumb decision.

a big change disney made last year that could benefit guests considering the free-dining offer is that alcoholic beverages are now covered by disney's dining plans. but this too is a situation where visitors' mileage may vary. for instance, families who plan to spend the bulk of their time at the magic kingdom won't see much benefit from the change if they get the quick-service dining plan, because only a few of the theme park's restaurants even serve alcohol. moreover, travelers who don't typically have big appetites won't get their money's worth if they find themselves skipping meals to take in the attractions. the added value can be illusory, bricker said.

new year's resolutions, plans, goals, declarations and intentions — i've tried them all.
rosengren: i think there are some advantages of having a fed-led discussion about how we should think about the framework. my own view is that we would be better off having a little more flexibility than having a specific inflation target. i would much rather have an inflation range – something more like 1.5%-3%. and that during times where interest rates were likely to be low because labor force growth was quite low and productivity was quite low, that would be a time that i would actually like a higher level of inflation so i would like to be higher in the range during that period. and during periods of very high productivity then we could be lower. and the reason for that is – and it is partly a financial stability concern – that the current framework where we have low productivity and low population growth and not much immigration, is an environment where we are going to hit the zero lower bound too frequently. and i do think that has significant consequences – both because monetary policy becomes less effective when we can't move short-term interest rates, and i also think that it changes investor and household behavior when you start having periods of prolonged interest rates that are very low and unchanged. so i would like to avoid those kind of outcomes occurring in future recessions and so i think it is a good time to be discussing what is the right framework to reduce that probability.

my father was doing most of the meeting of the guests on my behalf. he was living alone and adjusting to that phase of life. and he was using words like 'boredom' a lot, says mangan, a former banker. but what was enjoyable for him was meeting the older guests who came to stay. they'd go to the pub together and go sightseeing and have dinner. there was real bonding. the common denominator was their age group.

as you know, the usual deadline for filing your annual personal federal income tax return is april 15 of the following year. however, that date is always adjusted for weekends and holidays. so the deadline for your 2016 form 1040 is april 18, 2017. that date reflects the fact that april 15 and 16 fall on a weekend and april 17 is the emancipation day holiday in the district of columbia. if you can't file by april 18, you can obtain an automatic six-month extension to oct. 16 by filing form 4868 by no later than april 18.

pricewaterhousecoopers is pleased that the court properly rejected all of the claims asserted by colonial bancgroup as well as several of the key claims asserted by the fdic. the court's ruling recognizes that in addition to those cbg employees who perpetrated the fraud, numerous other employees at colonial bancgroup actively and substantially interfered with pricewaterhousecoopers' audit. the fdic was only able to prevail on the claim that it did based on an earlier novel ruling by the court that immunized the fdic from imputation-based defenses. pricewaterhousecoopers intends to appeal that novel ruling at the earliest possible opportunity. pricewaterhousecoopers is also pleased with the court's finding that it did not cause a substantial portion of the damages the fdic is seeking. pricewaterhousecoopers looks forward to the damages phase where the fdic will bear the burden of proof on what remains of their inflated damages claim.

some people are surprised at this chart, since they thought residential real estate had produced much higher average annual returns — instead of rising at a rate even lower than long-term treasurys. hasn't real estate been the greater generator of wealth over the last half-century? but real estate's wealth generation is due in large part to leverage — buying a house with a mortgage — which magnifies the returns of the asset itself.

the u.s. has seen its happiness slide happiness over the last decade. in 2007, it ranked no. 3 among the organization for economic cooperation and development countries. but it now hovers at 19th place, partly due to the political discourse. the predominant political discourse in the united states is aimed at raising economic growth, with the goal of restoring the american dream and the happiness that is supposed to accompany it. but the data show conclusively that this is the wrong approach, economist jeffrey sachs wrote in the report.

9. save with purpose, says malani. rather than have one big savings account for everything, you should have different accounts for different goals: in 2019, put purpose behind your savings. start by deciding what you're saving for (i.e. trip to portugal, new west elm couch, etc.). then set up a separate savings account for each thing or experience you're saving for. finally, nickname the savings account in accordance with its designated purpose. you'll be much less likely to 'borrow' money from your portugal vacay account than just a general savings account, she explains.

if the annual percentage increase in costs for private insurers — who cover a population with fewer health care needs — already outpaces medicare spending growth, their costs are likely to rise significantly faster when they cover a costlier population. under the voucher plan, the government can keep its costs low by limiting the size of the voucher, but that strategy would only lead to an enormous financial burden falling on vulnerable elderly and disabled individuals.
