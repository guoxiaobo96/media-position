The impacts of the pandemic on retirement savings are yet to be seen. While some Americans have already had to take out of their retirement savings to pay for short-term expenses or other emergencies, COVID-19 is still wreaking havoc on Americans' personal finances. Cities are still in lockdown, some industries — such as travel and recreation — are still suffering, leading to job losses or reduced wages.

So, I used my system of insider analysis and company analysis to single out my favorites in the worst hit sectors. My 20 stocks were up 64% by the end of the year, a lot better than the 51.7% gain for the S&P 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gain of 44.4%. My group of stocks lagged behind the 75% gain for Nasdaq, because it contained no tech.
The biggest energy equities ETF — the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF XLE, -4.49% — is up 7% in 2018 so far, but only up 14% over the past three months. That means it still has some catching up to do to reflect the more than 20% rallies in both crude and Brent over the same period.

To be sure, if religious extremists take control of all levels of Iran's government, appeals based on Iranians' economic prospects will fall on deaf ears. But if Rouhani retains the presidency — or another moderate takes his place — there is a chance that such pressure would provide sufficient cover to scale back Iran's foreign adventurism and reform the domestic economy. This would minimize the risk of severe violence in Iran, while galvanizing opposition to religious extremists.
As we enter 2018, make no mistake that U.S. production will continue to drive the market medium and longer term, they said in Monday's report. If U.S. production continues to rise that will remain a consistent and growing headwind on oil prices.

Here's the plan. If your total itemizable deductions for 2020 will be close to your standard deduction amount, consider making enough additional expenditures for itemized deduction items before year-end to exceed the standard deduction. Those prepayments will lower this year's tax bill. Next year, your standard deduction might be a bit bigger thanks to an inflation adjustment, and you can claim it then. Or it could be smaller, if major tax-increase legislation passes, which I think is unlikely.

Allowing authorized users does provide some of the conveniences that allowing a cosigner does, since it gives another person the ability to spend on the same credit account. However, while opening one's own account alone or with a cosigner helps an individual build credit, an authorized user doesn't build as much, Ethan Dornhelm, the senior director of scores and analytics at Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) previously told MarketWatch.
Valeant has previously been reluctant to disclose activities that it deemed immaterial.

Everybody loves classic cars. They can be gorgeous to look at, own, and — in some cases, at least — to drive. But if you're thinking of them as an investment, think again.

Take Huntsville, Ala., which had the most affordable rental market in the country back in January 2018, according to Attom Data Solutions. Last year, the average renter there only had to devote 22.3% of their wages to rent.

And the prevailing wages in places like Huntsville aren't as high as in cities like New York or Seattle.

Democrats will have the ability to take two bites at the reconciliation apple this year, if they choose to, so they could use one of those for extra fiscal stimulus and keep one in reserve. They could pass two budget resolutions – one for the current fiscal year ending in October and the traditional one for the upcoming budget year, as Republicans did in 2017.
Don't be fooled: Stock picking is still a loser's game
But there are limitations to the procedure. The reconciliation bills cannot increase the budget deficit beyond the years covered by the budget resolution, which is why President Bush's tax cuts were originally temporary. The bills cannot deal with Social Security. And the changes proposed must have a budget effect by changing spending or revenues in a non-incidental way. Violations of those rules can result in the offending provisions being stripped out or the bill losing its filibuster protection.

This is a faulty election result and, honestly, this should go very fast. You should meet tomorrow because you have a big election coming up and because of what you've done to the president. You know, the people of Georgia know that this was a scam and because of what you've done to the president a lot of people aren't going out to vote and a lot of Republicans are going to vote negative because they hate what you did to the president, OK. They hate him and they're going to vote, and you would be respected, really respected, if this thing could be straightened out before the election.

It's also easy to think spending upfront will motivate you to hit the gym often and get your money's worth, says Kevin Volpp, director of the Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics at the University of Pennsylvania.

While you're deciding whether or not to schlep to the gym on a busy weekday in June, you probably won't be considering the money you dropped on a membership in January.

To the extent you have capital losses this year or capital loss carryovers from earlier years, selling winners by year-end will not result in any tax hit. In particular, sheltering net short-term capital gains with capital losses is a tax-smart move because net short-terms gains will otherwise be taxed at your higher ordinary income rate of up to 37%, plus another 3.8% if the NIIT bites. Ouch.

If you put money away into an asset that is not linked to the USD or your local FIAT currency it will grow faster than inflation, if it also pays interest income on 35 different digital assets, such interest rates can be greater than inflation and get you closer and closer to financial independence each month.

This time around, there has been such intense focus on the curve, both instructive (Fed research on the powerful signal inherent in the term structure) and frivolous (market chatter that attaches some importance to a short-lived inversion between, say, 3- and 5-year notes), that the Fed may be more circumspect about tapping the brakes if the next adjustment in interest rates is certain to push the funds rate above the yield on the 10-year Treasury.

Today, we don't need the hellfire and the pitch forks, we don't need the rivers of boiling blood, but we do need a national usury law.
That sounds like important news for Trump. In fact, the Dow had already hit nine record highs before the election, when Hillary Clinton was projected to win. In nominal terms, the Dow is up 70% from its peak in January 2000. On Nov. 29, 2016, it was announced that the S&P/CoreLogic/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index (which I co-founded with my late colleague Karl E. Case) reached a record high the previous September. The previous record was set more than ten years earlier, in July 2006.
Tesla TSLA, +3.68% saw its target price upped to $810 from $540 by Morgan Stanley, which reiterated an overweight call on the electric-vehicle maker. Barclays, by contrast, reiterated its $230 price target.
What if you have some loser investments that you would like to unload? Biting the bullet and taking the resulting capital losses this year would shelter capital gains, including high-taxed short-term gains, from other sales this year.
Sinnreich said extensively sourced pieces of journalism are a welcome departure from the concept of alternative facts, a phrase used by Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway last year. A book can substantiate its claims, list sources and make nuanced arguments, Sinnreich said. The more we talk about books, the more those forms of persuasion get to play a role in the political conversation. As an author and avid reader, I'm all for that.
If consumers really do have a problem with their reports, the CFPB recommends contacting both the credit-reporting company that provided the credit report and any other company that may have distributed information about one's score (there are many third-party websites, such as Credit Karma or some credit-card companies, for example, that provide credit scores) to track down a potential error. That complaint should include what information consumers think is wrong, why they think it's wrong and copies of any documents that can back up that claim.
2) Rise in mortality improvement between 1990 and the mid-2000s. On the favorable side, the new drugs and technology became more universal and the decline in male smoking began to have a favorable impact. In addition, the decline in female smoking had a positive effect in the 2000s. At the same time, improvements were tempered by the rise in obesity.
MR. GERMANY: I don't know about that. I do know that we have – when military ballots come in, it's not just military. It's also military and overseas citizens.

If I were Marty McFly from Back to the Future, I would travel back and warn everyone against borrowing money from their future selves.
It may not be shocking, but it's hardly something to brag about. Janus' supposed expertise with regard to its concentrated portfolios was on the active-management side—and even then that expertise has led to some volatile performance and outright disasters after the dot-com bust. Indexing wins because of low costs and broad diversification. The thematic health ETFs offer neither—their 0.5% fees are high, and their holdings are extremely concentrated without any manager discretion. If anything cries out for the old-school active management Janus was once famous for, it's strategies like these.
The CDU will have to choose a leader with a clear view of what they want to do and whom they want to govern with. The top two contenders seem to be Friedrich Merz, the former BlackRock executive who was the runner-up in the leadership contest two years ago, and Jens Spahn, the 39-year old health minister.

Ultimately when Beijing created a market when it was the only buyer, it also placed itself in an extremely exposed position.
I think the time it would take to pass a budget resolution and reconciliation bill would not address the immediate issue of COVID and so they would direct their attention on an emergency supplemental rather than a reconciliation bill, he said.
The yen USDJPY, +0.10% was last down 0.4% against the U.S. dollar, but it has risen 2% this week as investors seek havens. The currency's strength weighs on Japanese exporters that repatriate earnings from overseas and pay costs at home.
In divorce situations, one spouse or ex-spouse may become legally obligated to make payments to the other party. Since these payments are often substantial, locking in tax deductions for the payer has often been a substantial issue. Before the new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), payments that met the tax-law definition of alimony could always be deducted by the payer for federal income tax purposes. And recipients of alimony payments always had to report the payments as taxable income.
First, solve the problems that you can solve today that can be digested by the consumer particularly in the car, and have longer range plans in autonomy, Qualcomm Inc. QCOM, +1.53% automotive executive Patrick Little said in summing up the current state of autonomous development during an interview with MarketWatch. I think several of our competitors have shown up to the party about three or four years early and they're all dressed up in their tuxedo waiting with their technology, but the industry isn't ready for that.
In this table, total return for the Gradient 50 strategy includes cash dividends, while total returns for the index include the reinvestment of dividends. Binger said his firm's clients tend to be at or near retirement age, so many take their dividends in cash to generate income. As cash from dividends builds up in the fund, it is reinvested in stocks, just not automatically in the same ones that are paying the dividends.
You be an example for your son. If someone tries to cheat you, advocate for yourself and come out fighting. It can be your final and most valuable lesson of all. Whether he decides to learn from it, of course, is entirely up to him.
It may seem strange to look ahead to 2018 so early in 2017, but it makes sense for long-term investors because some themes can take a long time to play out. Banks, for example, are expected to become much more profitable as interest rates rise, because rates on their loan portfolios will increase faster than their funding costs. So long-term investors — those making commitments of at least three years — really do need to take a longer-range look at earnings expectations.
1. What are the facts? (When you go to the doctor, the first thing that usually happens is getting blood pressure, etc.)
As you can see, within secular bear markets there are smaller bull markets or years of positive returns. During the last bear market between 2000 and 2013, nine of the 13 were positive, for example.
The chart also shows that bonds historically have had an even better record than real estate during equity bear markets. Bonds even gained ground during the 2007-09 financial crisis, when real estate fell. So if it weren't for currently low interest rates, you might conclude that bonds are the superior hedge against bear markets.
So tell me, Brad, what are we going to do? We won the election and it's not fair to take it away from us like this, and it's going to be very costly in many ways and I think you have to say that you're going to reexamine it and you can reexamine it, but reexamine it with people that want to find answers, not people that don't want to find answers.
With that six-month moratorium ending this coming Friday, investors were spooked that there could be an avalanche of pent-up selling.
According to a survey released last week by the AMG Funds, more than 90% of affluent mutual fund investors plan to maintain or increase their allocations to active funds in 2016, in spite of — or perhaps because of — the sustained to increasing volatility they see over the next 12 months.
The market is split on its expectations for Tuesday's meeting, according to a Bloomberg survey cited by Brown Brothers Harriman.

Lane, who was unemployed when he went on the show after working in corporate finance at J.P. Morgan JPM, +1.65% and other firms, says he has had trouble re-entering the industry. I didn't understand the magnitude of the show and how hard it is to get a real job right after, Lane says. Everyone knows who you are and employers see it as a distraction. Lane first appeared on the franchise nearly a year ago, and is still undergoing his job search.

Mere puffery, to quote the judge, became worth quite a lot. Meanwhile, only months before its sale to Suntory, Beam said it discovered in late 2013 that it was overstating millions of dollars in sales and profits by recording some revenues too soon. Despite the restatement, the final merger agreement with Suntory identified $108 million in stock benefits for Beam's board and executives.

PricewaterhouseCoopers is pleased that the Court properly rejected all of the claims asserted by Colonial BancGroup as well as several of the key claims asserted by the FDIC. The Court's ruling recognizes that in addition to those CBG employees who perpetrated the fraud, numerous other employees at Colonial Bancgroup actively and substantially interfered with PricewaterhouseCoopers' audit. The FDIC was only able to prevail on the claim that it did based on an earlier novel ruling by the Court that immunized the FDIC from imputation-based defenses. PricewaterhouseCoopers intends to appeal that novel ruling at the earliest possible opportunity. PricewaterhouseCoopers is also pleased with the Court's finding that it did not cause a substantial portion of the damages the FDIC is seeking. PricewaterhouseCoopers looks forward to the damages phase where the FDIC will bear the burden of proof on what remains of their inflated damages claim.

If selling some losers would cause your 2020 capital losses to exceed your 2020 capital gains, the result would be a net capital loss for the year. No problem. That net capital loss can be used to shelter up to $3,000 of 2020 income from salaries, bonuses, self-employment income, interest income, royalties, and whatever else ($1,500 if you use married filing separate status). Any excess net capital loss is carried forward to next year and beyond.
Greenfield expects government regulators to make a move with regard to film theatrical release windows (the amount of time between theatrical release and home video release). As it stands the release window is around 90 days and there's little wiggle room, and film exhibition chains try to prevent movie studios from shortening windows. An antitrust and collusion investigation could result if more films show up on Netflix and Amazon without going through major exhibition chains due to release strategies, according to Greenfield.
Some 37% of Americans want to eat healthier, exercise more and save more money, according to data analytics firm Statista. The gym membership probably won't work out, based on the number of people who take out new memberships and stop going. And Americans still struggle to save partly due to stagnant wages, despite an improving jobs market. But there are some simple dietary changes that could be a life saver.

The pre-election Biden tax plan would raise the top individual federal income rate on ordinary income and net short-term capital gains back to 39.6%, the top rate that was in effect before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) lowered it to 37% for 2018-2025. Biden also said he would generally raise taxes on folks with incomes above $400,000 without supplying specifics.

It's no secret that health-care costs bankrupt people all the time. How will you ensure that this never happens to you? Will you buy health insurance through federal or state exchanges until you reach age 65 and qualify for Medicare? Have you done the calculations for the income you plan to have, and ensured that your retirement budget can cover the full cost of premiums and copays (as well as the possibility of needing to go up to the out-of-pocket maximum)? Will you plan to live abroad and avoid buying insurance in the U.S.? (Or are you a lucky Canadian or European, who doesn't have to worry about such things?)

Instinet analyst Dan Dolev wrote in a November note to clients that the Cash Card is the fourth largest revenue component within Square's software and services segment, based on his recent chat with the company's investor-relations team. The various software and services components together are expected to have brought in $253 million during 2018, according to FactSet estimates. Square said in its second-quarter investor letter that Cash App customers spent $250 million with the card last June, almost triple the amount spent in December 2017.
Beware the casual Christmas anecdote. Daniel Pinto, co-president of JPMorgan JPM, -1.20% and head of its investment banking business, recorded a seemingly innocuous interview about receiving his worst ever Christmas present as part of a wider segment on the subject for the bank's internal TV and web channel. Pinto said his worst Christmas present from a family member was an electric piano – [a] beautiful, very nice present except for the fact that I never played the piano. I didn't know how to play the piano, nor did I have any intention to learn!

The precious metal has touched $1,350 an ounce a few times over the past few years and has been pretty stable between $1,200 and $1,250 since the last test of those highs back in September. We've yet to break out to the upside, but a clear pattern of higher lows is an incredibly encouraging sign that we've found a new floor for prices. And with recent moves up through the important round number of $1,300, there's a good chance we keep powering higher.

The company reported a loss of $825 million, or a loss of 94 cents per share, after a loss of $153 million, or a loss of 17 cents per share, in the year-earlier period.

They beat me in the – (inaudible 17:07) as you know, every single state – we won every state. We won every statehouse in the country. We held the Senate, which is shocking to people, although we'll see what happens tomorrow or in a few days. And we won the House. But we won every single statehouse and we won Congress, which was supposed to lose 15 seats and they gained I think 16 or 17 or something. I think there's now a difference of five. There was supposed to be a difference substantially more.
Less than two years ago, Gary Westbrook, one of the PwC audit partners, testified in the TBW case that audits are not designed to detect fraud. However, he changed his tune at the Colonial trial, testifying that the firm did have a duty to design audit procedures to detect fraud. He also testified that if PwC failed to design its audit procedures to detect fraud, it would be a violation of auditing standards.

All told, the user found themselves spending around $900 a month on food. With some self-motivation, they've managed to cut that amount markedly in recent months to just $150. I now have over $5,000 in savings and there's potential for so much more if I can keep cutting food expenses, they wrote.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: Really? How many people do that? You mean they moved out and then they said, ah, all the hell with it, I'll move back in? You know, it doesn't sound like a very normal – like you mean they moved out, and, what, they missed it so much that they wanted to move back in? You know, it's like – (laughs) – it's crazy.

Buffets can be a hotbed of germs: If you see someone grab food from the buffet with their hands rather than a utensil, they should notify the ship crew to ensure that the potentially-tainted food is disposed.
For pending divorces, the holidays are especially trying if there are kids and family traditions in the mix, according to Lee Rosenberg of Saltzman Chetkof & Rosenberg in New York. Fights over who gets the kids for what days get heated quick, leaving lawyers to hash out drop-off times to the exact time and location.
Four stock picks from a money manager focused on dividend growth
I asked Robert Shiller, the Yale University finance professor and a co-creator of the Case-Shiller measure, whether he thought real estate's poor performance in the 2007-09 was an anomalous event. He said it was, since historically there is surprisingly little relation between home prices and the stock market. The implication: Shiller does not expect that in the next bear stock market there [will] be anything unusual happening in the housing market.
As you can see, the three-year trend is favorable, despite the occasional decline. Decreases may be worrisome, especially if you look at the stock market's results every day. But your 401(k) contributions would continue to be made as long as your employer pays you, so you would have paid lower prices and beaten the market's overall return.
Not liking your job — being clear on what you're retiring from — is not enough of a reason to retire early. The answer may be much, much simpler: find a different job, or a different career path. If you're committed to retiring early, but don't have good answers for all of these questions, then let them kickstart some additional thinking and planning that will pay off once you pull that ripcord and wave arrivederci to your career.
A spokesman for Royal Caribbean said the early return was designed, in part, to give the company more time to clean and sanitize the ship before its next sailing.

I use debt as a tool, but hate owing money; in 2015, as I completed the divorce process, I looked at outstanding debts and came up with an aggressive plan and a target number. Having the specific plan — and I was committed to reducing debt while not cutting or liquidating other savings — allowed me to feel good about my progress.
Looking at the most recent period between 1975 and 2016, the pattern of declining, then increasing, and now declining rates of mortality improvement could be explained as follows:
And while we don't know what will happen, that uncertainty makes 2019 a good time to shore up your savings, spend less so you can save more, pay down debt and invest smartly. So we asked experts what money moves they'd recommend taking in 2019. Here are 15 of them.
Tax cuts and deregulation sound like good ideas. Wrong.
Similarly, before an attacker breaks into a computer system, it is important to know which engineer handles each type of technology, what could be required of them, and what happens if you can't reach them. During one attack on San Diego, Hayslip said, the city wasted 45 minutes waiting for one engineer to reach a computer.
MR. GERMANY: We've been going through each of those as well. And those numbers that we got, that Ms. Mitchell was just saying, they're not accurate.

In fact, I'm often asked, How did you transition from consulting into advertising? or How did you transition from advertising into tech? I did it by transferring my skill sets from one role to the next, distinguishing myself as a blend of experiences, perspectives and approaches.

U.S. stock-market indexes closed at all-time highs on Thursday, while the Dow topped the 25,000 milestone for the first time.
There has been a rise in the number of high-profile hacks and data breaches affecting children. In April 2017, more than two million recorded messages from parents and children stored by CloudPets plush connected toy company were exposed to potential hackers, along with 800,000 emails and passwords. (CloudPets acknowledged the exposure, but said user information was not compromised.) In 2015, a hack of another toy company exposed the information of more than 200,000 children.
First, United Technologies Corp.'s US:UTX Carrier heating and cooling unit backed off from a plan to offshore a few hundred jobs from an Indiana plant to Mexico, and now Ford is doing the same thing. But we never hear about the thousands of jobs that are lost quietly. Or the thousands of new hires that don't make the evening news.
The Justice Department is now looking into charges that Anheuser-Busch InBev is monopolizing distribution in California, while continuing to weigh the antitrust implications of its purchase of SABMiller. However, after buying 10 Barrel, Elysian, Golden Road, Breckenridge and 4 Peaks in the past year and a half, Anheuser-Busch InBev now finds itself in the brewer's, distributor's and retailer's tiers of the U.S. three-tier distribution system implemented after Prohibition — a system designed to prevent exactly this type of thing from happening. In fairness to Anheuser-Busch, they've been forthcoming about their plans to corner 100% share of mind and, in the case of their high-end craft division, have been open about their plans to use their own distributors to bring their craft brands to a wider audience. This turned a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the SABMiller purchase into a de facto debate on the merits of an ever-expanding Anheuser-Busch, but it's clear that a company that spent $20 billion on one brewer won't be shy about buying up craft brewers for $50 million to $100 million apiece.
The biggest threat according to the WEF would come from the skies in the form of extreme weather events, at the top of its list, followed by large-scale involuntary migration, major natural disasters, large-scale terrorist attacks and a massive incident of data fraud/theft.

If you have additional income and/or adjustments to income, you must file the new Schedule 1 with your base postcard return. For example, you must file Schedule 1 if you had business income, capital gains; unemployment compensation; alimony received; or gambling winnings. You must also file Schedule 1 if you are claiming so-called above-the-line deductions for things like deductible IRA and self-employed retirement plan contributions; self-employed health insurance premiums; 50% of self-employment tax; HSA contributions; student loan interest; or educator expenses.
I think that 26% drop is about what we'll get in a classic cyclical bear market, which I don't expect to be accompanied by a financial crisis like the last one was.

My husband doesn't believe in credit (it's all made up numbers). He also doesn't believe that we can afford life insurance — even though we dine out several times a week. My husband doesn't have a bank account and the man owns a sub-contracting company. (Literally, he cashes checks in a strip mall for outrageous fees, and who knows where that money goes.)

In the current bull market, few people are willing to sell, so buyers must keep bidding up prices to attract a seller to make a transaction. As long as this remains the case, and exuberance exceeds logic, buyers will continue to pay higher prices to get into the positions they want to own.
In her decision, Judge Rothstein wrote that PwC admitted that it had failed to design its audits to detect fraud, violating auditing standards, but had agreed during the Colonial trial that it was required to do so.
A possible reason: If a credit-card bill isn't paid, having multiple account holders to track down may be harder for banks and card issuers than having just one, said Matt Schulz, a senior industry analyst for CreditCards.com.
Attaching a price to emissions and allowing emitters to offset their pollution with a credit-swapping system is considered one tool in the fight to slow man-made global warming. The next United Nations Conference of the Parties (COP), to be hosted by the U.K. in Glasgow in November, is expected to formalize international trade in carbon credits under the Paris Agreement.

U.S. economic data released Friday was downbeat, with consumer sentiment for January falling to a six-month low. Gold saw a temporary boost in the data's wake, briefly climbing above $1,335 before paring back its gains.
Trump thinks he can reverse centuries of globalization with a tweet or two. He thinks he can restore America's glory by building tariff walls against the world. But Trump cannot repeal the laws of economics that give multinational corporations every incentive to cut their costs any way they can.

Without a doubt! A distance of 200 yards to the green is not the same every single time. If I have 200 yards right up the middle with no distraction, no hazard, I'm going for it. If I have 200 yards with sand on the left or right, a hazard in the middle — wow, now I have to think. I have to hit the perfect shot to get there.
Osborne said Facebook often receives complaints from users that ads are not relevant, so the company tries to balance making ads useful while not violating user privacy.
But I encourage people to think about ways they can retreat from everyday life and find a place of rest and solitude. We have a lot of thoughts hanging around in our minds. If we can let them settle down and make peace with them, that will give us resilience in our daily lives once we leave the retreat.
Though the company has been very clear to call this a security vulnerability rather than a bug in order to avoid culpability in the already-mounting legal disputes, and CEO Brian Krzanich was under fire for selling some shares prior to the public announcement of Spectre and Meltdown, many of the initial concerns appear to be calmed.
And these people are beside themselves. So they went out and they filled in a provisional ballot, putting the name Trump on it.
The Fed's murder weapon is aptly encapsulated in the pictorial representation of the yield curve, or term structure of interest rates. When the central bank raises its benchmark, short-term rate to a level that exceeds that on a risk-free, long-term rate, such as the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.619% — that is, when the term spread inverts — a recession is sure to follow, with an average lead time of 14 months.
The Colonial award will be public and could be more than $1 billion. Combined with the confidential settlements for MF Global and TBW in the last 18 months, the firm is likely already feeling a strain, he said.
The EU bureaucracy is now cracking down on duly-elected national governments to force Italy to adhere to the eurozone's unworkable national budget rules, Hungary to take down its border fence and stop enforcing its national immigration laws, and Poland to block its efforts to make its judiciary accountable to Polish values and not those of international civil society.
When investors get active, it can mean a lot of things. While all of those actions are done with good intentions, the results aren't always a plus.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: But, Cleta, a lot of if you don't need to be shared. I mean, to be honest, they should share it. They should share it because you want to get to an honest election. I won this election by hundreds of thousands of votes. There's no way I lost Georgia. There's no way. We won by hundreds of thousands of votes. I'm just going by small numbers, when you add them up, they're many times the 11,000. But I won that state by hundreds of thousands of votes.

Even investment conferences and newsletter writers who were once gold bugs are now cryptocurrency gurus, and this is very similar to 1999 when gold bulls became dot-com gurus, he said. Eventually, we will have another gold rush possibly even bigger than the late 70s but possibly more like the 30s.
 The Dow is up only 19% in real (inflation-adjusted) terms since 2000. A 19% increase in 17 years is underwhelming.

Roughly two thirds of the companies are expected to report rising earnings and sales estimates.
Data out over the weekend showed that speculative investors such as hedge funds increased their bullish net bets on WTI to the highest level ever recorded. Such data tend to raise concerns that the market is about to turn, because it could be an indicator the market is overheated.
We need to stop payday lenders from ripping off millions of Americans. Post offices exist in almost every community in our country.

The United States is a credit society: $922 billion in outstanding credit card debt pays a 24% average rate of interest back to the banks. Add $1.6 trillion in student loans and $1.2 trillion in car loan debt. We are being forced to borrow from our future selves at rates of 12% to 24% when we can barely earn 1% on our money from traditional financial institutions.
Gold miners have been underperforming gold for the last several years, which is not unusual during a bear market or falling price, said Peter Spina, president and chief executive officer of GoldSeek.com. But over the prior few years as gold has moved hundreds of dollars off the low, miners have not led the gold price higher and instead mostly kept up pace with the gold price.
The Credit CARD Act, which U.S. President Barack Obama signed into law in 2009, made it more difficult for consumers under age 21 to get credit cards; they either needed a cosigner or proof of income.

When the economy is slowly recovering from a deep recession, markets often look ahead and bond yields rise. But this spike in long-term bond yields can cause growth to stall out. This dynamic was a constant struggle for Bernake in the wake of the financial crisis in 2008.
Though this outcome is all but certain, supporters of President Donald Trump are intent on using the session to promote their commitment to him and Trump's baseless claims, according to election and constitutional experts, that he lost the election due to widespread voting fraud.

Our first full year of Beer Goggles here at MarketWatch caught both the craft beer industry and beer in general in a state of upheaval largely unseen since the brewery consolidation of the late '70s and early '80s. Sure, Anheuser-Busch (and, later, Anheuser-Busch InBev BUD, -0.34% ) had purchased non-controlling stakes in Redhook, Widmer Brothers and Kona before and had already bought the Goose Island and Blue Point breweries. But acquiring four U.S. craft breweries (Elysian, Golden Road, Breckenridge and 4 Peaks) and a cider house (Virtue) in a calendar year?

Estimize, a crowdsourcing platform that gathers estimates from Wall Street analysts, as well as buy-side analysts, hedge-fund managers, company executives, academics and others, has calculated a consensus EPS estimate of 32 cents.
That scenario, which implies the potential for a final, euphoric surge to what's often been described as the most hated bull market in stock-market history, has been regularly predicted ever since the 2013 taper tantrum that drove a temporary spike in Treasury and other bond yields. Indeed, such predictions are now usually met with derision, acknowledged Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, in a Wednesday note.

If your answer is no, that's good. Detailed studies of investment results consistently indicate that the vast majority of investors who try to beat the market wind up doing the opposite.
And if you're not investing in an employer-sponsored account (after all, only 14% of employers offer such plans, according to the U.S. Census Bureau) consider a Roth IRA, which more forgivingly allows investors to use those assets for an emergency should a situation arise. As opposed to other accounts, like a 401(k) plan, that place penalties on individuals who withdraw money from these accounts, investors can take money out of a Roth IRA penalty-free so long as they only take out the money they invested, and not the investment earnings of those assets. Some 30 year olds, like Packer, have numerous accounts. Packer and his wife, for instance, have been maxing out their 401(k) plans and Roth IRAs for a few years.

Turnout in rural and more conservative-leaning portions of the state have lagged. President Trump is planning a last-minute rally Monday in Dalton in a last-ditch effort to rally the faithful to the polls.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: I think we probably did win it by a half a – you know, one of the things that happened, Brad, is we have other people coming in now from Alabama and from South Carolina and from other states, and they're saying it's impossible for you to have lost Georgia. We won – you know, in Alabama we set a record, got the highest vote ever. In Georgia we set a record with a massive amount of votes. And they say it's not possible to have lost Georgia. And I could tell you by our rallies. I could tell you by the rally I'm having on Monday night. The place, they already have lines of people standing out front waiting. It's just not possible to have lost Georgia. It's not possible.

Meanwhile, investors are playing down worries over potential tax increases as they focus on prospects for immediate stimulus, she said.
In my interview with him, Landis started by reviewing the amendments to Social Security that were enacted in 1983, which is the last time that changes were enacted. He pointed out that the Social Security trust fund was slated to run out of money in July of that year, and the changes that averted that possibility weren't enacted until March—with just four months to spare, in other words. Landis characterized the changes as gentle, phased in, and targeted in the future. They included the gradual increase in the full retirement age and an acceleration of a previously-enacted payroll tax increase; in addition, up to one-half of the value of Social Security benefits were made potentially taxable.
The list will show the discounted cash price for people paying on their own without insurance coverage. It will also show the negotiated price a hospital has reached with payers, like an insurance company — but keep in mind that's not the ultimate, out-of-pocket cost, which matter to consumers who still have co-pays and deductibles to reach.
3. Higher maximum rate on long-term capital gains
In contrast to bonds, which will be hurt by higher inflation, real estate should benefit. Consider the extent to which the 12-month rate of change in the Case-Shiller Home Price Index is correlated with that of the CPI. The correlation coefficient — which ranges from minus 1.0 (inverse correlation) to plus 1.0 (positive correlation) and which is zero if there is no correlation — is a statistically significant 0.45. The comparable correlation with long-term bonds is negative, not surprisingly, at minus 0.19.

Like a lottery winner, people focus on what they can do now with the $25,000 or $50,000 they're offered for a small pension, rather than on the ability to secure a lifetime income.
Among the numerous salacious allegations in Fire and Fury, many of which are attributed to former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, Wolff writes that President Trump did not expect or even want to win the presidency in November 2016, and writes that Melania Trump was in tears. In interviews, Wolff also took pot shots at the president's reading habits. Donald Trump doesn't read anything, he told NPR.
The second truth is one that many people suspected but were too timid to call out: the money-tree is real. Governments that proclaimed their impecunity whenever called upon to pay for a hospital here or a school there suddenly discovered oodles of cash to pay for furlough wages, nationalize railways, take over airlines, support car makers, and even prop up gyms and hairdressers.
Respondents were less certain about the direction of home prices, though. A net 46% thought they'd go up. Data provider CoreLogic agrees. The group forecast a 4.7% increase in rates from December 2016 to December 2017.

Such a boost will allow for more reliable communication, which is a must in areas like telesurgery, remote consultation and remote monitoring.

The stock market could not have written a more perfect script. And the wait-and-see message was re-enforced Wednesday with the release of the minutes of the Dec. 18-19 meeting, the tone of which was much more deferential to global economic and financial market considerations than Powell let on at the time of his post-meeting press conference.
The Dow is up only 19% in real (inflation-adjusted) terms since 2000. A 19% increase in 17 years is underwhelming, and the national home price index that Case and I created is still 16% below its 2006 peak in real terms. But hardly anyone focuses on these inflation-corrected numbers.
Between a 7% fall in shares that triggered new circuit breakers on the Shanghai SHCOMP, +0.51% and Shenzhen stock exchanges 399100, +0.81% and accelerated weakness in the yuan, there is ample fodder for China bears.
As part of China's catchup with the West, the Chinese state council, the People's Bank and other agencies are learning the rudiments of running an international currency. The West needs to guard against hubris or arrogance. Pivotal moments in the history of reserve currencies backed by centuries of capitalist development — Britain's departure from the gold standard in 1931, the U.S. break with gold in 1971, drastic U.S. monetary tightening after 1979 or Germany's disruptive policies on the Deutsche mark in the European post-1990 currency upheavals — are hardly models of smooth management.

While there is no doubt that a shrunken Sears will be more viable than the larger entity which struggled to turn a profit, we remain extremely pessimistic about the chain's future, wrote Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. In our view, Sears exits this process with almost as many problems as it had when it entered bankruptcy protection. In essence, its hand has not changed and the cards it holds are not winning ones.

As a result, my husband and I suffer the same affliction. We were given occasionally some pocket change to buy treats, candy, chips, sodas, etc. This is the only time money would cross our fingertips, and it would be gone within minutes to an hour.

After its shares were bruised badly in morning trading, Intel said in the early afternoon it was working on updating its chip instructions via firmware updates and that software vendors like Microsoft and Linux developers such as Red Hat Inc. US:RHT were working on software updates. Countermeasures will work on Meltdown, but one such approach, which would be to disable out-of-order execution, would devastate performance, the researchers wrote. Indeed, Intel said that the patches will slow down performance anywhere from 3% to 30%.

This was my personal version of various keep the change savings apps and programs that round up purchase amounts. It was not a spend to save idea, because I was not trying to spend money in order to put a buck in the jar. That kind of fake savings effort gets people in trouble.
As for the second promotion Disney announced Wednesday, which is open to any traveler, the savings are relatively paltry.

Selling too early. When you're younger and you start making more money you start investing more. I flip houses and I bought this one house [in East Hampton] right before the market crashed in 2008 and it was sort of a multimillion-dollar purchase. Instead of holding it — which I probably could have — I got really nervous and I sold it. I said, 'I have to sell it; everything is falling apart.' Now it's double its value of what I paid for it because it was such a great location and it was the right spot. I kind of knew it in the back of my head, but I haven't forgotten that lesson: sometimes if you don't know what to do, do nothing. Sit the market out a little. Unless you really need it to pay your mortgage, it will come back. It may not come back in the exact same time you want, but the market will come back, especially real estate. It was a dumb decision. [I lost] probably $200,000. It's an expensive lesson.

That doesn't mean that we set new speculative-market records every day. Stock-price movements tend to approximate what economists call random walks, with prices reflecting small daily shocks that are about equally likely to be positive or negative. And random walks tend to go through long periods when they are well below their previous peak; the chance of setting a record soon is negligible, given how far prices would have to rise. But once they do reach a new record high, prices are far more likely to set additional records – probably not on consecutive days, but within a short interval.
Security breaches at the federal government or large corporate levels tend to attract the most media attention, but cities, counties and states across the U.S. also grapple with questions of how to secure sprawling networks, which connect agencies with vastly different purposes, sizes and budgets, against cybercriminals.

But it is not just Trump's proposed tax changes that plausibly affect market psychology. The U.S. has never had a president like him. Not only is he an actor, like Ronald Reagan; he is also a motivational writer and speaker, a brand name in real estate, and a tough deal maker. If he ever reveals his financial information, or if his family is able to use his influence as president to improve its bottom line, he might even prove to be successful in business.

All the Money in the World is reflecting old money, whereas Molly's Game is reflecting new money. The dot-com billionaires, rappers, movie stars and their world of wealth is different to someone who got rich from doing oil deals half a century ago. So, both movies might be about money but the characters who have that wealth are very different.
FactSet publishes a blended growth percentage change for earnings per share for the S&P 500, representing a blend of year-over-year growth of actual results already reported and the average estimates of surveyed analysts of upcoming results.
The availability heuristic is a mental shortcut that causes people to rely on recent examples that come to mind when evaluating certain concepts. I think there's some of that going on in this instance because of the constant drumbeat of stories on the popularity of index funds and ETFs. People don't realize that active management is still the dominant force in the markets.
And you will find – you will be at 11,779 within minutes because Fulton County is totally corrupt and so is she totally corrupt. And they're going around playing you and laughing at you behind your back, Brad. Whether you know it or not, they're laughing at you. And you've taken a state that's a Republican state and you've made it almost impossible for a Republican to win because of cheating, because they cheated like nobody has ever cheated before.

PRESIDENT TRUMP: No, we do have a way but I don't want to get into it –
Among the biggest obstacle to people's ability to create a career they love is a preconceived notion of where they should be and what they should do. But success doesn't have to follow a scripted narrative that says college grads need to find a job that relates to their major and stay on a singular career path over their lifetime.
Blockchain technology isn't just for little-known companies trying to make a name for themselves, or struggling former blue-chip companies trying to rebrand themselves as innovative. It is the real deal, as a number of household names have been boarding the blockchain bandwagon.

The Republicans, not surprisingly, are fighting and will continue to fight against all of the structural reforms that would democratize this country, and that would thereby vastly reduce their chances of holding national power. Together with the policy differences between the parties, this reality will remain the long-run, material basis for an increasing partisan divide, until these structural problems are resolved.

A few months later, AQR's Cliff Asness, himself a quant fund manager, wrote a post-mortem for Institutional Investor to try to get to the bottom of what happened and come to the defense of his style of investing. One line he wrote has stuck with me ever since:

I am optimistic that in the second half of this year, the economy, and, frankly, life, should begin to move back to something resembling normal. GDP growth should be strong in the second half of the year and through 2022, before a light tapering in 2023, Harker said.

Example #4: This wasn't a matter of simply always being bullish. I also made a contrarian call suggesting caution in an Aug. 27 column, because investors were too bullish and insiders were cautious. By Sept. 22, the S&P 500 had fallen 7%.

This should go without saying, but I didn't forecast that monster rally. (Who expects their investments to rise by a factor of 30?) I didn't want to invest in Netflix because I had analyzed and found value in its price-to-earnings and enterprise-value-to-sales ratios; I couldn't have even defined those terms back then. I was simply a voracious movie watcher, and Netflix's DVD-by-mail system was not only more convenient than Blockbuster (remember Blockbuster?), but came with a vastly superior selection.

New year, same old Goldman Sachs GS, -1.25% . Capital reported in October last year about Goldman's madcap stunt where interns were confronted with a shortage of chairs. The investment bank is still going to desperate lengths to appeal to the next generation of trader whizzkids. Surprised interns on existing Goldman Sachs programs have been asked by the bank if any of their friends can fill slots on its newer work experience placements. An email from Kerry Vanslembrouck, vice president of graduate recruitment at Goldman Sachs, seen by Capital, informs interns the bank is engaging in some very direct marketing. She asks if the young recipients know any students studying correlated courses who can take part in our first internship program in consumer and commercial banking (Marcus)… their profile requirements are rather different to our broader divisions.

Sometimes it's disappointing, but in the big scheme of things it's great because you get hired because other people respect your work. They don't hire you because you're flavor of the month. Well, they do a bit but not compared to other elements of the movie business.

11. Get smarter about your credit score. Malani says you should check out your credit score using Creditwise from CapitalOne (you don't have to be a CapitalOne customer to use it). It shows you your credit score, why your score is where it is, and simulates how decisions like applying for a new loan might impact your score. It also has fraud alerts to let you know if someone is trying to use your personal information. If your score is low, here's a guide to boost it.

You could do that, but a judge is likely to notice your sudden generous payments towards your mortgage and car loan, and could even penalize you for them. That's the kind of surreptitious action that has gone against others years after the fact. In 1996, a California woman won $1.3 million in the lottery and filed for divorce 11 days later. She didn't tell her husband or anyone else about her windfall, and two years later her husband found out about it (they always do) and sued her. Superior Court Judge Richard Denner ruled that she acted out of fraud or malice and awarded her husband all of her winnings. Had she been honest, they both would have walked away with half.
If Gerwig were to win, she would be the second woman in Oscar history to win the best director title, and Peele would be the first African American.
A New York Times story published last year said President Trump consumes a dozen Diet Cokes every day.

Other senior Fed officials also spoke on Friday. Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said the economy looked quite healthy, echoing remarks from other members of the FOMC.
CLETA MITCHELL: I will say, Mr. Secretary, one of the things that we have requested – and we – what we said was, and if you look at – if you read our petition, it said that we took the names and birth years, and you know, we had certain information available to us. We have asked from your office for records that only you have. And so we said there's a universe of people who have the same name and same birth year and died, but we don't have the records that you have. And one of the things that we have been suggesting formally and informally for weeks now is to try – is for you to make available to us the records that would be necessary to confirm – (inaudible 30:46) –

The kicker missed a late 43-yard field goal that would have won Sunday's wild-card-round game against the Philadelphia Eagles, ending his overachieving team's bid to advance in the playoffs and toward its first Super Bowl appearance since 2007. The missed field goal has already been called among [the] most brutal in NFL playoff history. The kick looked like a winner until its leftward drift resulted in its hitting the upright, then the crossbar, drawing gasps from the crowd.
If we fail to establish and maintain adequate internal controls, we could suffer material misstatements in our financial statements and fail to meet our reporting obligations, which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. This could limit our access to capital markets, adversely affect our results of operations and lead to a decline in the trading price of the ADSs, says the prospectus.

The lack of real interest in investing in the future by younger generations is due to the confusion caused in trying to put away for tomorrow by these traditional financial channels. Interest rates are near 0% from banks; there's no return to be had on bonds, all while things like rent, tuition cost keep climbing faster than the rate of inflation.
Another device, Snuza Hero, attaches to a child's diaper and monitors the baby's abdominal movements to track breathing.

Real estate becomes particularly compelling when framed against higher inflation. For example, the 10-year Treasury TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.696% currently yields about 2.5%. If inflation over the next decade averages more than that, those investing in the 10-year today will be guaranteed to lose money. To put that in context, consider that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) over the last 12 months rose 2.1%; it won't take much of an uptick in inflation for a 10-year Treasury purchased today to produce a negative real return.
Trump vowed to ramp up spending on infrastructure, including roads, bridges, airports, the electrical grid and other elements. Trump's pledges to boost infrastructure investment were credited as a driver of the postelection stock-market rally.

Gradient Investments is a registered investment adviser based in Arden Hills, Minn., with about $1.3 billion in assets under management for affiliated advisers. The Gradient 50 strategy, one of several strategies Binger and his colleagues pursue, seeks to outperform the benchmark S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% by selecting stocks of what they consider high quality U.S. companies, and where dividend yields exceed that of the index. They will sell stocks that have become expensive relative to earnings or cash flow and seek opportunities to buy shares of companies that have temporarily fallen out of favor with the market.
Example #2: A group of five contrarian great outdoors names I picked with help from money manager Eric Marshall at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas in a May 14 column were up 112.7% by the end of the year. That was more than three times the 31.7% gain in the S&P 500, and almost double the 59.6% gain in the Russell 2000, an apt comparison since our five names are mid-cap stocks.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, there's no way they could – then they're incompetent. They're either dishonest or incompetent, OK? There's only two answers: dishonesty or incompetence. There's just no way. Look, there's no way. And on the other thing that I said, too, there's no way – I mean, there's no way that these things could have been – you know, you have all these different people that voted but they don't live in Georgia anymore. What was that number, Cleta? That was a pretty good number, too.

Opponents are optimistic that President-elect Biden's incoming administration could stop the rule from taking effect and eventually rescind it.

For its part, the Nasdaq Composite has outperformed the S&P 500 in nine of the past 12 outings.

Cyberattacks are growing in number and scale. Every month, New York City faces about 80 million cyberthreats, ranging from phishing attacks to attacks meant to overwhelm websites that are usually caught by firewalls. Iranian hackers broke into the control system of a dam 20 miles outside of New York City in 2013, The Wall Street Journal reported recently, showing how infrastructure can become a target.
The consensus is that 2016 will be an outlier for advertising revenue, because of political and Olympic ad spending. Hargreaves reckons that ad revenue should accelerate, with relatively easy year-over-year comparisons for the first two quarters and an expected 1% increase to total ad revenue from the Summer Olympics. The year-over-year comparisons get more difficult after the first half of the year, however, and he expects live viewership will continue to decline.

Starboard has long sought changes at the Internet company and on Wednesday it said investors have lost all confidence in the management team and the board. Most of Yahoo's current value stems from its investment in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

Of course, if the economy evolves in a materially different fashion or if risks emerge, including those to financial stability, the Fed would be prepared to respond appropriately, the Cleveland Fed president said.

There's no change in the federal income tax treatment of divorce-related payments that are required by divorce agreements that are executed before 2019. However, for these payments to qualify as deductible alimony, payers must still satisfy the time-honored list of specific tax-law requirements. If those requirements are met, alimony payments can be written off above-the-line on the payer's federal income tax return. That means the payer does not have to itemize to benefit from the deduction. Payment recipients must include alimony payments that are required by divorce agreements executed before 2019 in their taxable income. So this is a continuation of business as usual.

Let's assume that your income is $150,000/year, or $12,500/month. Your employer offers a very generous 5% match and you are excited to contribute as much as you can to the plan as fast as you can so you set up a 15% contribution. Each month, $1,875 will be deducted from your paycheck (15% of $12,500) and your employer will match $625 (5% of $12,500) for a total contribution of $2,500 a month ($1,875 + $625).

For example, we estimate that if there had been no redistributive shifts since 1980, which mostly went in favor of shareholders, the level of the stock market in 2012 would have been only 56% of its observed value. However, these changes do not always favor shareholders. Case in point: the period from 1960 to 1980 saw substantial gains for workers at the expense of lower stock returns.
In plain English, Bank of America is a buy if the stock should fall.
In a recent survey of retirement plan participants by American Century Investments, 90% would tell their younger selves to save more.

PRESIDENT TRUMP: Did you ever check?
There are so many dirty deals that happen before people file for divorce. I recently heard of a case where a husband took $1 million equity out of the home that he lived in with his wife (his name was on the deed) shortly before they filed for divorce. That's the kind of paper trail that leads all the way back to a disgruntled judge in divorce court. I've had so many letters in recent months from or about people who want to pull a fast one: The wife who wanted to disinherit her stepchildren in the event that her husband of one year dies, and even a psychotherapist who wanted to be in cahoots with his client to cheat the insurance company.

A record position size, both long and short, carries an increased risk of a correction, said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, in a note.
Your future tax bracket matters, as well. If you anticipate your bracket will drop in retirement — which happens for most people, according to experts — making deductible contributions to individual retirement accounts now is a good plan, because the tax breaks from those contributions likely will outweigh any taxes you'll pay on future withdrawals of the IRAs. If you expect your marginal tax rate to be higher in retirement, making nondeductible contributions to a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, could be the better plan.

Pity about the panic on stock markets — so what else is new? — but financial practitioners and observers should really get wise about the yuan.

We had at least 18,000 that's on tape – we had them counted very painstakingly – 18,000 voters having to do with Ruby Freeman. She's a vote scammer, a professional vote scammer and hustler, Ruby Freeman.

Everybody fled the area. And then they came back – Ruby Freeman, her daughter, and a few people. There were no Republican poll watchers. Actually, there were no Democrat poll watchers. I guess they were them. But there were no Democrats, either. And there was no law enforcement. Late in the morning, they went – early in the morning, they went to the table with the black robe – the black shield and they pulled out the votes. Those votes were put there a number of hours before. The table was put there – I think it was – Brad, you would know. It was probably eight hours or seven hours before, and then it was stuffed with votes. They weren't in an official voter box. They were in what looked to be suitcases or trunks – suitcases, but they weren't in voter boxes.

In the minds of the brewers making these deals — and the Brewers Association — private-equity money enables brewers to expand and experiment without giving up their independence. In the eyes of brewers who've refused private-equity deals, that's just a good way to get new labels slapped on your beer, your distribution and production increased, your portfolio streamlined and your brewery sold again within five years. It's certainly an alternative to selling to another brewer but, as even brewers with employee shareholders like Full Sail have discovered, it's no guarantee. It'll be interesting to see not only how the latest round of PE-owned brewers fares, but who takes PE money next.

For many years, Form 1065 partnership returns have been due three and a half months after the end of the partnership tax year. Ditto for returns of LLCs that are treated as partnerships for tax purposes. So for a calendar-year partnership or LLC, the filing deadline was April 15 of the following year (adjusted for weekends and holidays). However, recent legislation changed the deal. For partnership and LLC tax years beginning in 2016 and beyond, the Form 1065 due date is moved up by one month, to two and a half months after the close of the tax year. So the deadline for 2016 returns of calendar-year partnerships and LLCs is March 15, 2017. Six-month extensions to September 15, 2017 can be obtained by filing Form 7004 (Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File Certain Business Income Tax, Information, and Other Returns) by the un-extended due date (March 15 for a calendar-year partnership or LLC).

Likewise, lifesaving treatments for those with COVID-19 will not come quickly. Treatments that initially met with great fanfare—remdesivir, convalescent plasma, and dexamethasone—have since proven to have little to no effect on overall morbidity or mortality. And treatments with greater therapeutic potential, like monoclonal antibodies, are still many months away, and may ultimately prove too costly to be made widely available.
The stock GE, -2.65% soared 4.5% Tuesday, the biggest one-day percentage gain since Oct. 5, 2015, to snap a six-session losing streak. The stock had closed Monday at $16.17, the lowest close since Dec. 2, 2011.
GE says there are approximately 7 million long-term care policies in force across the industry but its market share is only about 4%. The entire industry, said Zanin, is experiencing more claims than originally estimated— more people are making claims and for a longer time than expected. Large numbers of policyholders who purchased long-term care insurance years ago are now reaching age 80 and over, the prime claim-paying period.

Since our successful pilot text, Walmart has continued to expand our progress in testing blockchain technology for food traceability and transparency. In August 2017, we joined nine other global food retailers in a blockchain consortium in the U.S. Three weeks ago, we announced with our partners JD and Tsinghua University in China to launch a blockchain alliance in China.
The research, just published by the journal Current Biology, may not come as shock to anyone who has ever attempted to reason with a highly partisan friend, relative or coworker — or to anyone witnessing political debates on Twitter TWTR, -1.47% or Facebook FB, +2.02% .
Consider the stupendous increase since mid-March in the wealth of America's 614 billionaires. The additional $931 billion they amassed did not result from any innovation or ingenuity that generated additional profits. They got richer in their sleep, so to speak, as central banks flooded the financial system with manufactured money that caused asset prices, and thus billionaires' wealth, to skyrocket.
My stock of choice was Netflix Inc. NFLX, -3.75% , which was at the time known more for its little red DVD envelopes than for binge watching, a term that wouldn't enter the lexicon for several more years. I started setting aside money, and at some point mentioned the plan to my dad, a retired accountant and savings junkie. To my surprise, he strongly cautioned me against it, and convincingly enough that I took his advice and bought some very boring index funds instead. Here's what happened in the meantime:
A modest improvement is not enough. Large businesses in particular don't change investment plans quickly, and many might wait to see what kind of tax cuts or regulatory reduction the Trump White House has in the works.

Major proposals by the Biden campaign would raise $1.6 trillion to $1.9 trillion over a decade from corporations, $1 trillion to $1.2 trillion from high earners through the income tax, and $800 billion to $1 trillion from Social Security payroll taxes on high-wage earners. Biden also supports a fee on banks, which we believe will raise $100 billion, tax credits for renters and first-time homebuyers that we estimate will cost $300 billion, and an increase of the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, which we estimate will cost $100 billion.

McLaren, the supercar manufacturer spawned out of Woking, has released more details about its latest, much-anticipated 250 mph roadster. Tycoons, who have already dug deep to splash out £1.75m for its Speedtail, can choose from a range of bespoke enhancements including a tasteful 18-karat gold badge. The vehicle also distinguishes itself from the competition by coming replete with three front seats – the main hot seat, along with space for a brace of passengers, one either side. One chauvinist petrolhead views this innovation as space for both the wife and the mistress.
Low productivity and slower population growth are effectively caps on how fast the U.S. can grow. Getting businesses to ratchet up investment and drawing more people into the workforce at a time when businesses complain of a shortage of skilled labor are no easy tasks.

The catch here is that not every large insider purchase is bullish. You need a system that weeds out the best signals. I've developed one in two decades of studying insiders. I can't reveal my entire system. But one example: Look for groups of insiders buying in concert known as cluster buys.
This past year, the focus was on rebuilding retirement savings after the divorce, and I put a plan in place in January involving regular deposits and increased set-asides which ultimately led to meeting the savings goal without feeling financial pain.
We used to think, with good reason, that globalization had defanged national governments. Presidents cowered before the bond markets. Prime ministers ignored their country's poor but never Standard & Poor's SPGI, +0.45% . Finance ministers behaved like Goldman Sachs's GS, +0.95% knaves and the International Monetary Fund's satraps. Media moguls, oilmen, and financiers, no less than left-wing critics of globalized capitalism, agreed that governments were no longer in control.
The best advice for now is to never save any passwords in your browser or cache, and take advantage of any and all software and firmware updates from Intel, Microsoft and other providers as soon as possible. The discovery of these vulnerabilities are also likely to affect future microprocessor design, and the performance of data centers, so this story will not go away anytime soon.

There is nothing magic about a gym — and certainly nothing magic about a gym you don't go to, Stanforth says. Any kind of movement has value. Here are a few ways to get moving:
Decide what you are willing to cut out of your life and what needs to stay — and be honest with yourself. In a story about her own no spend year for the New York Times, novelist Ann Patchett said she set a rule that she could buy anything at the grocery stores, including the occasional frivolous purchase like flowers, but couldn't give in to her desire to shop at other stores. This gave her some flexibility, she wrote. I wanted a plan that was serious but not so draconian that I would bail out in February, she said.
The company still allows authorized users on its accounts, as do Chase, Citi and American Express. Unlike a cosigner, an authorized user of an account isn't liable for paying his or her bill; that responsibility falls to the primary account holder.

Bringing up the rear on the overall list, the Whole30 diet came in at number 38, scoring OK in terms of short-term weight loss but lagging in the long-term.

Netflix is trying to protect its margins with a $1 monthly price increase to $10.99 for over 50 million U.S. subscribers at the end of 2017. The company has made clear that the move is not the last, either, as it needs more cash for more programming spend.
IFX confirmed demand is normalizing and channel inventories are largely back to normal levels—we view these comments as reassuring, said Amit B Harchandani, analyst at Citi, in a note to clients.
A weaker yen would make sense given government bond yields of other developed nations are rising, the analysts added. Still, we would highlight that the yen remains very cheap from a long-term valuation perspective and [currency] markets continue to price in BOJ policy remaining very dovish for the foreseeable future. In that respect, there is risk that, if Mr. Kuroda's comments are seen as signaling a less dovish trajectory ahead, the yen could strengthen.

U.S. home prices rose 0.5% in November, representing a 6.3% gain from the same month in 2014, CoreLogic said Tuesday.
Make sure you both can handle working together. Brianna Marshall, a Las Vegas-based licensed marriage and family therapist, urged having a frank conversation about whether your relationship can weather the potential conflicts. We know ourselves: Are we able to leave it here at work and not have this interrupt our personal family life? she told Moneyish. If we can't do that, then maybe we shouldn't be doing this. And that's OK — it's not a weakness of any sort.
Earlier this week, a separate report examined mortality for the U.S. and other wealthy nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development for children from birth to age 19 from 1961 to 2010. From 2001 to 2010 the risk of death in the U.S. was 76% greater for infants and 57% greater for children ages 1 to 19, according to the study, Child Mortality In The US And 19 OECD Comparator Nations: A 50-Year Time-Trend Analysis, published in Health Affairs journal.
 Those who normally protest that money does not grow on trees, that governments must let the chips fall where they may, held their tongue. 
Rosengren: That's accurate. Financial conditions have not tightened significantly with the increase in short-term interest rates. Part of that is the stock market has gone up quite a bit and exchange rates and some of these other variables are being affected by a stimulative fiscal policy. So even while we're tightening with monetary policy, in some sense we have a more stimulative fiscal policy and over the course of the year people didn't know what, if any, tax change would occur. And now we know a tax change has actually occurred, so we now have a stimulative environment from the fiscal policy side that we didn't necessarily know was going to happen, so short-term interest rates have tightened but the long rate TMUBMUSD30Y, 2.417% is a little less than 2.5% right now. I would expect over time that it will gradually increase as we unwind our balance sheet and as it becomes clear that inflation really is picking up towards our 2% goal and that the tight labor markets are starting to have an impact on wages and prices over time.
What lessons can we learn from this experience? One is that we shouldn't be surprised if our politicians will wait until the last minute to make necessary changes to the Social Security system. If so, then we probably should assume that Social Security's current payout rules will stay largely or completely in place for the next 15 years.
Miller responded that the board assesses KPMG every year. There's no change planned at this time, but obviously that's something we look at every year.

Do you have one final piece of advice for all of us golfing investors?
Our first step in this research was to consider which factors might be responsible for movement in the stock market in aggregate. Each firm that is represented in the stock market index produces a stream of revenues. After paying a portion to workers, the rest is left over as profits that can be distributed to shareholders as dividends. The stock price will rise whenever the rewards to the shareholders increase, which can be caused by one of three separate forces:
Right now, the stock has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 100 and a trailing price-to-earnings of about 200. For the record, I don't think a valuation reading this high is categorically a bad thing. But I do think it needs to be justified — and in the case of Netflix, it isn't.
They're hoping to avoid situations akin to the 2003 blackout in the Northeast, when power failures left several states and New York City dark for hours or longer. While that blackout was caused by a power surge, security and IT experts fear that criminals have the capability — and local governments have the vulnerabilities — to launch attacks of similar scope, hampering their ability to provide public safety, transportation and other key services and creating wide-ranging ripple effects.

5. Move your savings online, says Malani. Most savings accounts are paying out very low rates right now so you want to earn as much money as you can. That's why she likes online banks like Ally and Marcus. They pay a higher rate of interest on their regular savings account than a typical brick-and-mortar bank, she says.
Bad weather and alcohol are a bad combination
Moving your mom in with you seems to run counter to your desire to maintain healthy boundaries, says Anne Tumlinson, founder of Daughterhood, a Washington, DC-based organization that provides information and resources to people caring for aging parents. That's not necessary in New York. Additionally, your mother is already obviously on Medicaid so you don't need to worry about whether your mother will qualify, which is usually a huge thing given people's assets and incomes that usually need to be spent-down first.
There is strength in embracing everything that makes you unique. So, if you're ready to bring your authentic, whole self to work, here are four essential tips to get started:
9. Save with purpose, says Malani. Rather than have one big savings account for everything, you should have different accounts for different goals: In 2019, put purpose behind your savings. Start by deciding what you're saving for (i.e. trip to Portugal, new West Elm couch, etc.). Then set up a separate savings account for each thing or experience you're saving for. Finally, nickname the savings account in accordance with its designated purpose. You'll be much less likely to 'borrow' money from your Portugal vacay account than just a general savings account, she explains.
I have brought it up to her, but she acts like it is temporary. She says that she has no reason to save money until she is out of school and treats every dollar she earns at her summer job as disposable income. When I say anything, she acts like I'm being dramatic. Because of her habits, basically anytime she talks about buying something new, it drives me nuts.

Ask a financial planner for help and they are likely to say to take the payout, because you can put the money to work and get a better result in the end; they're right, so long as they're also not giving stupid advice about what you invest in when trying to generate those superior returns.

One sister now probably faces a big inheritance: the farm and equipment. I was told by several people that dad has me written out of his will. Everything will go to at least one sister, if not both.

Should the Democrats prevail, the US Senate would be evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, granting liberals de facto control of the chamber as Dem Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would be the tie-breaker on votes. The House of Representatives will continue to be ruled by a Democratic majority for the next two years. With Democrat Joe Biden in the White House, the Dems would control the executive and legislative branches for the first time since 2010.
Booze has also been found to damage DNA, according to new research partly funded by Cancer Research U.K. and published in Nature this week.

I only had about two and a half weeks from when I officially got the word, says JJ Lane, a former investment banker and a contestant on the 11th season of The Bachelorette, in an interview with MarketWatch.

But she realized then that she wanted a career that would give her more family time than real estate and its round-the-clock schmoozing. And her focus on her daughter's nutrition inspired her to become a certified nutritionist. This led to founding Nibbles By Nic, which helps busy women build kitchen confidence through menu planning and organizational techniques. I thought, 'How can I carve out a niche for myself that is somewhat unique?' And meal planning and organizing for busy women came to the forefront, she said.

Another study published in Psychological Science further backs this up. Participants found motivation from imagining a fresh start in the form of moving in to a new apartment. They were asked to imagine their new digs and also ranked their level of motivation to pursue their goals. Those who imagined that the move was their first one in nine years (versus an annual event) were more motivated to make progress on their goals.

So I guess with all of it being said, Brad, it's – the bottom line – and provisional ballots, again, you know, you'll have to tell me about the provisional ballots. But we have a lot of people that were complaining that they weren't able to vote because they were already voted for. And these are great people, and you know, they were shell shocked.

If your business pays nonemployee compensation aggregating to $600 or more to a single payee (payment recipient) in a calendar year, the business must file a Form 1099-MISC to report the payments. Similarly, employers must report wages paid to employees on Form W-2. Previously, these forms were required to be filed with the IRS and Social Security Administration (SSA) by the last day of February or by March 31 if filed electronically. Copies were required to be supplied to payees and employees by January 31 of the following year. Recent legislation moved up the deadline for filing with the IRS and SSA to Jan. 31 of the following year. So the IRS/SSA filing deadline for Forms 1099-MISC and W-2 that show payments made last year is Jan. 31, 2017. This rapidly approaching due date applies whether you submit the forms on paper or electronically.
To understand why, imagine you have $27,000 in itemized deductions, including $17,000 in interest from your 4% mortgage. It might seem like paying all that mortgage interest is sharply reducing your tax bill and hence your after-tax interest cost might be closer to 3%, assuming you're in the new 22% or 24% marginal tax bracket.

For example, a specific net-worth or retirement-savings balance could be the concrete goal, as could saving a certain amount of cash to pay for a big-ticket item without relying on credit. Broad, generic goals could run from simply increasing savings to decreasing debt.
• International Business Machines Corp. IBM, +0.80% has flung itself full-bore into blockchain. In 2017, the company created a division wholly devoted to researching use cases for blockchain technology. IBM has 1,500 employees who focus on blockchain and over 400 different client engagements and solutions, said Marie Wieck, general manager of blockchain at IBM. This is probably the most interest I've seen in an individual technology since the early days of the internet and e-business, Wieck said. Test pilots the company has explored include a collaboration with Stellar.org and KlickEx Group to make it possible to perform cross-border payments on the blockchain and a partnership with Maersk to digitize the paper trail associated with global shipping.
The term Green New Deal refers to a stimulus program backed by many progressives that intends to address both climate change and economic inequality.

As a result, all investors are prone to the same damaging, subconscious techniques embraced by your dogmatic brother-in-law during a political argument. These include sticking to a decision just because you've made it, dismissing data because it goes against your opinions, and surrounding yourself with people who agree with you.
Before the holidays, we talked about how U.S. mortality improvements have fallen behind other high-income countries so that the United States is now at the bottom of that group in terms of life expectancy. It is also interesting to look at how the rate of mortality improvement in the United States has varied over time.
The support break will occur if and when the index falls below its August low of 1,867, to the nearest penny, wrote the bearish Michael Kahn in his Getting Technical column in Barrons.com.
Here are five easy steps you can take to make yourself — and your finances — less hackable.
First, Iran's leaders are convinced that global geopolitics is a zero-sum game — a belief shared with Russian President Vladimir Putin. (That commonality perhaps explains the close alliance that has formed between Russia and Iran.) Second — and more dangerous — Iran's leaders believe that they have a God-given right to unite Shia Muslims under a single caliphate. The result is a hostile regime that views its neighbors' success as a threat — and is willing to wage war over it.
Wald believes the recent spate of weakness is the cyclical bear market waking up in the midst of a secular bull market and suggested that the selling pressure will soon work itself out.
On Wednesday, Disney released the details of its latest free dining promotion for Summer 2019. The deal gives travelers booking a stay at select Walt Disney World in Florida hotels free access to the Disney Dining Plan, which pays for meals at the theme parks and resorts around the complex. Under the deal, guests who pay full price for a room essentially eat for free (although the deal doesn't include gratuities.)

The ECB's [minutes] was indeed upbeat but was also clear that inflation continued to undershoot, and that is was committed to the sequence of finishing asset purchases and then, after some time, lifting rates, said currency strategists at Brown Brothers Harriman in a Monday note.
Altaba, though, will do virtually nothing but hold these assets, as what is known as an investment company. Because there is little decision-making involved in being basically a ticker symbol, Altaba does not need a full board of directors, so it will slash the size of the current Yahoo board in half. Among those who will no longer be on the board are Mayer, who could still be acting as the head of Yahoo under Verizon leadership, and Yahoo co-founder David Filo.
This feeling of a new beginning appears to empower and make it easier to leave our past self and failures behind and embrace our new potential for success moving forward, researchers surmised. A new year represents a new chance to start over and try again.
I've often worked with first-time directors and they're often very unsure and that results in bad decisions because they're scared of things. But Aaron was good at trusting my opinion.
The day started on a bearish tilt — global asset manager BlackRock, in an October research report, describes global market sentiment in late August weighing bearishly on stocks. Even before the markets opened in the U.S. that day, global equity markets were down 3% to 5% and the e-mini S&P 500 future was limit down 5% in pre-market trading. Investors responded to these global macro concerns with aggressive orders to sell, including four times the number of market orders observed on an average trading day, according to New York Stock Exchange data.

Ultimately it's better to be talked out of a good investment than talked into a bad one, which means I view this missed opportunity as more of a what if scenario than a decision that put me on the path to ruin. And so, while I'm reluctant to admit this in print, where it can be easily pulled out at the next family reunion, it should be said: my dad was wrong, but he was also correct.

It's not enough just to plan and take the first step. Once you have your game plan, follow it. Think of your New Year's resolution the way you would a business plan, says Gomez. It does no good to have one if you don't use it. Set manageable goals, include some rewards, find an accountability partner and keep track of your progress. This enables you to stay motivated and get consistent results, she adds.
If the account requires personal information, simply give the bare minimum amount required, said Alan Brill, a senior managing director in Kroll's Cyber Security practice. Recognize you are not under oath there, you don't have to tell the truth, he said. Many devices don't have GPS services and there is no reason to give it your real address. People have to think about the consequences. Users can even invent false names, ages, dates of birth, and other data to minimize risk in the case that the website is hacked.

Yields started the session higher after Bloomberg News reported that a U.S. delegation would visit Beijing for a new round of trade talks on Monday and Tuesday. It would mark the first face-to-face negotiations since President Donald Trump's meeting with China's leader Xi Jinping in early December.
With the record-fast development, testing, approval, and rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, a fifth secret was revealed: science depends on state aid, and its effectiveness is oblivious to its public standing. Many commentators have waxed lyrical about markets' capacity to respond quickly to humanity's needs. But the irony should be lost on no one: the administration of the most anti-science U.S. president ever—a president who ignored, intimidated, and mocked experts even during the worst pandemic in a century—allocated $10 billion to ensure that scientists had the resources they needed.

The Biden tax plan would increase the maximum refundable child credit to $4,000 for one qualifying child or $8,000 for two or more qualifying children. Families making between $125,000 and $400,000 would receive reduced credits. Apparently, the same rules would apply to an enhanced credit for expenses to care for qualifying dependents.
Average monthly rent for an apartment in San Antonio will run you $1,226 (estimated as recently as December 2017). The price of a home in the area is $232,000.

We had struggled with budgeting for years. We'd accumulate credit-card debt and pay it off. It was a vicious cycle. I can remember starting multiple times to cut back and then it would feel like deprivation. Or three or four weeks without eating out felt like centuries and if you got that far, then you really had to go out to eat to celebrate not going out to eat.

Food — and that sounds strange coming from the CEO of a modeling agency. I was just in Norway and I wound up at TGI Fridays and I sat with a friend of mine at the bar and had a pint of beer and mozzarella sticks. It was one of the best days I've had in a long time. To me it's about the place and the people — I won't spend a lot of money on food.
Thirty-two states already have their own laws against surprise billing, Kelmar noted. The federal law will cover the remainder and, importantly, apply to healthcare plans answering to federal laws that states cannot regulate.

Given how common it is for companies to get hacked these days, this is a simple step that can prevent hackers from stealing a consumer's information and using it to open fraudulent credit accounts.
As you may have expected, the announced changes don't tackle the real problem of Facebook keeping its users hooked. Instead they ensure that the dopamine-driven feedback loop is even more effective. In short, Facebook aims to make your newsfeed more interesting by reducing the visibility of professionally made content and increasing the visibility for posts made by your friends and family. While this means that brands will have to adjust (which may result in the creation of fake profiles and group spamming) to get their content out, what's more important is that newsfeeds will become more relevant and, thus, more addictive to users.
The rule is trying to manage patient price expectations just like a new law that bars surprise out-of-network medical bills. That law was part of a $900 billion COVID-19 rescue package Trump signed last week.
Readers of The Moneyologist advice column couldn't seem to get enough of letters from stepmothers, who often appeared to be looking out for their own interests. (Stepchildren didn't always come off so well either, it should be said.)

Tell your girlfriend how your family's history changed your outlook and then explain how her profligate spending makes you feel. (Maybe don't say profligate.) Better to say how it makes you feel rather than attributing any value judgments to her behavior.

The traditional free dining promotion has some significant limitations. The promotion is only available for certain dates and hotels in May through August, and guests must stay at least four nights to qualify. And because travelers with free dining must also pay full price for their rooms and Park Hopper tickets, they could actually lose out on possibly better savings through getting a separate discount on their hotel room from Disney, buying their park tickets through an authorized re-seller or staying at a non-Disney hotel, said Tom Bricker, who owns DisneyTouristBlog.com. You can do a number of things that can save you money, Bricker said.

I also include her on my family cellphone plan. I bring her household items and groceries on every visit.
Fed officials generally said that substantial progress was not based on specific numerical criteria or thresholds.
Rosengren: Just having the data from the spring time roll off – we had the wireless prices changes, there were a couple other changes in prices that I think were tied to individual markets that really were not tied to overall inflation and so I think once we get to the spring time we're going to be seeing numbers much closer to 2%. In addition, we have pretty tight labor markets already, and if we continue to grow faster than potential, those labor markets are going to get even tighter. If we start seeing unemployment rates below 4%, that's a pretty tight labor market. You're already hearing lots of stories, I think, in some of the tight markets about the difficulty of getting labor and one way to respond to that is to offer higher wages to try to attract people either in the local market or from outside the local market. These things take time. They don't happen overnight. That's why there are long and variable lags in monetary policy. I do expect that over time it will have that impact. We'll see more wage pressures and we'll see with time more inflation.

There are a few glaring issues facing the TV bundle. First, more and more services are popping up to compete in the over-the-top (OTT), or online subscription video-on-demand space. This gives customers more options for ditching cable bundles for more affordable services with the content they want most. To boot, these OTT platforms are proving they can produce their own quality content: Netflix Inc.

And then there is the recent Christmas ecard sent to interns by Goldman Sachs's campus recruiting division and also seen by Capital. Not content with merely wishing interns the compliments of the festive season, the ecard goes on to inform students that We're looking forward to you joining the [applicable] Analyst class in 2019.

You don't need much of a number because the number that in theory I lost by, the margin would be 11,779. But you also have substantial numbers of people, thousands and thousands, who went to the voting place on November 3rd, were told they couldn't vote – were told they couldn't vote because a ballot had been put in on their name. And you know, that's very, very…very, very sad.

A big change Disney made last year that could benefit guests considering the free-dining offer is that alcoholic beverages are now covered by Disney's dining plans. But this too is a situation where visitors' mileage may vary. For instance, families who plan to spend the bulk of their time at the Magic Kingdom won't see much benefit from the change if they get the quick-service dining plan, because only a few of the theme park's restaurants even serve alcohol. Moreover, travelers who don't typically have big appetites won't get their money's worth if they find themselves skipping meals to take in the attractions. The added value can be illusory, Bricker said.

One man's windfall is another man's slap in the face. This son in South Carolina wrote to say he feels his dad, who passed away from lung cancer, didn't love him as he only left him $10,000. He compared all of the belongings (truck, small boat, his family home) that were left to others. His 12-year-old nephew was left the house. Did his brother pressure his father into doing that? Alas, undue influence and a request to be remembered in a will are hard to prove.
Many commentators have attributed China's success to totalitarianism, but a country's system of government is not really the deciding factor. Far more important is whether political leaders are willing to trade short-term economic pain and quotidian conveniences for the safety of their citizens. In New Zealand and Australia—both vibrant democracies—bold leadership and strong governance brought new infections down almost to zero, and political leaders like New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern were rewarded accordingly at the ballot box.
According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an independent, non-profit, bipartisan public-policy organization based in Washington, D.C. that examines federal budget and fiscal issues, Biden's tax plan would raise $3.35 trillion to $3.67 trillion over a decade if enacted in full starting next year, or 1.3% to 1.4% of gross domestic product.

That's a lot of money to come out of pocket, she said.

For many years, Form 1120 C corporation returns have been due two and a half months after the end of the corporation's tax year. So for a calendar-year corporation, the deadline was March 15 of the following year (adjusted for weekends and holidays). However, recent legislation established new deadlines for corporate returns. For tax years beginning in 2016 and beyond, the Form 1120 due date is generally moved back by a month, to three and a half months after the close of the corporation's tax year, which translates to April 15 (adjusted for weekends and holidays) for a calendar-year corporation. So the filing deadline for 2016 returns of calendar-year corporations is April 18, 2017. Five-month extensions to September 15, 2017 can be obtained by filing Form 7004 by the un-extended due date (April 18 for a calendar-year corporation).

The FBI has been placing more of a focus on connected toys in recent months, said Jim Ivers, the vice president of marketing for the Software Integrity Group at Synopsys. The protection of children is a pretty emotional subject, he said. If child safety starts being compromised and manufacturers don't start looking out for it themselves, the government is going to step in and regulate. Although the FBI recommended parents check the background of the toys they buy their children, he said there is no central location to do that. It comes down to parents taking action regarding each particular toy, he said.

The figure below shows the U.S. age-adjusted mortality rate from 1900 to the present. In 1900, about 28 men out of 1,000 died in a given year; by 2016 that number had dropped to 9. Mortality rates have always been higher for men than for women, although the gap appears to be narrowing in recent years. With the notable exception of the flu pandemic in 1918, mortality rates have generally dropped year after year.
Today's younger workers are more likely to work in nontraditional job settings and more likely to switch jobs than other age groups, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data. The median job tenure among workers age 25 to 34 (2.8 years) is less than one-third of older workers age 55 to 64 (10.1 years). What's more, 55% of jobs held by those ages 18 to 28 lasted less than one year, and 70% of jobs lasted no more than two years. The challenges that come with frequent job changes include not staying long enough to become fully vested in the company 401(k) plan, the failure to roll over their retirement savings into new retirement plans, or forgetting about their account altogether when they change jobs.

To live up to its higher valuation, AMD doesn't have to actually beat Intel, though, it just needs to compete well enough to grow market share from virtually zero and increase revenue.

Also, in the past, guests had access to the standard dining plan during the free-dining promotion if they stayed at moderately priced resorts, where room rates start at $200 per night. But starting last year, guests at these hotels now get the quick-service plan during the free-dining offer, which has less value. Now it's not quite as easy a decision to make, Bricker said. They're not doing this out of some corporate benevolence — they want to increase their occupancy rate.

Kala Pharmaceuticals Inc. KALA, -4.13% shares dropped 8% in extremely heavy morning trade on Friday after the company released results from two late-stage trials for its dry eye therapy KPI-121. KPI-121 had statistically significant results for some but not all endpoints in the two trials, which enrolled about 900 patients each. In particular, the therapy was not statistically significant for the primary symptom endpoint of the second trial, STRIDE 2, measuring ocular discomfort severity change from baseline to day 15. Although we did not achieve statistical significance for the primary symptom endpoint in STRIDE 2, we did observe a strong trend towards a positive treatment effect in symptoms in more symptomatic patients, for which we achieved statistical significance in STRIDE 1, said Mark Iwicki, chief executive of Kala Pharmaceuticals. The company will continue to analyze the results and expects to discuss them with the Food and Drug Administration, he said, noting the company's $114 million cash balance. Kala also emphasized that the therapy was well-tolerated, with the most common side effect being instillation site pain. Dry eye disease, which has symptoms such as chronic pain, dry eyes, eye discomfort and variable vision, is a major market primed for new entrants. Allergan's Restasis AGN, +2.32% has long been a powerhouse dry eye therapy without much competition, bringing in $1.4 billion in revenue for the company in 2016.

Plus, I thought the economy would recover sooner than the crowd expected. As people came around to my view, the group of six insurers in a July 8 column beat the market by advancing 19.6% by year-end, compared with 18.5% for the S&P 500. I think this play still has legs. A group of 10 insurers I put in my stock letter on July 6 was up 29% by the end of the year, compared with 19.4% for the S&P 500.

The problem? Not everyone is saving — or can save — that much toward retirement. Either they're living paycheck to paycheck, don't know about the accounts available to them or simply aren't thinking about the amount of money they'll need in their futures.

Blockchain essentially functions as a decentralized ledger used to record and verify transactions. It is what allows digital currencies to function as a way to exchange value without the participation of a central bank or government. Instead, so-called miners on the blockchain solve complex computational problems to validate transactions on the network, and are rewarded with bitcoin or other such coins. Due to the way such networks are constructed, it is nearly impossible for such transactions to be forged.

In the years ahead, the gain from buying bonds will most likely be less than the interest cost you could avoid by paying down debt. It's hard to be so definitive about stocks, because changes in investor sentiment are such a big driver of annual stock returns. Still, over the next 10 years, you probably won't earn more than 5% or 6% a year from U.S. stocks, barely more than the 4% interest you might avoid by paying off a mortgage.

The refund delay for a return that claims either of the aforementioned credits affects the entire refund shown on the return — not just the portion of the refund caused by claiming one or both of the credits. Although the IRS will begin releasing refunds for returns claiming the credits on February 15, it is unlikely that the refund will arrive in your bank account or be available on your debit card before the week of Feb. 27, due the time it takes for bank account deposits and debit card credits to roll through the financial system. Note that the Feb. 27 date assumes that your return has no processing issues and you that you choose the direct deposit option or debit card option to receive your refund.

With any luck, the economy will cruise along in Goldilocks mode, neither too hot nor too cold. But what if it doesn't? This might be a good moment to prep your finance for the next economic downturn—and that means not only building up your emergency fund, but also paying down debt.
The bulls feel justified in this continued share appreciation. However, keep in mind that the current share price isn't a validation of October's growth but reflect expectations about expansion. And that leaves little room for error this year.
Secretary Clinton says we just need to impose a few more fees and regulations on the financial industry. I disagree.
I love my uncle. My tweet yesterday had nothing to do with family, McDaniel, who dropped the maiden name Romney after assuming her RNC post, said on Fox and Friends. I would have done this to any freshman incoming senator, and I would have said, 'Hey, let's focus on the real issues here, which are the Democrats, who are proposing dangerous policies for our country. And let's remind Americans about the good things that have come out of the Trump administration.'
What's more, the unemployment rate has fallen below 5%, wages are rising after years of meager gains and consumers are the most confident since the early 2000s. The economy would not need much of a boost to get to 3%.
When Wall Street was on the verge of collapse, the Federal Reserve acted with a fierce sense of urgency to save the financial system. We need the Fed to act with the same boldness to combat unemployment and low wages.
Renters living in the smaller candidate cities would be particularly hard hit if Amazon were to move in. People who rent their homes in Raleigh could see rents grow up to an additional 2% because of Amazon workers moving in, according to real estate website Apartment List. That could add up to an additional $15,356 spent on rent over 10 years. Renters in Columbus, Indianapolis, Pittsburgh and Nashville could also expect to see rent hikes of more than 1% on top of the average expected rent growth if they became home to Amazon's HQ2.
So I did everything he asked. I just got berated all over again, and he told false stories to my family and community about me. He blamed me for his divorce from my mother. He wouldn't talk to my sisters for a couple years either because of the divorce. My sisters told me that they had not spoken to him, but they had. They were always favored.
The Fed had indicated in December that at least three rate increases were in the offing for 2017, according to a forecast of interest rates from members of the central bank, known as the dot-plot.

But the risk here is that it can be difficult to maintain control when expectations build that the currency is set on a depreciation path. This can lead to a snowball effect with capital outflows, says Daiwa.
Demand for chocolate is stronger than ever, especially now that more consumers in China and India are buying bars and bonbons long considered an unaffordable luxury. But cocoa production is down, including a steep slide last year in Ghana, the second-largest cocoa-growing country. Cocoa prices have jumped nearly 40% since the start of 2012.
However, bitcoin BTCUSD, +0.94% , despite a late-session jump following a report on Tuesday that Peter Thiel's hedge fund has built a large stake in bitcoin, has been under pressure from a cadre of coins that threaten to supplant it as the most used virtual asset. It is a challenge that the cryptographically produced currency hasn't faced since its debut in 2009.
Janus Capital Group US:JNS, once an emblematic superstar money manager of the 1990s, never fully recovered from the subsequent dot-com crash. Assets have dropped from their 2000 peak of $324 billion to $199 billion as of Sept. 30—a 39% decline. The firm has been particularly hard-hit from the more recent industry-wide exodus out of actively managed funds into index products; it lost $1.8 billion to outflows for the 12 months ending Sept. 30. Flows are concentrated in some very large fund companies with ETFs, says Patrick Davitt, a partner at Autonomous Research who covers Janus. Janus hasn't had a strong position there.
Both ETFs look to take advantage of this growth area by investing in companies that either derive some portion of revenue from blockchain-related activity, or which invests in blockchain research and development. The Amplify fund is actively managed and charges an expense ratio of 0.7%.
A new generation of baby devices connects directly to a child's body for close monitoring. Owlet, a $300 smart sock that wraps around a child's foot, claims it can monitor the infant's heart rate and oxygen levels while they sleep. Parents can use the accompanying app for sleep data on their child and sounds and lights alert them if anything is out of the ordinary with a child's vitals, according to the list of uses on the device. A review on parenting site What To Expect noted that the sock isn't a medical device that's been approved by the FDA, but that it could be useful for parents of premature infants. However, it's one of the most expensive monitors out there.

The authorized user is more of a parent/child relationship, he said; even if one partner allows the other to be an authorized user, one person is still the primary account holder, which can be detrimental to building confidence and management skills for the other party, McQuay said.
Another tremendous number – we're going to have an accurate number over the next two days with certified accountants. But an accurate number will be given, but it's in the fifties of thousands, and that's people that went to vote and they were told they can't vote because they've already been voted for. And it's a very sad thing. They walked out complaining. But the number is large.

In his book The Institutional ETF Toolbox, Eric Balchunas estimates that there is a combined $75 trillion or so of institutional capital (pensions, insurance companies, endowments, foundations, sovereign wealth funds, etc.). These funds have just around 1% of that $75 trillion in ETFs. Institutions have trillions of dollars in separately managed accounts and other fund structures such as limited partnerships.
More recently, price support has come as separate surveys showed that December crude output from major producers saw their biggest monthly declines since January 2017.
The stock spikes demonstrate the level of excitement that exists behind a technology some say could prove to be as world-changing as the internet. But two men, each of whom just launched a blockchain-related exchange-traded fund—the first two to hit the market, both of which debuted on Wednesday—aren't enjoying this wave of enthusiasm. Instead, they're issuing a warning.
Researchers Max Rollwage, Raymond Dolan and Stephen Fleming at University College London's Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging conducted two separate sets of experiments, one involving 381 people drawn from the general population, the other involving 417. In both cases, they first studied each person's political views in some depth. Then they subjected participants to long series of tests in which they had to compare two boxes of flickering dots on computer screens, and try to gauge which one contained more.

The U.S showed less social support, less sense of personal freedom, lower donations, and more perceived corruption of government and business, it said. America's crisis is, in short, a social crisis, not an economic crisis… Almost all of the policy discourse in Washington, D.C. centers on naïve attempts to raise the economic growth rate, as if a higher growth rate would somehow heal the deepening divisions and angst in American society. This kind of growth-only agenda is doubly wrong-headed.

Given that some college is becoming more necessary than ever to compete in today's economy, it only makes sense that making it easier for students to take classes behind bars would improve their chances of success once they leave, said Margaret diZerega, a project director at Vera and one of the authors of the study.
Other pieces to consider: Will you follow the 4% rule? Have you put together a realistic budget that will account for all potential expenses and things you want to do in retirement? Have you done multiple projections to ensure that you're saving enough before retiring to provide enough income for the full period that you'll need it, even if the markets don't provide good returns every year? If you have kids, will you plan to pay for their college?
There are a lot of pieces to that puzzle. And while Netflix delivered in third-quarter numbers back in October, investors don't award points for past performance.
Are you both equally committed to retiring early, and do you share the same vision of what's worth sacrificing to reach your goals? Have you mapped out your big goals for your lives together? Do you both feel comfortable with your retirement budget and projections, or does one of you feel they are too aggressive or risky? Are you both committed to the discipline and frugality needed to ensure you don't outlive your retirement savings? Do you regularly check in with each other to make sure you're still on the same page about money and life goals? If you're currently single, does your vision allow for flexibility if you one day get in a serious relationship?

Scott Rieckens and his wife Taylor were living what many people might consider a dream life: renting a house across the bay from San Diego, working hard but also playing hard, whether regularly hitting up hot new restaurants, joining the local boat club or enjoying flashy weekend trips. After their daughter Jovie was born in 2015, they hired a nanny for $2,500 a month.
January is a natural time to take stock of your financial life, and to dream big dreams about 2018. Could this be the year you make the leap to homeownership? Or will you make a big change and trade in your mortgage payment for a landlord? While the housing market has slowly recovered from its dip in the 2000s, blind faith in housing gains has not. Homeownership rates hit a 50-year low in 2015, and first-time home buyers are now waiting a record six years to move from renting to buying. In fact, young adults looking to upgrade out of their one-bedroom apartments are increasingly renting single-family homes rather than buying. Single-family rentals — either detached homes or townhomes — make up the fastest-growing segment of the housing market, according to the Urban Institute.

TOKYO — Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Tuesday he would continue to advocate free trade, and officials said they hadn't given up on the Trans-Pacific Partnership despite President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the deal.
The obligation to make payments (other than payments of delinquent amounts) must cease if the recipient party dies. If the divorce papers are unclear about whether or not payments must continue, applicable state law controls. If under state law, the payer must continue to make payments after the recipient's death (to the recipient's estate or beneficiaries), the payments cannot be deductible alimony. In other words, the payment obligation must cease if the recipient party dies in order for the payment to qualify as deductible alimony. Failing to meet this requirement for payments to cease if the recipient dies is the most common reason for lost alimony deductions.
Still, shares are down for all three retailers, along with many others across the sector. Macy's and J.C. Penney shares were each down more than 5% in early Thursday trading, while L Brands took the largest tumble of 15%.

But for all that these cities share in common, they have had rather divergent trajectories from a real estate perspective since the nadir of the recession.

Several years ago, Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas) introduced a bill with a new WEP formula. It involved two steps. First, the regular Social Security factors would be applied to all earnings — both covered and uncovered — to calculate a benefit. The resulting benefit then would be multiplied by the share of the AIME that came from covered earnings. Such a change would produce smaller reductions for the lower paid and larger reductions for the higher paid. That is a better approach.

Even if you only have to file the base postcard return, you may have to fill out some worksheets that are included in the Form 1040 instructions. For example, if you claim the new deduction for qualified business income from pass-through entities (sole proprietorships, LLCs, partnerships, and S corporations), there's a worksheet to calculate your allowable deduction. You don't file these worksheets with your return, but you should keep them with your tax records for the year.

The new tax law has further complicated the math in deciding whether to rent or buy, according to the Urban Institute. Under the 2017 tax code, a family of three with an annual income of $150,000 would be better off buying if their rent exceeded $1,507 per month. But with the new tax code, they'd have to pay more than $1,885 per month to make buying worthwhile. Do we expect people not to buy because of these changes? At the margin, yes, researchers at the Urban Institute wrote.
The U.S. News annual survey assessed 38 diet plans across nine categories. While DASH continued its reign as the best diet overall—beating out the Mediterranean and the MIND diets—it didn't crack the top 10 in terms of weight loss.

Considering whether the payee will honor the annuity is where the lottery choice can actually help investors looking at lump-sum payouts offered as a retirement incentive or as a means for a company to get former employees out of a pension plan.
This makes life hard for the central bank. For instance, it makes it more difficult for the central bank to engineer a soft landing for the economy, Rosengren said. It also means the Fed cannot pause in its gradual pace of rate hikes and should even pick up the pace a bit this year. The U.S. central bank might have to raise rates four times in 2018, he said, more than the median forecast of Fed officials or the two hikes the market expects.
While the popular story in the media during the market's rally from the financial crisis is that active management doesn't work — and fund flows have shown investors loading up on index funds — the market's volatility and concerns about a possible downturn make 2016 the kind of time when active management typically does what investors hope for when they take the chance.

Anheuser-Busch InBev will do what it wants until someone says no: When Anheuser-Busch was told it couldn't own distributors in Kentucky, it just bought more in Colorado — where it's already the biggest distributor — and bought a craft brewery there just for kicks. When it appeared it wouldn't be allowed to buy SABMiller without ditching Miller brands in the U.S., it sold them to Molson Coors at a discount. When the Justice Department told it that it couldn't sell Corona, Pacifico and other brands here after buying Modelo for $20.1 billion in 2013, it gladly ceded U.S. rights to Constellation Brands in favor of larger global market share.

Sometimes, the letters are heartbreaking. This woman is running out of time to secure a viable financial future for her son when her husband is only concerned about leaving money to his own children.

Effective for dispositions in 2018 and beyond, the TCJA stipulates that certain intangible assets can no longer be treated as favorably-taxed capital gain assets. This change affects inventions; models and designs (whether or not patented); secret formulas; and processes that are: (1) created by the taxpayer or (2) acquired from the creating taxpayer with the new owner's basis determined by the creating taxpayer's basis (such as an acquisition by gift or by contribution by the creating taxpayer to another entity such as a corporation or partnership).

The Dow Jones Industrial Average US:DJIA jumped 747 points or 3.3% to close at 23,433.16, for its best performance since Dec. 26, when it surged 5%. (Before Dec. 26, the Dow's best day was Aug. 26, 2015, when it climbed 4%.) The S&P 500 index US:SPX clambered up 3.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index US:COMP leapt 4.3%.
The other is a naturally occurring illusion: the proximity of Dow 20,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% has been above 19,000 since November, and countless news stories have focused on its flirtation with the 20,000 barrier, which might be crossed by the time this commentary is published. Whatever happens, Dow 20,000 will still have a psychological impact on markets.

The December reading shows stock allocation jumped from 69% to 72%, which trails the 77% level reached before the epic implosion nearly two decades ago. The 3-percentage-point jump is the biggest monthly increase in four years. Does that mean a collapse is imminent? Of course not. Maybe.
Not only does New York have more HNW individuals than any other city in the world, but it also has the largest population of ultrawealthy people, defined as those who have assets worth more than $30 million. It regains this distinction after losing the title to Hong Kong in 2017. However, the tenuous relationship between the U.S. and China roiled the wealthy elite in Hong Kong, causing the HNW population there to drop by more than 11% last year.

The common denominator was their age group.

If you consider the challenges in front of Apple, including the strengthening dollar, President Trump's trade dispute with China, the partially related economic slowdown in China, longer upgrade cycles and some pushback against newer higher-end and higher-priced iPhones, it might help to take the long view. Economies ebb and flow, the dollar doesn't always rise and trade disputes tend to be settled. Apple can also work on its product mix and marketing to recapture its buzz.

That said, people really do have trouble negotiating with the credit bureaus (the three major ones are Equifax EFX, +0.41% , TransUnion TRU, +0.15% and Experian EXPN, -1.01% ; Equifax and TransUnion were fined by the CFPB this month after the bureau said they misled consumers about their credit scores) when they have problems with their reports, Weston said, which has created a cat and mouse relationship with credit bureaus for years.

Daniel Pemberton: What separates Getty apart from everyone else is his wealth and power. Musically the way of establishing that is by giving him a very grand musical backing. We ended up with a 70-piece orchestra as well as large scale choir. Giving one man a 70-piece orchestra and a 20-piece choir is a way of signifying power and wealth behind that person. I wanted his world to feel operatic and theatrical. I'm not saying the music feels like it could have been written by Beethoven or Verdi but I wanted it to feel in that lineage. Getty believed he was reincarnated from Hadrian so we played on medieval scriptures too. When we go to the kidnappers, the music became a lot more rural and visceral. I ended up going to a remote part of Italy and recording folk singers in Sardinia.

3) Decline in mortality improvements since 2005. The decline could be attributed to the exhaustion of the positive effects of the cardiovascular drugs and technology. That is, once everyone at risk of heart disease is already taking a statin, further dissemination cannot increase the rate of mortality improvement. Similarly, the gains from the decline in male smoking have mostly run their course, although the gains in the decline in female smoking continue. And the negative effects of obesity are hampering improvements in mortality.

However, at some point, for whatever reason, this dynamic changes. Buyers will become more scarce as they refuse to pay a higher price.

The current spread between the effective funds rate and 10-year Treasury is about 30 basis points.

Marcus believes the company's agreement to acquire Delta Lloyd NV NL:DL will add earnings out of the gate when it is completed.
The current policies by the Federal Reserve also stifle retirement plans for the younger generation. Current approaches cause low or nonexistent income for most savers, and there is no indication of it getting better for the foreseeable future. Decades ago, with Social Security and a pension from an employer, a person could expect to sustain themselves in retirement. Now, too many people find themselves retiring with student loans, car loans, and more that make retirement difficult to realize.
Under the VIE structure, the Chinese company creates two entities, one in China that holds the permits and licenses needed to do business there and the other an offshore entity, in this case in the Cayman Islands, in which foreign investors can buy shares. The Chinese entity, which is usually owned by top executives, pays fees and royalties to the offshore company in contractual arrangements. The risk is that foreign investors don't actually own stock in the company, and local management or even the Chinese government could force a split with the listed company, leaving U.S. investors high and dry.
Haithcock said that if the pension was going to generate retirement income of $3,000 per month, the person considering a lump-sum offer should see if the big payout could buy an annuity that replaces or improves upon the pension payout.
Meanwhile, March silver US:SIH7 was off 11.8 cents, or 0.7%, at $16.519 an ounce, paring its weekly rise to roughly 3.3%. March copper US:HGH7 added less than a cent to $2.546 a pound—up about 1.6% for the week.
Research suggests it takes 21 days to make a habit that won't likely be broken in the future. Perhaps start with a No Spend month and then incorporate a no spend day, or no spend week, into each month for the rest of the year.
MW: What do these changes mean for students?
Inflation would still be, I think, in a range that it wouldn't be affecting decision-making by households or firms but would give you a little more flexibility to reduce the probability that you hit zero during recessions. So if we were to have a recession right now, most recessions we move interest rates by much more than 300 basis points. If you look at where the [Fed forecasts] in December had the fed funds in the long run, [2.8%] it is low enough that more than likely in most recessions we'd hit zero. That is a concern.
Biden would eliminate the TCJA's $10,000 cap on itemized deductions for state and local taxes.
Boston College's Center for Retirement Research found that most people world-wide are what you'd call passive savers or people who pay little attention to tax incentives currently given by traditional financial policies. Instead, they adapt and adjust their spending to their take-home pay. This mentality makes the idea of saving and earning more responsive to initiatives like auto-enrolment.
Though the Chinese government made some critical misjudgments early on, one thing it did right was to warn the rest of the world that the virus was transmissible, airborne, and controllable only through drastic and immediate measures. The countries that ignored the warning have since suffered the most, both economically and in human terms. Meanwhile, the countries that demonstrated social solidarity in controlling their outbreaks have been able to reopen their economies, though not necessarily their borders.
So, if you're looking for a country to bet on, there may be better options, according to our call of the day. Specifically, Japan is poised to deliver, says DoubleLine Capital's Bond King Jeffrey Gundlach, who recently shared his views with Barron's regarding the upcoming year.

Q: Your income hasn't changed much since you left San Diego. What about your spending?
For tax years beginning after 2017, the TCJA imposes a three-year holding period requirement in order for profits from certain partnership interests received in exchange for the performance of services to be treated as low-taxed long-term capital gains rather than higher-taxed ordinary income. That's an improvement.
A: The advice stays the same. The money we make is relative to our lifestyle. If you're having a hard time saving, look at the choices you're making.
Second, the only way to reduce the competitive striving of active investment managers would be to make their work so unrewarding that they would decide to quit. Given how highly compensated active managers are these days, it would take an awfully large drop in compensation to cause many active managers to leave the market.
That is the one question every investor must ask himself. Your answer may have a sizable impact on your results.
MR. MEADOWS: OK. All right. So, Mr. President, everybody is on the line. And just so – this is Mark Meadows, the chief of staff. Just so we all are aware, on the line is the secretary of state and two other individuals, Jordan and Mr. Germany, with him. You also have the attorneys that represent the president – Kurt and Alex and Cleta Mitchell, who is not the attorney of record but has been involved – myself, and then the president. So, Mr. President, I'll turn it over to you.
General Electric Co.'s stock GE, -2.65% slumped 1.7% in afternoon trade Monday, to be the Dow Jones Industrial Average's DJIA, -0.46% biggest decliner, after J.P. Morgan analyst C. Stephen Tusa cut his price target, saying there were too many risks to change his bearish view on the industrial conglomerate. He after taking a fresh look into GE's potential this year, after the stock's extremely poor relative performance last year, he said the consensus analyst outlook for earnings per share of about $1 is reasonable, but remains the lowest quality $1 of EPS in the sector. He wrote in a note to clients that the consensus presumption that free cash flow can grow meaningfully from here banks on working capital remaining positive..., restructuring collapsing..., and an opaque, negative 'other account,' including contract assets, getting significantly less negative. Tusa reiterated his underweight rating, and cut his price target to $16 from $17. The stock had rallied 6.8% amid a 5-session win streak through Friday, the longest such streak since February 2017, and the biggest five-day gain since November 2016. In 2017, the stock had plunged 44.8%, the worst one-year performance since 2008, while the Dow rallied 25.1%.

Oracle Corp. ORCL, -1.30% said Thursday it has signed a 20-year partnership with the the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball, giving the Redwood City, Calif.-based cloud services and software company naming rights to the Giants' ballpark through 2038. Effective Thursday, the Giants will change the name of its ballpark to Oracle Park from AT&T park. Financial terms of the partnership were not disclosed, but in a report out late Wednesday, the San Francisco Chronicle estimated the deal to be worth $300 million to $350 million. We are extremely proud that one of the best and most storied ballparks in America will now be called Oracle Park, said Oracle Chief Executive Mark Hurd. Together we will create an incredible fan experience and develop programs to engage and impact the community in new ways. Among parts of the agreement, A new scoreboard and signage will be added, a community outreach program will be developed and sports hospitality experiences will be built. Additional ballpark upgrades will be announced in the coming weeks. Oracle's stock slipped 0.3% in afternoon trade, while AT&T shares T, +0.20% gained 0.8% and the S&P 500 SPX, -0.16% tacked on 0.1%.

Meanwhile, the Fed's Beige Book, a snapshot of domestic economic activity released after gold futures settled Wednesday, revealed that contacts in many districts have become less optimistic in light of market volatility and political uncertainty. That could prompt Fed members to trim their expectations for higher interest rates in 2019, a potentially dollar-supportive, gold-negative development.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: But where were the poll watchers, Brad? There were no poll watchers there. There were no Democrats or Republicans. There was no security there. It was late in the evening or late in the – early in the morning, and there was nobody else in the room. Where were the poll watchers? And why did they say a watermain broke – which they did – and which is reported in the newspapers? They said they left – they ran out because of a watermain break. And there was no watermain. There was nothing. There was no break. There was no watermain break. But where – if you – if you take out everything, where were the Republican poll watchers – even where were the Democrat poll watchers – because there were none.

Be careful — your child's connected teddy bear may be watching you. Increasingly popular internet-connected toys pose a privacy concern for the children who use them and their families, as regulatory bodies work to crack down on violations.
If lawmakers were to lift the ban on prisoners accessing Pell grants — the money the federal government provides to low-income students to pay for college — the wages of all formerly incarcerated people would go up by $43.5 million during the first year of release, according to a report released Wednesday by the Vera Institute of Justice, an advocacy organization focused on the criminal justice system, and Georgetown University's Center on Poverty and Inequality.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: Because most of them are made out to the name Trump because these are people that were scammed when they came in, and we have thousands of people that have testified or that want to testify. When they came in, they were proudly going to vote on November 3rd, and they were told, I'm sorry, you've already been voted for – you've already voted. The women, men started screaming, no, I proudly voted to November 3rd. They said, I'm sorry, but you've already been voted for, and you have a ballot.
The problem with passive investing, for many investors, is that index funds ride the market rollercoaster, which can get nauseating when declines are fast and steep. A fund manager, typically, is expected to inject some downside protection, so that while their fund may not beat the market in good times, it avoids some of the pain in bad times.
Excess sodium can increase your blood pressure and your risk for a heart disease and stroke, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. Together, heart disease and stroke kill more Americans each year than any other cause. Americans get 71% of their daily sodium from processed and restaurant food. Cooking for yourself is the safest and healthiest option.
On valuations, Japan looks attractive relative to its global peer group, so one of our reasons we are interested in Japan it's not just because it's profitable but also because the valuation headwind has turned into a tailwind. So Japan is interesting, he said.

Owning a home can give you a place to hide from a bear market for stocks
The trend toward low-cost investment products is one of the best things to ever happen to investors. And I believe this trend is a secular change. There's no going back now. Many of these highly priced mutual funds and hedge funds will continue to charge high fees but, eventually, this trend is going to overwhelm this business model and they'll lose assets, have to lower their fees, get bought out by another firm or go out of business.
And to know that you need to know this: What's the bare minimum portfolio you need that will produce sufficient income to fund your retirement? If you have a $1 million portfolio and can withstand a loss of $100,000 before it adversely affects your lifestyle than that's the point at which you would rejigger your portfolio. Again, it's your plan — not your emotions — that dictate when and what you'll do.
If I could sit down with you individually, here are some of things I'd ask you.
The show provides food for contestants, but when staying in the mansion, any cooking, laundry and other chores are up to them. Some activities have to be improvised — Murphy says a beaten path in the backyard served as a running track for contestants who wanted to exercise in between filming sessions. Though contestants may access a phone in cases of emergency or to talk to their children, most other media, including books, aren't allowed. You never really go offline like you do on the show, Murphy says.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: No, but I told you, but we're not – we're not saying that. We are the aggrieved –
I know any earnings I could see on investment is nothing compared to credit-card interest, which I have been charged with paying off all by myself.
That could soon change as analysts forecast a further rise in gold, and gold mining stocks start the year on a strong note.
It's not just because Amazon is the default choice for many Americans doing their holiday shopping. It's also because its Amazon Prime subscription service continues to prove it is increasingly a way of life for many consumers.
One of them is this idea that good film music is that which goes unnoticed. That's total nonsense. Film music is a character in a film. Sometimes you don't want to notice it — it's a supporting actor which steps back and doesn't draw attention to itself. Other times it wants to be like Tom Cruise, a big part of the film. With an Aaron Sorkin film, his dialogue is so key, you can't interfere with that and you've got to help the momentum of that and not get in the way. Whereas Ridley Scott's films are a bit more visually cinematic.
Solving the problems plaguing pay TV could take more than re-evaluating service offerings. BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield said that media companies will need to hunt for acquisition prospects in 2016 to diversify and reduce exposure to the sinking basic cable ship.
Since financial researchers often assume that productivity is the key driver of stock prices, our results suggest that a major rethinking may be in order.
Both benchmarks traded around their highest levels since December 2014, with West Texas Intermediate crude US:CLG8 7% higher in 2018 so far, and Brent up 5%. They are up 24% and 21%, respectively, over the last three months. WTI traded around $64 a barrel on Monday.
Despite that wonderful 100% return if you contribute what your employer is willing to match, you should consider, over time, working your way up to making maximum annual contributions to your 401(k).
Both films, made on shoestring budgets, were breakthroughs at the box office. Get Out was released in February 2017 and earned $175.7 million in the U.S. on a budget of $4.5 million. Lady Bird is A24's highest-grossing film to date, pulling in $39.1 million on a $10 million budget. A24 is one of Hollywood's leading independent studios. Last year's best picture-winner, Moonlight, was previously A24's highest-grossing film.
This rule brings long-needed clarity for American workers and employers, U.S. Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia said in a statement.
This is of course vitally important when the economy is still down more than 9 million jobs since February. We have an estimated 26 million people who are going hungry in the United States, and some 7 million to 14 million at risk of eviction. And many of the jobs lost in the hardest-hit industries, such as retail and hospitality, will not be coming back. Many workers will have to change occupations and some will be unemployed long-term; at present, the percent of unemployed who are long-term (more than six months out of work) is at 36.9%, up from 19.2% in February.
So Rieckens would hardly describe himself as frugal by nature.
Instead, I began goal-setting — making annual targets that were achievable over the course of 12 months, even if I faltered and my path was not straight and consistent.
And, the reason these risky financial schemes were given such favorable ratings is simple. Wall Street paid for them.
Ultimately, investors come up with a lot of ways to explain their moves without ever having to fess up to market timing or giving into their fear or greed. They buy on dips or protect their profits against downturns, and thus become tactical; in the face of the market's recent moves, they're considering adding to the parts of the market that have gone on sale — like China or oil companies — or they're steering clear of more pain.

If you're eyeing a move to Florida, Tallahassee delivers on sunshine (233 days a year? Yes, please!), at a price point well below many other Florida cities — you can still buy a house here for less than $200,000. Another bonus? You'll be just a couple of hours from some of the most beautiful beaches on the Gulf Coast.
Every transaction in the market requires both a buyer and a seller, with the only differentiating factor being at what price the transaction occurs. Since this is necessary for there to be equilibrium in the markets, there can be no sidelines.
The MGP story is just one example. In danger of being left behind amid a generational boom that is reshaping U.S. grain fields and export markets, the founding family confronted management during a proxy contest for control of the Atchison, Kansas-based company in 2013. Lurching from quarter to quarter, MGP was trading for about $6 a share, less than one-quarter its market value today.
Apple and Alphabet have also seen big declines in forward P/E valuations. Investors weren't surprised when Apple CEO Tim Cook explained a tremendous cut in the iPhone maker's sales forecast on Jan. 2; the stock was down 32% during the fourth quarter (with dividends reinvested).
His remarks were in response to the U.S.-ordered drone strike against Iran top general Qassem Soleimani late Thursday, with his death expected to incite an increase in tensions in the Middle East and to potentially result in a sharp retaliatory response.
When firms open up offices in new cities, not only are they wiling to change where they recruit, it looks like they're willing to recruit at less-selective universities, Weinstein said. The analysis is limited to schools at a certain level of prestige, so it's unclear whether schools at all levels of the selectivity spectrum benefit from a company's new office.
In 2008, the taxpayers of this country bailed out Wall Street because we were told they were too big to fail. Yet, today, 3 out of the 4 largest financial institutions (JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo) are nearly 80 percent bigger than before we bailed them out. Incredibly, the six largest banks in this country issue more than two-thirds of all credit cards and more than 35 percent of all mortgages. They control more than 95 percent of all financial derivatives and hold more than 40 percent of all bank deposits. Their assets are equivalent to nearly 60 percent of our GDP. Enough is enough.
On Dec. 28, U.S. District Judge Barbara Jacobs Rothstein gave the FDIC a victory on one of three claims it brought against PricewaterhouseCoopers, the auditor of Colonial Bank Group, a financial crisis-era bank that failed after a massive fraud was discovered between the bank and the mortgage originator Taylor Bean & Whitaker.
Americans had more than $420 billion in credit card debt as of late 2018, according to personal finance website NerdWallet, and the average household with credit-card debt has nearly $7,000 in revolving debt that carries over from month to month. And those households are paying a hefty sum in interest.
Additionally, refunds like the one Royal Caribbean offered don't always cover additional travel expenses incurred, such as rebooking airfare.
Andrew Lapthorne, head of SocGen's quantitative analysis team said sky-high valuations have been a reason investors have been scared of snapping up Japanese stocks, but that headwind has been dissipating.
In Europe many passengers know about the strict guidelines regarding long delays on airlines and are quick to claim what they're owed, said Brian Sumers, airline reporter for travel analysis site Skift, but the refund policy is little-known in the U.S.
To save for your retirement, you must first understand what it means to be financially free. Financial freedom means preserving your capital, earning yield on the wealth you're creating, and budgeting for your savings to outlast your days on this planet. The goal of financial freedom is to get to the point where your monthly income is greater than your monthly expenses. When you're spending, you'll be spending against your own earned money and not against what you hope you'll earn in the future. When rates on deposits drop below the inflation rate it becomes impossible to save for the future and so one must invest in more risky assets or in non correlated assets to escape this impossible savings conundrum.
Lesson #2: It pays to be contrarian
The minutes also show some talk of slowing down the pace of the shrinking of the balance sheet. At the moment, the Fed is letting $50 billion of maturing securities run off the balance sheet each month.
The answer could be any number of things — earning dividends from stocks you own, selling shares of index funds, collecting rent on an investment property or 10, doing part-time work, or some combination of the above. The answer can also change over time, focusing primarily on one strategy until you reach age 59 1/2, for example, and then shifting to live off your 401(k) or IRA after you reach the eligible age.
The change comes after a successful 2016, a year in which value stocks have beaten growth, particularly after the election. Here's how his Gradient 50 strategy of 50 stocks has performed, according to information verified by Orion Advisor Services:
Eliminating these provisions would be a mistake. They are well-intentioned attempts to solve an equity issue that arises because about 25% to 30% of state and local workers are not covered by Social Security.

Futu designed its platform with the aim of allowing access to low-cost investment for everyone, including customers with little or no market experience. Its commission rates are about one-fifth of the average rate offered by the leading players in Hong Kong, according to its prospectus, citing an industry report that it commissioned from Oliver Wyman Consulting (Shanghai) Ltd. That same report found that Hong Kong is the world's fourth biggest online securities market, with annual trading volume growing to $1.6 trillion in 2017 from $404.5 billion in 2012, equal to a compound annual growth rate of 31.3%. The market is expected to grow to $3.1 trillion by 2022.

How to keep them? Find the joy in the goal, and focus on short-term rewards instead of long-term rewards. For example, if your resolution is to go to the gym, instead of planning to lose 10 pounds, aim to do a certain number of exercises during each workout. If you want to stop drinking so much alcohol, instead of thinking of it as a ban in your life, make a goal to opt for water or juice next time you hit the bar.

For some, that isolation can be relaxing. My favorite part was being disconnected, Lane says. Cast members can lounge by the pool, and drink and eat without being bothered by work emails or phone calls.
• We're seeing a textbook short squeeze in the pound today following Theresa May's press conference ... . The one revelation that stood out though was the intention to put any deal before parliament, which in theory should tip the balance slightly further away from a 'hard Brexit,' even if May acknowledged that we will not be seeking access to the single market. This triggered a rally in the pound which in turn was the catalyst for the short squeeze that followed.
In 2016, the focus was on reducing the remaining debt. Being vague about exactly how to do that allowed me to set my priorities straight. My primary goal was to hit the retirement-savings target in 2016; once that was secure, remaining monies would reduce the debt without adding the pressure of a specific bullseye. Thankfully, I achieved beyond both expectations this year.
Germany is undergoing an economic and political crisis calling for new leadership both in style and substance. The latest manufacturing data have confirmed that the country's problems are not just due to slowing world trade, but that they partly stem from ingrained problems that have caught both businesses and the government by surprise. Industrial production fell 3.5% in December compared with the previous month, and nearly 7% over the past year. The car industry's struggles to deal with the challenges of climate change and the dearth of investment in recent years are taking their toll at last.
$830 billion — That's the market capitalization of the total cryptocurrency universe, which broke through the $800-billion level for the first time over the weekend. That's even as bitcoin, by far the biggest player, trades well below its record peak.

You worked with Aaron Sorkin when he wrote the Steve Jobs script. But how did you get to score his directorial debut Molly's Game?
Making moves in the name of tactical asset allocation — changing index allocations or swapping one index fund for another — is active investing, and can have the same performance-reducing effects as investing in active funds to begin with.
Next up on the prepayment menu are state and local income and property taxes that are due early next year. Prepaying those bills before year-end can decrease your 2020 federal income tax bill, because your itemized deductions total will be that much higher. However, the TCJA decreased the maximum amount you can deduct for state and local taxes to $10,000 or $5,000 if you use married filing separate status. So, beware of that limitation.
A lot of people think they can serve on a board and that that's enough. Nope. That will not work. Many people in their 50s and 60s are on boards and find that meaningful, but it's not what I'm talking about. I believe it's a more hands-on approach, of rolling up your sleeves and being with people who need you. It can be the most rewarding experience of your life.
In the three-plus years Beam operated as a standalone company (after being spun off by Fortune Brands in 2011), it boosted expenditures on advertising and marketing by 30% to get consumers to spend more—and pay more—for its products, which also include Skinnygirl and Sauza Tequila. In turn, its operating income rose by 35% to $617.1 million, on an 18% increase in sales to $3.1 billion.
China showed that new infections could be halved in just two weeks through standard measures such as enforced mask-wearing, social distancing, and mandatory quarantine and isolation. By contrast, in countries like Brazil, the United Kingdom, and the United States, national political leaders dismissed the threat and dithered in marshaling the appropriate response.
Despite concerns about the Chinese regulator's rapid flip-flop on the circuit breaker — suspending it just four days after it was launched — some applauded the move. The decision to remove it was sensible, said Andrew Xia, Hong Kong research director at Noah.
Bankruptcy experts who are watching the Sears saga unfold note the impact on workers.
A 50% limit isn't easy to achieve, but it frees up money for wants (30%) and savings or debt repayment (20%). Sticking to a 50/30/20 budget also helps people better survive job loss and other economic setbacks by limiting their overhead. Having an emergency fund equal to three months' worth of must-have expenses is a good goal after you get on track with retirement savings and have paid off troublesome debt such as credit cards. Any loans may be affordable if the payments doesn't push your must-have expenses over the 50% mark.
But more important, the advice was correct, even if I would have been better off not taking it. His argument had been simple: investing in single stocks is risky even if you've done your due diligence, so it's better to diffuse that risk by investing in the broader market, which is almost guaranteed to go up over time (especially over my timeline of a then-21-year-old kickstarting a nest egg).
It seems likely that players like Amazon AMZN, -3.44% , Google, Microsoft, and even HP HPE, -2.81% , Dell US:DVMT , and more might come calling for Intel to offer rebates or discounts on future purchases. If 10% to 20% of Amazon AWS computing capability across its many data centers is suddenly missing, it will need to ramp up new system deployment to avoid harming its customers. This additional cost may be where Intel is most vulnerable to culpability.
On a call with analysts, GE Chief Executive John L. Flannery said he was deeply disappointed at the magnitude of the charge in the company's legacy reinsurance portfolio.
I have two daughters. Growing up in an agricultural family during the farm crisis was tough. My dad was extremely abusive, both physically and mentally. When I was 12 years old, he would pinch my ears with pliers. He told me once that he loved me, but he treated me like I was a farm worker, and always punished me if I didn't do things just as he had asked.

General Electric GE, -2.65% was the dog of the Dow in 2017, losing almost half its value during the broad market rally. Well, 2018 is a completely different story so far, with GE and its 6% surge beating all other blue chips.
However, there is just one flaw that I need help with: Her spending habits. They drive me ****ing crazy.
This strategy also coincides with a long-established tendency of Republican Party leadership, since the 1970s, to run up federal budget deficits when they are in power and then return to fiscal conservatism when the Democrats take office. And finally, there are also some true believers in high Republican places; Mitch McConnell used some of these in the Senate to tell Trump no can do just before the election, when Trump leaned on Republican senators to reach a deal with the Democrats on the Heroes 2.0 COVID stimulus bill. Trump backed off, perhaps calculating that a fight with Senate Republican leadership just before the elections was not worth the risk.

[W]e monitor for consistent improvements in a more balanced lingerie assortment, which can help support price improvements, wrote Cowen & Company analysts led by Oliver Chen. Further, we watch for prospects for improved store traffic (store comps -6% at Victoria's Secret during December) that is not driven by promotional activity, which could include targeted direct mail.
We need a banking system that is part of the productive economy – making loans at affordable rates to small- and medium-sized businesses so that we create decent-paying jobs. Wall Street cannot continue to be an island unto itself, gambling trillions in risky financial instruments, making huge profits and assured that, if their schemes fail, the taxpayers will be there to bail them out.
I expected to find a bruised and battered company after that proxy fight, Griffin told me. What I found was a positive, collaborative culture, unlike any I've experienced. … It was very clear they had underutilized assets. They had tremendous macro trends that were going to benefit them.
For individuals who must pay alimony, this change can be expensive--because the tax savings from being able to deduct alimony payments can be substantial.
It may be tempting to set a resolution to not spend for a whole year, but experts suggest taking a baby step first — maybe by starting with a no spend day once a week or no spend week once a month.
One of the best tools to gain an edge is segmented money flows. Let's explore with the help of a chart.

A House Democratic aide, on condition of anonymity, said no when asked if reconciliation would be take too long to be useful for passing another round of stimulus.
While multiple comments from officials, as well as a lowered expectations of rate increases in 2019 from three to two already pointed to a change of sentiment at the Fed, the minutes hammered that point home on Wednesday. Some central bank officials had been in favor of pausing the rate increases in December already, and many agreed that the Fed could be patient with their hikes going forward.
According to Vanguard CEO Bill McNabb, although indexing represents over 30% of the mutual fund world, it's only 15% of the entire U.S. stock market and less than 5% of the global market.
I arrived at the airport five hours early the next day so as to not make the same mistake again. I sat in the terminal with a book. My flight was supposed to board at 8:30 p.m., but when that time came the flight had been delayed. And delayed again. And again. Finally, after allowing passengers to board at 1 a.m., the pilot announced the plane had to be evacuated due to a mechanical error.
Adding someone won't hurt, he said, it's just not likely to make nearly as substantive a difference.
New Year's resolutions, plans, goals, declarations and intentions — I've tried them all.
I wasn't in pursuit of this new career; it just came to me, she said. It's like what they say in 'Sound of Music: 'When God closes a door, somewhere He opens a window.'

In fact, it was the second yearly decline for the component that tracks the number of people who say it's a good time to buy. That was a net 36% in December 2014, a net 35% in December 2015, and a net 32% last month.

Tobias Levkovich, chief U.S. equity strategist at Citi, who trimmed his 2019 target for the S&P 500 to 2,850 from 3,000, believes this is a good time to jump back into the market, in part given that stocks have the potential to rise 16% over the next 12 months on valuations alone.
Rosengren: Nothing has changed dramatically, prices are still edging up, so valuation concerns are still there. I would say what has changed a little bit is, for a while, real estate looked like the only asset class that was showing signs of having substantial variation from what the average valuation had been, but I think we're starting to see more asset markets have that characteristic.
Because Arm's chip designs are at the heart of products from companies like Qualcomm QCOM, -3.11% and Apple, this is an incredibly important effort to make. Arm is unlikely to feel any effect in terms of sales or financials, as there are no reasonable alternatives to the product or services that it offers to those major customers.
Options traders are expecting some fireworks from the results. A strategy known as a straddle, that involves the simultaneous buying of bullish and bearish options at current prices, is implying one-day post-earnings move of about 5% in either direction. Read more about option straddles.
Roughly half (51%) of those in this survey are given a political label. Some 73% of those assigned a label on their political views say the listing very accurately or somewhat accurately describes their views, Pew said.
Investors need to accept that the character of the market is changing. What has worked over the past nine years may not work in the future. Investors ought to shift their mindset from a buy, buy and buy mode. Consider following a comprehensive adaptive model that has a proven track record in both bull and bear markets. It is important not to rely on static models because market conditions have changed. Static models that may have worked in the past may not work in the future.
In May 2015, Financial Engines released the results of a study that concluded workers in the U.S. were leaving $24 billion a year on the table because they don't contribute enough to take full advantage of employers' matching 401(k) retirement-plan contributions.
The stock market may have recovered from the first shocks of the pandemic, but Americans' retirement savings might not be as lucky.
Did my wife and I think these thoughts when our children were newborns? I don't believe we did because we were too sleep-deprived and too nervous about getting the parenthood thing right. But as a grandparent, I have the luxury of pondering the unfathomable potential of a new human being — and wonder if she'll be the one who invents such sorely needed products as a levitating sofa or a Google translator for cat meows.

OPEC and other major players have agreed to cut production starting this month, but the market continues to be plagued by concerns that some oil-producing countries will not comply with the terms.
His or her intention to resign is not due to any disagreement with the company on any matter relating to the company's operations, policies or practice, Yahoo noted in the Securities and Exchange Commission filing that launched a thousand confusing tweets.
That's the Achilles' heel in this business; normally, if you have a surplus or price plummets, you just ship it to another state, but here you don't have that option, said DiPisa.
A little bit of research can go a long way for consumers eyeing a new car in 2019. The prices dealers offer are not necessarily set in stone — the auto industry wouldn't dub possible price tags as the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price for nothing.
Short-term momentum: Beyond this base, there's encouraging momentum. Gold prices GLD, -0.58% are up roughly 6% in the last six months, which underperforms a gain of 11% for the S&P 500 but is still noteworthy. And since rolling back in early December, gold has surged more than 5% in just a few weeks while the S&P has barely budged.
• We are coming up on our 10th wedding anniversary.
With inflation showing little sign of veering from the Fed's 2% target, and inflation expectations well-anchored, the Fed is under no pressure to bring out the heavy artillery.
But Brad, if you took – the minimum numbers were many, many times above the 11,779, and many of those numbers are certified, or they will be certified but they are certified. Those are numbers that are there, that exist, and that beat the margin – the margin of loss. It beat – they beat it, I mean, by a lot. And people should be happy to have an accurate count instead of an election where there's turmoil. I mean, there's turmoil in Georgia and other places. You're not the only one. I mean, we have other states that I believe will be flipping to us very shortly.
Most current games do not take advantage of Nvidia's addition of ray tracing and AI to its cards, however. Moorhead noted that Nvidia has a better play for the future, but AMD — with the lower price tag than the comparable Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 cards — could offer a better value for the present gaming era.

Companies are nearly twice as likely to recruit at universities within 100 miles of a new office in the four years after opening the new office compared to the year before it opened, according to an IZA — Institute of Labor Economics discussion paper. And if the new office is in a location where there's a dearth of companies in its industry — say somewhere other than the coasts? The firm is six times more likely to recruit from local universities in the years following the opening of the new location.

Although mortgages, debt collection, payday loans and other consumer products may have their own issues, credit reports encompass many aspects of consumers' financial lives (including loans and debt), which may be one reason they received the most complaints in LendEdu's study, said the company's co-founder and Chief Executive Nate Matherson.
So for a five-night, six-day stay at Disney's All Star Music Resort, a family of four with two kids over the age of 10 (at Disney anyone 10 years of age or older counts as an adult) would essentially need to spend upwards of $500 for their lodging and more than $2,000 for their theme park tickets to qualify for the free dining promotion.

In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel's open immigration policies have imposed disastrous social consequences and crime. Meanwhile her designated successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, muses Germany through the social market economy and our system of social partnership, we have a system where many issues and conflicts are always discussed and settled in orderly structures.
The reality is more complex, of course. American companies (and European, and Japanese and Chinese companies as well) aren't putting some of their production in Mexico just to take advantage of a poorly negotiated NAFTA. They are investing in Mexico because it's a great place to do business. And Trump can't change that reality with a tweet or a tariff.
That said, not all analysts were so downbeat. Raymond James's Ric Prentiss reiterated his outperform rating on Intelsat, but acknowledged that could change once details are known about how they payments are split between the satellite companies.
But there is a broader secret: While 2020 was a banner year for capitalists, capitalism is no more. How is that possible? How can capitalists flourish as capitalism evolves into something else?

To be sure, the central bank has disappointed economists before. At its December meeting, the bank left interest rates unchanged, disappointing economists who, according to a Wall Street Journal survey, had expected the central bank to raise rates by at least a quarter of a percentage point.
Despite these scandals, Facebook actually does provide lots of options for users to control their ad preferences, said Abhishek Iyer, technical marketing manager, at Cupertino, Calif. Security firm Demisto. But it apparently has not communicated these tools well enough to users, he added, if only 1 in 4 users is aware of the ad preferences page.
The committees then write legislation to meet those targets and that language is bundled together, usually into one bill. Legislation that is spun out of the budget resolution is protected from filibuster in the Senate, meaning it can pass with only 51 votes instead of the 60 ,
Given that the much smaller state of Colorado is generating several hundred million [dollars] annually, it seems reasonable, he said. (Colorado's population is 5.6 million, while New York's statewide population is more than three times that; New York City's population alone exceeds 8.5 million.)

If the report has no errors, consumers can improve their scores by paying off debt, consistently paying bills on time (setting up automatic online payments can help with this) and using as small percentage of credit available to them as possible. (This is known as the credit utilization ratio; personal finance experts recommend using less than 30% of total credit, such as 30% of a total credit card limit.)

But Intel is still the biggest fish in the pond and will receive the most attention going forward. Customers in the enterprise space, where Intel holds a 95%+ share, are going to be more concerned about lowered performance. Workloads that are heavy on network and storage interaction are seeing the most reduction in performance due to the patches. Database and web services that are simply handlers for networking and storage requests could see drops in the area of 20%.

• The tone of the speech, conciliatory in nature towards her EU counterparts, was also quite savvy, in that in coming across as measured and reasonable she has occupied the moral high ground to some degree. ...

We expect a bear market rally to develop over the coming weeks, and we expect a new bull market to develop over the coming months to quarters, said Ari Wald, a technical analyst at Oppenheimer & Co.
A stop order is an order to buy or sell a stock when it passes a certain price. It then becomes a market order, but it may or may not execute at exactly the stop price. If the order is good till canceled it remains open until an investor cancels it or a trade is executed. If a trader put in a market sell order on Aug. 24 they may have been shocked to discover later that it sold down 10 or 20%.

San Francisco-based Ripple launched in 2012 and is unlike most of its peers. It is a centralized ledger of transactions intended to serve as a conduit for bank-to-bank payments. Ripple transactions also are measured in seconds versus minutes for bitcoin. Bitcoin purists's biggest criticism of this rival is that it is centralized, meaning that someone still acts a third party between transactions and that the company caters to financial establishment.

2018 started off with a bang for chip vendors like Intel INTC, -3.12% and AMD AMD, -5.46% , as a new and potentially industry-shifting security vulnerability at the silicon level was announced.

Manchester United MANU, +0.64% fans are hardly mourning the departure of manager José Mourinho after he was sacked by the footballing giant last month. It transpires Mourinho's alienating managerial style extends to the money management arena. An impeccable source says at one stage Mourinho chose Barclays Capital to look after his not-inconsiderable fortune (he has made an estimated £51.5m from payouts alone). But the source adds Mourinho wouldn't only demand to choose which money managers he would meet, but insist on selecting the specific room they would be meeting in. How special.
Thirtieth birthdays are an excellent time to take stock of your future funds, especially as short-term financial obligations solidify, such as continuing to pay off the last of student loans, living on your own (or maybe starting a potentially three-decade stretch of mortgage payments) and raising children. Millennials, the generation 20s to mid-30-year-olds fit into, have delayed marriage and home ownership from happening in their 20s (as was the norm decades ago). Now 57% of today's 30- year-olds are or have been married, 47% are living with a child and a third are homeowners, according to the United States Census Bureau.

Companies must use their cash to make productive investments that will generate a return higher than the debt cost or pay down debt. Given that economic growth, along with revenue growth, will likely remain weak, the former will be difficult. If inflationary pressures and interest rates rise, as many expect, cash will get used to pay off debt rather than invest.

On Facebook, reward comes in the form of positive feedback from friends, family and people we admire. That motivates users not only to post, but also to outdo themselves each time they create new content. The addiction mechanism forces them to go for an ever-increasing number of positive comments and affirmative emojis, which results in their posts and photos becoming riskier. Whether it's showing one's wealth or revealing shots of oneself or filming dangerous stunts, the motivation is always the same: to gain admiration from friends and followers.

But the people of Georgia and the people of America have a right to know the answers. And you have data and records that we don't have access to and you keep telling us and making public statements that you've investigated this and, you know, nothing to see here. But we don't know about that.

How will you make sure that your whole plan doesn't get sunk, especially after you've given up a well-paying job, by a natural or financial disaster? Will you budget for homeowners or renters insurance? Will you maintain an emergency fund, separate from your other investments? Will you carry life insurance? Umbrella insurance? Will you build in any other contingencies like the ability to downsize a home or move somewhere cheaper? How will you ride out bad periods for the stock markets, including possibly extended recessions? How much of a cash cushion will you maintain? Could you trim back your early retirement budget if you had less to spend some years?

The average fund fees for actively managed funds still dwarf those of index funds and ETFs by about 400%, give or take. That means these fund firms are still raking in way more money in fees than their low-cost counterparts. You're going to have to pry that revenue from their cold, dead hands in most cases. My guess is we'll see a lot of captains in the fund world go down with their ship as many firms will die off or get bought out. But they'll still be earning a decent living in the meantime.

For those who took exception to last week's column (While a short-term decline of up to 5% is always a possibility during a bull market, the prospect of the major averages stopping dead in their tracks and reversing for good is faint), I cannot predict whether Donald Trump will completely destroy our economy, as Bryan Korte fears. I also do not know what a trade war with China would do to global growth.
Rosengren: I think there are some advantages of having a Fed-led discussion about how we should think about the framework. My own view is that we would be better off having a little more flexibility than having a specific inflation target. I would much rather have an inflation range – something more like 1.5%-3%. And that during times where interest rates were likely to be low because labor force growth was quite low and productivity was quite low, that would be a time that I would actually like a higher level of inflation so I would like to be higher in the range during that period. And during periods of very high productivity then we could be lower. And the reason for that is – and it is partly a financial stability concern – that the current framework where we have low productivity and low population growth and not much immigration, is an environment where we are going to hit the zero lower bound too frequently. And I do think that has significant consequences – both because monetary policy becomes less effective when we can't move short-term interest rates, and I also think that it changes investor and household behavior when you start having periods of prolonged interest rates that are very low and unchanged. So I would like to avoid those kind of outcomes occurring in future recessions and so I think it is a good time to be discussing what is the right framework to reduce that probability.

Elaborating on a speech she delivered on Monday, Kansas City Fed President Esther George said the central bank's shrinking portfolio of bonds may be a fair explanation for what's driving stock-market SPX, -0.16% volatility.

That said, George told the newspaper the Fed hasn't reached the conclusion it was necessary to change the pace of the bond roll-off. George reiterated to the newspaper that she now advocates for some patience before the Fed raises interest rates further.
That's a whole lot to take in during a year when the number of breweries in the U.S. skyrocketed past 4,100 to pre-Prohibition heights (if non pre-Prohibition breweries per capita). Even after spending more than a year with our eyes and ears on the industry and our feet planted in breweries, brewpubs, storage coolers and brewers' conferences, we took away one big lesson: There's still a whole lot to learn about the beer industry in the United States. However, here are some of the other takeaways that we think are going to serve us, brewers, distributors and beer drinkers well in 2016.

U.S. stock markets have risen on every single day of the new year so far, as the global trading mood from 2017 stayed strongly positive.

Thankfully, changes included in the TCJA took millions of taxpayers out of AMT danger, but not everybody. Ask your tax adviser if you're in the clear for this year or not.

My husband has concerns about me not acquiring her debt and/or expenses when the time comes and he feels it will destroy us financially. I don't disagree with him.

The only way to contain the Street's excesses is with reforms so big, bold, and public they can't be watered down – busting up the biggest banks and resurrecting Glass-Steagall.

Economists are not very good at predicting how large deviations will be. And there are some underlying reasons for why you might see valuation differences. One would be that if you really think we're in a low-interest-rate environment. That means valuations, will, on average, be higher. So the question is, do you think that is a permanent phenomenon or a temporary phenomenon? And obviously when you are talking about stocks, but also to some extent commercial real estate, the tax code matters, and we've just had a tax code change. So those kinds of effects can have an impact on valuation. But I would say that real estate, like other asset classes, are now showing to be a bit higher than what they've been historically and that continues to be a little bit of a concern for me.

Some 28 U.S. states have so-called filial responsibility laws, which can be traced back to colonial times and (in theory) impose a duty on adult children to support their impoverished parents. Those states don't include New York. Here's a list of the other 28 that do have those laws, even if they don't practice them. One of those states is Pennsylvania, which did use filial responsibility to force an adult child to pay his mother's bill. In 2012, Pennsylvania court ruled that John Pittas must pay his mother's $93,000 nursing home bill after she moved to Greece. Otherwise, they are rarely enforced.

Rather than shifting the holdings of the domestic G50 strategy, Binger said his firm was suggesting that affiliated advisers with clients worried about U.S. stock valuations reduce exposure to the G50 and consider investing in the G40-I, because he believes global markets are a little bit cheaper than their U.S. counterparts.
Asia's high net worth population saw its wealth grow by less than 1% in 2018 (0.6% and 0.3%, respectively).

This competing effect has resulted in almost no change in the HNW population and its wealth in the region, it added.

Many employers offer some sort of contribution on the employee's behalf. When an employer contributes to the plan, it usually occurs in one of two ways. First, your employer may offer a contribution that does not depend upon your participation. These employer payments may be labeled as either profit-sharing or safe harbor contributions. Regardless of which type is offered, the employee does not have to add anything to receive the benefit. The second type of employer contribution is a matching contribution. To receive matching contributions, the employee must defer income into the plan.

Money-losing investors, and receivers like bankruptcy trustees and the FDIC, bring the largest global audit firms — PwC, Deloitte, KPMG and Ernst & Young — to court quite often. However, the Big 4 rarely go to trial because one catastrophic guilty verdict could put them out of business.

Funds, however, will ride this rally as long the charts tell them to do so.

The aggregate dividend yield for the S&P 500 is 2.07%, according to FactSet.

Some may also be splurging for a wedding — scary fact: the average American wedding costs about $35,000. The last thing someone in their 30s should do, though, is leave retirement to the wayside.

The U.S. market was popular with Chinese companies in 2018, when 32 of them listed, the highest number in nine years, according to Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital, a provider of IPO exchange-traded funds. Many turned to the U.S. because their home stock market was faring badly, she said. The Shanghai Composite ended the year down about 25%, its worst annual performance since 2008, the peak of the financial crisis. The Shenzhen Composite fell 33%, and the Hang Seng declined about 14%.
The slate of blockbuster film releases rivals that of 2015. Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen expects Viacom Inc.-owned US:VIA Paramount Pictures and Fox to bounce back from their soft box office performances in 2015. Paramount, which saw revenue drop 36% compared with 2014, is set to release Star Trek Beyond and another live-action Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film. The 2014 catalyst film grossed $191.2 million and was the studio's second highest-grossing film that year. Fox's revenue fell 27% in 2015, but the studio is banking on Kung Fu Panda 3, Deadpool, X-Men: Apocalypse and an Independence Day sequel being box office hits.
The transparency in those situations might be helpful for budgets, but it isn't necessarily, in reality, 'shoppable,' she said.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday the U.S. central bank can now be patient about further monetary policy and wait to see how conflicting signals from the market and the economy resolve themselves. In a conversation at the American Economics Association meeting in Atlanta, Powell said the central bank was open to changing course on rate hikes and reducing its balance sheet depending on how the economy evolves. In a brief opening remarks, Powell pushed back on the market's DJIA, -0.39% pessimism about the outlook, saying most of the hard data remain quite solid and suggest ongoing momentum going into 2019.

If the Democrats manage to pull off the upsets in Georgia, then a key difference this time around, in my view, is that many of those same Democrat players who were there in 2009 would likely use their latest opportunity to advance greater fiscal spending to support the economic recovery. In a more-pronounced economic recovery, we would expect an even further rise in Treasury rates, tightening of municipal and corporate bond spreads, weakening of the dollar, and higher performance of value stocks and emerging market equities, added Brian Levitt, global market strategist at Invesco, in a note ahead of the results.
Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said Friday that monetary policy is in a good place and this will allow the central bank to take the time to assess the economy before making any more policy moves. Mester said the central bank could pause or even stop tightening now depending on inflation. She said that the two rate hikes penciled in by the central bank for 2019 could happen and that would be a good sign that the economy was performing well. Mester said she didn't support any slowdown in the pace of the shrinking of the balance sheet but said if the economy weakened markedly that a change was possible. Pressed on whether she supported further rate hikes, Mester said she didn't have to vote now and would wait for more information.
At our EBI Conference a few months ago, Charley Ellis brought up the fact that there are 325,000 Bloomberg terminals worldwide (the premium data source for investment professionals), 120,000 CFA charterholders (plus another 250,000 candidates looking to obtain their CFA). Add to that the countless MBAs, PhDs, economists, quants and wanna-be Warren Buffett's and Stanley Druckenmiller's, and there is still a ton of brainpower looking to outperform the markets.
The bigger question, however, is whether it is worth the trouble of creating a whole new procedure when the real answer is to extend Social Security coverage to all state and local workers. Universal coverage would both offer better protection for workers and eliminate the equity problem.

Not all of Janus' new offerings are as noteworthy. Its thematic index ETFs for the health care sector—Janus Health & Fitness US:FITS, Janus Obesity US:SLIM, Janus US:ORG and Janus Long-Term Care OLD, -1.47% —seem gimmicky and dangerous, based more on generating cutesy tickers to market than on meeting legitimate investing goals. Each is focused on a sliver of an industry and is concentrated in just a handful of stocks. In the Long-Term Care ETF, for instance, just two stocks, Welltower US:HCN and Ventas VTR, -3.68% , account for 40% of its portfolio, while Nike NKE, -1.14% and adidas Group ADS, +0.18% ADDYY, -0.92% account for 37% of the Health & Fitness ETF. Highly concentrated portfolios are something Janus is known for historically, so I don't think that's particularly shocking, Cherney says.

1. It makes estate planning easier to think about (and sometimes even enjoyable). Only 54% of U.S. adults over 55 have a will that directs where their money will go once they pass away. And fewer than 30 percent of all Americans have an up-to-date will. One big reason so many of us die without making our wishes known to our loved ones and others is that dying is an event we may not want to contemplate. Framing a discussion in a more positive light — about the impact you would like to make, from saving the redwoods to supporting your local church or synagogue — triggers happy memories. That transforms a potentially miserable process into a source of joy.

Oklahoma City has a really strong and supportive arts community, says Kelsey Karper, one of the founders of Factory Obscura, an artist collective that creates wildly popular immersive art experiences.

While I never miss an opportunity to bring this up (at least not until he points out the cost of raising a child through college), I can't hold his advice against him. For one thing, that mine-in-an-alternative-universe $175,000 assumes that I wouldn't have cashed out at any point over the past nine years. That's certainly debatable; as someone who once decided to quit while he was ahead after winning $4 at a casino slot machine, I imagine I would've been pleased as punch once my investment returned, say, 20%. And if for some reason I stuck around, I probably would've declared victory after it doubled, tripled or quadrupled, at which point I still would have missed the bulk of what was to come. (Each time my hypothetical investment doubled, I told myself that the stock would surely begin a downtrend the second I jumped in.)

In the complex calculus that's required for the renting vs. buying decision, one variable stands out: Which is cheaper? If that seems like a tough question to answer, there's a good reason: crunch the data from America's largest cities, and you'll learn it's a perfectly split decision. According to an Urban Institute analysis, among 33 top metropolitan areas in the U.S., there are 17 places where buying is cheaper, and 16 where renting is cheaper. Home buying is a better option for those who plan to stay in one place for 3-5 years or more. It's also a good investment in many housing markets. According to the Urban Institute, here are 16 cities where buying is cheaper.

The Fed, like the world's other central banks, is steadily debasing the currency, in order to create inflation. A Google Ngrams search of books shows that use of the term inflation targeting began growing exponentially in the early 1990s, when the target was typically far below actual inflation. The idea that we actually want moderate positive inflation — price stability, not zero inflation — appears to have started to take shape in policy circles around the time of the 1990-1991 recession. Lawrence Summers argued that the public has an irrational resistance to the declining nominal wages that some would have to suffer in a zero-inflation regime.

I'm planning to divorce my husband of eight years, as he's never worked in this time or contributed to bills. We live in California, a community property state.

Revisit too, something we'll call your capacity for risk, how much money you can lose before it starts to adversely affect your proposed retirement lifestyle. Yes, it's good to know what percent declines your portfolio can suffer (down say 5% or 10%) without it adversely affecting your proposed standard of living in retirement. But it's also good to know the absolute dollar amount you can lose without it putting a damper on your future lifestyle.

The worry I have when I look at the results is if you are nervous about the market — and 95% expect moderate to high volatility this year and they say that high volatility makes them very uncomfortable — what happens by investor behavior is that people tend to withdraw with no sense of when to come back, said Bill Finnegan, chief marketing officer for the AMG Funds. You need a strategy as to how you will manage this, whether it is buy-and-hold or some investment policy … active or passive, because otherwise all you are doing is mixing strategies and making moves that feel right in the moment but that work against the long-term tactics that you know you should be following.

Slowdown ahead. Here we get to pure speculation. The economic expansion is in its ninth year. The new tax law will stimulate the economy, but it isn't clear how much further unemployment can fall.

This path isn't well-trod — it's windy and uneven, and unmarked in places. It's more like a windy hedge maze at times than a large thoroughfare with well-marked exits. Early retirement won't magically fix everything we wish was different about us or our lives, and it comes with its own set of stresses. To some of us, those new stresses are worth it, but we can only know that if we do some real introspection and planning.

The only way to win the health insurance game is to get the costs of health care under control, and the numbers say that Medicare is a much more effective mechanism than private insurance. People who care about cost control should move cautiously when messing with Medicare.
The company would not confirm what it has offered in the case of previous gastrointestinal illness outbreaks.

Move here if you want to: join a tightknit community.
The pandemic also has the potential to move up the date in which Social Security's reserves run out of money, or lessen the monthly checks beneficiaries receive in the future.
After several high-profile breaches involving internet routers, it would be wise to change the default password on any device in your home that's connected to the internet. Often when you purchase an internet router, it comes with a default string of letters and numbers as the password. These passwords are easily available on online forums, on the dark web and the regular internet, making it possible for hackers to get into your home network and every device connected to it. Changing your home network password is one of the most simple ways to avoid getting hacked.

Bono likens strengthening willpower to becoming stronger physically. If we can get ourselves to exercise willpower in small, everyday behaviors — maybe we resist the temptation to get the candy bar when we're in the checkout line at the grocery store — those are the opportunities that allow our self-regulatory strength to grow. The more you practice, the easier it becomes.

Meanwhile, the continued democratization of investing, as evidenced by growth in zero-fee index funds and fractional trading offered by brokers and funds, as well as the race to zero-fee online stock trading by a number of high-profile brokerages, could provide the second catalyst, he said.

In reviewing six years of financial filings by Beam and its predecessor, Fortune Brands, I found little reference by management to such terms as quality or taste that might support the trend toward higher sales and profits. Instead, I found phraseology like we will upweight marketing investment in the second half behind our most exciting brands and innovations, as in an 8K filing by the company in August 2012. And Beam's annual report to shareholders that same year promoted a TV advertisement with Jimmy Fallon promoting its Maker's Mark brand: It is what it isn't, the copy writer attested.

The key is to take an inventory and pay attention to how you feel (what fuels and drains you) so you can create a path that is aligned with who you are.
The bottom line is when you add it all up, and then you start adding, you know, 300,000 fake ballots, then the other thing they said is in Fulton County and other areas – and this may or may not be true, this just came up this morning – that they are burning their ballots, that they are shredding, shredding ballots and removing equipment. They're changing the equipment on the – on the Dominion machines. And you know, that's not legal. And they supposedly shredded I think they said 300 pounds of – 3,000 pounds of ballots, and that just came to us as a report today. And you know, it's – it's a very sad situation.
It is going to take some time to see the depth and breadth of those three issues. We should not take any further actions until these issues are resolved for better or worse, he said.
The Scottsdale car show from Jan. 12 to Jan. 20 is one of the biggest classic car shows of the year. Estrada's Rolls has no published reserve price. The TV star could not immediately be reached for comment. (One of the three 1978 Pontiac Firebird Formulas used in the 1970s TV show The Rockford Files, which starred James Garner is also on the block. It too has no reserve price.)
Its declines cemented the dollar's worst weekly performance against the yen since August 2013 — and its worst weekly performance against the euro since early December of last year — as Chinese stocks and the yuan dropped sharply, with global ramifications. The dollar was down 2.6% against the yen on the week, while the euro rose 0.6% against the dollar.
Too bad its stock crashed and burned despite this.
This is what I call the uncle stage. This is when panicked investors throw in the towel and take action. They want to get out of the market while they still have something left. At this stage, there is huge downside volume and double-digit declines on the indexes. At the end of Stage 4, many people vow to never buy stocks again. We are not even close to this stage yet. Typically, we hit bottom when investors capitulate after losses of 20% to 50% in their stock portfolios.

The newly-enacted law blocking surprise bills for out-of-network care is a big deal, Kelmar and Donovan both said. This is a significant improvement for patients because it is protecting them from prices they had no control over avoiding, Kelmar said.
The Labor Department reported that 156,000 jobs were added in December to cap off the sixth straight year in which the economy created more than 2 million new jobs. Economists polled by MarketWatch had predicted a 180,000 increase in new nonfarm jobs. The unemployment rate rose to 4.7% from 4.6%.
To take the leap, you need to fundamentally believe that it's never too late to transition into a career that aligns with who you are.

But that was before deducting all the costs involved in buying, owning and eventually selling the cars. Transaction, storage, transportation, insurance, maintenance and restoration costs can be substantial for classic cars, and vastly surpass the costs of (financial) asset classes, they admit. They calculate that the commissions on buying, and later selling ,a car can add up to 25% of the total value. Even car auctioneers concede these are unlikely to be below 20%.
The Green New Deal sends a positive message of what government can do, for this generation of citizens and the next. It can deliver today what those who are suffering today need most — good jobs. And it can deliver the protections from climate change that are needed for the future.
They spent this money in order to get the government off their backs and to show the American people what they could do with that new-won freedom. Well, they sure showed the American people.

The biggest boon to investors in Facebook has been the company's continued growth in profitability now that it has reached what is arguably critical mass for its social network.

After the release of the earnings report, the stock bolted 7.5% to clear a head-and-shoulders continuation pattern on volume that was 277% above average. The move cleared a cheater entrance (one that is below the top of a sideways basing pattern) above last week's high of $77.83. Aggressive speculators might consider entering around Jan. 19's close of $80.50, which is 3% past the cheater entry.
The U.S. economy during the Coolidge administration was very successful, but the boom ended badly in 1929, just after Coolidge stepped down, with the stock market crash and the beginning of the Great Depression. During the 1930s, the 1920s were looked upon wistfully, but also as a time of fakery and cheating.
To return to the refrain: sequencing and pacing matter. It would have made more sense to begin with creating new jobs before the old jobs were destroyed, to ensure that the profits of the oil and coal companies were taxed, and the hidden subsidies they receive eliminated, before asking those who are barely getting by to pony up more.
There is a very easy fix for this. Simply divide the maximum dollar contribution of $18,500 by your annual salary and contribute the resulting percentage of your pay. So, in the example above, you would set up your contribution amount at 12.33% ($18,500 divided by $150,000 = 0.1233 or 12.33%). Contributing 12.33% of your pay for 12 months will earn you $1,250 more employer match than contributing 15% of your pay will for 10 months.
Of course, the problem with debt is that it is not free money even at low interest rates. The interest on the debt diverts capital from productive investments.
Your bracket determines the value of your itemized deductions and tax-advantaged investments. Someone in a low tax bracket, for example, doesn't get much value from write-offs, such as mortgage interest deductions or investments such as municipal bonds or variable annuities, that can benefit people in higher brackets.
Alternatively, family counseling and mediation are the only options left open to you. A family intervention as a kind of emotional or moral leverage might move your son in the right direction. From what you say, however, my hunch is your son would dilly-dally, putz and futz, obfuscate and drag this out interminably until your time on this earth is over and he keeps your life savings.
But perhaps the biggest advantage Mexico has is something Donald Trump doesn't want to talk about: Mexico has free-trade agreements with more countries than anyone else. Those treaties mean that, if you want to export cars to North America, to South America, or even to Europe, it makes sense to build them in Mexico.
To do better than other investors, you have to be different, especially when they have bunched up in a crowd. This is called contrarianism.

And yet a little light retouching can go a long way for some job seekers. Frown lines, dark circles under the eyes could give the impression of being tired or stressed out, experts say, so freshening up pictures can give you an extra edge on the competition.

Example #2: My approach helped me beat a well-known expert in biotech in an informal faceoff. In a March 24 column, I asked biotech analyst Michael Yee at Jefferies for his favorite names. I also suggested two of my own. By the end of the year, his three were up 1%. Mine were up 123%. Mine also did better than the 48% gain for the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF IBB, +0.70% and the 90% gain for the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF XBI, +1.12% ).

12. Revisit your estate plan, says Zagarola. Review your wills to ensure that your wishes will be met at your death. Review the beneficiary designations of retirement accounts and life insurance to ensure they marry up with your estate planning wishes, he explains.
Hardly anyone in the economic profession is willing to bet it will happen this year. They say it will take months or longer before any of Trump's key economic proposals, such as tax cuts, are put in place. Nor will a quick rush to get rid of regulations be enough.
As with most tax questions, the answer is yes and no. In the simplest situations, taxpayers can now file the postcard-sized base Form 1040 and be done with it. Good for them. These folks may be able to dispense with paid tax preparers. But if your tax situation has any degree of complexity, preparing your 2018 return won't be any easier than before. But it will be different. And your paid preparer may charge more than before as a result. Sorry about that.
The return figures for classic cars were also flattered by a mania for Ferraris that peaked several years ago. There was a crazy Ferrari boom, Cardinale adds. The Ferrari boom was incredible. It was the hype. There's only so many people that can play in that level of the market. Ferrari could not be reached for comment.
All four benchmarks set intraday records, rising for the third straight session. The S&P closed at a record in each of the first three trading days of the new year, the first time it has done so since 1964, according to The Wall Street Journal Market Data Group. The Nasdaq did the same, for the first time since 1999.
European stocks finished lower Monday, weighed as the euro continued to march up further into three-year highs, giving a key regional benchmark its third drop in four sessions.
U.S. stocks end higher Friday, starting the Donald Trump presidency in the green, but the major indexes log their second straight weekly decline as uncertainty about the new administration lingers. See full story.

Example #4: Contrarian bets based on my system even worked against well-known investing experts like Warren Buffett and his team at Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B, +0.20% . They cleared out of airlines in the first quarter, presumably on Covid-19 fears. But my system favored the group. Seven airline stocks taken from my stock letter for this May 26 MarketWatch column advanced 43.6% by the year end vs. 25.6% for the S&P 500. My airlines portfolio in this column included the ones Buffett sold.
Our issue with transparency is it is only a tool, it is not the savior, Caitlin Donovan, senior director at the National Patient Advocate Foundation. It's an open question what disclosed prices will do for insurance rates in the future, she and others told MarketWatch.

Symptom checkers that function on the same principle as chatbots are already available, free of charge. However, these rely on the user inputting symptoms and complaints manually. We yearn for one that can make predictions and suggestions based on a user's data, like sleep tracking, heart rate and activity collected via wearables. With such features, those bots can help users make healthier choices without having to drag themselves to their doctor.

Many other banks and card issuers had already discontinued the practice, making the ability to sign up with a cosigner rare.
When stock prices do eventually fall, companies that performed un-economic buybacks would find themselves with financial losses on their hands, more debt on their balance sheets, and fewer opportunities to grow in the future. Equally disturbing, the many CEOs who sanctioned buybacks are much wealthier and unaccountable for their actions.
And on Jan. 11 he told MarketWatch he would still buy them, even though they had risen since Dec. 5.
The downside of using the reconciliation procedure is it could take longer than Democrats want and its use would require the bill to be more narrow in scope than they would prefer.
Her best advice is to think about your assets -- your skills as well as your property -- and use them to leverage a new life. And it's never too late. I couldn't have done this in my 20s, she said. I was too ambitious. But in my 40s and 50s, I've realized there's more to life, and I want to check that out. Now I have more time to pursue things I had put on the back burner.
Some members have said jokingly that they could see a romance part taking off, he says. We'll see where it goes.
Within the first 100 days of my administration, I will require the secretary of the Treasury Department to establish a Too-Big-to Fail list of commercial banks, shadow banks and insurance companies whose failure would pose a catastrophic risk to the United States economy without a taxpayer bailout.
Time's Up is hoping to strengthen sexual harassment and discrimination laws across the country and push for equal pay between genders in all industries, not just Hollywood. The movement formed following revelations of decades of sexual misconduct and rape allegations against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein in the fall. Since then, dozens of powerful and prominent men in the movie and TV industry have been implicated in misconduct.
It sounds like your mother has fallen under the influence of her son, or has decided to make you and your younger brother the source of her fears and anxieties. Or both. If she is of sound body and mind, she has every right to renege on her promise to give you the money for a down payment. Even if your mother died and left her house to your older brother in her will, undue influence is notoriously difficult to prove in court. There's so much psychology and so much that is unknown about these kinds of cases.
I think what we are experiencing right now is a tectonic shift underneath our feet, where women, and men, are feeling like we can no longer not say the truth, Ferrera said. And when the truth is said, there is maybe a ripple in our culture right now that is going to allow for there to be a change.
Renting may be better than owning to build wealth — if you're disciplined enough to invest the money you save by not owning a property, a 2017 study suggested. When considering buying and building wealth through equity appreciation versus renting, and reinvesting in a portfolio of stocks and bonds, property appreciation does not change the results, co-author Ken Johnson, real estate economist at Florida Atlantic University's College of Business, said.
Amazon has said that the new headquarters will employ 50,000 people — but the full impact on the site selected will be much larger when taking into account other companies that may follow in Amazon's footsteps.
The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report published in October estimated that the world has at most 12 years to make the drastic changes needed to stop temperatures from rising beyond the Paris agreement's 1.5 degrees Celsius target. That report was followed in November by the Fourth National Climate Assessment conducted by the U.S. government, which warned that average global temperatures could rise as much as 5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Such a rise would make parts of earth uninhabitable and would make the entire world uninsurable, creating billions of dollars in economic losses.
In addition to the job market, can we talk about how cool Cleveland has gotten in the past few years? The city has had a renaissance and transformed into a surprisingly hip, youthful and creative city brimming with an energy of newness and rejuvenation — perfect for anyone looking to tap into that energy in their own life.
Your case is a classic, the classic, example of why you should discuss your approach to finances before you get married. It doesn't just impact your happiness, it has multiple effects on your peace of mind, your children's future, their education, your ability to retire early or at all, insurance against the kind of health emergency that can bankrupt families and cost them their home.
I left my Maryland home on a Friday morning knowing my daughter, living nearly 2,000 miles away in Utah, had been in labor since the night before. I was worried that we hadn't heard anything but was not about to call. When you're in labor, probably the last thing you want is a phone call from Dad saying, Um, what's up?
Some people know which causes they would like to assist; they've been working on issues close to their heart for years. Others prefer to explore and understand the impact they may have.
Secretary Reich is right. Real Wall Street reform means breaking up the big banks and re-establishing firewalls that separates risk taking from traditional banking.
Oil futures rose on Monday, buoyed by optimism tied to trade talks between the U.S. and China as well as output reductions by major oil producers, but settled well below the session's highs as Goldman Sachs cut its price forecast on worries over energy demand and the potential for a supply surplus.
To do this, set up an account at a well-known manager service like Lastpass, 1Password, Dashlane, Keeper, or Password Boss. While there is a negligible risk the password manager itself could be hacked, experts say any manager is still safer than trying to remember your own passwords.
Below are some of the initial reactions from analysts:
The firm has been going through a transformation program under Potts after trouble integrating rival Safeway in 2003, which meant it was late launching convenience stores and online. It also failed to modernize, having outdated systems that meant, until recently, its supermarkets had to order stock by pen and paper.
All this is just a glimpse of what one part of one big policy difference—on fiscal policy—between the two parties in power would mean for the most of Americans in the immediate and near future. Over the longer run, it means much more. For it is now well-established that America is structurally set up for minority rule. And that minority is the Republican Party.

3. Charities are ready to celebrate you. A new bequest can mean a dramatic increase in a nonprofit's ability to have impact. Many organizations have legacy societies to honor people who have put a gift in their future plans. People within the legacy society are invited to special events, given gifts and warmly thanked. The Cleveland Museum of Art, for example, has yearly receptions and tours for members of its Legacy Society. Save the Redwoods League does something similar. These events give you the opportunity to meet like-minded people and receive recognition for your generosity.

The U.S. stock market has enjoyed strong gains thus far in 2018, with nearly every one of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors higher on the year. However, one sector, which has been lagging behind the market despite positive earnings news, could be poised for a pronounced move higher.

Nationwide, about 30% of economics majors in college are women, she said, suggesting a lack of role models as well as an implicit bias as reasons for women's apparent disinterest in the field. She said research shows women economists receive less credit than men for co-authoring academic papers, especially when the co-author is a man.
Markets require a dovish pause at the very least, he said.
However, an equally important factor here is zoning laws. Seattle's housing boom isn't simply a reflection of people's excitement about Amazon and the tech sector more broadly — though that certainly contributed. The city's zoning officials were not prepared to handle the onslaught of interest in new construction. As a result, building starts have seriously lagged housing demand, thus fueling more competition and driving prices sky-high.
Regular trading for WTI was closed Monday for the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday. Over the weekend, an agreement lifting sanctions on Iran was implemented—lifting limits on Iran's ability to sell oil on the world market.
In a Saturday telephone call, President Donald Trump urged Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to overturn President-elect Joe Biden's victory in the state.

Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets, said momentum for a rise in gold has been aided by uncertainty raised about the pace of rate increases after the release on Wednesday of minutes from most recent meeting of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.
Right. That starts with understanding your strengths and weaknesses, setting expectations that are realistic. I cannot hit the ball 300 yards; I know that. Likewise, someone with $10,000 who has a plan to have a million dollars by the end of the year — that's not realistic.

Lifestyle is one major factor in getting cancer, research shows. The odds of getting upwards of 40% of all cancers could be reduced with a change in daily habits, according to a 2015 report published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Oncology. That means maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking, lowering the amount of alcohol consumption and working out two and a half hours a week.
Meb Faber of Cambria Investment Management explains that an investment adviser's most challenging task may helping them guard against taking undo risks in buying foreign assets.
If we really are in tune with ourselves we know when to leave that job — we're just afraid. I always say, 'what you fear controls you.' If fear is your motivating factor you're not in a good place for your career or your life. So know it, it's getting in tune with yourself to say, 'I'm going to get out there, and I'm going to make a change.' The change may be scary, but I've never heard anyone say after that 'I want to go back.'
But the economics of manufacturing in Mexico (and in many other low-cost regions around the world) are too compelling for any multinational corporation to ignore. Trump can probably make it prohibitively expensive to import anything into the United States, but that wouldn't reverse Mexico's advantages in producing for a global market, especially if our trading partners retaliate with tariffs or otherwise restrict U.S. exports.
But you can't just spot a crowd and say they are wrong. That is too simple. You also have to have a solid thesis based on fundamentals. Because not all crowds are wrong. For example, the crowd loved Tesla TSLA, +3.68% at $600 in early December. Then it went above $720 by the first day of trading this year. Anyone who was short got creamed. Likewise, the crowd loved technology in 1996. It went on to post phenomenal gains over the next four years.

Bernanke said the Fed's monetary policy has had beneficial effects since the pandemic started wreaking havoc on the economy in March.
To face the precipitous price declines, companies have cut their expenses, laid off employees, and sold so-called non-core assets. Spending ticked higher by the end of last year, and Wall Street expects that trend to continue.

Moreover, that 5% or 6% comes with a heap of short-term risk.

The divorce or separation instrument cannot state that the payment in question is not alimony or effectively stipulate that it is not alimony because it is not deductible by the payer or not includable in the payee's gross income.
Patients could even save money on their medications by asking doctors and pharmacists about less-expensive versions. Many Americans assume medical expenses at set at a fixed price, but they're not, and patients can comparison shop to reduce costs. Patients can lose thousands of dollars a year by not looking around before going with a medical procedure or prescription, researchers at Harvard, Yale and Columbia Universities found. Fewer than 1% of individuals used price transparency tools, including websites or apps, to find the best prices for medical procedures and medications.
They're also indicative of just how costly craft beer's massive growth can be. When you have to increase capacity, take on new employees, pay more for ingredients and materials and open new facilities, that all costs millions of dollars that you, as a relatively small brewer, often don't have. We are seeing brewers that have been at it for 20 years or more sell part or all of themselves just to keep afloat, and we're seeing breweries like Saint Archer and Golden Road, which aren't even five years old, sell to maintain their massive growth and exit an increasingly crowded market. As Anheuser-Busch InBev's purchases in late December reminded us, brewery acquisitions aren't done by a long stretch. Brewery ownership doesn't matter to most drinkers yet, but a rapidly shifting beer landscape may change that in years to come. We expect to be quite busy tallying up the mergers and acquisitions and writing the post-mortems in 2016.

For example, millennial drivers living with their parents typically pay far higher annual premiums ($1,750) versus other demographics, a Compare.com study determined.

However, Verizon is only buying the core business of Yahoo, and the company owns a lot more than that.

Indeed, some countries are still pursuing the foolish notion of herd immunity, despite scientific evidence suggesting that no such protection exists for this disease. There are four common (though rarely remarked upon) coronaviruses that infect up to 15% of the world's population each year, and that come back year after year, often reinfecting the same people. Assuming that SARS-CoV-2 is no exception, any country that places its hopes on a herd-immunity strategy will be endangering the rest of us year after year.

It's important to be saving for retirement while doing all these things at the same time, said Alexander Rupert, assistant portfolio manager at Laurel Tree Advisors in Cleveland, Ohio. Retirement savings should be growth-oriented for someone in their 30s, he said, which means they should be stashing money away whatever they can and considering a high risk tolerance. Market ups and downs will affect the portfolio, but young investors should remember their money (and they) are in it for the long haul, Rupert said.
So in 2016, I wondered What if I throw all singles I get in change into savings? Under the system of 2015, if I spent $1.47 someplace and paid with a $10 bill, I would put $1.53 in the jar (the 53 cents in change, plus a dollar), with $7 left in my wallet. In 2016, all of the singles in my change went to the jar, so there would have been a fiver in my billfold and $3.53 in savings.

There's a mistaken consensus that tweaking [limit up, limit down] will solve all our problems. That's a smokescreen to avoid addressing tougher issues like market fragmentation.

This is the second time this year that Disney had promoted a free food deal for this summer. Disney previously announced a free dining promotion back in January, which some perceived as a sign that fewer people are booking trips to the Most Magical Place on Earth this summer. Most people are guessing that they released it early to incentivize travel to Disney World, said Sue Pisaturo, owner of Small World Vacations, a Disney-authorized vacation planning company. It seems that people are holding off making plans until Disney announces when Star Wars Land will open later this year.
The goal of doing no discretionary spending at all for a year may sound insurmountable, but many claim it reset their views of money for a long time to come. So whether you plan to do a no spend day, week, month, or entire year, here are some tips to help you get started.

Gold, which is priced in dollars, often trades inversely with the dollar, as moves in the U.S. unit can influence the attractiveness of the precious metal to holders of other currencies.
For instance, Disney is also offering up to 25% off hotel stays at certain resorts from May 28 through August 28. Those savings could potentially outweigh the value of the free dining plan, depending on the room.
The World Happiness Report was released in March 2017 and involved polling of 1,000 residents per country by research organization Gallup, and was put together by SDSN, a group linked to the United Nations and led in part by economist Jeffrey D.

The interviews are conducted by phone and face-to-face.

Gasoline prices jumped 10.7% in 2017. Although gas accounts for just 3.6% of aggregate consumer spending, that large price increase boosted the CPI by 0.35 percentage points. The prices of food to be consumed at home rose 1.6%, but because food accounts for a somewhat larger 13.6% of spending, even that modest increase was enough to boost the CPI by 0.07 percentage points.
Get Out and Lady Bird were also critical darlings—Lady Bird won the Golden Globe for best comedy—but some thought the films may be too small and their directors too new for both to garner Academy nominations.

In a note to clients, Themis Trading said they have raised this issue consistently over the past few years and even published a paper titled Phantom Indexes where they called on the index providers to change their calculation methodology.

This change will never be put in motion by the company itself; it has to come from users. We need to become social again without relying heavily on social media. Social behavior doesn't come from online tools, but from genuine human interaction that starts in our families, continues in schools and flourishes in adulthood. Online platforms are useful tools, but they should never be the main way we communicate. If this trend continues, human beings will drift further apart, which in a globally connected world is an irony in itself.
As MarketWatch's Tax Guy Bill Bischoff wrote, the new law limits your deduction for state and local income and property taxes to a combined total of $10,000 ($5,000 if you use married filing separate status). Foreign real property taxes can no longer be deducted. So no more property tax write-offs for your place in Cabo. However, you can still choose to deduct state and local sales taxes instead of state and local income taxes.

The Ford announcement reveals the hidden danger of Trump's bullying tactics: Corporations may be eager to give Trump some credit for decisions they'd make anyway, which will bolster Trump's confidence that there's nothing wrong with American manufacturing that can't be solved by getting tough.

In my book, I talk about the sorrowful, joyful experiences in my life. My dad died of lung cancer when I was 14. It was just terrible; he was my hero and I was with him at the time and wasn't expecting it. That was the most sad and sorrowful I've been in my whole life. Seventeen years ago, I founded a grief center for children in southwest Missouri — the Lost & Found Grief Center. When I work with teens who have a parent who died, can you imagine the joy I feel when I leave that group?

Another significant change has been flying under the radar: Janus, the poster child for active management, has been making forays into exchange-traded funds. In the last 10 months, it has launched eight ETFs, bringing its total to 10 after it acquired two VelocityShares ETFs in 2014. Davitt says such ETF launches are inexpensive for Janus, but he doubts they will have much of an impact on the company's bottom line. Trying to play the passive game in ETFs is very difficult now, he says. The winners have been decided.

If you breach 300,000 on claims, then you're skating on thin ice. We're nowhere near that, said Mullaney. Data like this continues to demonstrate the positive global macroeconomic backdrop that means economies around the world, including the U.S., should be OK for the foreseeable future. Strong labor market data will help earnings, which in turn will help stock prices.
In the wake of Donald Trump's election, many are looking to the stock market to learn what is in store for the economy. While much of the short-run action likely reflects movements in market confidence or uncertainty, upcoming decisions on corporate taxes or labor policy may influence what shareholders ultimately receive. Our research implies that expectations regarding redistribution, rather than forecasts of overall economic performance, may play a crucial role in driving stock prices as the political agenda is revealed.
The international stock markets have had a torrid New Year opening — but it should have been fairly clear that they were heading for a correction. I remember a member of the European Central Bank executive board telling a small London dinner in April 2013 that equities in the German Dax were in bubble territory. Since then the German market (aided by the weak euro and the ECB's asset purchases) has moved 20% higher.
Such a move would bring the central bank's benchmark one-week repo rate to 11% (it is presently at 8%). So-called repo rates are short-term repurchasing agreements that typically allow financial firms to borrow from the central bank in exchange for putting up certain securities as collateral. Meanwhile, the overnight-lending rate would rise to 11.5% from 8.5%, and the overnight-borrowing rate would rise to 10.25%, from 7.25%.
The shortage of homes for sale nationwide has made it much more difficult to find a home to purchase, meaning that buyers are struggling to take advantage of the record-low mortgage rates on offer.

In the past, many brokers and financial advisors have discouraged clients from paying down debt. That way, the advisor ends up with more money to manage and, of course, can charge fees or commissions for doing so. But from now on, you should be leery of advisors who insist that carrying a big mortgage is the best strategy, unless they offer a detailed justification based on your individual tax situation.

In rare cases he has even learned of toys being sent to children randomly in the mail under the guise of them winning a prize in order to hack into the family's network and obtain sensitive information. Never accept a toy, especially a connected one, from an unknown source.
Those strategies had performed brilliantly for years, but all of a sudden they stopped working. The assumption was that a large fund made some bad bets and received margin calls because they used leverage to amplify their returns, requiring them to sell anything they could. And since many of the funds used similar approaches, many fund managers capitulated after large losses, which led to even more selling.

The tax planning objective of carried interest arrangements is to trade current fee income that would immediately be treated as high-taxed ordinary income and be subject to federal employment taxes for a partnership profits interest that is expected to generate future long-term capital gains that will be taxed at lower rates. Nice. You can see why this ultra-favorable tax treatment of carried interests is controversial.
Now's a good time to review whether your psyche, not just your portfolio, can handle all this volatility.

Slower growth for Medicare is not a new phenomenon. Between 1988 and 2015, private insurers experienced average annual increases in spending per enrollee of 7%, while annual increases in Medicare spending per enrollee averaged 5.6% (see Figure 2). And Medicare's performance has been even better recently. Since 2009, the rate of growth for Medicare has been less than half of that for private insurers (4.1% per year for private insurers versus 1.8% per year for Medicare).

More than a month later, I was contacted by a company representative agreeing to pay me $800: $700 for the EU Regulation 261/2004, $50 for my taxi home after my first canceled flight, and $50 for food I ate at the airport. The $800 I received minus the $100 in costs incurred at the airport and $260 in money I lost on the Airbnb left me with $440 in profit from my failed Paris trip. I may use that money toward planning another vacation to Europe in the new year. And what airline will I chose? Despite all the delays — Norwegian.

In golf, I might hit the one-in-a-million shot and get through those 15 trees and land on the green. Whereas if I chip out to the fairway, I'm definitely not going make it to the green, but I'm guaranteed to get out safely and maybe my third shot is on the green. In investing, it's the exact same thing. If you want to get the potential reward of a portfolio that's 100% invested in stocks and you're willing to take that risk, fine.

It is possible to financially benefit from that fame, but the returns are minimal for most people. Lane estimates that former contestants can make about $2,000 to $3,000 for appearances at bars or other venues, and promoting products on personal social media accounts usually doesn't add up to a livable salary unless you've gained more than a million followers. It's not a way to make a living, it is more of a supplemental way to get something out of being on the show.
When you reached the point in your letter where you said your had signed over your savings account, my heart sank. I knew how this would end. Not that I'm clairvoyant, but because (a) people do bad things, (b) that was a riskier position than, say, giving him health-care power of attorney or trust and (c) you were writing a letter to the Moneyist and, the nature of the beast, is that they often end badly.

Think about having a similar personalized chatbot that's accessible via your smart device and with additional health and lifestyle features. This chatty virtual being can wake you up at the appropriate time based on your sleep pattern and advise you to take your antihistamines as the pollen concentration is particularly high during your commute that day, before you even get out of bed. It can even recommend what you should consume for each meal based on your nutrigenomic profile. It could find the best words for you to motivate you to go to the gym. It could find the best jokes that help you get into a good mood. But would you rather bend to the rules of an AI, essentially forgoing your freedom of choice, than experience life based more on your own will?

Under current law, the federal income tax basis of an inherited capital-gain asset is stepped up fair market value as of the decedent's date of death. So, if heirs sell inherited capital-gain assets, they only owe federal capital gains tax on the post-death appreciation, if any. This provision can be a huge tax-saver for greatly-appreciated inherited assets — such as personal residences that were acquired many years ago for next to nothing and are now worth millions. The Biden plan would eliminate this tax-saving provision.

Or at least, one cannot make vodka by hand at the volume required for a nationally marketed brand like Tito's. No reasonable consumer could believe otherwise.

A long list of resolutions makes it less likely you'll be able to do all of them, so order them. If you already feel as if you're being spread too thin, you likely will not be able to keep multiple New Year's resolutions, says Carpenter. To edit your list, first rank your resolutions in order of importance and then keep only the top few. This gives you a better chance of meeting your goals.
Finally, there is also the problem of information control and artificial influence. By being able to pay for visibility, individuals and businesses are capable of fabricating the truth and using their reach to further their agenda.

MR. MEADOWS: Well, Mr. President, this is Mark. Let me – let me just – it sounds like we've got two different sides agreeing that we can look at those areas, and I assume that we can do that within the next 24 to 48 hours to go ahead and get that reconciled so that we can look at the two claims and making sure that we get the access to the secretary of state's data to either validate or invalidate the claims that have been made. Is that correct?

In late 2003, fraudsters began running the TBW fraud using the COLB accounts by having TBW sell Colonial 99% participation interests in mortgages that had already been sold to other investors. That helped conceal TBW's overdraft by making it appear on Colonial's financial statements as if Colonial owned an interest in legitimate COLB mortgages. Colonial's 99% participation interest would have been represented by a participation certificate held as collateral for Colonial in its vault until Colonial was paid for its 99% participation interest in the underlying mortgages.

My opponent says that, as a senator, she told bankers to cut it out and end their destructive behavior. But, in my view, establishment politicians are the ones who need to cut it out. The reality is that Congress doesn't regulate Wall Street. Wall Street, its lobbyists and their billions of dollars regulate Congress. We must change that reality, and as president I will.

The judge wrote that, instead of looking at the actual documents, PwC relied on TBW CEO Lee Farkas, to confirm the key information about the collateral underlying the Colonial credit facility for TBW.

Generally, an employer match is somewhere between 3% to 6%, but it could be more or less. The match can be made using one of many formulas. A common matching formula may be stated as a dollar for dollar match up to 3% of pay. Under this scenario, to receive the full match, you would have to contribute 3% to your account. Every time you contribute a dollar, your employer would match 100% of your contribution up to the first 3% of your pay. If you contributed 2%, the employer would match 2%. However, if you were to contribute 4%, the employer would only be obligated to match 3%. Of course, if you did not contribute anything, the match would be zero.

Rosengren: We've intentionally pushed long-term rates down by having a big balance sheet. We've chosen a path which will not disrupt financial markets which means that our balance sheet comes down quite slowly. Until we have more normalized the balance sheet, it is not surprising that long rates are lower than they otherwise would be and it is not just what the U.S. is doing, it is what Japan and Europe are doing. So they are still expanding their balance sheets, even though we've been pulling back, and so that also is pushing down long-term rates as well.
MarketWatch spoke with Rosengren as he was preparing to give his first speech of the year on the economic outlook. In his remarks, he said low inflation has so far allowed the Fed to pursue very gradual rate hikes.
But it is more than the symbolism of the New Deal that is being invoked now. It is its animating purpose: putting people back to work, in the way that FDR did for the U.S., with its crushing unemployment of the time. Back then, that meant investments in rural electrification, roads, and dams.
And just like that, the bulls came charging back.
Weird launch, maybe they thought of it this morning, he said, before laughing and suggesting he may have gone too far with his last comment.
This reading implies a significant level of potential longer-term risk, he says. If the market does start to head meaningfully lower, this condition could exacerbate the decline, given the amount of capital with the potential to exit the market. In such an event, the substantial potential risk could, thus, become manifested risk.
Weak production: Across 2017, gold mining GDX, -1.72% was incredibly anemic, prompting a report from ANZ that noted gold output was at its lowest point since the financial crisis, with risks only getting greater. There are a host of factors at play, from cash-strapped companies like Freeport McMoRan FCX, -1.91% closing underperforming sites to new regulatory policies for miners in Indonesia and South Africa. But the collective result is less gold coming out of the ground, which should benefit gold investors in 2018.

You can be generous with your time and your love and support, and not use inheritance as a cudgel or proxy for love.

Walking away from this farm is a gift you can give your childhood self.
The short-term and medium-term fluctuations of the market are unpredictable, and my timing advice is simple: Buy when you have the money available to invest, ideally using dollar-cost averaging, and sell when you need the money.

So, to those on Wall Street who may be listening today, let me be very clear. Greed is not good. In fact, the greed of Wall Street and corporate America is destroying the fabric of our nation. And, here is a New Year's Resolution that I will keep if elected president. If you do not end your greed, we will end it for you.
Marcus described a major edge for Aurelius over traditional private-equity companies. Private-equity firms never want to take a company through bankruptcy, he said.

The writing has been on the wall for some time. It has been in straightforward English and not Mandarin. Clearly, if the Chinese authorities wish — as they certainly do — for their currency to become a reserve asset, then the yuan USDCNY, +0.03% cannot be equivalent to the dollar. If it were, there would be no point in the currency entering the SDR.
And so my message to you today is straightforward: If elected president, I will rein in Wall Street so they can't crash our economy again.

What I'm hopeful for is, is there some way that we can – we can find some kind of an agreement to look at this a little bit more fully? You know, the president mentioned Fulton County, but in some of these areas where there seems to be a difference of where the facts seem to lead. And so, Mr. Secretary, I was hopeful that, you know, in a spirit of cooperation and compromise, is there something that we can at least have a discussion to look at some of these allegations to find a path forward that's less litigious?
Late Tuesday, Aerohive warned that fourth-quarter revenue would be in the ballpark of $37 million, following its previous forecast of $40 million to $42 million.

In 1980, Congress passed legislation to require credit unions to cap interest rates on their loans at no more than 15 percent. And, that law has worked well.

Rosengren: No, I wouldn't phrase it that way. Our dual mandate goal would be that we have to get to 2% inflation and get to what we believe is a sustainable unemployment rate. The unemployment rate right now is at 4.1% so we're already lower than where we think we need to be. My own view is what the sustainable unemployment rate would be more like 4.7%. If you look at the Blue Chip forecasts, which just came out, they are actually getting it down to 3.7% in 2019. So we are actually moving in the opposite direction. I do think that we have to gradually tighten and I don't want to overshoot on the unemployment rate so much that it becomes very difficult to get back to a sustainable unemployment rate without having a recession.

Cryptocurrencies can't compete: Lest you think the crypto craze sapped demand for gold, it's important to remember that the nice appreciation for the precious metal in 2017 came even amid bitcoin's big run.

Furthermore, even after the Cboe launched bitcoin futures in late 2017, Goldman Sachs reported no discernible outflow of gold as traders and institutional investors were given another fashionable way to play the crypto market. Gold is a haven for a reason, and no fashionable asset craze can change that.

This so-called technical termination rule is generally unfavorable because: (1) it can require the filing of two short-period tax returns for the tax year in which the technical termination occurs, (2) it restarts the depreciation periods for the partnership's (LLC's) depreciable assets, and (3) it terminates favorable tax elections that were made by the partnership (LLC). Thankfully, the TCJA repeals the technical termination rule, effective for partnership (LLC) tax years beginning in 2018 and beyond.

Valeant would have been required to revise its revenue recognition and inventory accounting approaches regarding Philidor activity three times in the last 18 months. Initially, Valeant said it recognized revenue immediately when shipping to Philidor. Then after purchasing the option, it said it changed its approach and began to consolidate Philidor inventory on its balance sheet and delayed recognition of revenue until sales were made to final customers. Finally, Valeant would have reversed course again after announcing October 30 that the relationship with Philidor was finished.
Disappointing economic readings, including manufacturing data from the Empire State factory index early Friday, which showed a decline to its lowest level since the 2008-2009 recession, and a drop in the producer-price index—a measure of inflation, added to market fears Friday.

Set parameters. (It) depends on the job and the kind of work, but in general I think firewalls are good, psychologist Mary Alvord told Moneyish. It is nice to have separation of work time and work issues versus family time. Have clear boundaries on when and where it's OK to discuss work stuff, Marshall said, and designate a work-free zone where you don't discuss business. It's generally understood that to the extent that you are working with a loved one, then work is work and home is home, and we really try everything we can to avoid bringing those two things together, Taylor added.

Norwegian Air NAS, -0.26% informed me its system does not allow passengers to check in less than an hour before a flight, and no amount of pleading could change it. (Airlines must submit passenger lists to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.) Determined to salvage my trip, I paid $600 for a flight the next day, kicking myself for not arriving earlier and vowing to be hours early from now on when I travel. I asked Norwegian not to cancel the return leg of my $350 flight, and the airline agreed.

Surveys show millennials remain under-invested in stocks relative to other generations, but that's likely to change, he argued, as millennials begin to receive their inheritances from the boomers and realize that, in a time where both interest rates and likely inflation/inflation expectations are troughing, equities, as has been the case for the last 100 years, continue to represent the best alternative for wealth preservation and accumulation in a diversified investment portfolio.
The disconnect between halts on underlying stocks within indices and the need to price the index resulted in the pricing volatility seen in exchange-traded products. In the October report BlackRock told clients that a combination of factors impacted market makers, on Aug. 24. Seeing an absence of quotations or price indications on many ETP portfolio holdings, unable to effectively hedge due to [limit-up, limit-down] halts, and lacking clarity regarding erroneous trades, market makers were temporarily unable to participate in the 'arbitrage mechanism' to align prices properly for a number of ETPs.

For wages paid in tax years beginning after 12/31/17 and before 1/1/20, the TCJA allows employers to claim a tax credit equal to 12.5% of wages paid to qualifying employees while they are on family or medical leave — as long as the employee is paid at least 50% of his or her normal wage while on leave. The credit rate is increased by 0.25% for each percentage point that the wage rate paid while on leave exceeds 50% of the normal rate. However, the maximum credit rate is 25%. Finally, to be eligible for the credit, the employer must give all qualifying full-time employees at least two weeks of annual paid family and medical leave. Part-time employees must be given proportional leave time.

Just because I have money in a money market account doesn't mean I am saving it for investing purposes. It could be an emergency savings account, a down payment for a house, or a vacation fund on which I want to earn a higher rate of interest.

Foreign entities store cash in the U.S. for transactions processed in the United States, which they may not want to repatriate into their country of origin.

Disney to charge 'substantially' less than Netflix for streaming
Think of this dynamic as you would a football game. Each team must field 11 players despite having over 50 players on the team. If a player comes off the sidelines to replace a player on the field, the substituted player will join the other sidelined players' ranks. Notably, at all times, there will only be 11 players per team on the field. Such holds equally true if teams expand to 100 or even 1,000 players.

As you know, the usual deadline for filing your annual personal federal income tax return is April 15 of the following year. However, that date is always adjusted for weekends and holidays. So the deadline for your 2016 Form 1040 is April 18, 2017. That date reflects the fact that April 15 and 16 fall on a weekend and April 17 is the Emancipation Day holiday in the District of Columbia. If you can't file by April 18, you can obtain an automatic six-month extension to Oct. 16 by filing Form 4868 by no later than April 18.
If the annual percentage increase in costs for private insurers — who cover a population with fewer health care needs — already outpaces Medicare spending growth, their costs are likely to rise significantly faster when they cover a costlier population. Under the voucher plan, the government can keep its costs low by limiting the size of the voucher, but that strategy would only lead to an enormous financial burden falling on vulnerable elderly and disabled individuals.

Some people are surprised at this chart, since they thought residential real estate had produced much higher average annual returns — instead of rising at a rate even lower than long-term Treasurys. Hasn't real estate been the greater generator of wealth over the last half-century? But real estate's wealth generation is due in large part to leverage — buying a house with a mortgage — which magnifies the returns of the asset itself.
The S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% is up 54.5% over this period, which makes for a pretty good annualized return, especially when you factor in dividends and the fact that the past nine years includes the carnage of the financial crisis (it has more than tripled since the bottom of that collapse). It only looks bad when you consider it in contrast to the fluke stock I nearly picked by chance.

In the long term, stock prices do follow earnings, but in the short term, there is too much noise. Even if you had a crystal ball which said with a 100% certainty what earnings next year would be, nobody has any idea what the multiple is going to be or where the interest rates are going to be—there are so many variables that it's impossible to predict where the prices will end up, he continued.

Millennials, the generation born between the early 1980s and the mid-to-late 1990s, make up about one-third of today's U.S. workforce. They are better educated than previous generations, with a greater proportion of them possessing a college degree. Because they have lived through the Great Recession, they are more risk averse. They are also more likely to begin to save earlier in their careers.
Looking ahead, the CPI will be driven higher or lower by a few large categories of spending: shelter, food, energy and medical care combined account for 68% of the CPI. Those are the items to keep your eye on.
In the past four decades these structures have grown in their political importance, size and scope. This applies to gerrymandering, as in the Republicans winning a 33-seat majority in the House of Representatives in 2012, with more than a million fewer votes than the Democrats. It applies to the Electoral College, with eight of the past 20 years under Republican presidents (George W. Bush and Donald Trump) who lost the popular vote; and to the Senate, where about half the U.S. population elects 80% of the Senate, while the other half gets 20%. And then there is voter suppression that targets minority and poorer voters, and disenfranchises them disproportionately.
But on the other hand, the fact that all the other major central banks are meanwhile in no rush to raise interest rates means there is no real alternative currency that yield-seeking investors will be piling into yet, he said in recent commentary.

I think that what the point is, is that his role has been greatly exaggerated, whereas the President hasn't gotten the due that he deserves for the movement that he put together to tap into the kinds of people whose life concerns don't get a lot of attention on CNN. — Oh, which one to choose? There are just so, SO many morsels from this epic Stephen Miller interview with Jake Tapper on CNN.
Many people appear not to understand that inflation is a change in the units of measurement. Unfortunately, although the 2% inflation target is largely a feel-good policy, people tend to draw too much inspiration from it.

The AARP and other organizations have helpful guides for preparing to care for an elderly parent. This includes figuring out what your mother's needs might be and forming a team (that includes your brother and husband). There are many online resources to see if she qualifies for public benefits of state, federal, and private programs that help pay for groceries, prescription drugs, health insurance and home help. The best time to think about these issues is now, before there's a crisis. And, as my former colleague Elizabeth O'Brien wrote, take care of yourself too.

U.S. bank and financial stocks, which had been in a funk since interest rates fell close to zero, have a good shot at beating the broader equity market in 2017.

To continue on this trajectory put us at risk...of becoming an extension of a broken system, Williams wrote. He said it is too soon to say what the new model for Medium will be. The cuts reduce the Medium team by about a third and include some executives from the two shuttered offices, according to the post.

All you're doing as a composer is trying to capture the essence of the character, story and environment. In these films the aesthetic taste of the characters really influences it [the score]. So with Getty, I wanted the music to feel like the world he creates.

Risk unrewarded. We're in the ninth year of a bull market for U.S. stocks—and in the fourth decade of a bull market for bonds. Financial markets are, alas, mighty expensive and priced for modest returns.
Bear markets are nothing like bull markets. The buy-on-the-dip strategy that worked in a bull market does not work in bear markets. Bull markets are slow-moving and methodical, and you may get many days in a row that are green. Bear markets, however, are violent and volatile. You can short-sell almost every rally. Rallies are short-lived while the declines last longer. In a bear market, nearly every buy-on-the-dip purchase turns red. In a bear market, there is absolutely no stock or individual portfolio that is impervious to the pain of being long.
As discussed in last week's column, two reliable indicators of a long-term trend are currently out of harm's way. They are not infallible. (As it happens, they did not signal the S&P 500's SPX, -1.48% 21.6% drop on an intraday basis in 2011, though they both signaled caution prior to the 2007 bull market top.)
It's a battle for small brewers to elbow into that pack, but it's a battle they can win if they choose to make it a priority. State beer guilds wield more power than they realize and, by taking the distribution fight to the statehouse — as was the case in Kentucky — they can level the playing field and get the three-tier system working as it should. The Justice Department might help shape future beer distribution with its ruling on the SABMiller sale, but the big battles lie ahead in the states themselves.
Move here if you want to: start your own business.
Once you run out of cash to invest, the next step is to borrow cash to increase equity allocations. With professional investors leveraging their bets, there isn't much excess cash sitting around.
In automotive, once you get on the top of the hill, you go for a long time, said Little, Qualcomm's senior vice president and general manager for the automotive business. The time constants are painful up front, but very gracious in the back end.
6. Freeze your credit – even if you don't suspect any foul play. This can protect you from people taking out credit cards and loans in your name in the future – and as data breaches and identity theft are becoming more and more frequent, this may be smarter than ever. All three major credit agencies, Equifax, Experian and Transunion, allow you to freeze your credit file for free. Best of all, it only takes a few minutes to 'thaw' when you need to have your report pulled. This is the best way to be proactive in protecting your credit, says Hockenbury.
It wasn't a great week for fourth-quarter earnings, as fewer companies beat expectations than usual, and the outlook for the first quarter fell deeper into the red, which would mark the first year-over-year decline in nearly three years, if it holds.
A lot of value investors are having a difficult time right now, Marcus said. You have to have a catalyst, which is why I focus on special situations.
Millennials have a lower level of financial literacy than older workers. Many of the most important financial decisions, including investing in higher education, saving for retirement, and purchasing a home, are made early in adult life. Addressing common budget challenges young workers might face such as paying off student loans, mortgages, and credit card debt, could help them save for retirement. For example, it is not necessarily true that a young worker cannot or should not save for retirement if they carry any debt. While it certainly makes sense to pay off a high-interest loan, a young adult may be better off in the long run putting some money away for retirement while also paying down a low-interest student loan. Providing opportunities to focus on the bigger picture of financial wellness can help workers better navigate these competing financial demands while encouraging planning and budgeting for unexpected expenses.
Mimo ($144), a baby onesie fitted with a sleep tracker, says it monitors a child's breathing through subtle rises and falls in the infant's chest. Parents can access data collected from the baby using the accompanying app on iPhone AAPL, +1.27% and Android.
In addition to the data sharing scandal sparked by the Cambridge Analytica revelations, Facebook has been accused of violating the Fair Housing Act in a complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
In the later stages of a bull market, the financial media and Wall Street analysts seek out rationalizations to support their views. A common refrain: There are trillions of dollars in cash sitting on the sidelines just waiting to come into the market.
MS. MITCHELL: I've watched the entire tape.
The case against PwC, and Colonial's internal audit co-source vendor Crowe Horwath, for professional malpractice and breach of contract, was the first FDIC suit against an auditor for financial crisis-era bank frauds or failures.
In this example, if you were to contribute 5% of your salary, or $3,750 a year, to your 401(k) account, your employer would also contribute $3,750 a year. Contributions are typically made every pay period. The bottom line is: Each of your contributions would earn an immediate 100% return — a doubling of your initial investment. You will need to check to see how long it takes for the employer's contribution to be vested. This means you may lose recent matching contributions if you change employers. For some companies, after an initial vesting period, all employer matching contributions are immediately vested.
Based on what we know today, we should assume that none of the vaccines under development will prevent infection or provide lifelong, lasting immunity. At best, they will limit the symptoms of those infected and minimize the number of COVID-19 cases that progress to severe illness. Moreover, the vaccines currently approved for use require multiple doses, with a delay of up to two months before the benefits kick in.
Meanwhile, the quick-service dining plan that Disney Visa cardholders staying at this hotel can get during the promotion costs $52.50 per adult per night. This dining plan entitles guests to two meals at counter-service restaurants and two snacks per night of their stay, plus a refillable mug for drinks. For a five-night stay for a family of four, that would normally cost roughly $1,050. (The dining plan does not cover gratuity.) As such for travelers staying at Disney's lower-cost hotels, the value of the free dining promotion can exceed the cost of lodging, making it a good source of savings.
What about commercial real estate and real-estate investment trusts? They in general are much less correlated to the Case-Shiller index. For example, the correlation coefficient between that index and the Vanguard REIT Index fund VGSIX, -0.97% is just 0.15.

January always seems to be the time people want to start anew and start their lives over again, said Peter Walzer, a California matrimonial lawyer practicing for 36 years. About 35% to 40% of his cases are filed in January and February, he said.
The Bank of Japan, meanwhile, is thought of as having the most accommodative monetary policy among its peers. Still, a decision to reduce its purchases of government bonds, also known as JGBs, earlier this month and comments about the negative effects of prolonged quantitative easing late last year, have analysts wondering when the BOJ will take action and push the yen USDJPY, -0.06% higher.
We're modernizing what has made Diet Coke so special for a new generation, said Rafael Acevedo, Coca-Cola North America's group director for Diet Coke, in a statement.
That's not about the odds or the pace of actual ticket sales and how many numerical combinations will be covered by the tickets. It's about the way the jackpot is paid out, and how this jackpot is so ginormous that it might change the way the typical lottery winner claims their prize.
Because Apple controls the entirety of the software and hardware stack, and it has the highest percentage of consumers that update operating systems regularly, confidence is high in Apple's product line.
That's one of the many arguments in Demographics and the Demand for Higher Education, a book by Nathan Grawe, an economics professor at Carleton College, published late last year. Grawe explores how demographic trends — like the shift from majority white to majority-minority, from northeastern population centers to the Southwest, and declining birth rates — will affect American colleges.
As the broader digital-currency market garners wider attention, the most popular of the cohort, bitcoin, is facing its fiercest challenge for cryptocurrency supremacy in its brief history.
February gold US:GCG6 gained $17.10, or 1.6%, to settle at $1,090.70 an ounce, its highest close since Monday. But prices still logged a 0.7% weekly decline, after a rally in the first full week of the new year lifted prices by 3.6%, according to FactSet data.
What is your plan for eating healthily, exercising and stimulating your mind in early retirement? Does that plan look a lot like what you already do now, or does it involve some drastic changes? Early retired you is still you, so ask yourself if drastic changes are realistic, or if you need to start making incremental changes now to make sure staying healthy is doable once you're retired. On the mental front, will you embrace new technology and other societal changes as you age? Will you befriend younger people? Will you engage in activities or hobbies that expand your thinking, and force you to form new neural pathways?
From the end of 2007 to the close of trading on Tuesday, Netflix has soared a staggering 3,397.1%, enough to turn my $5,000 into about $175,000. (It jumped even more after its results on Wednesday, which took it to, sigh, still new records in afterhours trading.) This isn't enough that I could've retired by age 30, by any means, and it doesn't account for any taxes and fees I would've incurred, but it's a huge return I missed out on — one of the best trades of the decade.
They launched these ETFs when they did because they closed the actively managed funds that cover those areas, says Morningstar analyst Greg Carlson. They're trying to run these ETFs with generally the same philosophy as Janus Venture and Janus Triton.
Video-based baby monitors have gotten an upgrade, too. Cocoon Cam ($150) claims to monitor breathing in real time without the use of wearables — that is, a device that needs to be worn by your child. It works by focusing a camera that can detect breath movement on a child and the company says it can send an alert if the child stops breathing. Parents can also access the live feed of a child through the accompanying app.
Netflix is a much-loved stock on Wall Street, and for good reason. It's one of the FAANG stocks that has captivated investors with its momentum — a leap of more than 1,400% since the beginning of 2013.

While these probable victories raise the level of political uncertainty and certain sectors of the U.S. equity market may underperform (health care, tech for example), the macro implications of these election outcomes are clearly positive, said Derek Halpenny, head of research for global markets at MUFG Bank in London. There is now a chance of larger stimulus checks for U.S. households ($2,000 instead of $600) and an increased prospect of larger fiscal stimulus support in general going forward.
McDaniel, following Romney's swipe in the Washington Post at Trump's leadership, had tweeted, For an incoming Republican freshman senator to attack @realdonaldtrump as their first act feeds into what the Democrats and media want and is disappointing and unproductive.

The reconciliation procedure has been used for major bills in the past, like part of the Affordable Care Act and the 2017 tax cut bill, but usually the process has taken months. Democrats have said they would like to see a new round of fiscal stimulus soon after Joe Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20.
Believe it or not, 1 in 3 Americans say their financial stability is dependent on inheritance. That's according to a survey released last week by Merrill Edge, an online discount brokerage service provided by Bank of America Merrill Lynch BAC, -0.29% . Some 36% of Generation X-ers, 32% of millennials and 20% of baby boomers say they're relying on their family fortunes. It's hard to read that without feeling something, somewhere in America has gone horribly wrong.

Under current law, the 12.4% Social Security tax hits the first $137,700 of 2020 wages or net self-employment income. Employees pay 6.2% via withholding from paychecks, and employers pay the remaining 6.2%. Self-employed individuals pay the entire 12.4% out of their own pockets via the self-employment (SE) tax. For 2020, the 12.4% Social Security tax cuts out once 2020 wages or net SE income exceed the $137,700 ceiling. For 2021 and beyond, the Social Security tax ceiling will be adjusted annually to account for inflation. As things currently stand, the 2021 ceiling will rise to $142,800.

Cable networks had been earning handsomely for decades due to the pay-TV bundle and a lack of alternatives. But the landscape has shifted and cable networks' earnings have struggled to keep up with expectations. In an ideal world, media companies would begin to snatch up already successful OTT services, but Greenfield said Netflix is now too large—the company announced a 130-country expansion during the 2016 CES conference—and none of Hulu's partners would want to give up their shares. The Wall Street Journal reported in November that Hulu was reported to be looking to sell a stake of its business to Time Warner Inc.

5 ways Joe Biden can accelerate America's shift to electric vehicles
Experts say the divisive political climate in the U.S. likely hasn't helped. The United States can and should raise happiness by addressing America's multi-faceted social crisis — rising inequality, corruption, isolation, and distrust — rather than focusing exclusively or even mainly on economic growth, especially since the concrete proposals along these lines would exacerbate rather than ameliorate the deepening social crisis, the report added.

CAMBRIDGE, U.K. (Project Syndicate)—COVID-19 stormed across the planet in 2020, striking first in Asia and then surging throughout Europe and the Americas in what seemed like an endless tidal wave of grief.

What she's done to this party is unbelievable, I tell you.

In addition, the applications of quantum computing to health care are manifold, ranging from much faster drug design to quicker and cheaper DNA sequencing and analysis to reinforced security over personal medical data. While the technology does hold such promises, we still have to be patient before practical solutions can be implemented in medicine. However, with continued progress in this area, even though quantum computing has been something from a science fiction novel, this decade will see the first such computer used in the clinical practice too.
One of the biggest changes in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was the installation of a flat 21% corporate federal income tax rate for 2018 and beyond. Before the TCJA, the maximum effective rate for profitable corporations was 35%. The Biden plan would increase the corporate tax rate to 28%. This change would raise an estimated $1.1 trillion or so over 10 years.

What to do in your 50s to build wealth for your retirement
Revise your old assumptions. Siblings and cousins, for example, may need to redefine their relationship to think of each other as business partners, Spector said — after all, their reputations as kids may have been the flaky one or the screw-up. It's hard to realize that 'OK, that was decades ago, and now this person is an adult and a competent professional,' she said. Don't pigeonhole people. If you're the one trying to shake an outdated image, she added, demonstrate your capability, your competence, your credibility in your role.
The other thing, dead people. So dead people voted, and I think the number is in the – close to 5,000 people. And they went to obituaries, they went to all sorts of methods to come up with an accurate number, and a minimum is close to about 5,000 voters.
The IPS is document you should have created when you first started investing and the one you should have revised and updated at the end of 2015 or start of 2016.

By 30, you should have a decent chunk of change saved for your future self, experts say — in fact, ideally your account would look like a year's worth of salary, according to Boston-based investment firm Fidelity Investments, so if you make $50,000 a year, you'd have $50,000 saved already. By 35, you should have twice your salary, the firm said. The median retirement savings for a worker in their 30s was $45,000, according to Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies, which looked at workers' retirement accounts including employer-sponsored accounts and individual retirement accounts.

We think that if you check the signatures, a real check of the signatures going back in Fulton County, you'll find at least a couple of hundred thousand of forged signatures of people with – that – who have been forged. And we are quite sure that's going to happen.

Separately, HSBC Global Research called blockchain one of the biggest trends it sees for 2018, writing that the technology could create a money system outside of government, liberalize centralized ledgers like the land registry, create smart contracts, be used within markets and speed up settlements, change the way industry traces supply chains, tracks provenance and more.
This kind of actively passive investing is countered by people who buy and hold active funds, where they don't chase performance and let managers do their work, so that they passively manage their active funds.

'My situation is a little different'
The first year of dealing with COVID-19 has taught us that piecemeal measures will only feed the pandemic. National and global crises call for national and global coordinated action. The U.S., the U.K., Brazil, and other laggards have failed on both counts.
Right now, about 64% of inmates in state and federal prison are academically qualified to take college courses, according to the report, but most don't have access to these programs and even if they do, they likely can't afford the tuition, diZerega said.In 2014, the latest year for which data is available, just 9% of incarcerated people received a certificate from a higher education institution while in prison.

Stock-market investors will be pining for information on a range of topics, particularly given the lack of detail surrounding the incoming administration's ambitious but vague economic plans. Trump is slated to talk to the press at 11 a.m. Eastern in his first full-scale news conference since July.
Momentum was the single-biggest factor driving prices in 2017, and that remains the case so far this year. Valuations are stretched, no question, based on historical standards, but they're OK relative to bond yields and inflation, which means we're not overly concerned about them at this juncture, said Michael Mullaney, director of global market research at Boston Partners.
Once the title is gone, how will you see yourself? What will you do to ensure that you see yourself as a worthy person making contributions in the world? How will you find fulfillment without a job?

8. Make a concrete budget. You've heard this advice before but that doesn't make it any less relevant this year. Indeed, experts say this is the best way to get your spending under control, pay down debt and save more. This guide will help you make a budget in seven steps, or consider budgeting software like YNAB to help. One of the things that trips many people up is the semi-annual and annual payments, Hockenbury says -- which might include things like car insurance payments or annual memberships. Take the extra time to think through these types of expenditures, Hockenbury says.
One of the first things that I want to do when our new senators are seated is to deliver the $2,000 checks to American families, Schumer said.
The idea here is that things that consumers spend a lot of money on have a bigger weight in the CPI. About one-third of consumer spending goes for owning or renting a home, so it follows that even a relatively modest 3.2% rise in rental prices is going to have a bigger impact on your wallet than, say, a 15% rise in fuel-oil prices (which accounts for about 0.1% of the typical consumer's budget).

The future government will have to tackle the issues the current one hasn't. It will have to at least form a view of the role Germany should play in Europe and the world. On the economic front, it will have to decide what to do about the state of the economy. There is the matter of a short-term fiscal stimulus, advocated by economists both German and foreign. But there is also the question of what type of long-term public investments the country needs to overcome the structural flaws of its economic model.

15. Fight overdraft fees.Overdraft fees have been steadily rising, with Americans paying more now than they have since 2009. Here are some tips for fighting those fees. You can also try the free app Earnin, which allows you to borrow up to $100 from your pending paycheck rather than have to wait every two weeks and risk overdraft. The app allows you to pay what you think is fair for the service. Just beware of the potential pitfalls, including blowing your budget and overspending.
With a few days left in the year, this had generated about $500 in savings. More importantly, it never made me feel like I was burning through cash. That vacation fund is starting to look healthy too.
Brent oil UK:LCOH8 briefly moved above the $70 mark last week and again early on Tuesday, boosted by a decline in U.S. stockpiles, a weaker dollar and the cold spell that has gripped North America this winter.

Add those buyers to a Japanese public that is broadly underinvested in equities and there are some solid gains ahead. Gundlach recommends the WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Fund DXJ, +0.73% to gain exposure to the growth that lies ahead.
This should be a short-term option, though, Schulz said; credit utilization ratio, or the amount of one's available credit that is used, also is a component of credit scoring. Because the utilization of secured cards tends to be high, consumers should strive to use them for about nine months to a year and then upgrade to a traditional credit card with more desirable terms, he said.
After six months, you have contributed $11,250 (6 X $1,875) and your employer has added $3,750 (6 X $625). However, if you continue on this path, you will reach your maximum $18,500 annual contribution in October. You will have contributed $16,875 through September (9 X $1,875) and will only be able to contribute the remaining $1,635 in October ($18,500 – $16,875). So, your contribution for November and December will be zero. And, since your employer only makes contributions when you do, their deposits will be zero as well. By funding your 401(k) too soon, you will lose two months of employer match, or $1,250 (2 X $625).
Analysts also believe that Dr. Pepper Snapple is well-positioned if tax policies change.
It's the first time this measure has fallen since April, and the decline was large enough to erase the gains made in recent months.
While accounts earning 3% are hard to come by, consumers should investigate ways to earn more in interest. For instance, many online banks offer above 2% interest on their accounts. Another option is to take out a certificate of deposit — many banks offer 1-year CDs with annual percentage yields above 2.5%.
The percent of [New York Stock Exchange] stocks trading above their 200-day moving averages has been less than 50% since June … and the NYSE composite index itself has been in decline since May, telling us that the average stock already is in a bear market, wrote Kahn. For me, almost everything is in place for the third cyclical bear market of the 21st century.

That lone exception in which residential real estate fell was a doozy, however: the 2007-09 financial crisis. So perhaps the first issue to grapple with is whether the 2007-09 period was an outlier. Insofar as it was an exception that proves the rule, then we can be at least moderately confident in real estate's ability to cushion equity bear markets.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: Cleta, even before you do that, and not even including – that's why I hardly even included that number – although in one state we have a tremendous amount of dead people, so I don't know.

AMD still not out of the woods
Asset rotation: Many stock-market investors are still optimistic after a great run in 2017, but it's undeniable that many traders are ready for what's next now that tax reform is priced in and the big run for equities looks long in the tooth. It's natural for the fast money to look for greener pastures when we've had a good run, and the turn of the year is a great excuse to move out of stocks and into something else.

Whatever your answer, this would let me introduce you to dollar-cost averaging (DCA). This is a practice that assures you will buy more shares when prices are lower and fewer shares when they're higher.
But cruise passengers generally have very little recourse if they get sick during a vacation. It's difficult to prove the origins of food poisoning and any compensation is typically left to the generosity or goodwill of the cruise line in question.
Achieving early retirement is a pretty awesome feat. My husband and I are on the verge of it later this year, at the ages of 41 and 38, respectively. And we're beyond excited. But that doesn't mean early retirement is for everyone.
On the economic front, asset bubbles in a major economy was a concern, along with the increasing polarization of societies and the potential for social instability. Rising wealth inequality and aging populations were also named as risks.
Other social workouts may be worth putting down some money. For example, Stanforth suggests hiring a personal trainer for a small group of friends and splitting the cost. Or sign up for a niche gym or fitness group — cycling, yoga, CrossFit — in which other members will count on you to be there, she adds.

Communication also suffers. We once expressed ourselves using body language, scent, tone and inflection in our voices, but contemporary social networking limits us to abbreviations, cute pictures and 280 characters per post. This isn't how humans are meant to communicate effectively, and it's no wonder that social-media platforms have become a hotbed for division, conflict and mutual mistrust.

Cherney says the ETFs won't hurt its existing mutual fund business. I wouldn't call this cannibalization, he says. The ETFs are complementary. If investors were going to leave Venture or Triton for ETFs, they would do that anyway. They now have a better ETF option. The ETFs are distinct from one another as well as their fund counterparts. While Triton and Venture both own 19 of the same companies in their top 25 holdings, the ETFs have just two companies that overlap with one another, and three between them that are found in the funds.

2. It's likely to be the most important donation you'll ever make. An Internal Revenue Service study found that a typical bequest is almost three times as large as the total amount that person has donated in his or her lifetime (on FreeWill, it averages at $69,000). Choosing causes on which you're going to have an enormous impact is immensely satisfying. But with so much money at stake, it's worth thinking carefully about where you want to have impact and why.
In most cases the cruise line will not offer any compensation, implying that it is the customers' fault for not washing their hands, even though the CDC and the FDA state that contaminated food or water are the most common explanations for norovirus, Walker said.

What's more, in 52% of markets, including Chicago and Los Angeles, rents are rising faster than wages. And more renters may also find themselves priced out of the housing market, because home prices are appreciating more quickly than rents in 70% of markets. As a result, the old guideline of not spending more than 30% of your income on rent (or a mortgage) has become increasingly difficult to follow in cities like San Francisco and New York.
5. You want to give advice to the new parents…but you don't.
Passengers can also use a third-party service like AirHelp that can badger an airline on your behalf, even taking it to court if it denies payment. AirHelp takes a slice of the payment — around 25% — in exchange for its services: €63 ($78) on compensation of €250 ($301), €100 ($120) from compensation of €400 ($480) or €150 ($180) of €600 ($722). It only charges passengers if their claim is successful.

LONDON (Project Syndicate) — One of the most extraordinary things about the current protests in Iran — the largest since the Green Movement in 2009 — is that the very people that they are directed against may well have been the people who started them. Iran's ultra-conservative theocrats appear to have thought that by stoking anger over the economy in their political heartlands, they would undermine the moderate President Hassan Rouhani.

The March 25 column mirrored a theme I was suggesting in my stock letter. Eight public-gathering-space stocks in my letter on March 17 were up 108% by the end of the year, more than twice the 49% gain for the S&P 500 over the same time. My contrarian names were in airlines, banking, housing energy and what I called public gathering space stocks. My stock letter portfolio included names like Cedar Fair FUN, -0.19% , Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL, +2.16% , Carnival CCL, +2.41% , Planet Fitness PLNT, +1.31% and Churchill Downs CHDN, +1.18% .
When I went to London, the first thing I did was search Airbnb for two weeks, looking for older-looking hosts I could stay with to see what it would be like. There were very few, says Mangan.

If the challenges of climate change are not met today, huge burdens will be imposed on the next generation. It is just wrong for this generation to pass these costs on to the next. It is better to leave a legacy of financial debts, which our children can somehow manage, than to hand down a possibly unmanageable environmental disaster.
• Theresa May's speech began with caution and a heavy dose of sympathy for euroskeptics, but a desire to use this 'moment of change' to reach beyond Europe's borders and recall a British culture that is 'profoundly internationalist' gave the rhetoric a grandeur and a sense of optimism. At times it was just rhetoric, with talk of 'certainty at every stage' somewhat hollow in light of no graspable plans, yet the commitment to a vote on May's final strategy in both houses of Parliament will provide no end of hope to the 'Remain' camp.

Although a 'blue sweep' with a Democratic win in Georgia result may revive a discussion about U.S. tax hikes to come, we consider it unlikely that the new Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen would pursue policies that could stifle the U.S. economic recovery.

Private equity funds and hedge funds have historically been structured as limited partnerships. Under prior law, so-called carried interest arrangements allowed private equity fund and hedge fund managers to give up their right to receive current fees for their services and instead receive an interest in future profits from the private equity/hedge fund partnership. These arrangements are often called carried interests because the private equity/hedge fund manager doesn't pay anything for the partnership profits interest. Also, the private equity/hedge fund manager is not taxed on the receipt of the carried interest because it's not considered a taxable event.

First, while index funds and exchange traded funds now approach 30% of stock market assets, their turnover is so small compared to that of active investors that they account for less than 5% of trading, and trading is what sets prices.

Perhaps Janus' most promising new ETF is Janus Short Duration Income VNLA, -0.04% , which launched in November. Not only is the fund actively managed and thus in the firm's wheelhouse, but its management team at Kapstream Capital, which Janus acquired in 2015, has an excellent long-term record. Kapstream is run by portfolio managers that Bill Gross originally hired at Pimco, who left to start their own firm in Australia in 2006, Cherney says. That strategy—the $4.7 billion Kapstream Absolute Return Income, which the new ETF will resemble—has produced a 5.3% annualized return since its inception in May 2007, beating its Australian short-term bond benchmark by 1.4 percentage points a year.

By contrast, the target asset allocation for a 60-year-old might be 40% stocks, 60% bonds if you use the rule of thumb that has you subtracting your age from 100 to determine what percent to invest in stocks and bonds.
PwC may still face a separate jury trial in Alabama over claims from the FDIC for two more years of audits of Colonial, if the firm does not now settle as a result of this decision.

I was a simply fan of the company, and based my investment idea on that. This isn't the best reason to buy a stock, but there are worse ones; there's even an ETF dedicated to companies with high levels of customer satisfaction (Netflix comprises about 0.34% of the portfolio). I suppose you could argue that my being a customer helped me imagine the company's growth potential — I gave memberships as Christmas gifts, knowing the recipients would find it a better deal than cable — but ultimately I got lucky. Had I picked another stock, even one with its own fanatics, I could easily have lost money. Remember how Crackberries were a thing in 2007? BlackBerry BB, -6.07% is down 92% since then.

On the surface, it looks as if Trump's bullying tactics are working, even before he takes the oath of office and makes good on his threat to impose hefty tariffs or taxes on any imported products manufactured in those offshored factories.
Gold futures settled lower on Friday as strength in the U.S. dollar and equities in the wake of the monthly domestic jobs report dulled investment demand for the precious metal.
Tom Selling, author of the blog Accounting Onion, says PwC will have to take into account everything that's happened to Valeant this year when it makes its annual going-concern assessment.
And from that perspective, Amazon could be a bigger burden in some of the finalists located in the Northeast than their Southern counterparts. Some cities are just better suited to expanding housing supply, said Tendayi Kapfidze, chief economist at LendingTree, pointing to Dallas, Nashville, Raleigh, and Austin as candidates with laxer zoning laws.
Over the past five years, Kashkari said the Taylor rule would have called at times for much higher interest rates, almost has high as 3% over some periods, while the Fed kept them close to zero.

 Facebook said it often receives complaints from users that ads are not relevant, so it tries to promote useful ads, while not violating user privacy. 
He asked for advice on how he can help restore some peace of mind to nervous investors.
Some of the most remarkable moves in the U.S. stock market over the past few months have been in companies announcing an initiative related to blockchain, the decentralized ledger technology best known as the foundation behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
This opens a new round of political uncertainty. But look closer, and it is clear that the German economy could benefit from this surprise announcement, if it signals the end of the years of indecisiveness at the top.
Chinese stocks rose and the yuan strengthened Friday, a respite from the early-year meltdown that wiped as much as $1.1 trillion from mainland markets, after authorities overnight removed a mechanism blamed for triggering more volatility.
Most people are reacting on emotion and not tactically, said Walzer.
With high inventories and stagnant prices, not every play out there is going to make sense, but we are starting to see some optimism, Glickman said. He expects the uptick in capital spending to be in the high single digits.
The iPhone X went on sale in November to reasonably good buzz, but not without supply-chain issues. There were fears that initial demand may not have been met in December, so it will be important to see whether Apple delivers — and, if not, whether that demand gets pulled forward.
Thus, the WEP would benefit from a little reform. But neither the WEP nor GPO should be eliminated. These provisions address a real inequity associated with having some state and local workers not covered by Social Security.
Daniel Packer, a 29-year-old data analyst at an online advertising agency in Los Angeles, knows more responsibilities will stack up as he hits the big 3-0 this summer, so he's been religiously stashing away money in his retirement accounts the last few years.
German, Japanese and Korean auto makers are expanding their production in Mexico not to take advantage of any claimed unfair rules under NAFTA, but because Mexico is a good place to build cars. For starters, labor costs are much cheaper in Mexico ($8.24 an hour vs. $46.35 in the U.S. and Canada). The manufacturing supply chains are robust. The Mexican peso USDMXN, +0.01% is weak, giving its manufacturers another advantage.

Almost half of the 134 U.S. chief executive officers surveyed by the New York Times last month said they expect the U.S. economy to be in recession by the end of 2019. That forecast was echoed by almost half of the chief financial officers who participated in the Duke University/CFO Global Business Outlook survey in December. (It would appear that the inhabitants of the C Suite communicate with one another!)
Beasley thinks that addressing the sugar issue is a good path for the company. It's also something that packaging alone doesn't solve. Still, making an impression on the grocer's shelf is important.
The hope is that by reaching scale the company will eventually see a return on its investment, in typical tech-stock style. But Wall Street will eventually expect it to deliver.
Every case is different but, yes, if you believe you're right, as I think PwC does, then you are willing to take a stand and go to trial, he said.
There are four psychological stages that people go through during a bear market. Right now, investors know the market is struggling but most believe it will come back. In fact, many see this as a buying opportunity. Here are the four stages:
That move, combined with protectionist trade moves against China and Europe, has added to international tensions that make cooperation between major powers more challenging, at a time when the world needs to work together.

Any [penalty] with a 'B' in it is going to be an extraordinary burden to any firm, Langdon said. Whether it is enough to tip a firm into non-existence is one thing, but it certainly would be enough to change the cost of the audits going forward.
An obvious problem, though, is that consumers have been hearing about fully autonomous systems for many years, and now are going to be buying cars with systems that sound like they are more than just a smarter ADAS system. Even some of the players involved fight the terminology: When MarketWatch questioned Huang on the use of the name Autopilot for an ADAS system at CES, he forcefully denied that Nvidia's version of autopilot should be classified as ADAS instead of true autonomy.
* Schedule B if you had more than $1,500 of income from interest and/or ordinary dividends or if you had certain types of interest and dividend income (such as tax-free interest from U.S. Savings Bonds used to pay qualified higher education expenses).
But even with these incredible successes, there is still only a slim chance that we will have a vaccine or treatment that is safe, universally available, and effective enough to stop the pandemic before the end of 2021.
Each new earthquake, tsunami, or emerging disease reminds us that nature is a dangerous force. If there was a reason why many Asian countries reacted more quickly and effectively to COVID-19, it was because they still harbored memories of SARS, H1N1, and the avian flu. Their experience in recent years shows that public-health measures that are stringently applied through strong leadership, governance, and social solidarity can quickly bring a pandemic under control and limit the death toll.
The buy-versus-rent calculus is shifting toward renting being more affordable, said Daren Blomquist, senior vice president at Attom Data Solutions. With a strong jobs market, Americans want to stay mobile and often can't afford to buy near urban centers where they're more likely to get a job at higher wages, he said.
All it took was some wild swings and big losses in U.S. stock prices for the R word — recession — to start tripping off people's tongues.

What's the best investment you can make in 2018? Three considerations—taxes, risk and the economic cycle—point to one conclusion: Paying down debt looks like an awfully smart move.
Though actively managed stock ETFs have yet to take off, active fixed-income ETFs from Pimco and DoubleLine Capital have done well in terms of both performance and asset-gathering. Actively managed fixed income is the only active story in the ETF space that has attracted significant assets in the last couple of years, says Dave Nadig, CEO of ETF.com. Janus is taking a different angle here by offering a truly global fund. It isn't just buying the same short-term bonds everybody else is buying in the U.S. It falls into a similar category to the Pimco Enhanced Short Maturity Active MINT, +0.01% —an enhanced cash-replacement fund.
We regard tax refunds as a windfall rather than a return of what we earned.

While you're at it, if you are a homeowner, consider setting up a home equity line of credit. That way, if you pay down your mortgage but later find yourself out of work and in need of cash, you could re-borrow the money by tapping into your home's value. Sound like a smart strategy? It isn't as smart as it used to be: The interest you pay on your home equity line of credit won't be tax-deductible, thanks to another change introduced by 2017's tax law.
By contrast, items with falling prices had a much smaller impact on the CPI. The biggest drag on the CPI came from wireless phone services, which fell 10.2% as AT&T T, -0.46% and Verizon VZ, +1.00% switched to unlimited data plans in response to competition from smaller rivals Sprint US:S and T-Mobile TMUS, -1.88% . That's going to be a one-off event, part of what Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen has said is the transitory disinflation in a few items that could be masking broader inflation risks.

What's more, the judge is likely to take into account that your husband never worked over this time, or paid the bills, and a good lawyer will make sure that's front and center in your divorce case should your husband's lawyer ask for alimony in lieu of you living in your house (sorry to bring that up). The upside: Alimony is tax-deductible for the payer and must be reported as income by the payee. Divide it all down the middle, start over and look to the future, says Randy Kessler, an Atlanta-based lawyer who wrote the book, Divorce: Protect Yourself, Your Kids, and Your Future. You should feel better that when the case is over, you will still have a job and can replenish so even if it is all divided, you will still be better off than him. It pays to have a good (and honest) divorce lawyer.
How the free dining deal works
Strength in the dollar, with the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.42% , a measure of the currency against six rival currencies, tacking on 0.7% Friday, weighed on gold, which is priced in the currency. A stronger buck makes assets priced in the currency more expensive to buyers using other monetary units.
Now for the bad news: It might be too late to undo the gift without the cooperation of the son — he may not be able to force the son to unring this bell, Kunkler added. This would be the case if this really was a true gift, meaning there were no conditions to the gift — no strings attached. If that is the case there would not be much he could do legally. Also, if you were intending to hide assets, be clear with your lawyer, as that could come back to bite you later.
GE's North America Life & Health is the reinsurance portfolio that the company retained after mostly exiting the business between 2004 and 2006. A reinsurer buys the right to receive premiums from the primary insurers that deal directly with consumers in exchange for eventually shouldering any potential losses. Those primary insurers underwrite and administer the policies and process claims when they come in.

Indeed, a study published in the European Journal of Social Psychology found that, on average, it takes 66 days to make something a habit. The study followed 96 people over 12 weeks as they tried to make a health or lifestyle change, such as drinking an extra few glasses of water a day or running before dinner. The authors defined a habit as something that felt almost automatic when you did it. And, all told, participants said it took between 18 and 254 days before something became a habit, with the average being 66.
Rents are rising faster than wages in most markets
It's indeed hard to argue against Big Tech right now, and I expect these dominant megacaps to keep thriving. But the reality is that Netflix shouldn't be included in that group — and that poses a big risk to stockholders and Wall Street puts increasingly higher expectations.
No matter what the market does this year, investors are ready to be more active in it.
Very liberal and conservative people find it much harder to admit they're wrong about anything, even when it's got nothing to do with politics, a new study has found.
• General Electric Co. GE, -2.65% is exploring the possible applications of blockchain technology at its FORGE Lab in upstate New York. The lab also serves as an educational resource for teams throughout the company to learn more about blockchain, said Ben Beckmann, senior scientist and blockchain mission leader at GE Global Research. The company hasn't moved any of its applications of the technology beyond the experimental stage, but Beckmann expected that to come down the pike soon. We're using the underlying technology to help secure our industrial assets, he said.
The big story for investors in 2017 was the broad-based rally in stocks. Simply by owning equities of any shape or size, you likely made out very nicely.

Aside from affordability, there are other encouraging signs, according to strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Many of the largest, well-known quantitative (quant) hedge funds all started blowing up at the same time. Everything they were buying was going down, while everything they were short selling (betting on a decline) was going up, causing massive losses for some of the biggest funds in the business.
The company is no stranger to offering stored-value debit products, having launched the consumer-focused Cash card in 2017. Consumers don't pay to use the Cash card, but Square generates revenue from it via transaction fees.

Billionaire investor Carl Icahn on Thursday urged Xerox Corp. XRX, -4.69% to revise or even terminate its Fuji Xerox joint venture in the wake of an accounting scandal, and offered his support to Darwin Deason, the company's third-biggest shareholder. Deason said Wednesday that Xerox should disclose its agreement with Fuji and explore strategic alternatives regarding Fuji. We are obviously in favor of renegotiating the joint venture agreement to make it more favorable for Xerox, Icahn wrote in an open letter to shareholders. This should have been done a long, long time ago. It is self-evident that the current management team is clearly incapable of doing so. Icahn also criticized the long-tenured directors at Xerox who refuse to acknowledge that change is needed. In December, Jonathan Christodoro, a former Icahn employee, resigned from his role as member of the Xerox board after a disagreement about strategy. Xerox shares were down 0.8%, but have gained 15% in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% has gained 23%.
The number of kids who come from first generation backgrounds is likely to fall. A lot of that is just following from the population. In recent decades we've had an increase in college attendance. That pushes against some of the current dominant narratives
The only sure way to successfully grow your investments is to have an asset allocation plan that you stick to and continue to contribute over a long period. That way you are buying stocks when they are cheap as well as when they are expensive. And a diversified portfolio will smooth out volatility. The only thing to avoid is to rush and change the plan whenever the market changes, he said.

A good miss! I got to the green because of some element of luck. Same thing with those portfolios. But most people don't want to depend on luck — they want to have a strategy.
If you hold investments in taxable brokerage firm accounts, consider the tax advantage of selling appreciated securities that have been held for over 12 months. The federal income tax rate on long-term capital gains recognized in 2020 is only 15% for most folks, although it can reach the maximum 20% rate at high income levels. The add-on 3.8% net investment income tax (NIIT) can also bite at high income levels. So, the true maximum rate for high-income individuals is 23.8%: the advertised 20% top rate plus 3.8% for the unadvertised NIIT.
That consent decree is a disaster. It's a disaster. A very good lawyer who examined it said they'd never seen anything like it. And –
Norway moves to the top of the ranking despite weaker oil prices, the report noted. It is sometimes said that Norway achieves and maintains its high happiness not because of its oil wealth, but in spite of it. By choosing to produce its oil slowly, and investing the proceeds for the future rather than spending them in the present, Norway has insulated itself from the boom and bust cycle of many other resource-rich economies.
This TCJA treatment of alimony payments will apply to payments that are required under divorce or separation instruments that are: (1) executed after Dec. 31, 2018 or (2) modified after that date if the modification specifically states that the TCJA treatment of alimony payments (not deductible by the payer and not taxable income for the recipient) now applies.
Retirement is a long ways away for him, he says — at least 30 years — but saving money early on means not worrying about putting away as much later down the road if he weren't able to do so. He's already seeing his strategy pay off, given he has a 1-year-old daughter and raising kids is expensive (try somewhere between $284,000 and $600,000). I'm glad I was able to take advantage of [saving] for the last nine years, he said.

Today, it is very important to me to focus on my well-being, which means not returning to our previous relationship which left me damaged financially and emotionally. At the same time I have a lot of stress and anxiety about where this will leave me if and when (a) she passes on, (b) a decision has to be made to change her living situation (in my home or a nursing home) or (c) something major happens, like a legal judgment against her.

Since a worker's monthly earnings are averaged over a typical working lifetime (35 years), a high-wage earner with a short period of time in covered employment looks exactly like a low-wage earner. Both would have 90% of their earnings replaced by Social Security.
He prefers certain family-controlled conglomerates, because if they have strong management, they can make quick and possibly unexpected moves to acquire bargain assets and create value. He said many investors shy away from conglomerates, preferring companies focused on particular industries. But some old-fashioned conglomerates have made it work, he said.
That old Yogi Berra quip about how Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded applies neatly to stock investing, and illustrates why it's so difficult even for investment pros to beat the market.
That to me is animal spirits, said chief economist strategist John Canally of LPL Financial. He was referring to a phrase popularized by John Maynard Keynes to describe why it's important for the economy that business people feel confident.
But the seventh secret that this year revealed represents a silver lining. While bringing about radical change is never easy, it is now abundantly clear that everything could be different.

That's a shame, because for many passengers this is easy money, he said. Sometimes airlines are open about what passengers are entitled to. Other times they're more cagey and rely on travelers to do the research.
Helping the youngest workers today understand the importance of securing their long-term financial well-being is an investment that will yield significant benefits. How soon and for how long an individual saves is important because of the power of compound interest. For example, compare a person saving $100 a month starting at age 27 with a person saving the same amount starting at age 37. The first will have contributed just one-third more by age 67, but would accumulate twice as much in savings, assuming a 6% annual rate of return.
Bank of America BAC, +2.61% , Wells Fargo WFC, +2.43% and U.S. Bank USB, +3.27% still allow cosigners.
The Shanghai Composite Index SHCOMP, +0.51% finished up 2% at 3,186.41, recovering from a 7% plunge Thursday. It finished down 10% for the week, its worst performance since the week ending Aug. 21.
February natural gas US:NGG19 fell 3.2% to $2.944 per million British thermal units, after finishing last week down 7.8%.
But these numbers are illusory. The U.S. has a national policy of overall inflation. The U.S. Federal Reserve has set an inflation objective of 2% in terms of the personal consumption expenditure deflator. This means that all prices should tend to go up by about 2% per year, or 22% per decade.
But we only lost the state by – by that number, 11,000 votes, and – 779. So with that being said, with just what we have and – you know, with just what we have, we're giving you minimum – minimum numbers. We're doing the most conservative numbers possible. We're many times – many, many times above the margin. And so we don't really have to – Mark, I don't think we have to go through machines because –

This poor relative performance of Chinese IPOs in the U.S. market in 2018 and weak performance of brokerage stocks in general could make investors valuation sensitive about the Futu IPO, said Smith. However, investors will likely be interested in it...because of the extraordinary growth in its business and its profitability.
But for now, American whiskeys are at least as fun to watch as to savor.
Economists have debated how effective the New Deal was — its spending was probably too low and not sustained enough to generate the kind of recovery the economy needed. Nonetheless, it left a lasting legacy by transforming the country at a crucial time.
However, there'd be no Woodstock for bears without at least a few depressing messages. At the London conference, Edwards shared some concerns over what could eventually upend the recent global stock market rally, pointing to Japan as one of the potentially triggers.
Apple stands out, as you can see, with analysts expecting a slight decline in sales this year and marginal improvement during 2020. Then again, it is, by far, the cheapest stock among the FAANGs on a P/E basis. It will be fascinating to see if Cook decides an acquisition would be a good way for the company to deploy its mountain of cash.
Mangan hopes Freebird will ultimately spread its wings and help members search online for things to do together so they can meet up around interests.
But it's possible people will be able to do that within several years, he added. Insurers and tech companies may apply predictive analytics to the disclosed numbers so they can estimate all the permutations of care and figure out what a patient's final bill will be ahead of time.
I am an 81-year old disabled senior who worked very hard all my life, never took vacations or spent money on myself. After my divorce in 1964 I raised my son alone and always took priority in caring for him and saving money, just in case that something happened to me and he would be alone.
Annual contracts (and resolutions) don't account for how your life may change later in the year, Yarrow says. You lose interest; you shift priorities; you get busy — for whatever reason, you may not be a gym-goer come June.
However, the difference between a 50-50 Senate and a 51-49 Senate on the ability to pass legislation is small.
Overall, America had six of the top 10 HNW cities, per Wealth-X's list. Dallas–Fort Worth, which has seen its wealth grow thanks in part to the strong energy sector, entered the list for the first time this year.
[I]n the even broader tax policy changes occur as currently proposed, Dr. Pepper Snapple would be a relative beneficiary given its current high tax rate (35%), limited mismatch from a destination-based tax perspective, and low likelihood of sizeable incremental debt post the announced Bai acquisition, the note said.

Lesson #3: Insiders aren't the only smart money worth following — and neither is Warren Buffett
In a letter to clients dated Jan. 17, Einhorn, the founder of Greenlight Capital, offered up a few insights into his thinking as Donald Trump is set to be sworn in as the U.S.'s 45th president on Friday.
The point he makes with that chart is that investors shouldn't try and time the market and that downturns tend to be followed by swings higher, eventually. With that in mind, an average investor should have a rule-based asset allocation plan, preferably put together before big storms and selloffs, and let the plan do the work in bull and bear markets.
That's according to a study released Wednesday by the Pew Research Center, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. The vast majority of users surveyed (74%) said they were not aware that Facebook FB, +2.02% lists their interests for advertisers and that these interests can be found in the ad preferences page on user profiles. Those preferences run the gamut from pop culture, consumer purchases and likes to multicultural affinity and political labels.

 'I think this is an opportunity for old-fashioned stock picking. We've had decades, maybe 10 or 20 years, of active managers underperforming passive managers.' 
You have clearly both had very different life experiences, so it's probably no wonder that your girlfriend is one of those lucky folks who has the luxury not to give too much thought about tomorrow. She has her parents' income to rely on and, likely, has some kind of sizable inheritance in her future too. That has given her a sense of freedom and, perhaps, folly. Just because she can spend like there's no tomorrow does not make it (a) any easier to watch and (b) smart.
The worst period for accidents appears to have just passed. Research shows people hospitalized in late December face increased risks for readmission or death, while another study said Christmas Eve poses a particular heart attack risk for older and sick people.
While most of the focus has been on saving the jobs and keeping the stores open, little attention has been given to those suppliers that took the risk to extend credit to keep Sears open, but now will face these potential losses, he said.
To put that in context: No single book sold more than 1 million copies last year. The Getaway, which is part of Jeff Kinney's Wimpy Kid series, was the bestselling new book, selling over 992,000 copies. Fire and Fury might be doing what Trump, arguably the country's first Twitter president, could not do. It could be encouraging America to read again.
The U.S. has seen its happiness slide happiness over the last decade. In 2007, it ranked No. 3 among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. But it now hovers at 19th place, partly due to the political discourse. The predominant political discourse in the United States is aimed at raising economic growth, with the goal of restoring the American Dream and the happiness that is supposed to accompany it. But the data show conclusively that this is the wrong approach, economist Jeffrey Sachs wrote in the report.

MR. HILBERT: That is correct. That information is the minimum, most conservative data based upon the USPS data and the secretary of state's office data that has been made publicly available. We do not have the internal numbers from the secretary of state. Yet, we have asked for it six times. I sent a letter over to Mr. (inaudible 1:05:10) several times requesting this information and it's been rebuffed every single time. So it stands to reason that if the information is not forthcoming there's something to hide. That's the problem that we have.
It appears that the Republican leadership's recent willingness to finally negotiate a COVID relief package was driven by the risk that continued refusal could result in losing the Jan. 5 runoff election for the two senators from Georgia. This election will determine who controls the Senate.

And I don't care how long it takes me – you know, we're going to have other states coming forward pretty good, but I won't – this has never given – this is – we have some incredible talent who've said they've never seen anything – now the problem is they need more time for the big numbers, but they are very substantial numbers. But…and I think you are going to find that they – by the way, a little information. I think you are going to find that they are shredding ballots because they have to get rid of the ballots because the ballots are unsigned, the ballots are corrupt. And they are brand new, and they don't have seals, and there's a whole thing with the ballots. But the ballots are corrupt. And you are going to find that they are – which is totally illegal. It's more illegal for you than it is for them because you know what they did and you're not reporting it. That's a – you know, that's a criminal – that's a criminal offense. And, you know, you can't let that happen. That's a big risk to you and to Ryan – you're lawyers; that a big risk.

Authors Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin suggested adding up the annual earnings over your entire life, as reported in Social Security statements or old tax returns. To that total, you can add in other money received that wasn't reported to Social Security, such as investment and interest income, inheritances, gifts and gambling winnings.

Further, the Fed should stop paying financial institutions interest to keep money out of the economy and parked at the Fed.

Talk through worst-case scenarios, advised Johnny C. Taylor Jr., president and CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management. As an extension of the interview and hiring process, he said, both parties should sit down with a certified HR professional to role-play various hypotheticals: Could you stay objective if your mom were consistently late to work, or if your brother passed you over for a promotion? What would you do if a family member were caught stealing? Are you prepared to call law enforcement on your son, your daughter, your cousin, your mother? Taylor said. If the answer is no, then both of you can't work (there). The third-party HR presence can help push the conversation forward and pick up telling body language, he added.

Simply put, the vulnerability in Meltdown occurs when the processor uses out-of-order execution, looking ahead to schedule subsequent operations to idle execution units of the processor.

Renters in the Marin County/San Francisco metro area will spend over 77% of their salary, on average, to pay rent in 2017. But purchasing a home there would cost even more: 104% of the average paycheck for the median-priced home, which is a whopping $950,000. That means that it's more affordable – for now – to rent there, even though Attom forecasts rents will rise 29% over the coming year, compared to a 4.4% increase in the price of homes for purchase.
Oil demand optimism was lifted as senior officials from China unexpectedly attended negotiations between Beijing and their counterparts in Washington, in an effort to resolve longstanding trade disagreements that have underpinned uncertainty in global markets.

An negative term spread suggests that the expected short-term rate, as reflected in the long rate, is below the current short-term rate. The implication is that the economy will require an infusion from the monetary authority — specifically, reductions in the benchmark rate — to revive it.
The price transparency rules are a welcome change, for sure, health care experts told MarketWatch. But the numbers only reveal so much — and they still don't cut to the core of massive medical costs that can bankrupt a person.
In my view, it is unacceptable that the Federal Reserve has been hijacked by the very bankers it is in charge of regulating. I think the American people would be shocked to learn that Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan Chase, served on the board of the New York Fed at the same time that his bank received a $391 billion bailout from the Federal Reserve. That is a clear conflict of interest that I would ban as president. When I am elected, the foxes will no longer be guarding the henhouse at the Fed. Under my administration, banking industry executives will no longer be allowed to serve on the Fed's boards and handpick its members and staff.

Allow me to put your credit-card debt into perspective. A $7,000 credit balance with an 18% annual rate, with a minimum payment of 2% of the balance, or $10, whichever is greater, would take 188 months or just nearly 16 years to pay off. Making minimum payments on your credit card is a long road to nowhere, and making no payments will lead to debt collectors and more stress.

Upper-income individuals would face higher capital gains taxes under the Biden plan. Under current law, the maximum effective federal income tax rate on net long-term capital gains and qualified dividends recognized by individual taxpayers is 23.8%, as explained in the main body of this column. Under the Biden plan, net long-term gains (and presumably dividends) collected by those with incomes above $1 million would be taxed at the same 39.6% maximum rate that is proposed for ordinary income and net short-term capital gains. With the 3.8% NIIT add-on, the maximum effective rate on net long-term gains would 43.4% (39.6% plus 3.8%). That would be almost double the current maximum effective rate of only 23.8%.

In more than half (59%) of housing markets nationwide — 442 of 755 U.S. counties — renting a three-bedroom property is now more affordable than buying a median-priced home, according to a new report from real-estate data firm Attom Data Solutions.

Basically, I don't have a plan. And I need one. Help. Thank you.
It isn't surprising to me that we're tightening up at the short-end but the fact that monetary policy both here and abroad has been pushing down on the long rate means that this is going to be a little bit different exit strategy than what we've historically seen. We haven't had a bloated balance sheet around the world in previous periods. People who are taking a lot of meaning from the slope of the yield curve, I think, need to consider what it means to be in a different monetary policy framework — which is that Europe, Japan and the United States have a balance sheet that intentionally was suppressing long rates. So the signal value probably isn't quite the same, but it is a reason to your earlier question about why financial conditions haven't tightened more because the balance sheets are likely to only come down gradually over time. Now you could do it differently, and if you want to see the long end of the market go up quickly I can certainly imagine policies of central banks in some part of the world deciding to sell long-term securities would have the impact of pushing up the yield curve. I'm not advocating that. But I think it is an intentional policy. It is not as if this is an unanticipated outcome.
Note on the chart that the smart money flows are neutral in Netflix. This goes back to what I said above. Smart money tends to take risk into account. After the recent run-up in Netflix, when risk is taken into account, in addition to the potential reward, the risk-reward is balanced. The momo crowd does not care about the risk and continues to heavily buy.

So far, investors have largely shrugged off Trump's campaign threats to label China a currency manipulator and to impose tariffs on imported goods. Since then, he's barely mentioned the protectionist measures that had been a substantial part of his campaign, noted Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda.
Medical technology went through an amazing development in the 2010s, and there's now no single square centimeter of the human body without quantifiable data. For example, AliveCor's Kardia and Apple Watch measure electrocardiogram and detect atrial fibrillation with high sensitivity. The EKO Core digital stethoscope records heart and lung sounds as a digital stethoscope, while blood pressure is monitored with the Omron Blood Pressure Smartwatch, the MOCAcare pocket sensor, and blood pressure cuff, the iHealth Clear, the Skeeper, a pocket cardiologist, or the Withings Blood Pressure Monitor, and of course, dozens of traditional blood pressure cuffs.
You didn't say whether your brother has been appointed as your mother's durable power of attorney. If you saw evidence of financial misdeeds, you could ask a civil court to provide an accounting of how your mother's money is being spent, according to the American Bar Association. You could also take a case in civil court to force him to repay any money withdrawn from your mother's accounts without her knowledge and revoke his durable power of attorney.
Under current law, parents can collect a credit of up to $2,000 for each under-age-13 qualifying child. This is a refundable credit, which means you don't have to have any federal income tax liability to collect the credit. In other words, the child credit is free money.
Americans can save even more with tax-advantaged health plans. Some employers offer health savings accounts (or HSAs), which offer tax-free contributions, growth and withdrawals. Workers must have a high-deductible health plan to qualify however (which means they'd be paying more up front for their medical expenses before the insurer begins covering costs). Flexible Spending Accounts allow employees to contribute a specific amount of their salary upfront, and then use that money to spend tax-free on medical expenses throughout the year. Money in an FSA must be used before the end of the year or will be forfeited.

It's an architectural flaw brought about by a design decision made to increase performance, and it's baked into hardware. The required software fix will slow things down, said Roger Kay, principal analyst at Endpoint Technologies, in an email. Now, many performance-oriented tasks, like gaming, don't switch much between user and kernel levels, but many cloud computing tasks do. And those servers are mission critical. They're right in the middle of the workflow. Intel has almost all the server hardware locked up. This could open it for others, notably AMD.

If a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist. When it comes to Wall Street reform that must be our bottom line. This is true not just from a risk perspective and the fear of another bailout.

That narrow margin could also incentivize bipartisanship, though.

The Biden plan would impose a new 15% minimum tax on corporations with at least $100 million in annual income that pay little or no federal income tax under the regular rules. An affected corporation would pay the greater of: (1) the regular federal income tax bill or (2) 15% of reported book net income. This new tax would raise an estimated $160 billion to $320 billion over 10 years.

Changes like; a marriage, birth of a child, death of a family member, a change in health status, divorce, change of jobs, caring for a special needs child, entering retirement, charitable giving decisions, selling of a primary residence or investment property.

To see how that happens, look at the Social Security benefit formula. It applies three factors to the individual's average indexed monthly earnings (AIME). Thus, in 2020, a person's benefit would be the sum of 90% of the first $960 of AIME, 32% of AIME between $960 and $5,785, and 15% of AIME over $5,785 (see Table 1).

A reduction in the top corporate tax rate to 20% from 35% could add $5 to $7 a share to S&P 500 earnings in 2017, said Russ Koesterich, co–portfolio manager of BlackRock's Global Allocation Fund, in a blog post. That would go a long way toward closing the gap between Wall Street expectations for earnings and reality, he said, providing a real-life tailwind, in the form of faster earnings growth, to a market increasingly driven by hope over experience.

The WEP reduces the first factor in the benefit formula from 90% to 40%; the 32% and 15% factors remain unchanged. It is not a perfect solution. The benefit cut is proportionately larger for workers with low AIMEs, regardless of whether they were a high- or low-earner in their uncovered employment. Albeit, the WEP does guarantee that the reduction in benefits cannot exceed half of the worker's public pension, which protects those with low pensions from uncovered work.

This period could be characterized as one in which the new drugs and technology for heart disease and stroke identified in the 1970s and 1980s were only beginning to have a positive effect and the impact of male smoking two or three decades earlier continued to have a negative effect on mortality improvement. Further, the initial surge in mortality improvement due to the introduction of Medicare and Medicaid had petered out.

The COLA for next year is 2.8%, which would otherwise increase this monthly payment by $39. A reduction of that COLA by 1 percentage point would reduce the monthly increase to $25, or $14 less.
Many retailers have been coping with issues related to the unseasonable winter temperatures at the tail end of 2015, and Under Armour was no exception. The company experienced a 2% holiday sales decline, according to SportsScan data with softness showing in sweats and fleeces.

Of course, my decision stings because I literally could not have chosen a better stock. Remember, Netflix is up about 3,400% since the start of 2008. For comparison's sake, Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, -2.92% is up a mere 139.1% over that period, while Apple Inc. AAPL, -3.39% is up 324%, a quadrupling in value that has made it the largest U.S. company by market cap. Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -3.44% is up 774.1% over this period; it has also become one of Netflix's biggest rivals in the online streaming space, a category that barely existed nine years ago. Among the other quadruple-digit percentage gainers, Tesla Motors Inc. TSLA, -6.93% is up 1,139.9%, although it only went public in June 2010. (Too rich for my blood, I told a friend in 2012, right before it jumped 344% in the subsequent year.)
There was a 0.4% rise in grocery sales offset by a 2.3% fall in general merchandise (clothing, toys and electrical goods). Around three years ago, Sainsbury's snapped up Argos owner Home Retail Group and has been busy cutting costs and integrating the business.

Kaplan is not a voting member of the Fed's interest-rate committee this year, but he is influential as a member of the central bank's subcommittee on communications with markets.
My husband and I grew up dirt poor — I mean he literally had holes in the floor where you could see the dirt. I was fairly better off, my single mother had been expected to marry and have no need for understanding how things like credit worked (her father was a loan officer; it was a different time). At times, we had a little money and, at other times, we ate at the local churches.

Still, AirHelp recommends that passengers experiencing long delays or canceled flights hold on to their boarding pass and any other travel documents, request an alternate flight to their destination, and negotiate with the airline for compensation for inconvenience.
That all sounds good, but there is a catch. There is a maximum dollar amount you can defer from your income. For 2018, that amount is $18,500. (There is an additional $6,000 catch up amount available for those aged 50 or over, but this amount will not be considered in this example since not all employers provide a match on the catch up amount.) Once you reach the maximum deferral limit, your payroll deductions will cease.

It jolted the markets earlier this month, particularly since the general consensus had been that the BOJ was in [easy-money mode] for the long haul, wrote Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets U.K. This month's actions have shown that can't be taken for granted, so markets will be paying close attention to not only what Kuroda does, but also how [he] guides future expectations of policy moves later on into 2018.
Strong global demand: Aside from the charts and asset rotation, there is structural demand that will provide a lift for gold. For starters, look at India, where gold imports surged an amazing 67% in 2017. The nation is the No. 2 consumer gold market in the world behind China, so that's an encouraging sign of retail demand. As for China, demand for gold bars through November was up 40% from a year earlier, according to gold portal Kitco. That speaks to strong momentum.
The economic recovery has proven to be faster than expected, he noted. In June, the Fed expected 2020 GDP growth would be minus-6.5% on a year-over-year basis. Now, the Fed expects it will be less than minus-2%.
On the one hand, the outlook for gold and other metals look bullish in 2019. The Fed's likely inaction this year [according to some analysis, though others disagree] should help to devalue the dollar against her major rivals, said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst with Forex.com. The dollar and gold, primarily priced in dollars, usually have an inverse relationship.

With the recent moves, oil has already exceeded J.P. Morgan's 2018 year-end forecast of $65 per barrel for Brent and $60.50 for WTI. The Wall Street bank said prices are likely to stay high in the first half of the year, but could return to shaky ground in the second half if OPEC ends its production cuts and U.S. shale ramps up production in response to the recent rally.

Of course, in hindsight I recall having always read that one should not give their children one's savings. But I thought that my son, whom I always put before me and financially supported, would not be such a heartless and greedy person.
Men and women approached their investments differently, however. Significantly more men — 65% — took advantage of COVID-19 relief programs, compared with 28% of women, but they were also more likely to take a distribution or borrow from their retirement accounts (49% versus 14% and 44% versus 11%, respectively). Women were less likely to make a change to their stockholdings, and less likely to check their accounts daily. Almost four in 10 men were willing to take on more investment risks, compared with 9% of women.
The Green New Deal is premised on three observations: First, there are unutilized and underutilized resources — especially human talent — that can be used effectively. Second, if there were more demand for those with low and medium skills, their wages and standards of living would rise. Third, a good environment is an essential part of human wellbeing, today and in the future.

Like a doctor or lawyer, people usually come to the Moneyologist when there's something wrong, so we're not catching people at their best when they're fighting over estates or plotting against their stepchildren. There were many instances of people who did want to do the right thing, like this lady who wants to know how to disperse $150,000 she received from her ex-husband's pension. Or this mother who didn't want to receive anything from her abusive ex-husband's estate.

I think the risk is that you see a widening gap between who can afford to buy a home and who can't and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy that those folks who aren't able to afford to buy can't build wealth through real estate.

Norway was also No. 1 out of 155 countries on the 2017 World Happiness Report, up from No. 4 the year before, followed by Denmark (last year's No. 1), Iceland and Switzerland. The U.S. was trailing at No. 14. These four countries rank highly on all the main factors found to support happiness: caring, freedom, generosity, honesty, health, income and good governance. Their averages are so close that small changes can re-order the rankings from year to year, the report said.

Timeshares and recreational vehicles often are pitched as a way to save on future vacations. Anyone who has owned either knows that's not necessarily true. First-time RV buyers, for example, often underestimate the costs of maintaining, repairing and fueling their rigs.

A report by the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum on the yuan and the multi-currency reserve system stated in January 2013: After six years of gradual appreciation against the dollar — amounting to 30% in nominal terms since 2005, as part of China's modification of the currency peg — the renminbi no longer seems fundamentally undervalued against the dollar. For much of this period, markets treated the renminbi as a one-way bet. However, over the course of 2012 and 2013, repeated periods of slight weakness indicated that this view would have to change.

ATHENS, Greece (Project Syndicate)—A house of cards. A set of lies we have unconsciously accepted. That's what our certainties seem like during profound crises.

The fact that you were willing to take care of her is admirable. Many children don't have that willingness. Some would even like to charge their parents for taking them on regular trips to the doctor's office or grocery store. But — as hard as it may be to see your n'e'r-do-well brother take control of your mother's emotional and financial life — it doesn't mean you are entitled to that money. Is your mother of sound mind?

This fellow has been married three years and he was surprised (and not in a good way) by his wife's lack of savings and her unwillingness to work. This is not matched by an unwillingness to borrow money. She does not help me with the mortgage or property tax.

Instead of paying banks interest on these reserves, the Fed should charge them a fee that could be used to provide affordable loans to small businesses to create hundreds of thousands of jobs.
Innovation is more important than ever: From brewers that sell only kegs to those who invest big in their communities and employees, the most brilliant and successful new breweries find ways to branch out and separate themselves from the pack. If you're canning organic beer, growing your own ingredients for locally branded beers, using one way kegs or using your facilities as a hub for small brewers seeking a hand up, you're finding an angle and moving U.S. beer forward. The big brewers are doing the same, and have been for decades, but if you can use their size and limitations against them and make beer that stands the test of time, even years of struggle can eventually pay off. The innovators are creating some of the best stories in the beer industry right now, and we're hoping to tell more of them.

Made of flexible, waterproof materials impervious to stretching and twisting coupled with tiny electrodes, digital tattoos are able to record and transmit information about the wearer to smartphones or other connected devices. While these are only in use in research projects, they could allow health-care experts to monitor and diagnose critical health conditions such as heart arrhythmia, heart activities of premature babies, sleep disorders and brain activities noninvasively. Moreover, by tracking vital signs 24 hours a day, without the need for a charger, it is especially suited for following patients with high risk of stroke, for example. Although we are not there yet, there are certain promising solutions on the market such as MC10's BioStampRC Sensor.

Easily. Capitalism's greatest apostles, like Adam Smith, emphasized its unintended consequences: precisely because profit-seeking individuals have no regard for anyone else, they end up serving society. The key to converting private vice into public virtue is competition, which impels capitalists to pursue activities that maximize their profits. In a competitive market, that serves the common good by boosting the range and quality of available goods and services while constantly lowering prices.

Housing, transportation and food are the three biggest expenses. But my advice is to start with the small stuff, because you're proving to yourself you can do it. You're building those habits.

Believe me, I understand this. I've written numerous articles about why active investing — where the components of a portfolio are chosen by an individual — is inferior to simply buying index funds. And I get that the day traders who try and beat the market are almost guaranteed to get hosed. Admittedly these lessons don't apply completely here, as there's a difference between short-term speculation and my buy-and-hold plan, and I would've been happy with gains even if they didn't beat the market. Still, it's hard to deny that if you want a big payoff, putting all your eggs in one basket — especially an untested one, as opposed to a market bellwether that pays a steady dividend — is extremely risky, a thousand-to-one shot. It just so happens that in this case, I picked the one.

 Buyers want classic or vintage cars that have been retrofitted with modern engines, power steering, and even air conditioning. 
That means that many married couples will end up taking the standard deduction, because their local tax deduction, mortgage interest and other allowable deductions don't exceed their $24,000 standard deduction and thus it isn't worth itemizing. Even if their itemized deductions exceed the $24,000 threshold, the benefits of itemizing will likely prove modest.
Biden would reinstate or expand tax incentives intended to reduce carbon emissions — such as deductions for emission-reducing investments in residential and commercial buildings and restored credits for buying electric vehicles produced by manufacturers whose credits have been phased-out under current law. Biden would also eliminate federal income tax deductions for oil and gas drilling costs and depletion.
If anything, the strong euro will dampen inflation pressures and squeeze earnings. Anglo-American companies are more likely to pass along currency developments to customers, while Continental and Japanese businesses appear to put more emphasis on market share than short-term profitability are less likely, they said. The euro's 2.5% appreciation on a trade-weighted basis is tantamount to a 40 basis points tightening of monetary policy.

In fact, having a capital loss carryover could turn out to be a pretty good deal. The carryover can be used to shelter both short-term gains and long-term gains recognized next year and beyond. This can give you extra investing flexibility in those years, because you won't have to hold appreciated securities for over a year to get a lower tax rate. You'll pay 0% to the extent you can shelter gains with your loss carryover. If there are future tax rate increases (which I think are unlikely through at least 2022), capital loss carryovers into future years could turn out to be really valuable.
The surge in consumer sentiment that's been recorded since the presidential election is typical, Fannie chief economist Doug Duncan noted in a statement, and whether buyers can withstand the corresponding jump in mortgage rates is an open question.
In global health, for example, an algorithm can provide a reliable map of future measles outbreak hot spots. It uses statistics on measles vaccination rates and disease outbreaks from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as non-traditional health data, including social media and a huge range of medical records. That's just one example, but the field is already buzzing with smart algorithms that can facilitate the search for new drug targets; improve the speed of clinical trials or spot tumors on computed tomography (CT) scans.
May was initially meant to submit her controversial plan, which is deeply unpopular within her own Conservative party, to a vote in December, but postponed it in order to avoid defeat. Market participants remain skeptical that May will prevail.

The rule establishes a test for determining independent contractor status under the Federal Labor Standards Act, giving more weight to two of five factors, which critics say are favorable to gig companies such as Uber Technologies Inc.

The other factors are skill, permanence of the working relationship and whether the work is part of an integrated unit of production.

Additionally, consumers should be aware how much interest they're earning on their banks accounts. Stock-trading platform Robinhood made a huge splash in December when it announced banking accounts that were set to earn 3% interest. Though the company has since delayed the rollout of these accounts amid regulatory scrutiny, the public's enthusiastic reaction to the announcement — some 850,000 people joined a waitlist for the accounts — shows that Americans are hungry to earn interest on their cash.

To explain this, we need to delve a bit deeper into how your brain on Facebook works. After posting a comment or a photo, you're exposing yourself to a slew of notifications and reactions that make you feel good. Thumbs up, positive comments and emojis all light up special parts of your brain that govern the release of dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin and endorphins (also known as DOSE chemicals) — a cocktail that, simply put, makes you happy. Of those, dopamine is the most interesting, as it is responsible not for happiness, but for the anticipation thereof (which can become addictive) and plays a pivotal role in the reward system.

The U.S. dollar, which also tends to find support during periods of chaos, was also largely unfazed. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.08% , a measure of the currency against a basket of six major rivals, was little changed near 89.41.
Rosengren: The [Fed forecasts] in December had three tightenings. I actually think we'll probably need a little bit more than that. I'm hopeful that we can continue to do it gradually. Doing it gradually probably requires us to continue to be doing it though. So if we were to slow down for some reason, I would be worried that at some point we would have to start moving more quickly. I would be worried about moving quickly at a time when asset prices were already at very high valuations. I think being able to do it more leisurely is one reason why we haven't had as much of a slowdown and probably has reduced the probability of having a recession. In addition, fiscal policy being so stimulative is a period where you wouldn't expect an economic downturn either.
The start of a new year naturally creates incentive for making changes. Days that seem like transition points motivate people to take advantage of the fresh-start effect, research shows. Birthdays, the beginning of a semester, and the start of a new week all fall under this new transition time. Researchers at the Wharton School came to this conclusion after they discovered that visits to the university fitness center spiked during these turning points.
No matter what stage you're at in thinking about or planning for early retirement (or, heck, for regular retirement!), take some time to think through these questions and their answers. If you struggle to answer any of them, then early retirement may not be right for you, or may not be right for you right now, and that's okay! Not everyone has to share this vision for their future. Particularly if you don't have a clear vision of what you want to retire to, there's nothing wrong with working a little longer, or even a lot longer.

It is no secret that millions of Americans have become disillusioned with our political process. They don't vote. They don't believe much of what comes out of Washington. They don't think anyone is there representing their interests. In my view, one of the reasons for that deep disillusionment is the widespread understanding that our criminal justice system is broken and grossly unfair – and that we do not have equal justice under the law. The average American sees kids being arrested and sometimes even jailed for possessing marijuana or other minor crimes. But when it comes to Wall Street executives, some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in this country, whose illegal behavior caused pain and suffering for millions – somehow nothing happens to them. No police record. No jail time. No justice.
Amid the current protests, however, the West has an opportunity to push Iran to suspend its regional ambitions and focus on its desperate domestic situation. If an agreement is reached, existing sanctions can be reduced; if Iran's leaders refuse to budge, new sanctions could be introduced.

Speaker of the House Paul Ryan is proposing a big change to Medicare as part of the broad-ranging Better Way plan. Under the current Medicare program, the government provides health insurance for people 65 and over and adults with disabilities. Under the Better Way plan, the government would provide a voucher, and the elderly and disabled would select a plan from a private insurer. Speaker Ryan argues that this change will help make the Medicare program more fiscally stable.

Trump has never been clear and consistent about what he will do as president. Tax cuts are clearly on his agenda, and the stimulus could lead to higher asset prices. Lower corporate taxes are naturally supposed to lead to higher share prices, while cuts in personal income tax might lead to higher home prices (though possibly offset by other changes in the tax system).

Developments in artificial intelligence will dominate the next decade. Machine learning is a method for creating artificial narrow intelligence — narrow refers to doing one task extremely well — and a field of computer science that enables computers to learn without being explicitly programmed, building on top of computational statistics and data mining. The field has different types: it could be supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised or reinforcement learning, among others. It has an unprecedented potential to transform health-care processes and medical tasks in the future — and it has already started its invisible revolution.

Just a few instances of very real competition to Netflix include Amazon (which just won best comedy series at the Golden Globes), Walt Disney Co.

Each of these companies has both the know-how and the capital to pose serious headaches for Netflix.

GE's outlook for taxes may be of interest after the passage of tax reform legislation, which GE applauded for upgrading the U.S. to a territorial tax system for the first time in history. The company said in October that the fourth-quarter tax rate was expected to be around zero, and the rate for 2017 was projected to be in the low single digits percentage range, which is below the new baseline corporate tax rate of 21%.
According to USAMega.com, if one person wins the current lottery and the jackpot is $1.5 billion, the lump-sum payout will be $930 million. After federal taxes are withheld — and Uncle Sam requires that 25% of the winnings are withheld, but the winner presumably owes closer to 40% overall — the payment is a bit under $700 million, which may face additional state withholdings. If state tariffs are at the 5% or 6% rate, the net payout will be at or below $650 million. (The confusing discrepancy between what is withheld versus what someone at the top tax rate must pay is why plenty of past lottery winners wound up in tax trouble with Uncle Sam.)

We have taken actions to replace underperforming sales team members, and we believe that the new people we have been putting in place, combined with other actions, will enable us to capitalize on our improved product offering and exciting roadmap in 2018. The company expects to fully report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 8. Aerohive shares plunged more than 18% in light after-hours trading following the announcement.

On the other hand, parents or others who would rather not be cosigners on accounts may view the discontinued practice as a good thing, Schulz said; cosigners are taking the risk that the applicant they are cosigning for will pay his or her bill responsibly, as to not damage the co-signer's credit. Eliminating the option of cosigners may take away that risk and responsibility.
MR. RAFFENSPERGER: Well, I've listened to what…the president has just said. President Trump, we've had several lawsuits, and we've had to respond in court to the lawsuits and the contentions.

But what can be even more significant is that many employers offer matching contributions, up to a certain percentage of your salary.
Two things: If you can't afford it — if you know the money's not in the bank — don't buy it. When I graduated college I got into credit card debt like everybody else and it took me two or three years to get out of it. I maybe had $5,000 [in debt], but the first job I had out of college was teaching English making $21,000 a year. It would have taken me 30 years to pay that off at that salary. I cut up my credit cards, maybe three years out of college, and I've only used a debit card ever since. So if it's not in my bank account, I don't buy it.
The first secret was thus exposed: Governments retain inexorable power. What we discovered in 2020 is that governments had been choosing not to exercise their enormous powers so that those whom globalization had enriched could exercise their own.

Many millennials believe they will need to take action on their own to save for their retirement. Four out of five millennials surveyed are worried that Social Security will not be there for them when they are ready to retire.

Looking to the future though, it seems likely that, if anything, Disney will reduce the value of the free-dining offer rather than increase it, Bricker said. Though higher prices did prompt attendance to drop at Walt Disney World back in 2017, Disney opened a new area at its Hollywood Studios theme park based on the Toy Story franchise last summer and is set to unveil a new area inspired by the Star Wars films this fall. With the record numbers of visitors expected to flock to Florida for those attractions, Disney won't have as much need for the free-dining incentive in the coming years.
It's unlikely to change American habits or literacy levels, but it shifts the national conversations away from tweets and towards a book, said Aram Sinnreich, professor of communications at the American University, Washington.

Many toxic parents compare one sibling unfavorably with another to make the target child feel that he's not doing enough to gain parental affection, she adds. This motivates the child to do whatever the parents want in order to regain their favor. This divide-and-conquer technique is often unleashed against children who become a little too independent, threatening the balance of the family system.

You could ask your mother to set up an irrevocable or revocable living trust with strict instructions on how her money should be spent. But you should approach this with the aim of helping her — not revisiting the subject of the down payment. If your mother dies without a will, you and your brother are legal heirs. If she dies with a will and doesn't explicitly disinherit you, then you have an excellent case that she simply neglected to mention you.
This was in the fall of 2007. I was fresh out of college and had just started at my first full-time job, an entry-level reporting position where I covered corporate news and stock price movements, areas of the world I had little direct experience with. The nature of my beat made me interested in the market, and after a while I had the idea to save up $5,000 and invest it. I remember thinking that this would be a graduation and employment gift to myself as much as an investment; I figured I'd be more invested in my job if I had some skin in the game, and if I made some money in the bargain, all the better.

Just as the specific goal flipped from debt to retirement savings, the vague goal went in the opposite direction. In 2015, the idea was simply to add two new mutual funds to my retirement portfolio, with those funds getting regular monthly set-asides.

Medicare's lower growth rate is really remarkable for two reasons. First, the numbers include the big increase in Medicare spending in 2006 due to the introduction of the Prescription Drug program (Medicare Part D). Second, the populations that Medicare covers — people over 65 and individuals with disabilities — have significant health care needs compared to the population covered by private insurance. Yet, spending growth among private insurers has significantly exceeded that in the Medicare program.

The nature of this threat (nice place you got here, hate to see anything happen to it … or to you) won't be lost on anyone familiar with mobster movies. Trump's take on the tough-guy cliché wasn't particularly coherent, but it met the trope's two basic requirements.

Moreover, the concentration of extremely wealthy individuals in certain cities could be simply a reflection of different cultural approaches to wealth.

It's hard to be careful, though, when it's difficult or impossible to predict what that care will ultimately cost. Medical providers charge wildly different amounts for the same treatments, and what they charge may be wildly different from what they'll actually accept. (Witness the recent $16,800 bill we got for a colonoscopy that insurance finally settled, in full, for $350.) What high-deductible plans can do is cause people to put off seeing the doctor, which ultimately can result in much bigger bills for treatment.
But if alcohol-fueled cases are slowing in this day of ride-sharing, Trendowski, the founder of Dram Shop Forensics, says she's not seeing it. However, she only sees the cases where things go wrong, she acknowledged.
There's a much greater understanding of the size and the scope of our mass incarceration problem in this country, then when lawmakers put ban on providing Pell grants to inmates in place, diZerega said.
The TCJA shortens from seven to five years the depreciation period for new machinery and equipment that is placed in service after 12/31/17 and used in a farming business (other than grain bins, cotton ginning assets, fences, or other land improvements).
Intel first learned of the vulnerability in June but said it took the lead working with software giants and other hardware makers on patches that would negate the effects of Meltdown. Consumers should update their devices when prompted to ensure that updates meant to stop Meltdown are installed, but there apparently is no known cure for Spectre at this time.
Most likely, winter in the Northern Hemisphere will bring a sharp rise in infections and deaths. The losses will be particularly pronounced in Europe and North America, where daily infection rates were already spiking in mid-autumn. And just as the weather starts to warm in the north, South America will cool and another epidemic wave will crash over us.
Meanwhile, a post from MarketWatch that suggested consumers should ideally save twice their salary by the time they're 35 set Twitter TWTR, -1.47% ablaze as users balked at how lofty a task that seemed to be.
In the end, there's not really a right or wrong decision, so much as mistakes that lottery winners and ordinary workers with pension benefits want to avoid. Ultimately, it's important to consider the choices rather than lunging at the fast-cash-now option. After all, the odds of having any additional jackpots are even longer than the chances you have with a big choice on a lump sum in the first place.
Next Avenue: Why did you write 'Meaningful Work?'
Hospitals will also show their highest and lowest negotiated rate for service.
Perhaps even more interesting to investors is the prospect of higher dividends and a more aggressive buyback strategy. The massive corporate tax cuts passed by Congress late last year is a boon to cash-rich profit machines like Apple, and Wall Street expects the tech giant to share its good fortune with shareholders.
In addition, Microsoft is working on open source solutions to improve the speed, governance and security of existing blockchain protocols like Ethereum, Hyperledger, Quorum and R3's Corda, a Microsoft spokesperson said. The solution is called the Coco Framework and it enables existing ledgers to process transactions at close to standard enterprise database speeds.
The U.S. presidential election and Olympics aside, analysts expect TV advertising to decline. Dix at Wedbush said the trend of negative-to-flat ad growth for U.S. TV networks continues. Newer technology that would help advertisers target and engage with audiences, potentially offering higher ad growth aren't yet ready for scale, Dix wrote.

How is it being a movie composers in an era where not so many people buy soundtracks in record stores?
In a main CES keynote that in previous years hosted Intel Corp. INTC, +1.55% and Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +0.76% CEOs, Su detailed AMD's 2019 plans for computers, servers and videogames. With new, high-end graphics cards and a second-generation server chip, Su particularly went after Nvidia and Intel, showing performance of early versions of its 7-nanometer hardware against those rivals' offerings.
For now, both a voluntary emissions offset program, such as that tracked and priced by S&P Global Platts, and the existing compliance-mandated cap-and-trade programs will have a shared role, said Kramarchuk. Cap-and-trade is decades old but never achieved broad adoption, in part because of fragmentation and shallow volume. California, for instance, still engages in a regional cap-and-trade program. And South Korea has taken a lead in expanding its own emissions trading.
And in Michigan, a 50-person cyber civilian corps trains for emergencies as a kind of IT version of a volunteer fire department. The group is working with other states to help develop similar response plans, said Tonia Cronin, its program manager.
Metso Oyj FI:METSO fell 9.8% as the Finnish engineering company warned that fourth-quarter 2017 profitability of its minerals segment will be weaker than expected, due to a higher-than-estimated share of equipment sales compared to services sales and a weak margin of the services business. Metso said overall fourth-quarter sales are set to rise 5% from a year ago, to €710 million.
Mutual funds: Everything you need to know
To be deductible alimony, a payment must be made in cash or cash equivalent.
Many Fed officials noted that the Fed should tell markets clearly its assessment of progress well in advance of the time when the central bank might change the pace of the purchases.
On Jan. 17, the central bank introduced a new currency-swap facility to provide dollars to local banks in exchange for lira. If lira are auctioned at rates above the current market rate, the subsequent rise in borrowing rates could support the lira by fending off speculators hoping to short the currency, UniCredit said.
The first month of the new year is also traditionally the time that splitting spouses act on the Auld Lang Syne lyrics asking, Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and never brought to mind?
Amid this risk-on rally, many investors likely overlooked gold US:GCG8.
The IRS isn't engaging in do-overs on the $600 checks because another tax-filing season is approaching. The tax collection agency says it has to act fast under a compressed timeline. (The IRS did have a process to claim missing or stymied checks for the $1,200 payments.)
Friday was a day of significant gains for U.S. stocks, after the Labor Department's reported the U.S. economy added 312,000 jobs during December, well above the consensus forecast of a 182,000 increase among economists polled by MarketWatch.
The reality is that, unbelievably, millions of low-income Americans live in communities where there are no normal banking services. Today, if you live in a low-income community and you need to cash a check or get a loan to pay for a car repair or a medical emergency, where do you go?
In most divorce cases, especially in California which is a community property state, couples are instructed to divide their shared assets down the middle (in monetary terms) and, as part of that settlement, they're allowed to keep what they own personally, such as clothing and jewelry. In your state, you take out of the marriage what you brought into it, but this grows more complicated when a home has appreciated during a marriage and/or when marital assets were used to pay the mortgage (even though, in this case, your husband never actually worked). I'm not against your giving a little money to your parents if they need it for a specific reason, but not to hide it before your divorce is over. If you do have to split those savings, $10,000 is a small price to pay for your freedom. (Interestingly, I told a similar thing to a fellow earlier this week, who learned a $10,000 lesson.) One more consideration: You may need that $10,000 in savings for legal fees.
Square bought Weebly, a website-creation platform, back in May, giving the company a foothold in web commerce. Fellow fintech company PayPal Holdings Inc. PYPL, -0.27% , which is rooted in online payments, is looking to bolster its omnichannel offerings as well, by moving in the other direction: PayPal in September purchased iZettle, a company that makes point-of-sale products and card readers. PayPal-owned Braintree also facilitates mobile payments, as does rival Stripe Inc.
• As shown on the chart, momo crowd money flows are extremely positive in Netflix NFLX, +0.73% . Short-squeeze money flows are also extremely positive in Netflix. (On Friday several analysts upgraded the stock.) This means Netflix can fly if there is some good news, such as earnings that are better than the whisper numbers. Investors ought to pay attention to whisper numbers and not the consensus numbers because stocks move based on the difference between those two.
No tech company is going to willingly run a public demo where it doesn't win, but AMD's willingness to throw a gauntlet down in aiming for the chip thrones held by Intel and Nvidia shows that it is confident that it will not fall apart as it has in previous attempts. Su has managed to push AMD back into competition with larger rivals, and Wednesday's appearance on the biggest stage tech has to offer shows that she is confident AMD can do much more.
Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday said the U.K. will seek a bold new trade deal with the European Union and leave the bloc's single market, as she delivered a much-anticipated speech that confirmed a so-called hard Brexit is in the works.
That includes potentially using reconciliation to advance critical priorities for American families, he said.
Do an apples-to-apples comparison to at least see if the lump-sum offer is a good one, Haithcock said. You have other decisions to make about what you might be able to do if you invest the lump-sum and in evaluating the safety of your pension and the company's ability to pay it, but start with a direct comparison of what you can get with the money they are offering you.
They're not near that level yet, but the group of large-cap technology stocks suffered during the fourth quarter of 2018, and with another year of excellent sales growth expected for most of them, you might be looking at buying opportunities.
And then you say, well, they left their station. You know, if you look at the tape – and this was – it – this was reviewed by professional police and detectives and other people – when they left in a rush – everybody left in a rush because of the watermain – but everybody left in a rush, these people left their station. When they came back, they didn't go to their station. They went to the apron wrapped around the table, under which were thousands and thousands of ballots in a box that was not an official or a sealed box, and then they took those, and they went back to a different station. So if they would have come back, they would have walked to their station and they would have continued to work. But they couldn't do even that, because that's illegal because they had no Republican poll watchers.
Mike Coupe said on Wednesday: There has been a general sort of down trading, so people have been very, very careful in the way that they spent their money.
A wealth ratio is a measure of how effectively you've converted your lifetime income into wealth.
That was Vinik in a CNBC interview, in which he also laid out a bullish long-term market call but cautioned that the coming months could be bumpy.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: No, no, no. Did you ever check the ballots that were scammed by Ruby Freeman, known – a known political operative, ballotteer? Did you ever check who those votes were for?
And I would put financial conditions – that is not a goal of monetary policy – but it makes it harder to start tightening if you have to do a lot of tightening, and if you really have to slow down the economy. If you think that potential GDP is growing around 1.75%, well if you want to get the unemployment rate to gradually go up, you are going to have to be seeing some 1.5% [GDP prints] and some lower numbers than we've been seeing. When we see those numbers it is possible that you get more of a slowdown than you're anticipating, and that can be particularly true, I think, if financial markets are a little bit too ebullient. So I think financial conditions and financial stability issues complement some of the concerns I would have about whether we're getting to an unsustainable level of unemployment rate over time.
As you think about a transition, remember that careers are rarely linear. You can find passion in your work, whatever that may be, but it requires peeling back layers to understand who you are and what makes you tick.
The recent supply disruptions in Libya and the North Sea won't change the outlook for oil over the medium term, but rising potential global demand coupled with OPEC adhering to production cuts has helped to offset rising U.S. production, according to analysts at the Sevens Report.

The IRS has released the new-and-improved Form 1040 for your 2018 individual federal income tax return. The good news is the return is now postcard-sized if your tax situation is super-simple. The bad news is it's probably not — in which case the new Form 1040 is just alarmingly different than before rather than simpler.

In the U.S., the combination of Trump and a succession of new asset-price records — call it Trump-squared — has been sustaining the illusion underpinning current market optimism. For those who are not too stressed from having taken extreme positions in the markets, it will be interesting (if not profitable) to observe how the illusion morphs into a new perception, one that implies very different levels for speculative markets.
Netflix beat third-quarter revenue expectations, and has beat for seven of the past nine quarters.
It's a long-term shift in preference in consumer tastes.
To the extent Sears reorganizes around a much smaller store base, major hurdles to its long-term business will remain, said Christina Boni, vice president at Moody's. Scale, which is critical to competing in retail today, will be lacking and its core customer proposition still remains in question. Sears had been shrinking its store base and reducing costs in recent years but improvement in sales trends and profitability remained elusive.
After completing various interviews, questionnaires and background checks, contestants typically find out that they have been accepted to the show about two to three weeks before filming begins. In that time, they have to inform their employer — if they have a job — that they will be gone for anywhere from a week to a month and a half, assemble a TV-ready wardrobe and settle their finances for the next six weeks, since they are not allowed to have access to their phone, the Internet or television during filming.

But a slowdown in the first part of the year would not require more fiscal easing so long as the medium-run outlook remains intact, Mester said.
Rarely has a letter moved me as much as yours. You have created a wonderful life for yourself and done so without becoming hard of heart to those in your life or bitter about the past. You have maintained a strong relationship with your brother and a relationship with your mother that is based on love and service, while maintaining healthy emotional and financial boundaries. You have since learned that you can't do everything, nor should you have to do everything.
You're a big fan of going on a retreat to help find meaning in life. Can you talk about that?

O'Byrne also said that the ongoing political spectacle this week between Trump and sections of the intelligence community is a continuing geopolitical risk and shows how unstable the political situation in the U.S. remains.
KURT HILBERT: Mr. President and Cleta, this is Kurt Hilbert. If I might interject here for a moment.
Going back, primarily what you're – what you've talked about here, focused in on primarily, I believe, is the absentee ballot process. I don't believe that you're really questioning the Dominion machines because we did a hand re-tally, a 100 percent re-tally of all the ballots and compared that to what the machine said, and it came up with virtually the same result. Then we did the recount and we got virtually the same result. So I guess we could probably take that off the table. I don't think there's an issue about that.
A number of sites online (including ours) offer the opportunity to make a will with a bequest. For more complex, or large, bequests, it's best to talk to an attorney.

He made her believe his life was ruined because she adopted us. She claims she gave me my share of her estate in the form of a the down payment and said my brother's share was his schooling, which she paid for.

When her son gets his hands on the money it will be spent on drugs.

If your employer is making matching contributions, their payments will automatically stop when yours do. So, if you reach your $18,500 before the last paycheck of the year, your employer matching payments will stop before the end of the year and you may not receive your full match.

Example #1: I took a decidedly contrarian stance near the lows for the year in a March 25 column favoring all the hardest-hit sectors that the crowd hated the most.

As we get older, we have greater opportunities to find meaning in life if we're willing to look for it. The main reason it's true is we have an understanding of what it means to have a broken heart, otherwise known as sorrow. We can examine that and then begin to figure out what's next.
Many New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks opened for trading later than 9:30 a.m. on the NYSE even though they were traded at other exchanges and off-exchange venues before and after 9:30. Until NYSE-listed constituents of the S&P 500 index were opened on the NYSE, the S&P 500 index still reflected NYSE closing prices from August 21.
Medical bills can get expensive, but patients sometimes have more control over these costs than they realize. Patients can cut costs simply by asking their health practitioners questions, starting with whether a doctor and their affiliated labs — where a doctor may send you to get tests — are in network. Healthcare professionals belong to networks, and though patients can see doctors outside of their network, it will cost more.
We apparently don't believe in health insurance either. We are both in poor health, we pay cash for our son's dental and doctor visits, and because I'm a satisfactory degree of Native American descent, my son and I can run up to Oklahoma for major health needs for free if needs be. I did have to go to the ER last year. I pay $30 per month toward that bill, there's no interest on the account so I can take my time paying it off. My husband does not pay his medical debt.
To qualify as deductible alimony, a payment must be to or on behalf of a spouse or ex-spouse. Payments to third parties, such as attorneys and mortgage lenders, are permitted if they are made on behalf of a spouse or ex-spouse and pursuant to a divorce or separation agreement or at the written request of the spouse or ex-spouse.
In a statement, Melinda Hatton, the association's general counsel, said the organization supports price transparency and anything that will help patients plan their out-of-pocket costs. But the organization continues to believe that the disclosure of privately negotiated rates does nothing to help patients understand what they will actually pay for treatment and will create widespread confusion for them, she said.
