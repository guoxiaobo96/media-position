However, there is no guarantee employers would redistribute pooled tips, and critics say economic models show they will likely pocket them instead. If this proposed rule were finalized, restaurant owners could pocket between $523 million and $14.2 billion — with $5.8 billion being the best estimate — in tips earned by tipped workers each year, according to Economic Policy Institute economists Heidi Shierholz, David Cooper, Julia Wolfe, and Ben Zipperer.
The company expects all-day breakfast comparisons to be a hurdle going forward.
Kodak, which emerged from bankruptcy in September 2013 after a precipitous decline in fortunes that found it evicted from the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% in 2004, is a poster child for failing to embrace new technologies fast enough.
Smith also noted that over the last year, there has been a pronounced change in the robo advice landscape. Prior to 2016 there was widespread concern across the industry that robo advisers would fundamentally disrupt the traditional financial advice market, he said. Several start-up providers were gathering assets at meteoric rates and there were widespread assumptions that numerous other firms would jump into the market and enjoy similar success.
• A simple technique that investors will find useful to double their returns and control risk is to buy a core quantity and then surround it with trade-around positions. To The Arora Report subscribers, we provide a detailed methodology for using this technique. Along with the buy signal, the call was to add trade-around positions with tighter stops to lower risk.
Looking ahead, the importance of trust has never been more critical, now ranking as the second most important factor in purchasing decisions. When it comes to your finances, we're seeing the bumpy social media ride of this past year push many toward quality, trusting expert advice over friend-turned-unfriended 'sources.'
This trend has captivated many investors, but volatility in individual stocks has means you could be in for a wild ride as the emerging cannabis industry struggles through its growing pains. After all, many dot-com stocks didn't make it thanks to misreading the market or being outmaneuvered out by competitors. For those interested in playing this broader trend, then, a basket of marijuana stocks rounded up in an ETF could be just the ticket.
This global focus on climate change and carbon emissions means big things for clean energy stocks, particularly names in the wind and solar space that already have seen strong interest from Wall Street over the past few years.
So if you're looking for outperformance in 2021, it may be worth biasing your portfolio just a bit toward a high-growth sector. It doesn't have to be something as vanilla as technology, as a universe of sophisticated funds allow investors to zero in specific trends without buying individual stocks.

Nicholas Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the declines in both China's capital account and its foreign currency reserves have been driven by traders quickly unwinding bets that the yuan would continue to strengthen, following the yuan's August devaluation.
For investors, it means a new crop of companies asking to look after your nest egg, said Michael Kitces, partner and research director at Pinnacle Advisory Group. Now your social-media firms might start soliciting you for your money, too, he told MarketWatch.
Employers may offer automatic enrollment or automatic increases to 401(k) plan contributions. The former takes money out of an employee's pay before tax and automatically places it into a 401(k) (usually around 3%), which qualify as elective deferrals. Employees can opt out of this, though it does ensure there's some money saved for retirement and has helped savers stash away maybe $29.6 billion for retirement.

According to Cerulli Associates' research, Smith said there will be increasing pressure on traditional advice providers to broaden their advice services to maximize their value to clients. Advisers will no longer be able to tout their services as 'wealth managers' while focusing almost exclusively on the implementation and rebalancing of an accumulation portfolio, he said.
Its most popular plan will see the largest hike, to $13 per month from $11. That option offers high-definition streaming on up to two different internet-connected devices simultaneously. Even at the higher price, that plan is still a few dollars cheaper than HBO, whose streaming service charges $15 per month.
The question, he said, is not whether traditional firms will offer these types of platforms, but which will best connect their advisers to clients in ways that highlight the value of advisory services beyond commodified aspects of portfolio management.

Same-store sales jumped 11.1% in foundational markets, with Japan leading the way, the company said. Some Latin American markets also contributed to the strong showing.

The CFP Board believes, he said, that technology should be the tool that helps advisers do what is most meaningful: deepen client relationships and enhance the level of financial advice consumers receive. Ultimately, technology will continue to evolve and create scale and capacity that will enable advisers to do their jobs better and empower stronger connections with the clients they serve, he said.
The S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% rose 14.87 points, or 0.7%, to close at 2,280.07. Materials and financials led the gains, while telecoms and health-care stocks were the biggest laggards.
All the same, a short-term pullback could be on the cards, and even more so, if debt ceiling negotiations hit an impasse, as they did in the government shutdown. Appetite for U.S. government paper could suffer if credit ratings agencies see the political brinkmanship as a reason to strip away the U.S.'s gold-plated, triple-A credit rating.

Today's chart is upbeat, suggesting that oil could find a bottom at last. But the stat of the day tosses red meat to the bears, as it gives the latest damage estimate for global stocks in this not-so-happy new year.
Retirement savers cannot withdraw from their 401(k) plans before they turn 59 ½ years old (unless they become disabled or are separated from their employer after turning 55 years old). If distributions are made before 59 ½ years old, savers have to pay an additional 10% tax on the distribution (loans up to 50% of vested account balances are also allowed depending on the employer and plan, though they must be repaid within five years).
This article was originally published in 2017 and has been updated with the 2019 Golden Globes.
Late last year, Chinese policy makers announced they would begin publishing the yuan's valuation relative to three new currency baskets, including one that was trade-weighted.
There was talk of drastically changing 401(k) plans late last year, before the tax bill was passed. Reports suggested the contribution limit would be dropped to $2,400 per year, or somewhere between there and the then-current limit of $18,000. Others thought Congress might Rothify these accounts, by taxing contributions before investing them. Traditional 401(k) plans are tax-deferred, which means they're taxed at withdrawal. The new tax bill ended up not including either of these ideas, but still affects retirement savers and retirees, such as stopping recharacterizations of individual retirement accounts (which allow savers to undo decisions to rollover or convert accounts to Roth IRAs) or inspiring some to move to another state.
Global X FinTech ETF FINX, +0.60% is one of the best options to look at if you believe in the fintech megatrend. This $1 billion ETF is a who's who of the space, with big names like PayPal as well as smaller firms with a lot of growth ahead of them like digital invoicing firm Bottomline Technologies EPAY, -0.55% . There are other ETFs out there, some of which play specific trends like mobile payments or blockchain if you're into that, but this is an established option with a lot of interesting holdings.

Bruckenstein wasn't convinced that the FPA's deal with Betterment was a game changer either. The FPA does have over 20,000 members, but they are not a homogenous group, and they don't always follow the FPA blindly, he said. I've yet to encounter an adviser who chooses a piece of software based solely upon a sponsorship that a firm has with FPA.
In its latest budget and economic outlook, the CBO said the new estimate was due to its expectation that mandatory spending would be lower than earlier anticipated.

Build resilience. Losses feel catastrophic in the moment, so look at the big picture: You've survived worse, and you can survive this, too. While dropping the ball on a new account and taking a professional hit can be difficult, that can never compare to other personal challenges in your life that you have overcome, said Monahan, who suggests keeping a journal of the tough times you've already handled. Reminding yourself of traumatic situations that you have lived through will bring your strength and the ability to see your current situation as less than dire in the moment.
Access to thought leadership content and collaboration with industry influencers is just a tweet or an email away in today's world, and the fastest-growing advisers are already connecting with solution providers to implement tools for digital advice, he said. The partnership will allow Betterment for Advisors to deliver content to a larger audience, but I'm not certain if that will result in engagement and attention from the FPA membership.
Welsh said the efforts by the CFP Board and FPA are just baby steps. The real change is coming soon as technology becomes a bigger piece of financial services and organizations like the FPA and CFP Board will need to up their game to continue leading the way, he said.
But J.P. Morgan analyst Chris Schott described the settlement as an incremental negative, adding a potential future competitor to the market.
The U.S. gained 304,000 new jobs in January, although hiring at the end of 2018 wasn't as strong as originally reported. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4% from 3.9% and the 12-month rate of hourly wage gains dipped to 3.2% from a revised 3.3% in the prior three months that marked a post-recession high.
Eastman Kodak Co. on Tuesday became the latest to do so, when the company said it would begin a major blockchain initiative. Kodak intends to use digital ledgers to help photographers license their work and get paid for usage.
Acthar will likely remain controversial, Schott said, but the company continues to generate strong operating cash flows, and we expect the company to continue to focus on diversifying the business through business development.

For his part, Winterberg suggested that financial advisers must examine what aspects of their practice is right for robo and which isn't. Financial advice providers must challenge themselves, and their business models, today to identify what aspects of their work are candidates for automation and algorithms, and what aspects cannot be automated, he said. The opportunity for advice providers' success in the future lies in augmenting the aspects of their business that are truly unique and difficult to scale, such as empathy for clients, evaluating and discussing tradeoffs, and offering a compromise to the actions clients can take.
At the top of the list of the best ETFs to play this megatrend would be the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF XBI, +1.12% . This biotech-focused fund is deep, with roughly 170 holdings. It's also not market-cap weighted like other funds that rely on just two or three big picks in the space; not a single position is weighted at more than 1.2% at present. That ensures investors can tap in to the smaller names with the biggest long-term potential.

It was a day some had longed for and others dreaded since Britain voted in a 2016 referendum to leave the EU, but it turned out to be something of an anticlimax.

We feel that advisers have been using technology to improve front- and back-office functions for decades, said Joe Maugeri, managing director of corporate relations at CFP Board. The more important question, though, is in regards to how advisers will change their practice to focus on things technology can't do, such as working with clients to define goals, explaining and working through behavioral finance issues and developing holistic financial plans ready to help investors in 2017 and beyond.
Here are a couple of factors that might affect the yuan's valuation over the next 12 months.

They have the same contribution limits as traditional 401(k) plans, though employees will see more taken out of their take-home pay because their wages will be taxed before a portion is invested into their retirement plan. To make the best decision, employees have to estimate what tax bracket they'll be in during retirement and assess what makes the most sense for them.

Britain left the European bloc's vast single market for people, goods and services at 11 p.m. London time, midnight in Brussels, completing the biggest single economic change the country has experienced since World War II. A different U.K.-EU trade deal will bring new restrictions and red tape, but for British Brexit supporters, it means reclaiming national independence from the EU and its web of rules.
More recently, however, Smith said it has become clear that the robo revolution will be most impactful as a catalyst to moving traditional advice providers into the digital age rather than replacing them outright.
Alan Rickman, a.k.a. Hans Gruber and Snape, dies at age 69.
One very important theme for the stock market during 2018 was the return of volatility, as investors worried about Federal Reserve tightening and President Trump's trade dispute with China.
A free trade agreement sealed on Christmas Eve after months of tense negotiations ensures that Britain and the 27-nation EU can continue to buy and sell goods without tariffs or quotas. That should help protect the 660 billion pounds ($894 billion) in annual trade between the two sides, and the hundreds of thousands of jobs that rely on it.
Last year didn't just bring change. It brought a seismic schism that will permanently alter how we work and live.

Traditional 401(k) plans are employer-sponsored accounts that allow employees to save pre-tax dollars from their wages for retirement.

The ratio of inventories to sales, meanwhile, fell to 1.33 from 1.34. That's how many months it would take to sell all the inventory on hand. One year ago, the inventory-to-sales ratio was higher at 1.40, reflecting an excessive buildup in production not matched by sales. Now companies appear to have a better handle on inventories.

Changes proposed by the Department of Labor on Dec. 5 would allow employers to legally pocket tips that servers earn at restaurants. The change, which would repeal part of a 2011 ruling that said employers could not pocket their workers' tips, is meant to level a growing disparity between what tipped employees like servers earn compared with back-of-house employees like cooks. After the changes, employers could take all tips earned by servers and redistribute them to workers that are not tipped.

The simple fact that investors are increasing integration of digital communication into every aspect of their lives is going to necessitate the transformation of their financial advice relationships, said Scott Smith, director of research at Cerulli Associates and a member of the CFP Board's digital advice working group.

Higher prices could alienate subscribers and possibly even trigger a wave of cancelations. For instance, Netflix faced a huge backlash in 2011 when it unbundled video streaming from its older DVD-by-mail service, resulting in a 60 percent price increase for subscribers who wanted to keep both plans. Netflix lost 600,000 subscribers after that switch.
I feel very sad that we're leaving, said Jen Pearcy-Edwards, a filmmaker in London. I think that COVID has overshadowed everything that is going on.

Instead, she said employers will be able to control tips and take a big chunk of them as long as they pay the minimum wage. The proposal would require staff to make minimum wage, but allow tips to be pooled beyond that. (A spokesman for the Department of Labor said it intends to publish an informed cost benefit analysis as part of any final rule.)
Big independent robo advisors have a few billion dollars each in investor money, but that only translates to a few million dollars a year in revenue, he added.

And the year before, Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Rich Hill just missed throwing a no-hitter last summer, when he gave up a walk-off home run against the Pittsburgh Pirates in extra innings on his 99th pitch; losing the game. Hill also just lost out on a perfect game after the third baseman made an error in the ninth inning. But when Hill approached the press afterward, he gamely stuck up for his teammate, and vowed to come out swinging. I'm looking forward to tomorrow, getting in the gym and getting ready for the next outing, said Hill. We have a lot of great things going on here. Tomorrow is a big game. We have to take the series and get back home.
Coronavirus created quite a disruption to the global economy in 2020, and complications still linger. However, the pandemic proved once and for all the power and portability of digital technologies.

Medical technology company Becton Dickinson and Co. BDX, -0.07% said Friday it has received a warning letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration relating to its preanalytical systems business unit. The company said it will provide a full response to the regulator by its Feb. 1 deadline. We take any potential issue with our products very seriously and are cooperating fully with FDA on this matter, Richard Byrd, worldwide president of the preanalytics business said in a statement. After the FDA inspection in July, we took prompt action that we believed fully addressed the agency's inspectional observations. The FDA said its letter cited several violations of federal law, including the marketing of modified versions of BD Vacutainer blood collection tubes without securing FDA approval and failing to submit medical device reports to the FDA within a required timeframe. Our inspection showed that BD violated the law by making a significant change to certain devices the company manufactures without notifying the FDA and failing to follow good manufacturing practice requirements, said Donald St. Pierre, acting director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health and deputy director of new product evaluation at the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health. We are continuing to aggressively investigate this issue, including whether the use of BD tubes led to inaccurate lead test results.

Experts largely praised the efforts by the FPA and CFP Board to better understand how human and robo advisers can work together in the future. From these announcements, it appears that these two organizations are recognizing that the delivery of financial advice will be different in the future, and if they are to remain relevant for their members, they need to start building content and practice standards that include digital capabilities, Welsh said. In fact their very futures as organizations depend on the human adviser being primary, and if the adviser job goes away than there won't be a need for them anymore.
To be fair, at least one expert suggested that the scenarios might mesh together in reality. While each of the four discrete scenarios in the CFP Board paper are all possible outcomes in the future, I believe the future of digital advice will evolve to include elements of all four scenarios, said Bill Winterberg, founder and president of FPPad.com.

Perhaps most important, while it does have some plays with vague EV applications, such as hydrogen fuel cell stock Plug Power PLUG, -7.85% , it is indeed a play on alternative energy — unlike the some funds, like the Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF PBW, +0.35% that roughly tripled last year thanks to boasting Nio NIO, +2.47% as a top holding.
Perhaps the more interesting point, Bruckenstein said is that the CFP Board is interested enough in technology and digital advice to take a leadership role, while they continue to virtually ignore technology in the CFP educational program.

Own up to it. There's no reason to hide it. It's nothing to be ashamed of; everyone has failures, the author of Leave Your Mark, told Moneyish. It's embarrassing for a minute, and then everyone moves on. And you're onto the next thing, too.
Another expert also suggested that there is high degree of uncertainty right now over robo and human advisers. Legislative and regulatory changes over the next few years are likely to have an impact on the ultimate outcome, said Joel Bruckenstein, a certified financial planner and publisher of Technology Tools for Today. In the near term, I think it's unlikely that digital will totally displace good financial advisers, but longer term, it is difficult to totally rule out.
Instead of competing with them, many of the start-up robo advisors are increasingly serving as the plumbing connecting traditional advisory firms to their clients, said Smith. Many robo firms have engineered outstanding technology platforms, but have neither the brand recognition nor the network of field advisors to achieve the distribution scale they need.

No matter whether the CFP Board's scenarios are discreet or not, another expert sees the need for financial advisers to contemplate all scenarios.
Plus, studies show that experiencing nostalgic memories helps us feel more socially connected — a compelling prospect today because research shows that many of us are profoundly lonely. Indeed, Americans today have fewer close friends — people they can discuss important issues with — than in the past: They have an average of two, down from three just 25 years ago, according to research from sociology professor Matthew Brashears, who now works at the University of South Carolina; and roughly one in four people says they have no one with whom they can discuss important issues with.
It's tempting to dismiss the recent turn in bearish sentiment as a rite of spring, and that the pace at which yields have climbed has taken the move beyond its moorings.

Back in 2017, the gulf between the Fed and Wall Street over the appropriate level of interest rates seemed impossible to close. Analysts accused the central bank of risking a policy misstep if it hiked rates when inflation readings persisted below its 2% target. Policymakers including Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen stuck to the script that a lack of price pressures would prove fleeting.

Sure, this ETF rode the coronavirus trend to more than 50% gains last year.

Shares of theater chain AMC Entertainment Holding Inc. AMC, +3.24% were down more than 2% in premarket trade on Wednesday after being downgraded to sector perform from outperform at RBC Capital Markets. RBC analysts wrote in a note that their tepid view of the 2018 box office and AMC's high leverage make for a challenging combination for the company. We'd likely get more bullish on AMC if the box office outlook (given its leverage) and, or there was traction on the international IPO, lead analyst Leo Kulp wrote. As was evidenced in 2017, AMC's leverage makes it very susceptible to changes in multiple. We estimate a one point EV/EBITDA multiple change has a 36% impact on the stock price. While this is a positive in an up year for the box office, the uncertainty around the 2018 box office makes us more conservative. Kulp expects that the 2018 box office will be flat compared with 2017, which was down slightly from the last two years. They said they see fewer big event films being released this year, and instead more non-sequel content, which could be a negative or a positive depending on how the shift in the box office is received. Shares of AMC have declined more than 59% in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% is up more than 21% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% is up nearly 28%.
On the earnings front, J.P. Morgan JPM, +3.96% reported a profit beat before the open, while Intel INTC, -0.97% delivers after the close.

Furthermore, to this day, the CFP Board absolutely refuses to grant any CE credit at to advisers for improving their competency with these 21st century tools of the trade, he said. The CFP Board did put together a very impressive group of experts to explore scenarios, most of who I know personally and respect, but until the CFP Board gets its own house in order, it is difficult to take them seriously as a technology leader.

We entered 2020 on the brink of a trust crisis, as traditional institutions from mainstream media to the government became divisive sources and many flocked to social media circles to serve as their most relied upon source for financial guidance. In fact, during the prosperous decade that preceded 2020, the rise of crowdsourcing meant many of us not only used recommendations from strangers to decide where to eat or what movie to see, it also determined our biggest financial decisions.

By his group's estimations, removing the tip credit would require restaurants to increase hourly wages of servers by 220% as long as they still received the standard tip rate of 20% from most customers — an unsustainable amount of pay for restaurants. This rise in wages for servers has led to more restaurants closing and fewer jobs for people in the service industry, Chaisson argues.
These kind of enterprise-oriented services always had a place, but amid social distancing and remote working, they proved their true potential to businesses — and those customers could likely double down on them in 2021.

But Matthew Hornbach of Morgan Stanley said that outside of recessions, only one in four times when the Treasury Department unloaded a wave of supply did yields rise over recent history.

Forward-looking investors already had a strong inkling of upcoming bond issuance.

Widening the audience in a sustainable way is the key issue for McDonald's as it enters [its] new fiscal year.
