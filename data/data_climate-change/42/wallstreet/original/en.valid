retirement savers can contribute $18,500 in a 401(k), 403(b), most 457 plans and the thrift savings plan in 2018, up $500 from last year. for people 50 and older, the additional catch-up contribution limit is unchanged at $6,000 more.\n\nother important facts to know, according to the internal revenue service:\n\ncontributions, also known as deferrals, as well as employer matches and discretionary contributions or allocations of forfeitures to your accounts, should be the lesser of either 100% of your compensation level or $55,000 in 2018 (or $61,000 with catch-up contributions).\n\nwhen it comes to retirement, 60s are the new 50s\n\nemployers may offer automatic enrollment or automatic increases to 401(k) plan contributions. the former takes money out of an employee's pay before tax and automatically places it into a 401(k) (usually around 3%), which qualify as elective deferrals. employees can opt out of this, though it does ensure there's some money saved for retirement and has helped savers stash away maybe $29.6 billion for retirement.\n\n401(k) plan requirements cannot require employees work more than a year at the company, though some companies may have to wait until they're eligible for matching contributions and others may have vesting requirements, which means you have to work a specific number of years before those matched contributions are completely yours.\n\nif an employee over-saves in a 401(k) plan, they have to act fast. excess deferrals as well as any money earned from those extra dollars must be refunded by april 15 so that it is reported as regular income. if done after tax day, late distributions are subject to extra taxes and penalties. companies may automatically stop contributions once the maximum is reached, but not always, so savers should check their accounts.\n\nsee:so you've maxed out your 401(k)? here's where else to save\n\n401(k) plan contribution limits was the top query related to 401(k) plans on google at the end of 2017, according to google trends. here are some others:\n\nproposed 401(k) changes by congress\n\nthere was talk of drastically changing 401(k) plans late last year, before the tax bill was passed. reports suggested the contribution limit would be dropped to $2,400 per year, or somewhere between there and the then-current limit of $18,000. others thought congress might rothify these accounts, by taxing contributions before investing them. traditional 401(k) plans are tax-deferred, which means they're taxed at withdrawal. the new tax bill ended up not including either of these ideas, but still affects retirement savers and retirees, such as stopping recharacterizations of individual retirement accounts (which allow savers to undo decisions to rollover or convert accounts to roth iras) or inspiring some to move to another state.\n\nroth 401(k) vs traditional 401(k)\n\ntraditional 401(k) plans are employer-sponsored accounts that allow employees to save pre-tax dollars from their wages for retirement. a roth 401(k) is also employer-sponsored, but contributions are invested with after-tax dollars and withdrawals are not subject to federal income tax (so long as you're 59 ½ years old and have had the account five years).\n\nthey have the same contribution limits as traditional 401(k) plans, though employees will see more taken out of their take-home pay because their wages will be taxed before a portion is invested into their retirement plan. to make the best decision, employees have to estimate what tax bracket they'll be in during retirement and assess what makes the most sense for them.\n\nalso see:four ways to change 401(k) plans for the better\n\n401k withdrawal age\n\nretirement savers cannot withdraw from their 401(k) plans before they turn 59 ½ years old (unless they become disabled or are separated from their employer after turning 55 years old). if distributions are made before 59 ½ years old, savers have to pay an additional 10% tax on the distribution (loans up to 50% of vested account balances are also allowed depending on the employer and plan, though they must be repaid within five years).\n\nthe money can't stay in the account forever, though. beginning april 1 of the calendar year in which the account holder reaches 70 ½ or retires (whichever comes later), retirement savers must start taking required minimum distributions.

a sudden, sharp decline by the yuan this week appeared to have far-reaching consequences for global equity markets, as indexes from asia to north america post serious losses.\n\nfor yuan traded in china's onshore market, it's been the largest period of decline since chinese officials surprised investors by announcing a surprise devaluation in mid-august. the decision had a similarly turbulent impact on global markets.\n\nread: dow kicks off 2016 with 400-point plunge on china fears\n\nmany market strategists believe the august devaluation convinced the federal reserve to delay its first interest-rate increase in nearly a decade.\n\nnow, with the dollar widely expected to continue rising as the fed raises rates this year, market strategists are waiting for the other shoe to drop. they're bracing for further devaluation of the yuan, and the global market turmoil they suspect might follow.\n\nhere are a couple of factors that might affect the yuan's valuation over the next 12 months.\n\npolicy makers loosen their grip\n\nlate last year, chinese policy makers announced they would begin publishing the yuan's valuation relative to three new currency baskets, including one that was trade-weighted.\n\nthis led to speculation that china might soon announce another change in how it manages the yuan's exchange rate. instead of using the dollar as its sole reference, officials could begin using the trade-weighted basket to set the yuan's daily reference rate, market strategists speculated.\n\ni think everybody's on alert that if the dollar rises substantially further, there's a good chance that [the pboc] would change the mechanism or let the [yuan] go, said greg anderson, global head of currency strategy at bmo capital markets.\n\nread: why china may want its yuan to be more like the singapore dollar\n\nsuch a change would likely help the yuan to gradually weaken, sparing investors from the global market turmoil that followed its sudden devaluation in august.\n\nthe china carry trade unwinds\n\nchina's enormous current-account surplus increased in 2015 as falling commodity prices cheapened the total value of the raw materials imported by chinese manufacturers.\n\nbut in the second half of the year, its capital account—a measure of money moving into and out of an economy—actually turned negative, and its foreign currency reserve declined.\n\nbecause the capital account reflects the flow of money across borders, it's likely that the yuan will continue to move in the same direction as the capital account, anderson said.\n\nnicholas lardy, a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics, said the declines in both china's capital account and its foreign currency reserves have been driven by traders quickly unwinding bets that the yuan would continue to strengthen, following the yuan's august devaluation.\n\nthe question that's the most interesting is: what share, roughly speaking, of the carry trades that were in place last summer have now been unwound?, lardy said.\n\nonshore yuan usdcny, +0.03% finished monday's session at 6.53 to the dollar, while its offshore cnycnh, +0.23% counterpart traded at 6.76. it was at 6.49, and 6.77 a session earlier, according to data from factset.\n\none currency, two exchange rates\n\nit's very likely that if the dollar continues to strengthen, chinese policy makers will take steps to drive their currency lower, though the people's bank of china prefers to gradually implement policy changes.\n\nbut it isn't just policy makers who want a weaker currency; yuan traders also believe the currency is overvalued at the onshore rate.\n\nproof of this can be seen in the gap between the yuan's onshore and offshore exchange rates, which has seldom been wider than it is right now, as the chart below illustrates.\n\nas they prepare for the yuan's inclusion in the international monetary fund's special drawing rights basket, traders and market strategists expect chinese policy makers to loosen their grip on the currency. many hope that someday the onshore rate will be eliminated as controls on the currency are abandoned.\n\nespecially in light of the discouraging data released over the past week, allowing the onshore rate to move closer to its offshore sibling might help boost growth in the country's slowing economy.
the congressional budget office estimated tuesday that the federal government would run a budget deficit of $559 billion in fiscal 2017, slightly smaller than an earlier projection.\n\nin its latest budget and economic outlook, the cbo said the new estimate was due to its expectation that mandatory spending would be lower than earlier anticipated.
the market bears just keep winning in the new year.\n\nthe s&p 500 has slumped into correction territory, and chinese stocks today briefly traded in bear-market territory. zerohedge is gleefully reporting that a legendary j.p. morgan quant sees the beleaguered s&p spx, -0.20% getting more grizzly. that's using the common definitions for correction and bear territory — drops of 10% and 20%, respectively, from closing highs.\n\nany silver lining in these dark clouds?

waiters and waitresses could take home significantly less money if a new rule proposed by the trump administration in december passes, critics say.\n\nchanges proposed by the department of labor on dec. 5 would allow employers to legally pocket tips that servers earn at restaurants. the change, which would repeal part of a 2011 ruling that said employers could not pocket their workers' tips, is meant to level a growing disparity between what tipped employees like servers earn compared with back-of-house employees like cooks. after the changes, employers could take all tips earned by servers and redistribute them to workers that are not tipped.\n\nthat sounds like a fair plan, in theory.\n\nhowever, there is no guarantee employers would redistribute pooled tips, and critics say economic models show they will likely pocket them instead. if this proposed rule were finalized, restaurant owners could pocket between $523 million and $14.2 billion — with $5.8 billion being the best estimate — in tips earned by tipped workers each year, according to economic policy institute economists heidi shierholz, david cooper, julia wolfe, and ben zipperer.\n\nand nearly 80% of the tips that would be taken from employees would come out of the pockets of female tipped workers, according to the economic policy institute. an economic analysis showing these negative effects of the change was scrubbed by the department of labor, a new report from the economic policy institute reported, showing the lengths to which the trump administration ... will go to hide the fact that they are taking steps to actively make workers' lives worse, it said. (the department of labor did not respond to request for comment.)\n\nthe big lie is that it will lead to restaurants sharing these tips with back of house, said shierholz, senior economist and director policy at the economic policy institute. instead, she said employers will be able to control tips and take a big chunk of them as long as they pay the minimum wage. the proposal would require staff to make minimum wage, but allow tips to be pooled beyond that. (a spokesman for the department of labor said it intends to publish an informed cost benefit analysis as part of any final rule.)\n\nthe moneyist: how to deal with a stingy friend\n\nthe economic policy institute said the department of labor did not provide estimates of the number of tips that would be shifted from employers to employees under the new ruling. the department of labor previously said the rule is out to comment and that stakeholders are encouraged to provide data on the economic effects of the proposal.\n\nhowever, 12% of tipped workers had tips stolen by their employer or supervisor, according to a 2009 study from center for urban economic development, often leading to minimum wage violations. the ruling would also disproportionately affect non-white employees: white non-hispanic tipped workers would lose $3.5 billion, hispanic workers would lose $1.4 billion, black non-hispanic tipped workers would lose $486 million, asian workers would lose $391 million, and tipped workers who are of another race would lose $104 million, according to the economic policy institute.\n\nsome restaurant workers say the department of labor changes are sorely needed as restaurants struggle to pay back-of-house workers like kitchen porters fairly in an industry with notoriously tight profit margins. in order for back-of-house workers to receive annual increases, tip credit needs to remain in place, said joshua chaisson, a server in portland, maine who has been involved in a grassroots campaign to undo similar legislation. restaurants can then focus on increasing hourly wages, he said.\n\nby his group's estimations, removing the tip credit would require restaurants to increase hourly wages of servers by 220% as long as they still received the standard tip rate of 20% from most customers — an unsustainable amount of pay for restaurants. this rise in wages for servers has led to more restaurants closing and fewer jobs for people in the service industry, chaisson argues.\n\nbut the epi's analysis suggested bigger profits would likely not be redistributed among workers, but rather go into the pockets of owners. to truly help back-of-house, low-income workers, wages need to be increased and employers should not be allowed to take tips, she added. there is far more incentive for them to pocket that money than to give it to employees, she said.\n\nthe proposed rule is up for public comment until feb. 3. a spokesperson for the department said stakeholders are encouraged to provide data on the economic effects of the proposal.
merck & co. inc. shares surged 5.8% in extremely heavy trade tuesday after the company announced that its key cancer drug keytruda had positive results in a late-stage clinical trial for advanced lung cancer.\n\nkeytruda has already been approved for this indication, last year. but the latest results should support the food and drug administration's decision and pose a setback for competitors roche rhhby, -1.56% and bristol-myers squibb co. bmy, +0.24% .\n\nthey also support the company's mrk, -0.04% move to change the design of the phase 3 trial last fall, despite pushback from wall street, cancer research expert brad loncar said.\n\nmerck's recent results are actually about as big as it gets, loncar, who manages the loncar cancer immunotherapy exchange-traded fund cncr, -1.56% , said, describing it as a happy ending for the company as well as patients.\n\nrelated: how a merck cancer breakthrough caused bristol-myers' stock to plunge\n\nin the phase 3 trial, patients on keytruda plus chemotherapy performed better on two measures of a cancer therapy's success, progression-free survival and overall survival, than the chemotherapies did alone.\n\nthose are especially important results because the trial was initially only supposed to look at progression-free survival, which measures how long it takes before a patient's cancer worsens.\n\nbut last fall, merck added overall survival, which measures how much longer patients on a therapy live, as another primary endpoint.\n\nwall street saw it then as a suggestion that merck wasn't confident in its product, as well as a timeline for results that was at least a year longer, loncar said.\n\nmerck shares fell 6% two days in a row in late october alongside a third-quarter sales miss and news of a major cyberattack.\n\nmerck plans to release more detailed results from the phase 3 trial at a coming medical meeting, and will submit them to regulators as well. (keytruda has not been approved in this indication in europe; merck withdrew its application there in late october.)\n\nread more: merck swings to loss as cyberattack hurts sales\n\nkeytruda has grown to become a top product by revenue for merck in recent years, going from a mere $55 million in sales in 2014 to $1.4 billion by 2016.\n\nsales are expected to grow to a projected $9 billion globally by 2026, according to an estimate by pharmaceutical and biomedical industry analyst firm informa pharma intelligence.\n\nrelated: merck earnings buoyed by cancer-drug sales\n\nthe latest results could prove an important foundation for that growth. smoking, which causes many lung cancer cases, has made advanced lung cancer a big market for pharmaceutical companies.\n\nthe competition has also been fierce.\n\nshares of roche, which recently presented data in this area, dropped nearly 4% and shares of bristol-myers squibb, which has the next big trial readout, dropped nearly 5% on tuesday after merck's results.\n\nit doesn't look like roche will be very competitive, loncar told marketwatch, adding, the next company that has a fighting chance is going to be bristol, but it's going to be a tall order after today, for sure.
president trump has said american workers have been front and center of his campaign and his presidency. the agenda i will layout this evening is not a republican agenda or a democrat agenda, it's the agenda of the american people. many of us have campaigned on the same core promises to defend american jobs and demand fair trade for american workers, the president said in his state of the union speech on feb. 5\n\n 'many of us have campaigned on the same core promises to defend american jobs and demand fair trade for american workers.' \n\nthe u.s. gained 304,000 new jobs in january, although hiring at the end of 2018 wasn't as strong as originally reported. the unemployment rate ticked up to 4% from 3.9% and the 12-month rate of hourly wage gains dipped to 3.2% from a revised 3.3% in the prior three months that marked a post-recession high.\n\nunder a host of new laws that will go into effect in 2019, however, states are taking it upon themselves to change employees' lives, from how much they earn, to their comfort and security in the workplace, to their ability to plan for their futures.\n\na handful of states have increased the minimum wage to between $12 and $15, and others have implemented regulations that focus on preventing sexual harassment, saving for retirement and fostering a more gender-diverse work environment.\n\n 'with the trump administration and republican congress, it's been states driving progress and innovation.'  — —paul sonn, state policy director at the new york-based nonprofit national employment law project\n\nwith the trump administration and republican congress, it's been states driving progress and innovation, said paul sonn, state policy director at the new york-based nonprofit national employment law project, a liberal-leaning think tank that advocates for workers' rights.\n\nsee: feel like your workplace is especially depressing? scientists found out why\n\nhere are some laws that went into effect in 2019, and other legislation expected later this year:\n\nincreasing minimum wage\n\nnineteen states and 21 cities and counties increased their minimum wage in january, with many raising it to $15 an hour. another 21 jurisdictions will raise pay by the end of the year, according to the national employment law project.\n\nstates that increased minimum wage at the beginning of the year include: alaska, arizona, arkansas, california, colorado, delaware, florida, maine, massachusetts, minnesota, missouri, montana, new jersey, new york, ohio, rhode island, south dakota, vermont and washington.\n\n 'cost of living data shows $15 an hour is what single workers in all 50 states need to afford the basics, and that's what they need in even low-cost states like texas and florida.'  — —paul sonn, state policy director at the new york-based nonprofit national employment law project\n\ncost of living data shows $15 an hour is what single workers in all 50 states need to afford the basics, and that's what they need in even low-cost states like texas and florida, sonn said. this will put thousands more in the pockets of struggling workers who right now are often going into debt and just aren't able to afford the basics.\n\nsee also:this is how many million u.s. workers will get a pay raise in the new year\n\nattracting more workers\n\nvermont began its remote worker grant program, which reimburses workers who move to vermont for expenses including relocation costs, computer software and broadband access. the program pays remote workers up to $5,000 every year, up to a total of $10,000, when they move to the state. lawmakers created the program to help reverse the trend of an aging and declining population and to draw more tech workers.\n\ndon't miss:ways your workplace wellness program could actually be making you fat\n\nno perks for some fired government workers\n\nillinois passed a law that bans government employees fired for misconduct from cashing in on severance pay. as part of senate bill 3604, misconduct refers to deliberate or careless actions that harm others or go against employer standards of behavior. it also includes chronic absenteeism, tardiness and criminal assault on another employee or customer. the law affects all government workers, as well as those who work for state colleges and universities and school districts. under the law, any government worker fired for misconduct wouldn't be allowed to collect any severance pay.\n\nthwarting sexual harassment\n\na california law that went into effect on jan. 1 prohibits secret settlement agreements pertaining to sexual harassment or sex discrimination. the legislation, which applies to public and private employers, allows victims to stay anonymous if they want to remain out of the public eye, but allows victims to pursue civil action.\n\n 'we've worked with so many more state legislators in 2018 on the issue of harassment in the workplace than we had in years.'  — —emily martin, vice president for education and workplace justice at the national women's law center\n\nthe #metoo movement, originally sparked by high-profile cases of sexual misconduct in hollywood, quickly spread to other industries and has changed america's workplaces. companies and policymakers are looking for solutions, emily martin, vice president for education and workplace justice at the national women's law center, told marketwatch last year. we've worked with so many more state legislators in 2018 on the issue of harassment in the workplace than we had in years, she said.\n\ncalifornia has also become the first state to require some company boards to have at least one female member. any publicly traded company with headquarters in the state must have one woman board member by the end of 2019 and, by 2021, companies with at least five directors need to have two or three female directors, depending on the size of the board.\n\nalso see: sheryl sandberg thinks the workplace is 'rigged' against women — but these steps could fix that\n\nan eye on retirement\n\na retirement crisis is looming in the country. americans are not saving enough for their futures and in many cases, don't have access to a workplace retirement account to start. states have taken it upon themselves to implement retirement plans, and in some cases, require companies to offer a retirement plan if they have no alternatives in place.\n\ncalifornia's program, called calsavers, will open to all eligible workers this july. oregon was the first state to implement its state-sponsored retirement program, and illinois has also started its own program. more states are expected to implement or propose similar legislation in the coming years.
london (ap) — britain's long and sometimes acrimonious divorce from the european union ended thursday with an economic split that leaves the eu smaller and the u.k. freer but more isolated in a turbulent world.\n\nbritain left the european bloc's vast single market for people, goods and services at 11 p.m. london time, midnight in brussels, completing the biggest single economic change the country has experienced since world war ii. a different u.k.-eu trade deal will bring new restrictions and red tape, but for british brexit supporters, it means reclaiming national independence from the eu and its web of rules.\n\nprime minister boris johnson, whose support for brexit helped push the country out of the eu, called it an amazing moment for this country.\n\n britons and eu citizens have lost the automatic right to live and work in the other's territory, while tourists face new headaches. \n\nwe have our freedom in our hands, and it is up to us to make the most of it, he said in a new year's video message.\n\nthe break comes 11 months after a political brexit that left the two sides in the limbo of a transition period — like a separated couple still living together, wrangling and wondering whether they can remain friends. now the u.k. has finally moved out.\n\nit was a day some had longed for and others dreaded since britain voted in a 2016 referendum to leave the eu, but it turned out to be something of an anticlimax. u.k. lockdown measures to curb the coronavirus curtailed mass gatherings to celebrate or mourn the moment, though a handful of brexit supporters defied the restrictions to raise a toast outside parliament as the big ben bell sounded 11 times on the hour.\n\na free trade agreement sealed on christmas eve after months of tense negotiations ensures that britain and the 27-nation eu can continue to buy and sell goods without tariffs or quotas. that should help protect the 660 billion pounds ($894 billion) in annual trade between the two sides, and the hundreds of thousands of jobs that rely on it.\n\nbut companies face sheaves of new costs and paperwork, including customs declarations and border checks. traders are struggling to digest the new rules imposed by the 1,200-page trade deal.\n\nthe english channel port of dover and the eurotunnel passenger and freight route braced for delays as the new measures were introduced, though the pandemic and a holiday weekend meant cross-channel traffic was light, with only a trickle of trucks arriving at french border posts in calais as 2020 ended. the vital supply route was snarled for days after france closed its border to u.k. truckers for 48 hours last week in response to a fast-spreading variant of the virus identified in england.\n\nthe british government insisted that the border systems and infrastructure we need are in place, and we are ready for the u.k.'s new start.\n\nbut freight companies were holding their breath. youngs transportation in the u.k. suspended services to the eu until jan. 11 to let things settle.\n\nwe figure it gives the country a week or so to get used to all of these new systems in and out, and we can have a look and hopefully resolve any issues in advance of actually sending our trucks, said the company's director, rob hollyman.\n\nthe services sector, which makes up 80% of britain's economy, does not even know what the rules will be for business with the eu in 2021. many of the details have yet to be hammered out. months and years of further discussion and argument over everything from fair competition to fish quotas lie ahead as britain and the eu settle into their new relationship as friends, neighbors and rivals.\n\nhundreds of millions of individuals in britain and the bloc also face changes to their daily lives. britons and eu citizens have lost the automatic right to live and work in the other's territory. from now on, they will have to follow immigration rules and obtain work visas. tourists face new headaches including from travel insurance and pet paperwork.\n\nfor some in britain, including the prime minister, it's a moment of pride and a chance for the u.k. to set new diplomatic and economic priorities. johnson said the u.k. was now free to do trade deals around the world, and free to turbocharge our ambition to be a science superpower.\n\n scotland's pro-independence first minister nicola sturgeon tweeted: 'scotland will be back soon, europe. keep the light on.' \n\nconservative lawmaker bill cash, who has campaigned for brexit for decades, said it was a victory for democracy and sovereignty.\n\nthat's not a view widely shared across the channel. in the french president's traditional new year's address, emmanuel macron expressed regret.\n\nthe united kingdom remains our neighbor but also our friend and ally, he said. this choice of leaving europe, this brexit, was the child of european malaise and lots of lies and false promises.\n\nthe divorce could also have major constitutional repercussions for the united kingdom. northern ireland, which shares a border with eu member ireland, remains more closely tied to the bloc's economy under the divorce terms, a status that could pull it away from the rest of the u.k.\n\nin scotland, which voted strongly in 2016 to remain, brexit has bolstered support for separation from the u.k. the country's pro-independence first minister nicola sturgeon tweeted: scotland will be back soon, europe. keep the light on.\n\nmany in britain felt apprehension about a leap into the unknown that is taking place during a pandemic that has upended life around the world.\n\ni feel very sad that we're leaving, said jen pearcy-edwards, a filmmaker in london. i think that covid has overshadowed everything that is going on. but i think the other thing that has happened is that people feel a bigger sense of community, and i think that makes it even sadder that we're breaking up our community a bit, by leaving our neighbours in europe.\n\ni'm hopeful that we find other ways to rebuild ties, she said.
robert h.b. baldwin, the former morgan stanley ms, +2.94% chairman credited with modernizing a wall street stalwart, has died. he was 95.\n\nbaldwin served as morgan stanley's president for six years before his election as chairman in 1979. he led the private partnership until 1983, when he ceded the post to his top lieutenant, s. parker gilbert.
business inventories in the u.s. rose 0.4% in november after no change in the prior month, the commerce department said friday. sales jumped 1.2% in the month. the ratio of inventories to sales, meanwhile, fell to 1.33 from 1.34. that's how many months it would take to sell all the inventory on hand. one year ago, the inventory-to-sales ratio was higher at 1.40, reflecting an excessive buildup in production not matched by sales. now companies appear to have a better handle on inventories.
there can be victory in defeat.\n\nlady gaga and bradley cooper's a star is born was considered a shoo-in to sweep the golden globe awards on sunday night by outlets including the los angeles times, the new york times and vanity fair. instead, the actors sat smiling in the front row while bohemian rhapsody and green book took many of the top awards, and glenn close upset gaga for the best actress nod. gaga did share the best original song award for her hit shallow from the film, however, and expressed her gratitude — and her support for close — on twitter afterward.\n\ni am so beyond grateful for this golden globe & honored to have won it w/ @markronson @wyattish, anthony rossomando and to have sang it with bradley cooper, she wrote. i also could not be happier for glenn close winning tonight. she is a true legend and deserves every award. thank you hfpa.\n\nand after chicago bears' kicker cody parkey missed the field goal cost his team a playoff win against the eagles this week, he gamely went on the today show on friday and said, i'm disappointed. i let the fans down, my teammates down and the whole organization down. but i'll continue to keep my head held high because football is what i do; it's not who i am ... at the end of the day, i'm going to keep positive and keep swinging.\n\naliza licht has also experienced public disappointment. after 17 years doing pr for dkny, she started her own consulting firm in 2016 -- but after 10 months, she realized it wasn't working out. rather than sulking, she shared what she learned from her loss in her article, this is how you know you're not meant to be an entrepreneur for forbes.\n\nown up to it. there's no reason to hide it. it's nothing to be ashamed of; everyone has failures, the author of leave your mark, told moneyish. it's embarrassing for a minute, and then everyone moves on. and you're onto the next thing, too.\n\nafter all, gaga still has plenty of chances to rebound; she's been nominated for five grammys, which air next month, including four for shallow, and she and cooper could still score nods when the oscar nominations are announced on jan. 22.\n\nlady gaga scored the best original song golden globe - but missed the coveted best actress prize. valerie macon/afp/getty images\n\nmany pro athletes have also mastered the art of being good sports. when japan's soccer team was eliminated from the world cup last summer, they came out looking like winners by bowing to their fans in the stands after the devastating loss to belgium. they also cleaned their locker room on the way out, cnn reported, and left their russian hosts a thank you note (written in russian) inside the now-spotless changing room.\n\nand the players weren't the only good sports. japanese fans have stayed after every one of their team's matches at the global soccer tournament to help clean their section of the stadium, leading sports illustrated to say the losing team has actually won the world cup. senegalese fans also tidied up their stadium section after beating france a couple of weeks ago.\n\nand the year before, los angeles dodgers pitcher rich hill just missed throwing a no-hitter last summer, when he gave up a walk-off home run against the pittsburgh pirates in extra innings on his 99th pitch; losing the game. hill also just lost out on a perfect game after the third baseman made an error in the ninth inning. but when hill approached the press afterward, he gamely stuck up for his teammate, and vowed to come out swinging. i'm looking forward to tomorrow, getting in the gym and getting ready for the next outing, said hill. we have a lot of great things going on here. tomorrow is a big game. we have to take the series and get back home.\n\nnow that's how you handle a loss like a boss.\n\neveryone likes to be around a winner - and that doesn't mean the person that wins the most games, career coach heather monahan, aka the boss in heels, told moneyish. that means the person with the winning attitude.\n\nliza bychkov-suloti, a partner at the shadow public relations and marketing company, agreed. sometimes the way you accept defeat or adapt to change is just as, if not more, meaningful than how you succeed and control any outcome. supporting those that are successful or 'win' reflects a strong, confident character, she told moneyish.\n\nno one's perfect, and it's inevitable that we're all going to bomb a sales pitch, presentation or some other work project at some point, or be on the losing team. so here's what we can learn about turning a loss into a win, especially when all eyes are on us.\n\nif you never lose, it means you're not taking big enough risks. everyone knows gaga is an accomplished singer and songwriter; she's got six grammys under her bedazzled belt. but she took a chance with a star is born — it's not only her movie debut, but she was also directed to strip off her signature makeup to completely expose herself. when my character talks about how ugly she feels — that was real, gaga told the los angeles times. i'm so insecure. i like to preach, but i don't always practice what i preach. licht added that, it's essential in life to take risks. people shouldn't be afraid to fail, they shouldn't be afraid to try, because not trying really is the ultimate failure.\n\naccept what you can and can't control. dr. jonathan fader, director of mental conditioning for the new york giants who was the new york mets' team psychologist for nine seasons, told moneyish that recognizing what is and isn't in your hands helps to just let it go when it doesn't work out. nolan ryan once said that a pitcher has two jobs: to choose the pitch and to execute it. what happens after that is out of your hands, dr. fader said. likewise, if you're a trader, you can pick this stock based on all of the statistical variants you know, but you don't have any control over unexpected bumps in the market, which can send your stock plummeting.\n\ntake a beat to reset yourself. so exactly how do you shake it off or let it go? dr. fader coaches players in mental conditioning and mindfulness to do a quick reset right after something goes wrong. when you watch baseball players closely, you'll see the pitcher or the batter taking a deep breath before each pitch, or looking at a focal point, like a blade of grass or a flagpole, to center themselves, he said. approach each moment independently. so if an interview isn't going well, or you get off to a rough start during a presentation or performance, just focus on something in the room, take a deep breath and start over.\n\nl.a. dodgers pitcher rich hill lost gracefully against the pittsburgh pirates. (justin k. aller/getty images) getty images\n\nembrace a new perspective. dr. fader's players also practice gratitude, which helps them to be good sports through wins and losses. and again, see gaga's very gracious posts thanking the hollywood foreign press association and congratulating close on twitter and instagram. if you think, 'i am so grateful that i get to compete at the highest level,' the one or two negative results don't loom as large, he said. apply that same approach to your job - you're lucky that you get to do what you love, or you're blessed to have a gig that supports your family, or you're working with a great team. that appreciation can help you take setbacks in stride.\n\nbuild resilience. losses feel catastrophic in the moment, so look at the big picture: you've survived worse, and you can survive this, too. while dropping the ball on a new account and taking a professional hit can be difficult, that can never compare to other personal challenges in your life that you have overcome, said monahan, who suggests keeping a journal of the tough times you've already handled. reminding yourself of traumatic situations that you have lived through will bring your strength and the ability to see your current situation as less than dire in the moment.\n\ntake action. hill didn't dwell on the perfect no-hitter that wasn't. he told the press that he was already looking to thursday night's game, and planning to hit the gym. the decision to take action and change your situation is the single most impactful thing you can do, said monahan. what action can you take today to change your situation and set you up for success the next time opportunity knocks on your door?\n\nbychkov-suloti agreed. don't shy away from examining your opportunity to learn and grow, she said. ask your boss (or the decision maker) for further background on the decision and the steps they'd like to see you take to achieve your goals.\n\nthis article was originally published in 2017 and has been updated with the 2019 golden globes.
medical technology company becton dickinson and co. bdx, -0.07% said friday it has received a warning letter from the u.s. food and drug administration relating to its preanalytical systems business unit. the company said it will provide a full response to the regulator by its feb. 1 deadline. we take any potential issue with our products very seriously and are cooperating fully with fda on this matter, richard byrd, worldwide president of the preanalytics business said in a statement. after the fda inspection in july, we took prompt action that we believed fully addressed the agency's inspectional observations. the fda said its letter cited several violations of federal law, including the marketing of modified versions of bd vacutainer blood collection tubes without securing fda approval and failing to submit medical device reports to the fda within a required timeframe. our inspection showed that bd violated the law by making a significant change to certain devices the company manufactures without notifying the fda and failing to follow good manufacturing practice requirements, said donald st. pierre, acting director of the office of in vitro diagnostics and radiological health and deputy director of new product evaluation at the fda's center for devices and radiological health. we are continuing to aggressively investigate this issue, including whether the use of bd tubes led to inaccurate lead test results. shares were slightly lower friday, but have gained 30% in the last 12 months, while the s&p 500 spx, -1.48% has gained 22%.

karen walker, the self-proclaimed pill-popping, jet fuel sniffing, gin-soaked narcissist, and her cadre of friends are coming back.\n\nwill & grace will return to nbc for a 10-episode revival in the 2017-2018 television season. the show will feature the main four members of the original cast: debra messing as interior designer grace adler; eric mccormack as gay attorney will truman and grace's best friend; megan mullally as the often inebriated socialite karen walker; and sean hayes as will's gay best friend. the show's creators, max mutchnick and david kohan, will executive produce the episodes. the original series ran on nbc cmcsa, -2.83% from 1998 to 2006 and was widely heralded as one of the most successful sitcoms with gay people as the main characters.\n\nthis is just the latest in a series of television shows, videogames, movies and other products that have gotten a reboot in the past few years. among them: the movie star wars, the nintendo 7974, -0.22% nes gaming console, and coke surge ko, -1.31% , crystal pepsi pep, -0.82% — all of which were hits for the companies that made them. star wars: the force awakens, released in 2015, made more than $930 million domestically in its first 16 weeks in the theater — the most money a movie has ever made in the u.s. and canada.\n\nthe classic nintendo nes classic edition sold out in almost every brick-and-mortar retailer this holiday season — and commanded online prices that were triple or more the $60 asking price. and soda reboots typically sell well too, says matthew barry, beverages analyst at market research group euromonitor — though exact figures typically for the most recent ones aren't always publicly released.\n\nwhy consumers are gaga for product reboots\n\nin today's high-tech, fast-paced world, consumers feel like they can't keep up-to-date all the new options and changes be they technological, entertainment or otherwise. we're living in a time of rapid change — people feel like they don't have power in preventing or dealing with this change, says brittany chozinski, an assistant professor of sociology at northeast lakeview college in san antonio, who studies nostalgia. they're trying to find an anchoring point, to slow down. and nostalgic products seem like they can do this, as people often see them — rightly or wrongly — as things from a simpler time, she says.\n\nplus, studies show that experiencing nostalgic memories helps us feel more socially connected — a compelling prospect today because research shows that many of us are profoundly lonely. indeed, americans today have fewer close friends — people they can discuss important issues with — than in the past: they have an average of two, down from three just 25 years ago, according to research from sociology professor matthew brashears, who now works at the university of south carolina; and roughly one in four people says they have no one with whom they can discuss important issues with.\n\n'will & grace' revival: will viewers be disappointed?\n\nwhat this does to your bottom line\n\nwhen we're feeling nostalgic, we spend more, a series of six experiments, published in the journal of consumer research in 2014, found. in one study, the experimenters showed participants two advertisements — one that made them feel nostalgic for the past and another that encouraged them to look toward the future. they were then asked how much they would spend on two nostalgic-related items — a bottle of coca-cola and a flip video camera. those that saw the nostalgic advertisement spent roughly 40% more than those who didn't. feelings of nostalgia make us spend more, says jannine lasaleta, an assistant professor of marketing at grenoble école de management in france.\n\nhow we're setting ourselves up for disappointment\n\nplenty of critics wrote that the gilmore girls nflx, -3.75% reboot was very good: julia felsenthal, called it kind of brilliant in vogue, and others had nice things to say as well. but many fans felt, well, disappointed. that's to be expected, says chozinski. memories of the past are often idealized and sanitized, so we are setting ourselves up for disappointment when we buy nostalgic products hoping to get back that feeling, she says. at best it's escapism says chozinski. it's temporary. after we consume the item, we're right back to searching for whatever it is we were searching for when we bought the item.\n\nwhy we can't quit the search for nostalgia\n\nwe'll pay a lot to get a nostalgic item, but its results are only temporary and it's often a disappointment. still, we still often can't stop ourselves from going back for another nostalgic item. the temptation of going back is so alluring that we are willing to do it. chozinski says. part of us knows we can never return to the past…but we still want it. she's not immune to it herself: i'm excited about the new 'twin peaks,' but i know it won't live up to my expectations.
the biggest news in the robo-adviser space so far this year? it's arguably that snapchat, twitter and other high-profile millennial favorites could jump in.\n\nyes, that snapchat. the popular social app is apparently growing up. mature institutions like the white house and wall street journal hopped on snapchat in the new year, and your ira might be on it one day, too.\n\nsnapchat — with its 100 million daily users to tap into — stands at the front of a line of tech firms developing robo-adviser offerings, said a reuters report last week. the report added that twitter twtr, -1.76% has been approached about delivering a robot-run investing service and intuit's intu, -2.33% budgeting tool mint is working on going robo, too. even paypal's pypl, -2.53% payments app venmo is looking at helping users automatically invest spare change.\n\nin a similar vein, a deloitte study in december suggested apple aapl, -1.93% and google parent alphabet goog, -1.26% googl, -1.26% could get into the robo-adviser space.\n\nrobo advisers basically provide automated investment portfolios of low-cost etfs via a website or app. they range from startups like betterment and wealthfront to schwab intelligent portfolios, an offering from big brokerage charles schwab schw, +2.78% .\n\nso what's the deal with the possible interest from snapchat and other outsiders?\n\nfor investors, it means a new crop of companies asking to look after your nest egg, said michael kitces, partner and research director at pinnacle advisory group. now your social-media firms might start soliciting you for your money, too, he told marketwatch.\n\nthe news also means that the buzz around robos is still considerable. the fact that it even hit snapchat's radar screen is notable, said kitces, who publishes the nerd's eye view financial planning blog. but he warns against being fooled by the hype.\n\neverybody's buzzing like it's still a hot area, but when you take a nuanced look at the space, companies are folding, they're pivoting away from consumers, they're getting out of the business, he said.\n\nbig independent robo advisors have a few billion dollars each in investor money, but that only translates to a few million dollars a year in revenue, he added. i don't know whether a multibillion-dollar social-media company even finds that to be an appealing market opportunity. ... that's kind of revenue chump change for them.\n\nand kitces has other doubts. tech companies have a tendency to foster whispering about new features, not all of which actually come to pass, he said. he had this warning as well: whether a social-media messaging company can successfully convert people into being investors is a question that remains entirely open.\n\ncan't he say anything nice? yes. kitces praises snapchat's massive user base. that is arguably the one thing that snapchat has going for it — their sheer size and reach, he said.\n\nread more:why investors should approach robo advisers with caution\n\nand see:we asked 4 robo advisers and 4 human advisers for portfolios for the same investor
san francisco (ap) — netflix is raising its u.s. prices by 13 percent to 18 percent, its biggest increase since the company launched its streaming service 12 years ago.\n\nits most popular plan will see the largest hike, to $13 per month from $11. that option offers high-definition streaming on up to two different internet-connected devices simultaneously. even at the higher price, that plan is still a few dollars cheaper than hbo, whose streaming service charges $15 per month.\n\nthe extra cash will help to pay for netflix's huge investment in original shows and films and finance the heavy debt it has assumed to ward off rivals such as amazon amzn, +0.33% , disney dis, -1.28% and at&t t, +0.20% .\n\nthis marks the fourth time that netflix nflx, +0.73% has raised its u.s. prices; the last hike came in late 2017 . but this is the first time that higher prices will hit all 58 million u.s. subscribers, the number netflix reported at the end of september.\n\npreviously, netflix had continued to offer a basic, $8-a-month streaming plan while raising rates on more comprehensive plans with better video quality and options to watch simultaneously on different devices.\n\nthis time, the price for the cheapest plan is going up to $9 per month. a premium plan offering ultra-high definition will jump to $16 per month from $14.\n\nthe new prices will immediately affect all new subscribers and then roll out to existing customers during the next three months. customers in about 40 latin america countries where netflix bills in u.s. currency will also be affected, excepting key international markets such as mexico and brazil.\n\nnetflix had nearly 79 million subscribers outside the u.s. as of september.\n\nhigher prices could alienate subscribers and possibly even trigger a wave of cancelations. for instance, netflix faced a huge backlash in 2011 when it unbundled video streaming from its older dvd-by-mail service, resulting in a 60 percent price increase for subscribers who wanted to keep both plans. netflix lost 600,000 subscribers after that switch.\n\nthe company is now betting it can gradually raise its prices, bolstered by a string of acclaimed hits during that past five years that have included house of cards, ''orange is the new black, ''stranger things, ''the crown and, most recently, the film bird box.\n\nwe change pricing from time to time as we continue investing in great entertainment and improving the overall netflix experience, the company said in a statement.\n\nconsumers also have an increasing array of other streaming options .\n\namazon offers a streaming service as part of its prime shipping program for $13 per month, or $120 for an annual membership. hulu sells an ad-free service for $12 per month. at&t's warnermedia unit plans a broader streaming service this year centered on hbo. walt disney is gearing up to launch a streaming channel this year.\n\nwith apple also widely expected to join the video-streaming fray, the competition for programming is enabling top directors, writers and actors to charge more for their talents. that has intensified financial pressure on netflix, which hasn't been bringing in enough money to pay for all its programming and other business expenses.\n\nthe company burned through about $3 billion last year and is expecting to do so again this year. to offset the negative cash flow, netflix has been borrowing heavily to pay for programming. the los gatos, california, company had accumulated nearly $12 billion in debt before borrowing another $2 billion in an october bond offering.\n\nconcerns about the stiffening competition and netflix's ability to sustain its current leadership in video streaming has caused the company's stock price to slide by 21 percent from its peak of $423.21 reached last june. the shares stood at $332.94 heading into tuesday's trading session.
ford motor co. said tuesday it is scrapping plans for a new $1.6 billion assembly plant in mexico, instead choosing to build small cars in an existing mexican factory, and invest $700 million in a michigan facility that will build electric vehicles.\n\nthe move is a surprising turnaround for ford f, -1.58% after facing criticism by president-elect donald trump for more than a year in relation to its mexico plan. last month, chief executive mark fields said it was looking to work with the incoming administration on trump's trade agenda, but indicated it was too late to change its specific plan to build a new factory in mexico.
bond markets — and by association, stocks and the housing market, even gold — are hanging in the balance.\n\nafter a tumultuous few weeks, the 10-year treasury yield tmubmusd10y, 1.696% set several bearish milestones, then topped 2.60% on thursday to notch a three-year high. yields rise when prices fall and are telling not only for fixed-income investors and competing assets, but for anyone keeping track of borrowing costs.\n\nfrom here, it's not entirely clear if the bond market selloff has enough momentum to sustain another big move.\n\nit's easy enough to argue why bond yields should rise. the treasury department will unload a deluge of issuance this year, major central banks are set to start a long-awaited shift away from easy money policies and inflation expectations have begun to trickle higher thanks to tight labor markets.\n\nthe market is starting to question whether or not the stories used to explain the flattening yield curve, like how inflation is in check, strong international demand, and all of the things that were going to keep the long end anchored, is valid in the perspective of synchronized global growth, said marvin loh, senior fixed-income strategist at bny mellon.\n\ninvestors say the european central bank and the bank of japan will finally make their much awaited shift away from their ultra-accommodative stance this year. market participants have pointed the finger at the two central banks for keeping a lid on long-dated treasury yields, as low-to-negative interest rates spurred a flight of investors from debt of both countries into u.s. government paper.\n\nsee: boj and ecb expectations have trader hopes riding high for the yen and the euro\n\na process of normalization of the global low-yield environment, in turn driven by a re-coupling of monetary policy globally towards a removal of accommodation would ultimately bring up the 10-year yield up to its stable, long-term levels, said strategists at société générale, in a note.\n\nthough many such calls have turned out to be no more than false alarms, improving economic data in europe and japan has reportedly led their central bankers to rethink their policy guidance without spooking markets. insiders in the bank of japan said officials were confident of hitting the 2% inflation target, which has remained frustratingly out of reach, reported the wall street journal.\n\nmarkets are also falling in line with the federal reserve's view of future interest rates, a stark change from last year.\n\nback in 2017, the gulf between the fed and wall street over the appropriate level of interest rates seemed impossible to close. analysts accused the central bank of risking a policy misstep if it hiked rates when inflation readings persisted below its 2% target. policymakers including fed chairwoman janet yellen stuck to the script that a lack of price pressures would prove fleeting.\n\nthis disconnect kept the 10-year yield depressed as investors wagered for a flattening of the yield curve, the slope of which reflected the spread between short-dated and long-dated bond yields.\n\nbut rising inflation expectations have had investors humming a new tune. a recent beige book report showed employers were open to raising wages to attract scarce workers, while higher commodity prices have pushed up breakeven rates, the market-based assessments of inflation prospects.\n\nthe 10-year breakeven rate established a three-year high of 2.09% on thursday as crude prices moved above $60 a barrel, as the chart below shows.\n\nrising oil prices have stoked inflation expectations. ubs\n\ntraders now estimate the chance of three rate hikes this year to have risen above 50%, according to fed fund futures data. that's in line with the so-callled dot plot, an aggregate of senior fed officials' projections for interest rates, which showed a median forecast of three hikes in 2018.\n\non top of that, a wave of treasury issuance could swamp bond investors. the fed's reduction of its balance sheet and the deficit-widening tax cuts could ramp up the federal government's borrowing needs.\n\nread: bond market braces for $ 1 trillion tsunami of treasurys this year\n\nthe supply deluge is unlikely to be a one-off if the budget shortfalls increase at their current pace. the committee for the responsible federal budget estimated the deficit to push above $1 trillion as early as 2019.\n\nbut matthew hornbach of morgan stanley said that outside of recessions, only one in four times when the treasury department unloaded a wave of supply did yields rise over recent history. moreover, prices adjust much less on an outright basis when the actual supply hits the market than when expectations for an influx of supply started to build, he said. forward-looking investors already had a strong inkling of upcoming bond issuance.\n\nhornbach's point highlights how many of the factors blamed for the bond selloff were also present toward the tail end of last year. nonetheless, the 10-year yield ended largely where it began 2017.\n\nwe know all this, and have for a while, and that the price action that starts the new year, which is seasonally habitually bearish even in bull markets, is not necessarily prologue, said david ader, chief market strategist for informa intelligence, in a note.\n\nit's tempting to dismiss the recent turn in bearish sentiment as a rite of spring, and that the pace at which yields have climbed has taken the move beyond its moorings.\n\nbut forecasts, including from goldman sachs and nomura, were already predicting bonds to come under pressure in the first quarter of 2018, but perhaps not at this disorienting speed. the 10-year yield gained more than 20 basis points in january.\n\nif the move may have been too fast, it has not gone too far, said strategists at deutsche bank.\n\nall the same, a short-term pullback could be on the cards, and even more so, if debt ceiling negotiations hit an impasse, as they did in the government shutdown. appetite for u.s. government paper could suffer if credit ratings agencies see the political brinkmanship as a reason to strip away the u.s.'s gold-plated, triple-a credit rating.
human advisers and robo advisers, once thought to be competitors, will likely become partners in the years to come.\n\njust like technology has altered and changed every industry, it is beginning in wealth management, said timothy welsh, a certified financial planner and president of nexus strategy. while the digital platforms have been around for a while, it is just now that we are starting to see their platforms start to become mainstream.\n\nconsider how two organizations, one the entity that oversees certified financial planners and the other, the association representing certified financial planners, are approaching the brave new world of human and robo advice.\n\n• the cfp board center for financial planning in december released the findings of a panel of experts who explored the future effects of digital advice on the financial planning profession, according to a release. the cfp board, the regulatory body for the nation's certified financial professionals, said its panel of experts sought to identify the challenges and opportunities financial planners face as the worlds of human and automated financial advice collide.\n\n• the financial planning association (fpa) announced, also in december, that betterment for advisors would become a strategic partner of the nation's largest association for certified financial planners. betterment for advisors will, among other things, teach the fpa's 24,000 members how digital investment advice can augment the robust financial planning services they are providing clients while staying true to the high-touch level of advice they are already providing, according to a press release.\n\nexperts largely praised the efforts by the fpa and cfp board to better understand how human and robo advisers can work together in the future. from these announcements, it appears that these two organizations are recognizing that the delivery of financial advice will be different in the future, and if they are to remain relevant for their members, they need to start building content and practice standards that include digital capabilities, welsh said. in fact their very futures as organizations depend on the human adviser being primary, and if the adviser job goes away than there won't be a need for them anymore.\n\nin its research, the cfp board's digital advice working group, using a scenario-planning approach facilitated by heidrick & struggles, created a matrix of four potential future outcomes that took into consideration the nature of consumer demand for integrated advice and the level of consumer trust pertaining to the digital experience.\n\nthe four scenarios were:\n\n• everyone goes digital: in this scenario, the same sophisticated digital advice platforms underpin both the direct-to-consumer online experience as well as the tools used by human financial advisors.\n\n• judgment day: this scenario assumes that digital advice accelerates to the point of ubiquity, with some form of financial advice available for free to most consumers.\n\n• rise of the humans: in this scenario, growing complexity of financial products extends the time horizon to realize greater automation of financial advice.\n\n• back to the future: in this scenario, a cyberattack directed at an online digital advice platform turns consumers away from human-less systems and drives a preference for the financial adviser.\n\nto be fair, at least one expert suggested that the scenarios might mesh together in reality. while each of the four discrete scenarios in the cfp board paper are all possible outcomes in the future, i believe the future of digital advice will evolve to include elements of all four scenarios, said bill winterberg, founder and president of fppad.com.\n\nno matter whether the cfp board's scenarios are discreet or not, another expert sees the need for financial advisers to contemplate all scenarios.\n\nthe simple fact that investors are increasing integration of digital communication into every aspect of their lives is going to necessitate the transformation of their financial advice relationships, said scott smith, director of research at cerulli associates and a member of the cfp board's digital advice working group. investors' expectations of what an advice provider will be able to deliver in terms of interaction and value will perpetually escalate.\n\nthis is not to say that each traditional provider immediately needs to launch a low-cost robo platform. but more to emphasize that digital engagement will become part of the core expectation of investors up and down the wealth continuum, said smith.\n\nthe question, he said, is not whether traditional firms will offer these types of platforms, but which will best connect their advisers to clients in ways that highlight the value of advisory services beyond commodified aspects of portfolio management.\n\ncan wall street close this gender gap?\n\naccording to cerulli associates' research, smith said there will be increasing pressure on traditional advice providers to broaden their advice services to maximize their value to clients. advisers will no longer be able to tout their services as 'wealth managers' while focusing almost exclusively on the implementation and rebalancing of an accumulation portfolio, he said.\n\nsmith also noted that over the last year, there has been a pronounced change in the robo advice landscape. prior to 2016 there was widespread concern across the industry that robo advisers would fundamentally disrupt the traditional financial advice market, he said. several start-up providers were gathering assets at meteoric rates and there were widespread assumptions that numerous other firms would jump into the market and enjoy similar success.\n\nmore recently, however, smith said it has become clear that the robo revolution will be most impactful as a catalyst to moving traditional advice providers into the digital age rather than replacing them outright.\n\ninstead of competing with them, many of the start-up robo advisors are increasingly serving as the plumbing connecting traditional advisory firms to their clients, said smith. many robo firms have engineered outstanding technology platforms, but have neither the brand recognition nor the network of field advisors to achieve the distribution scale they need.\n\nby pairing advisers skilled in building out their natural markets and gathering assets, with platforms that allow them to optimize their efficiency, smith said provider firms will be better able to maximize their marketshare in the long term.\n\nfor his part, winterberg suggested that financial advisers must examine what aspects of their practice is right for robo and which isn't. financial advice providers must challenge themselves, and their business models, today to identify what aspects of their work are candidates for automation and algorithms, and what aspects cannot be automated, he said. the opportunity for advice providers' success in the future lies in augmenting the aspects of their business that are truly unique and difficult to scale, such as empathy for clients, evaluating and discussing tradeoffs, and offering a compromise to the actions clients can take.\n\nanother expert also suggested that there is high degree of uncertainty right now over robo and human advisers. legislative and regulatory changes over the next few years are likely to have an impact on the ultimate outcome, said joel bruckenstein, a certified financial planner and publisher of technology tools for today. in the near term, i think it's unlikely that digital will totally displace good financial advisers, but longer term, it is difficult to totally rule out.\n\nperhaps the more interesting point, bruckenstein said is that the cfp board is interested enough in technology and digital advice to take a leadership role, while they continue to virtually ignore technology in the cfp educational program.\n\nfurthermore, to this day, the cfp board absolutely refuses to grant any ce credit at to advisers for improving their competency with these 21st century tools of the trade, he said. the cfp board did put together a very impressive group of experts to explore scenarios, most of who i know personally and respect, but until the cfp board gets its own house in order, it is difficult to take them seriously as a technology leader.\n\nwe feel that advisers have been using technology to improve front- and back-office functions for decades, said joe maugeri, managing director of corporate relations at cfp board. the more important question, though, is in regards to how advisers will change their practice to focus on things technology can't do, such as working with clients to define goals, explaining and working through behavioral finance issues and developing holistic financial plans ready to help investors in 2017 and beyond.\n\nthe cfp board believes, he said, that technology should be the tool that helps advisers do what is most meaningful: deepen client relationships and enhance the level of financial advice consumers receive. ultimately, technology will continue to evolve and create scale and capacity that will enable advisers to do their jobs better and empower stronger connections with the clients they serve, he said.\n\nwill fpa's deal with betterment lead to measurable change?\n\nwinterberg applauded the fpa for establishing a partnership with betterment for advisors, but he wasn't convinced that it will lead to any measurable change in the adoption of automated investment solutions by the association's membership.\n\naccess to thought leadership content and collaboration with industry influencers is just a tweet or an email away in today's world, and the fastest-growing advisers are already connecting with solution providers to implement tools for digital advice, he said. the partnership will allow betterment for advisors to deliver content to a larger audience, but i'm not certain if that will result in engagement and attention from the fpa membership.\n\nbruckenstein wasn't convinced that the fpa's deal with betterment was a game changer either. the fpa does have over 20,000 members, but they are not a homogenous group, and they don't always follow the fpa blindly, he said. i've yet to encounter an adviser who chooses a piece of software based solely upon a sponsorship that a firm has with fpa.\n\nto be sure, the sponsorship will surely bring visibility to betterment among some advisers, bruckenstein said. but in the end, advisers choose providers based upon the specific needs of their firm, he said. i think the challenge for the fpa will be to retain the loyalty and support of other digital providers who compete with betterment.\n\nfor her part, lauren schadle, the executive director and ceo of fpa, said the collaboration is not about whether fpa members decide to adopt the betterment for advisors platform for their respective businesses. rather, it provides our members with a greater understanding of the technology involved so they can make a more informed decision by providing betterment with an opportunity to connect more deeply with the fpa advisor community, she said.\n\nthe fact is that financial planning is a very high touch profession that requires the skill of a cfp professional, said schadle. the use of technologies like those offered by betterment for advisors can augment financial planning offerings for those members and firms that choose to do so, she said. our focus now is on working with the betterment team to see how we can integrate their experts and content with the expertise of fpa's adviser community.\n\nbottom line\n\nwelsh said the efforts by the cfp board and fpa are just baby steps. the real change is coming soon as technology becomes a bigger piece of financial services and organizations like the fpa and cfp board will need to up their game to

mcdonald's corp.'s fourth-quarter global same-store sales increase of 2.7% includes strong results in asia, with china and japan reporting increases, even as u.s. same-store sales slipped.\n\nglobal same-store sales were expected to increase a more-modest 1.3%, according to factset estimates.\n\nfourth-quarter same-store sales in the company's high-growth segment increased 4.7%, with the fast-food giant mcd, -0.54% highlighting a strong performance in china, including improved restaurant profitability.\n\nsame-store sales jumped 11.1% in foundational markets, with japan leading the way, the company said. some latin american markets also contributed to the strong showing.\n\nsee also:mcdonald's u.s. same-store sales fall, rise abroad\n\nfaced with a tough comparison with last year's all-day-breakfast launch, mcdonald's reported a fourth-quarter same-store sales decline of 1.3% in the u.s. the u.s. same-store sales result still beat the 1.4% decline in the factset forecast.\n\nthe company expects all-day breakfast comparisons to be a hurdle going forward.\n\nhere's what's behind the whiskey boom in the u.s.\n\nas we begin the first quarter of 2017, we are mindful of the comparison we face against first quarter 2016 results, which benefited from [the extra day from] leap year, favorable weather and continued momentum from all-day breakfast in the u.s., said chief executive steve easterbrook in a statement.\n\nsee also: mcdonald's turns up the heat with fast-food rivals in siberia\n\nread also:mcdonald's looks to sell part of japan business stake\n\nmcdonald's results beat expectations, though sales slipped year over year. earnings per share totaled $1.44, beating the $1.41 factset consensus and rising from $1.31 last year. sales totaled $6.03 billion, down from $6.34 billion last year, but above the $6.00 billion factset consensus.\n\nanalysts at conlumino say the all-day breakfast menu was the right call, but has come with the pitfalls of offering cheaper options. customers are choosing the less-expensive items, but the menu isn't necessarily driving new customers.\n\nmany have exploited this and average transaction values for lunch and dinner have fallen as a consequence, something that has put a dampener on overall growth, said conlumino chief executive neil saunders in a monday note. widening the audience in a sustainable way is the key issue for mcdonald's as it enters [its] new fiscal year. this has to be more than about menu change —including the recent introduction of multiple sizes of big macs which, in our opinion, does nothing to create step change or to increase real choice.\n\nsee also: mcdonald's selling majority stake in china business for up to $2 billion\n\nsaunders suggested that mcdonald's needs to be more radical with its changes, like opening a new restaurant brand, and consider the state of restaurants in the u.s., which leaves a lot to be desired.
mallinckrodt plc shares rebounded 3.5% in morning trade thursday, after the company announced a $100 million settlement with the federal trade commission on wednesday over allegedly using its monopoly to hike prices on its largest product.\n\nas part of the settlement, the company us:mnk will license rights to a competing drug — which it acquired in 2013 — to marathon pharmaceuticals llc for use in two disease areas.\n\nthe new licensing direction will not affect the company's net sales because it currently gets no u.s. revenue from the competing drug, mallinckrodt said.\n\nmallinckrodt's hp acthar gel, which treats infantile spasms, and its price hike to more than $34,000 per vial today from $40 a vial, are at the center of the ftc allegations.\n\nthe product is still a hand grenade, but we see no change in fundamentals, said raymond james analyst elliot wilbur on wednesday, who maintained an outperform rating for the company.\n\nread more: mallinckrodt says it has settled with the ftc over allegedly using its monopoly to hike drug prices\n\nbut j.p. morgan analyst chris schott described the settlement as an incremental negative, adding a potential future competitor to the market.\n\nsee: ftc set to file suit against mallinckrodt for using monopoly to jack up drug prices\n\nreplacing obamacare: who pays to cover the sickest?\n\nacthar will likely remain controversial, schott said, but the company continues to generate strong operating cash flows, and we expect the company to continue to focus on diversifying the business through business development.\n\nthe ftc said wednesday that mallinckrodt illegally acquired the u.s. rights to develop a competing adrenocorticotropic hormone drug, a space in which its acthar drug had a monopoly.\n\nbut wilbur, and mallinckrodt on a wednesday call, said that despite some similarities, the two drugs weren't exactly the same.
 'society is demanding that companies, both public and private, serve a social purpose. to prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society.' \n\nthat's from a letter larry fink, founder and ceo of blackrock, penned to business leaders, according to a draft obtained by the new york times, which said the note could mark a watershed moment on wall street.\n\nfink, who runs the world's biggest asset manager, says these companies need to do more than just churn out profits if they want to receive the support of blackrock and its $6 trillion in investments.
investor insanity about bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and blockchain is in full bloom.\n\nthose with trading experience have two choices: complain about the insanity or take advantage of the insanity to make money.\n\nthose choosing to make money ought to make sure they have a proven methodology in place to control risk. it is easier to control risk in bitcoin- and blockchain-related stocks than in currencies themselves, such as trading bitcoin btcusd, +0.94% ethereum and ripple.\n\nlet me illustrate with a chart of a former dow jones industrial average djia, -0.46% stock that has produced a 220% gain in one day after the arora report issued a buy signal.\n\nchart\n\nplease click here for the annotated chart of eastman kodak kodk, -5.19% . this is the old camera-film giant that used to be in dow until 2004. the stock represents the company that emerged from bankruptcy. please note the following from the chart:\n\n• the arora report gave a buy signal when the stock was at $3.80. at the time of the buy signal, the first target of $6.50 to $8.80 was given. we said if it catches the fancy of the momo (momentum) crowd, it could go as high as $17. as a risk-control measure, the stop zone was given at $2.73 to $2.88.\n\n• a simple technique that investors will find useful to double their returns and control risk is to buy a core quantity and then surround it with trade-around positions. to the arora report subscribers, we provide a detailed methodology for using this technique. along with the buy signal, the call was to add trade-around positions with tighter stops to lower risk.\n\n• the chart shows that, initially, volume spiked but the vud indicator was orange. this indicated that even though the stock was rocketing, there was net selling in the real time. our separate algorithms picked up extensive short selling. apparently short sellers did not believe in the rise. short sellers were betting on the stock to fall back to earth.\n\n• the chart shows that after-hours volume dried up but was still heavy relative to the time of the day.\n\n• the chart shows that, in the after-hours, the vud indicator turned green. this showed net real-time buying. our separate algorithms detected a short squeeze. in a short squeeze, short sellers panic, and then buy the stock to cover their positions. this panic buying adds fuel for a further rise.\n\n• the chart shows arora's call to take partial profits when the first target was reached.\n\n• the chart shows the point when stops were raised to break-even.\n\n• the chart shows the point where stops were raised to protect profits.\n\n• the chart shows the point where the stops were raised again to protect bigger profits. by taking partial profits and raising the stops, the risk was controlled while enjoying gains in the explosive move.\n\nask arora: nigam arora answers your questions about investing in stocks, etfs, bonds, gold and silver, oil and currencies. have a question?

shares of theater chain amc entertainment holding inc. amc, +3.24% were down more than 2% in premarket trade on wednesday after being downgraded to sector perform from outperform at rbc capital markets. rbc analysts wrote in a note that their tepid view of the 2018 box office and amc's high leverage make for a challenging combination for the company. we'd likely get more bullish on amc if the box office outlook (given its leverage) and, or there was traction on the international ipo, lead analyst leo kulp wrote. as was evidenced in 2017, amc's leverage makes it very susceptible to changes in multiple. we estimate a one point ev/ebitda multiple change has a 36% impact on the stock price. while this is a positive in an up year for the box office, the uncertainty around the 2018 box office makes us more conservative. kulp expects that the 2018 box office will be flat compared with 2017, which was down slightly from the last two years. they said they see fewer big event films being released this year, and instead more non-sequel content, which could be a negative or a positive depending on how the shift in the box office is received. shares of amc have declined more than 59% in the last 12 months, while the s&p 500 index spx, -1.48% is up more than 21% and the dow jones industrial average djia, -0.46% is up nearly 28%.
the latest trend among companies trying to drum up interest: announcing plans to introduce blockchain into the business.\n\neastman kodak co. on tuesday became the latest to do so, when the company said it would begin a major blockchain initiative. kodak intends to use digital ledgers to help photographers license their work and get paid for usage.\n\nthe stock kodk, -5.19% more than doubled on the news, rocketing $3.70, or 119%, to $6.80 in very active trade, after being down as much as 1.6% before the news. trading volume spiked to 64.9 million shares from a full-day average volume of about 264,000 shares, according to factset.\n\nafter closing at a record low of $3.05 as recently as jan. 4, the tuesday move was the biggest gain and saw the most shares traded in a day since the stock began trading in its current form in september 2013.\n\nthe company and wenn digital announced the launch tuesday of the kodakone image-rights management platform and kodakcoin, a photo-centric cryptocurrency.\n\nfor its part, kodak acknowledged in its press release that blockchain, like cryptocurrency, is a hot buzzword right now, but ceo jeff clarke said that the technology will actually prove useful in the company's case. for photographers who've long struggled to assert control over their work and how it's used, these buzzwords are the keys to solving what felt like an unsolvable problem, he said in the release.\n\nkodak added that distributed-ledger technology, which is the backbone of cryptographic currencies, will help spot unlicensed usage of photos.\n\nfactset, marketwatch\n\nwe are using ethereum smart contracts, but we're also developing our own proprietary blockchain and will evaluate the optimal solution during development, kodak said in a statement.\n\nthe company, founded in 1888 in rochester, n.y., said it plans to launch an initial coin offering, or ico, for kodakcoin, the cryptocurrency that will become the backbone of the new payment system. icos have emerged as a method of raising capital among ventures using digital tokens.\n\nthe ico target is $20 million, with the potential to go up to $100 million.\n\ndon't miss:what is an ico?\n\nthis is a wenn digital currency, kodak said in a statement. eastman kodak company will not be an issuer of the ico, will not receive proceeds on the ico.\n\ncompanies demonstrating sudden interest in blockchain of late have been well received by investors looking for new ways to play the cryptocurrency trend. shares of riot blockchain inc. riot, -7.03% , once an unknown animal healthcare company, have soared since the company announced its pivot toward blockchain. see cryptowatch.\n\nthen there are the more established brands, including long island iced tea corp., which recently became long blockchain corp. us:lbcc and enjoyed a nice stock-market boost for the name change. hooters parent chanticleer holdings inc. us:burg said earlier this month that it would use cryptocurrency for its loyalty program, which sent the chanticleer stock up sharply.\n\nkodak, which emerged from bankruptcy in september 2013 after a precipitous decline in fortunes that found it evicted from the dow jones industrial average djia, -0.46% in 2004, is a poster child for failing to embrace new technologies fast enough.\n\nsee also:don't become the next kodak.\n\nkodak's blockchain announcement boosted the company's market value by $157.5 million on tuesday, to $289.5 million. the stock remains down 55.6% over the past 12 months, compared with a 27.9% rally in the dow jones industrial average djia, -0.46% , even after tuesday's run-up.\n\nkodak was a dow member from july 1930 to april 2004.
last year didn't just bring change. it brought a seismic schism that will permanently alter how we work and live. what began as a public health crisis — one that will continue into the new year — became an unprecedented series of different crises that also took both jobs and the stock market on a roller-coaster ride.\n\nas we head into 2021, it's time to look ahead for how we can take what we've learned from the past 12 months — and further back — and sort out the trends that will be most advantageous.\n\nread: yes, it's possible to save too much for retirement\n\npart great recession, part great reinvention\n\nlike the last financial crisis of 2008-2010, this year economic volatility drove people to focus on high quality assets and liquidity while taking on less risk. but over the course of the pandemic, we started to see job losses stabilize, at least compared with a decade ago, and stocks bounced back and even surged.\n\nthis allowed for many to shift from being focused on their next paycheck to insuring against adverse events impacting their own health. in fact, we saw a notable difference in the purchase of health protection products compared with a decade ago.\n\nlooking into 2021 and beyond, regardless of age, health or status, more americans are acknowledging their own mortality and the importance of protecting their loved ones.\n\nread: how to get a job in 2021 if you're over 50\n\nthe three most important words in finance are 'digital, digital, digital'\n\nthe 'need for immediacy' was becoming a cornerstone of the financial world before the pandemic, but in 2020 we experienced a decade's worth of digital transformation in just six months. the industry's focus on digital innovation is particularly critical as millennials and generation z increase their share of the personal finance marketplace. in fact, our recent consumer poll showed that more than half of these groups would prefer to make purchase decisions through digital experiences using virtual or augmented reality technology.\n\nas we look ahead to 2021 and beyond, the digital experience for all financial offerings must catch up to comparable industries as everyone expects compelling products, seamless engagement and access to a broad shelf of offerings how and when they want them.\n\none crisis detoured — student loan debt\n\nentering 2020, employers and policy makers were focused on supporting college grads by figuring out ways to help reduce their college debts. to wit, we released of a survey in december 2019 which found that 35% of employers were concerned about their employees' student loan debt. however, the economic fallout of the pandemic combined with a new administration is poised to turn that world upside down.\n\nwhile we don't know the full extent to which loan repayment policies will change, it's possible that everything from income-driven repayment to full on debt cancellation is in play. no matter the specific outcome, this new dynamic will allow for greater focus on emergency and long-term savings alongside retirement planning.\n\nread: i can afford a $300,000 home in a ski town — where can i retire?\n\na shift in trust\n\nwe entered 2020 on the brink of a trust crisis, as traditional institutions from mainstream media to the government became divisive sources and many flocked to social media circles to serve as their most relied upon source for financial guidance. in fact, during the prosperous decade that preceded 2020, the rise of crowdsourcing meant many of us not only used recommendations from strangers to decide where to eat or what movie to see, it also determined our biggest financial decisions.\n\nlooking ahead, the importance of trust has never been more critical, now ranking as the second most important factor in purchasing decisions. when it comes to your finances, we're seeing the bumpy social media ride of this past year push many toward quality, trusting expert advice over friend-turned-unfriended 'sources.'\n\nthis past year tested us all in ways we never could have predicted. but now that we all know what we're capable of, we can plan ahead and ensure we're more prepared for the obstacles facing us in 2021.\n\namanda wallace is head of insurance operations with massmutual, a life insurance provider.
