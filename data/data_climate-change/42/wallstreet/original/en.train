in divorce situations, one spouse or ex-spouse may become legally obligated to make payments to the other party. since these payments are often substantial, locking in tax deductions for the payer has often been a substantial issue. before the new tax cuts and jobs act (tcja), payments that met the tax-law definition of alimony could always be deducted by the payer for federal income tax purposes. and recipients of alimony payments always had to report the payments as taxable income.\n\nthis old-law treatment continues for alimony payments made under pre-2019 divorce agreements. but for payments made under post-2018 agreements, things will change dramatically. here's the story.\n\ntcja eliminates deductions for alimony payments required by post-2018 divorce agreements\n\nfor payments required under divorce or separation instruments that is executed after dec. 31, 2018, the new law eliminates the deduction for alimony payments. recipients of affected alimony payments will no longer have to include them in taxable income.\n\nthis tcja treatment of alimony payments will apply to payments that are required under divorce or separation instruments that are: (1) executed after dec. 31, 2018 or (2) modified after that date if the modification specifically states that the tcja treatment of alimony payments (not deductible by the payer and not taxable income for the recipient) now applies.\n\nfor individuals who must pay alimony, this change can be expensive--because the tax savings from being able to deduct alimony payments can be substantial.\n\nno change in tax treatment for payments required by pre-2019 divorce agreements (business as usual)\n\nthere's no change in the federal income tax treatment of divorce-related payments that are required by divorce agreements that are executed before 2019. however, for these payments to qualify as deductible alimony, payers must still satisfy the time-honored list of specific tax-law requirements. if those requirements are met, alimony payments can be written off above-the-line on the payer's federal income tax return. that means the payer does not have to itemize to benefit from the deduction. payment recipients must include alimony payments that are required by divorce agreements executed before 2019 in their taxable income. so this is a continuation of business as usual.\n\nwhen payments fail to meet the tax-law definition of alimony, they are generally treated as either child support payments or payments to divide the marital property. such payments represent nondeductible personal expenses for the payer and tax-free money for the recipient.\n\nrequirements for deductible alimony\n\nwhether payments required by pre-2019 divorce agreements qualify as tax-deductible alimony or not is determined strictly by applying the applicable language in our beloved internal revenue code and related regulations. in general, what the divorce decree says and what the divorcing couple might intend does not matter. for a particular payment required by a pre-2019 divorce agreement to qualify as deductible alimony, all the following requirements must be met.\n\n1. written instrument requirement\n\nthe payment must be made pursuant to a written divorce or separation instrument. this term includes divorce decrees, separate maintenance decrees, and separation instruments.\n\n2. payment must be to or on behalf of spouse or ex-spouse\n\nto qualify as deductible alimony, a payment must be to or on behalf of a spouse or ex-spouse. payments to third parties, such as attorneys and mortgage lenders, are permitted if they are made on behalf of a spouse or ex-spouse and pursuant to a divorce or separation agreement or at the written request of the spouse or ex-spouse.\n\n3. payment cannot be stated to not be alimony\n\nthe divorce or separation instrument cannot state that the payment in question is not alimony or effectively stipulate that it is not alimony because it is not deductible by the payer or not includable in the payee's gross income.\n\n4. ex-spouses cannot live in same household or file jointly\n\nafter divorce or legal separation has occurred, the ex-spouses cannot live in the same household or file a joint return for payments to qualify as deductible alimony.\n\n5. cash or cash equivalent requirement\n\nto be deductible alimony, a payment must be made in cash or cash equivalent.\n\n6. cannot be child support\n\nto be deductible alimony, a payment cannot be classified as fixed or deemed child support under the alimony tax rules. the rules regarding what constitutes child support--especially what constitutes deemed child support--for this purpose are complicated and represent a nasty trap for unwary taxpayers. contact a tax professional if your proposed divorce agreement includes payments that you intend to be alimony as well as payments that you intend to be child support.\n\n7. payee's social security number requirement\n\nfor the payer to claim an alimony deduction for a payment, the payer's return must include the payee's social security number.\n\n8. no obligations for payments to continue after recipient's death\n\nthe obligation to make payments (other than payments of delinquent amounts) must cease if the recipient party dies. if the divorce papers are unclear about whether or not payments must continue, applicable state law controls. if under state law, the payer must continue to make payments after the recipient's death (to the recipient's estate or beneficiaries), the payments cannot be deductible alimony. in other words, the payment obligation must cease if the recipient party dies in order for the payment to qualify as deductible alimony. failing to meet this requirement for payments to cease if the recipient dies is the most common reason for lost alimony deductions.\n\nthe last word\n\nif you are currently in divorce proceedings and will be paying your soon-to-be-ex-spouse, you won't be able to deduct any of those payments as alimony, thanks to the tcja. on your soon-to-be-ex's side of the deal, he or she won't have to treat any of the payments as taxable income. so tax-wise, this is a financial loss for you and a windfall for the other party. take that into consideration when negotiating your divorce agreement.\n\non the other hand, if you are paying your ex under a pre-2019 divorce agreement, nothing has changed. but your payments must meet all the aforementioned rules to be tax-deductible alimony.\n\n(this story was updated on jan. 29, 2019.)
athens, greece (project syndicate)—a house of cards. a set of lies we have unconsciously accepted. that's what our certainties seem like during profound crises. such episodes shock us into recognizing how unsafe our assumptions are. that is why this year has resembled a rapidly receding tide, forcing us to confront submerged truths.\n\nwe used to think, with good reason, that globalization had defanged national governments. presidents cowered before the bond markets. prime ministers ignored their country's poor but never standard & poor's spgi, +0.45% . finance ministers behaved like goldman sachs's gs, +0.95% knaves and the international monetary fund's satraps. media moguls, oilmen, and financiers, no less than left-wing critics of globalized capitalism, agreed that governments were no longer in control.\n\ngovernment grew claws\n\nthen the pandemic struck. overnight, governments grew claws and bared sharpened teeth. they closed borders and grounded planes, imposed draconian curfews on our cities, shut down our theaters and museums, and forbade us from comforting our dying parents. they even did what no one thought possible before the apocalypse: they canceled sporting events.\n\n those who normally protest that money does not grow on trees, that governments must let the chips fall where they may, held their tongue. \n\nthe first secret was thus exposed: governments retain inexorable power. what we discovered in 2020 is that governments had been choosing not to exercise their enormous powers so that those whom globalization had enriched could exercise their own.\n\nthe second truth is one that many people suspected but were too timid to call out: the money-tree is real. governments that proclaimed their impecunity whenever called upon to pay for a hospital here or a school there suddenly discovered oodles of cash to pay for furlough wages, nationalize railways, take over airlines, support car makers, and even prop up gyms and hairdressers.\n\nthose who normally protest that money does not grow on trees, that governments must let the chips fall where they may, held their tongue. financial markets celebrated, instead of throwing a fit at the state's spending spree.\n\nsolvency illusion\n\ngreece is a perfect case study of the third truth revealed this year: solvency is a political decision, at least in the rich west. back in 2015, greece's public debt of €320 billion ($392 billion) towered over a national income of only €176 billion. the country's troubles were front-page news around the world, and europe's leaders lamented our insolvency.\n\ntoday, in the midst of a pandemic that has made a bad economy worse, greece is not an issue, even though our public debt is €33 billion higher, and our income €13 billion lower, than in 2015.\n\neurope's powers that be decided that a decade of dealing with greece's bankruptcy was enough, so they chose to declare greece solvent. as long as greeks elect governments that consistently transfer to the borderless oligarchy whatever (public or private) wealth is left, the european central bank will do whatever it takes—buy as many greek government bonds tmbmkgr-10y, 0.974% as necessary—to keep the country's insolvency out of the spotlight.\n\nthe fourth secret that 2020 brought into the open was that the mountains of concentrated private wealth we observe have very little to do with entrepreneurship. i have no doubt that jeff bezos amzn, +1.42% , elon musk tsla, +3.68% , or warren buffett brk.b, +0.20% have a knack for making money and cornering markets. but only a tiny percentage of their accumulated loot is the result of the creation of value.\n\nconsider the stupendous increase since mid-march in the wealth of america's 614 billionaires. the additional $931 billion they amassed did not result from any innovation or ingenuity that generated additional profits. they got richer in their sleep, so to speak, as central banks flooded the financial system with manufactured money that caused asset prices, and thus billionaires' wealth, to skyrocket.\n\nscience depends on the state, not the markets\n\nwith the record-fast development, testing, approval, and rollout of covid-19 vaccines, a fifth secret was revealed: science depends on state aid, and its effectiveness is oblivious to its public standing. many commentators have waxed lyrical about markets' capacity to respond quickly to humanity's needs. but the irony should be lost on no one: the administration of the most anti-science u.s. president ever—a president who ignored, intimidated, and mocked experts even during the worst pandemic in a century—allocated $10 billion to ensure that scientists had the resources they needed.\n\nbut there is a broader secret: while 2020 was a banner year for capitalists, capitalism is no more. how is that possible? how can capitalists flourish as capitalism evolves into something else?\n\neasily. capitalism's greatest apostles, like adam smith, emphasized its unintended consequences: precisely because profit-seeking individuals have no regard for anyone else, they end up serving society. the key to converting private vice into public virtue is competition, which impels capitalists to pursue activities that maximize their profits. in a competitive market, that serves the common good by boosting the range and quality of available goods and services while constantly lowering prices.\n\ntechno-feudalism, with next-day delivery\n\nit is not hard to see that capitalists can do much better with less competition. this is the sixth secret that 2020 exposed. liberated from competition, colossal platform companies like amazon did astonishingly well from capitalism's demise and its replacement by something resembling techno-feudalism.\n\nbut the seventh secret that this year revealed represents a silver lining. while bringing about radical change is never easy, it is now abundantly clear that everything could be different.\n\nthere is no longer any reason why we should accept things as they are. on the contrary, the most important truth of 2020 is captured in bertolt brecht's apt and elegant aphorism: because things are the way they are, things will not remain the way they are.\n\ni can think of no greater source of hope than this revelation, delivered in a year most would prefer to forget.\n\nthis commentary was published with permission of project syndicate—the seven secrets of 2020.\n\nyanis varoufakis, a former finance minister of greece, is leader of the mera25 party and professor of economics at the university of athens.\n\nmore viewpoints to help you make sense of things\n\nthe usual glib answers won't do as covid-19 casts a long shadow on the economy\n\nas biden gets set to take office, can americans forgive one another?\n\nsky-high stock prices make sense, robert shiller says
the stock market may have recovered from the first shocks of the pandemic, but americans' retirement savings might not be as lucky.\n\na majority of americans — 60% — withdrew or borrowed money from qualified retirement plans since covid-19 first arrived in the u.s., two-thirds of whom did so to pay for basic living expenses, according to a new survey from kiplinger's personal finance magazine and financial firm personal capital.\n\nnearly a third of the 744 respondents surveyed withdrew $75,000 or more from a retirement account, and another 58% borrowed between $50,000 and $100,000 the poll found. a third of people said they planned to work longer to compensate for the financial hit to their nest eggs.\n\nsee: worried about retirement? jump down 'one of the darkest rabbit holes' and you'll find plenty of company\n\nmen and women approached their investments differently, however. significantly more men — 65% — took advantage of covid-19 relief programs, compared with 28% of women, but they were also more likely to take a distribution or borrow from their retirement accounts (49% versus 14% and 44% versus 11%, respectively). women were less likely to make a change to their stockholdings, and less likely to check their accounts daily. almost four in 10 men were willing to take on more investment risks, compared with 9% of women.\n\nthe impacts of the pandemic on retirement savings are yet to be seen. while some americans have already had to take out of their retirement savings to pay for short-term expenses or other emergencies, covid-19 is still wreaking havoc on americans' personal finances. cities are still in lockdown, some industries — such as travel and recreation — are still suffering, leading to job losses or reduced wages.\n\nthe pandemic also has the potential to move up the date in which social security's reserves run out of money, or lessen the monthly checks beneficiaries receive in the future.

the u.s. economic recovery will be uneven in 2021, but federal reserve policy is supporting the economy and may not need to change at all, said cleveland fed president loretta mester on monday.\n\npolicy patience will prove to be a virtue mester said, in a speech to the maekyung-korea-american economic association forum.\n\nin the near term, the surge in coronavirus cases is likely to weigh on economic activity this winter, mester said.\n\nbut a slowdown in the first part of the year would not require more fiscal easing so long as the medium-run outlook remains intact, mester said.\n\nthe medium-run view assumes that most people get vaccinated by september and economic activity will pick up, she said.\n\nthis return to growth won't require the fed to take its foot off the gas because the economy will still be far from our employment and inflation goals, mester said.\n\nof course, if the economy evolves in a materially different fashion or if risks emerge, including those to financial stability, the fed would be prepared to respond appropriately, the cleveland fed president said.\n\nthere is still a high degree on uncertainty around the outlook, although some of the worst-case scenarios and downside risks have lessened over time, mester said.\n\nmester is not a voting member of the fed's interest-rate committee this year. chicago fed president charles evans, atlanta fed president raphael bostic, richmond's thomas barkin and san francisco's mary daly will be voting members this year.\n\nearlier monday, evans said he wanted fed policy to shoot for inflation around a 2.5% annual rate to get the fed to hit its 2% inflation target.\n\nmester said she expects inflation to gradually rise over the next few years.
some numbers matter more than others. how much you make is important, for example, but your financial health depends far more on how much you keep.\n\nknowing certain numbers can help you understand how well you're converting income into wealth, as well as the impact of your spending and tax situation on that process. the following calculations can help you make better decisions.\n\nyour wealth ratio\n\na wealth ratio is a measure of how effectively you've converted your lifetime income into wealth.\n\ncalculating the ratio is a key exercise in your money or your life, a guidebook for the simple living and early retirement movements, first published in 1992. authors joe dominguez and vicki robin suggested adding up the annual earnings over your entire life, as reported in social security statements or old tax returns. to that total, you can add in other money received that wasn't reported to social security, such as investment and interest income, inheritances, gifts and gambling winnings.\n\nthe next step is to calculate your net worth — what you own (the value of your assets) minus what you owe (your debts).\n\nyour net worth divided by your lifetime income, expressed as a percentage, is your wealth ratio — or what you have to show for all the money flowing into your life. if you've earned $500,000 and your net worth is $125,000, your wealth ratio is 25%. if you've earned $1 million and your net worth is $2 million, your wealth ratio is 200%.\n\nthere's no pass/fail here. younger people likely will have lower ratios than older people who've been saving and investing for decades. knowing your number can motivate you to look for ways to save and invest more so that your ratio grows.\n\nyour overhead ratio\n\nhow much of your after-tax income is eaten up by basic, must-have expenses? if you're having trouble making ends meet, calculating your overhead ratio can help explain why. it also can be handy to know when you're determining if you can afford new loan payments or how much to save in an emergency fund.\n\na must-have expense is one that can't be delayed or skipped without serious consequences. they include shelter costs, transportation, groceries, utilities, insurance, minimum loan payments and child care. in their book all your worth, bankruptcy expert (and current massachusetts senator) elizabeth warren and her daughter amelia warren tyagi recommend limiting must-haves to 50% of after-tax income.\n\na 50% limit isn't easy to achieve, but it frees up money for wants (30%) and savings or debt repayment (20%). sticking to a 50/30/20 budget also helps people better survive job loss and other economic setbacks by limiting their overhead. having an emergency fund equal to three months' worth of must-have expenses is a good goal after you get on track with retirement savings and have paid off troublesome debt such as credit cards. any loans may be affordable if the payments doesn't push your must-have expenses over the 50% mark.\n\nyour tax rates\n\nyour tax bracket doesn't reveal the amount of taxes paid on your total income. instead, the bracket (also called the marginal tax rate) reflects how much uncle sam claimed of the last dollar you earned. if you're a single filer in the 25% federal tax bracket, the first $9,275 of your 2016 taxable income is taxed at the 10% rate, the next $28,375 at 15% and the amount above $37,650 at 25%.\n\nyour bracket determines the value of your itemized deductions and tax-advantaged investments. someone in a low tax bracket, for example, doesn't get much value from write-offs, such as mortgage interest deductions or investments such as municipal bonds or variable annuities, that can benefit people in higher brackets.\n\nyour future tax bracket matters, as well. if you anticipate your bracket will drop in retirement — which happens for most people, according to experts — making deductible contributions to individual retirement accounts now is a good plan, because the tax breaks from those contributions likely will outweigh any taxes you'll pay on future withdrawals of the iras. if you expect your marginal tax rate to be higher in retirement, making nondeductible contributions to a roth ira, which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, could be the better plan.\n\nyour tax bracket, like your overhead and wealth ratios, can change over time. check these numbers regularly to stay on track with your financial life.\n\nmore from nerdwallet:
what's the best investment you can make in 2018? three considerations—taxes, risk and the economic cycle—point to one conclusion: paying down debt looks like an awfully smart move.\n\ndebtors' prison. ridding yourself of debt, even mortgage debt, has long been a savvy alternative to buying bonds and certificates of deposit. but thanks to the new tax law, it looks especially savvy right now—and especially if you're married.\n\nhow come? the new tax law took away personal exemptions but compensated by roughly doubling the size of the standard deduction. in 2018, the standard deduction will be $24,000 for married couples filing jointly, $18,000 for heads of household and $12,000 for single individuals. meanwhile, the allowable itemized deduction for state and local taxes, including property taxes, will be capped at $10,000 starting next year.\n\nthat means that many married couples will end up taking the standard deduction, because their local tax deduction, mortgage interest and other allowable deductions don't exceed their $24,000 standard deduction and thus it isn't worth itemizing. even if their itemized deductions exceed the $24,000 threshold, the benefits of itemizing will likely prove modest.\n\nto understand why, imagine you have $27,000 in itemized deductions, including $17,000 in interest from your 4% mortgage. it might seem like paying all that mortgage interest is sharply reducing your tax bill and hence your after-tax interest cost might be closer to 3%, assuming you're in the new 22% or 24% marginal tax bracket.\n\nthis is what happens when homes are made permanently affordable\n\nbut remember, in this example, your $27,000 of itemized deductions are barely above your $24,000 standard deduction. result: your itemized deductions, including that $17,000 in mortgage interest, are reducing your taxable income by a modest $3,000. paying off the mortgage—and getting rid of that 4% annual interest cost—looks smarter than ever.\n\nin the past, many brokers and financial advisors have discouraged clients from paying down debt. that way, the advisor ends up with more money to manage and, of course, can charge fees or commissions for doing so. but from now on, you should be leery of advisors who insist that carrying a big mortgage is the best strategy, unless they offer a detailed justification based on your individual tax situation.\n\nrisk unrewarded. we're in the ninth year of a bull market for u.s. stocks—and in the fourth decade of a bull market for bonds. financial markets are, alas, mighty expensive and priced for modest returns.\n\nin the years ahead, the gain from buying bonds will most likely be less than the interest cost you could avoid by paying down debt. it's hard to be so definitive about stocks, because changes in investor sentiment are such a big driver of annual stock returns. still, over the next 10 years, you probably won't earn more than 5% or 6% a year from u.s. stocks, barely more than the 4% interest you might avoid by paying off a mortgage.\n\nmoreover, that 5% or 6% comes with a heap of short-term risk. while foreign stocks still appear reasonably priced, u.s. shares are richly valued based on price-earnings multiples, the shiller p/e, tobin's q and dividend yields. are you prepared for a 30% or 40% short-term decline in share prices? faced with that risk, i suspect many folks wouldn't mind notching a guaranteed 4% by paying down their fixed-rate mortgage.\n\nthat said, before paying down debt, i would still stash enough in a 401(k) plan to earn the full employer match, and also contribute to a tax-deductible or roth ira, even though that'll mean buying pricey stocks and bonds. but if you've made the most of those opportunities and you have additional dollars to save, ridding yourself of debt looks pretty darn attractive.\n\nslowdown ahead. here we get to pure speculation. the economic expansion is in its ninth year. the new tax law will stimulate the economy, but it isn't clear how much further unemployment can fall. inflation ahead? to head off that risk and cool the economy, will the federal reserve start hiking short-term interest rates even faster?\n\nwith any luck, the economy will cruise along in goldilocks mode, neither too hot nor too cold. but what if it doesn't? this might be a good moment to prep your finance for the next economic downturn—and that means not only building up your emergency fund, but also paying down debt.\n\nwhile you're at it, if you are a homeowner, consider setting up a home equity line of credit. that way, if you pay down your mortgage but later find yourself out of work and in need of cash, you could re-borrow the money by tapping into your home's value. sound like a smart strategy?

very liberal and conservative people find it much harder to admit they're wrong about anything, even when it's got nothing to do with politics, a new study has found.\n\nthose with radical or more extreme political views resisted admitting they were wrong or changing their minds even during experiments where they counted the number of flashing dots on a computer screen, according to two studies recently conducted by scientists from university college at london university.\n\n extreme conservatives were just as likely as extreme liberals to think they were right when they were actually wrong. \n\nextreme conservatives were just as likely as extreme liberals to think they were right when they were actually wrong, researchers found. and both groups were about the same when it came to refusing to admit new evidence or change their minds.\n\nthe research, just published by the journal current biology, may not come as shock to anyone who has ever attempted to reason with a highly partisan friend, relative or coworker — or to anyone witnessing political debates on twitter twtr, -1.47% or facebook fb, +2.02% .\n\nmarket pulse:facebook shared more user data than it has admitted: report\n\nthe new study helps explain the growing polarization of politics in the u.s and other open societies, and what university of virginia politics professor larry sabato recently called the collapse of fair play in the political sphere.\n\nthe study also casts light on the way cognitive errors — or, for the purposes of this study, mistaken thinking — can hurt other aspects of our lives, such as how we handle our investments in turbulent markets.\n\nresearchers max rollwage, raymond dolan and stephen fleming at university college london's wellcome centre for human neuroimaging conducted two separate sets of experiments, one involving 381 people drawn from the general population, the other involving 417. in both cases, they first studied each person's political views in some depth. then they subjected participants to long series of tests in which they had to compare two boxes of flickering dots on computer screens, and try to gauge which one contained more.\n\ndon't miss:president trump, migrant caravans and the science behind the allure of #fakenews\n\n 'this deficit in recognizing and revising [one's] own mistakes seems to be the same at both ends of the political spectrum.'  — max rollwage\n\nmore radical participants displayed less insight into the correctness of their choices and reduced updating of their confidence when presented with post-decision evidence, the researchers found.\n\nthose with more radical left- or right-wing opinions were less likely to admit they might be wrong, or to change their minds when confronted with new evidence, they wrote.\n\nthere was very little difference between the two political sides. this deficit in recognizing and revising [one's] own mistakes seems to be the same at both ends of the political spectrum, rollwage told marketwatch.\n\nand the researchers pointed out that, critically, the experiments involved issues that had nothing to do with politics, economics, values or the great issues of the day.\n\nthe refusal to admit error, or consider new evidence, is closely linked to measures of dogmatic intolerance and authoritarianism, the researchers concluded. both, in turn, are linked with holding very left-wing or very right-wing political opinions.\n\nwith studies like these, behavioral scientists are developing a deeper understanding of the ways our brains fool us.\n\nnobody needs to understand these issues more urgently than someone trying to manage his or her own investments. while political extremists may be especially bad at admitting they've made a mistake, or changing their minds, nobody likes to do it.\n\nas a result, all investors are prone to the same damaging, subconscious techniques embraced by your dogmatic brother-in-law during a political argument. these include sticking to a decision just because you've made it, dismissing data because it goes against your opinions, and surrounding yourself with people who agree with you.\n\npolitical extremists can stay wrong all their lives without suffering any individual consequences. investors do not have that luxury. they'll go bust.

each of the 6,000 hand-numbered bottles of indiana bourbon whiskey named after greg metze sells for about $75.\n\nbut if you really want to experience the liftoff in american craft-whiskey production, you'd have done well to invest in his employer, mgp ingredients mgpi, -0.42% , whose shares climbed 64% last year.\n\nbrown spirits are booming, and so are craft distillers.\n\nit is a cautionary tale. big spirits companies are crowding the u.s. market with their own brands, and niche marketing strategies. and behind every market boom, a bust inevitably lurks. the number of craft distillers has increased more than tenfold in a decade, and the average firm is only three years old, according to research by eamonn ferry, francois mosnier and jean letzelter of exane bnp paribas.\n\nbut for now, american whiskeys are at least as fun to watch as to savor.\n\nthe mgp story is just one example. in danger of being left behind amid a generational boom that is reshaping u.s. grain fields and export markets, the founding family confronted management during a proxy contest for control of the atchison, kansas-based company in 2013. lurching from quarter to quarter, mgp was trading for about $6 a share, less than one-quarter its market value today.\n\nalso read: this is the most popular liquor in the world\n\nthe grandchildren of founder cloud cray sr. seized operational control. and in july 2014 they installed former brown forman and next level spirits executive gus griffin as ceo.\n\ni expected to find a bruised and battered company after that proxy fight, griffin told me. what i found was a positive, collaborative culture, unlike any i've experienced. … it was very clear they had underutilized assets. they had tremendous macro trends that were going to benefit them.\n\nwith 300 employees and two distilleries in atchison and lawrenceburg, ind., mgp's primary business is supplying distilled alcohol and ingredients to other makers, who apply their own labels—and finishing touches—to the product. so while mgp is not a craft distiller, it supplies big and small producers alike with the fixings, including a dozen or more recipes that can be custom-blended and finished. in 2014, mgp generated $257 million in sales on 18.5 million cases of whiskey, 500,000 cases of rye, and 6.3 million cases of gin. it also produces specialty wheat-based proteins and starches.\n\nthe term craft distiller defies formal legal definition, as i'm going to discuss in a moment. but the distilled spirits council of the united states categorizes small distillers as those that sell fewer than 100,000 cases a year. and the american distilling institute, which claims to speak for the very small maker, puts the upward bound on craft production at 42,060 cases; and limits to 25% the total investment that non-craft alcohol beverage companies can have in these independent distillers.\n\nso what is the sincerest form of flattery? that's right, imitation.\n\njim beam appropriated the language of the craft distiller in affixing handcrafted to the labels of the world's best-selling bourbon, according to a civil lawsuit filed last february in federal court in los angeles. in what might well have worked as a late-night tv parody, the complaint trotted out factory floor diagrams and photographs of industrial machinery, all the while faithfully parroting the jim beam claim that creating the world's #1 bourbon requires skilled craftsmen and a whole lot of patience.\n\nplaintiff's attorney abbas kazerounian quoted the merriam-webster dictionary as defining handcrafted as being created by a hand process rather than by a machine.\n\nunintentionally or otherwise, some of the lawsuit's language is bitingly satirical, all the while drawing attention to the offending label, which kazerounian describes as immoral, unethical, oppressive, and unscrupulous, and a continuing threat to consumers.\n\nconsumers have purchased jim beam bourbon under the false impression that the bourbon was of superior quality by virtue of being 'handcrafted,' kazerounian argued, adding that the consumers overpaid.\n\njudge larry alan burns disagreed. although misdescriptions of specific or absolute characteristics of a product are actionable, the judge wrote, generalized, vague, and unspecified assertions constitute mere puffery upon which a reasonable consumer could not rely.\n\nhe dismissed the case in august.\n\nother lawsuits took offense at such terms as the miller coors claim that its blue moon beer is artfully crafted, and that tito's handmade vodka is handmade. these actions also failed. u.s. judge robert hinkle, having thrown out a similar complaint related to the maker's mark brand of bourbon in may, dismissed much of the tito's lawsuit in september, writing, one can knit a sweater by hand, but one cannot make vodka by hand. or at least, one cannot make vodka by hand at the volume required for a nationally marketed brand like tito's. no reasonable consumer could believe otherwise.\n\nalso read:5 most important things we learned about beer in 2015\n\nwords do matter, of course. otherwise the former beam inc., based in deerfield, illinois, wouldn't have borrowed the language of the craft distiller to market its mass-produced bourbons. and its new owner, osaka, japan-based suntory holdings ltd. 2587, +1.48% , which announced a $16 billion offer to buy the american company only a month before the jim beam suit surfaced, wouldn't have defended it.\n\nin the three-plus years beam operated as a standalone company (after being spun off by fortune brands in 2011), it boosted expenditures on advertising and marketing by 30% to get consumers to spend more—and pay more—for its products, which also include skinnygirl and sauza tequila. in turn, its operating income rose by 35% to $617.1 million, on an 18% increase in sales to $3.1 billion.\n\nmere puffery, to quote the judge, became worth quite a lot. meanwhile, only months before its sale to suntory, beam said it discovered in late 2013 that it was overstating millions of dollars in sales and profits by recording some revenues too soon. despite the restatement, the final merger agreement with suntory identified $108 million in stock benefits for beam's board and executives.\n\nin reviewing six years of financial filings by beam and its predecessor, fortune brands, i found little reference by management to such terms as quality or taste that might support the trend toward higher sales and profits. instead, i found phraseology like we will upweight marketing investment in the second half behind our most exciting brands and innovations, as in an 8k filing by the company in august 2012. and beam's annual report to shareholders that same year promoted a tv advertisement with jimmy fallon promoting its maker's mark brand: it is what it isn't, the copy writer attested.\n\ndarek bell, the owner of corsair distillery in nashville, whose craft whiskeys, ryes and gins have amassed dozens of awards for quality and innovation, says, craft spirits are very simple. craft means small, independent, and actually made by that distillery.\n\ni think the heart of the matter is the big guys are mad that they cannot just keep making the same old stuff, and that they have to change due to evolving consumer tastes.\n\ntheir approach, bell says, seems to be to confuse the consumer by both discrediting the word craft and simultaneously by saying they themselves are craft.\n\nmgp has taken a lower profile in riding the boom along the u.s. bourbon trail. its chief grain buyer is a local farmer on the great plains who sells some of his own crop to the company.\n\nlast fall, mgp custom-blended three house bourbons to roll out its first branded product, bearing master distiller greg metze's name. new york whiskey connoisseur tony sachs says it is a tremendous display of just how good mgp is at both distilling and aging.\n\nbut the real testament is the stock price.\n\nceo griffin pointed out the company in january 2015 forecast that it will quadruple adjusted operating income in five years. that figure of $8.5 million for all of 2014 nearly tripled to $22 million through the first three quarters of 2015, the company announced in november.\n\nwe've gotten a lot better traction than we ever thought, griffin says.\n\nand about the shift in consumer tastes in distilled spirits from clear vodkas to american heartland brown bourbons, griffin says, we can debate whether this is going to be a 15- or 25-year run. but i don't think there's any question of whether it's going to be a three- or five-year run.\n\nit's a long-term shift in preference in consumer tastes.
washington (marketwatch) — the final reading on economic growth at the end of the obama presidency is expected to extend a disappointing trend: the u.s. failed to reach 3% annual growth for an unprecedented 11st straight year.\n\ngross domestic product — the scorecard for the economy — is likely to show the u.s. expanded at around 2.3% in the fourth quarter and just under 2% for the full year. the government will issue the report on friday.\n\nthe u.s. has failed to breach the 3% mark in every year since 2005, making barack obama the first president in modern times to fail to achieve that goal. the economy has historically expanded an average of 3.3% a year.\n\nenter donald trump.\n\nthe new president and his senior advisers vow to break the 3% barrier and push growth as high as 4%. trump has made a slew of big promises to turn up the dial on the economy and squeeze out the best performance in years.\n\ndo not allow anyone to tell you it cannot be done, trump said in his inaugural address.\n\nit won't be easy, at least not right away. one of the chief reasons the economy has lagged its historical performance is lackluster business investment during a recovery closing in on its eighth year.\n\nthe government on friday will also unveil december orders for durable goods — expensive and long-lasting items whose sale helps underpin growth. although orders probably rose in the last month of 2016, they've been soft for years.\n\nit's a paradox: companies have created 14.5 million jobs since 2011, but they have not invested the kind of money that helps workers be more productive at their jobs. low productivity is a major culprit in low economic growth.\n\nearly evidence, based on surveys of executives, suggest that kind of capital investment is likely to strengthen modestly this year, federal reserve chairwoman janet yellen said last week.\n\na modest improvement is not enough. large businesses in particular don't change investment plans quickly, and many might wait to see what kind of tax cuts or regulatory reduction the trump white house has in the works.\n\nthis is a long-lead business with highly capital-intensive investments, decisions that were made two, three and four years ago, general motors gm, -1.30% ceo mary barra said recently after trump criticized the auto maker for not creating more jobs in the united states.\n\nif a spurt in u.s. growth is going to happen, smaller businesses might have to lead the way. surveys of small firms during the obama years consistently showed a hesitancy to invest and hire even as sales improved.\n\nyet optimism among small companies soared after trump's election to the highest level since 2004, perhaps a sign they might be more aggressive in 2017.\n\nthat to me is animal spirits, said chief economist strategist john canally of lpl financial. he was referring to a phrase popularized by john maynard keynes to describe why it's important for the economy that business people feel confident.\n\nread: how trump can improve upon obama's economy\n\nenough to get the economy over the 3% hump?\n\nhardly anyone in the economic profession is willing to bet it will happen this year. they say it will take months or longer before any of trump's key economic proposals, such as tax cuts, are put in place. nor will a quick rush to get rid of regulations be enough.\n\nthe federal reserve predicts the economy will grow 2.1% this year. the blue chip survey of top u.s. economists is slightly more optimistic at 2.3%. another survey of leading business economists found that only one of 17 forecasters believes the u.s. can achieve 3% growth this year.\n\nimpossible then? time will tell. economists were excessively optimistic about how fast the economy would grow after the end of the 2007-2009 recession and they've grown more cautious the past few years. their track record is spotty.\n\ntrump certainly is inheriting a better economy than his most recent predecessors, barack obama and george w. bush. both entered office when the u.s. was either in or entering recession.\n\nwhat's more, the unemployment rate has fallen below 5%, wages are rising after years of meager gains and consumers are the most confident since the early 2000s. the economy would not need much of a boost to get to 3%.\n\nthe trick is not just getting there. it's staying there.\n\nlow productivity and slower population growth are effectively caps on how fast the u.s. can grow. getting businesses to ratchet up investment and drawing more people into the workforce at a time when businesses complain of a shortage of skilled labor are no easy tasks.\n\nwe, like pretty much everyone else, are awaiting to see precisely what the new administration brings on the economic file, with a mixture of trepidation and hope, said douglas porter, chief economist of bmo financial group.

as president trump continued to condemn the us senate elections in georgia as corrupt, democrats took an early lead in the two runoffs as early voting ended on jan. 1, according to an analysis of returns from the atlanta journal-constitution.\n\nwhile state law mandates that no ballots be opened before election night on tuesday, georgia's largest paper said its review showed more ballots were cast by democrat-leaning demographics and came from left-leaning parts of the state.\n\na record total of 3,002,100 early votes have been cast. black voters — who generally support democrats in the state by overwhelming numbers — are voting in higher numbers than they did in the presidential election, the paper reported.\n\nturnout in rural and more conservative-leaning portions of the state have lagged. president trump is planning a last-minute rally monday in dalton in a last-ditch effort to rally the faithful to the polls.\n\nsee also: pence to make eleventh-hour 'faith community' appeal on behalf of georgia republicans loeffler and perdue\n\nand trump continued saturday to question the legality of georgia's voting.\n\nwhy haven't they done signature verification in fulton county, georgia, trump tweeted. why haven't they deducted all of the dead people who voted, illegals who voted, non georgia residents who voted, and tens of thousands of others who voted illegally, from the final vote tally?\n\nneither of georgia's two incumbent senators, republicans david perdue and kelly loeffler, secured a majority of the vote in the 2020 senate elections in november, forcing them both into runoffs with their democratic opponents, the rev. raphael warnock and jon ossoff.\n\npolling in the state has shown both races to be largely deadlocked.\n\nshould the democrats prevail, the us senate would be evenly split between democrats and republicans, granting liberals de facto control of the chamber as dem vice president-elect kamala harris would be the tie-breaker on votes. the house of representatives will continue to be ruled by a democratic majority for the next two years. with democrat joe biden in the white house, the dems would control the executive and legislative branches for the first time since 2010.\n\nas everyone sprints to the finish, democrats have called out the party's biggest guns — including former president obama and michelle obama.\n\nthe former first lady recorded a robocall for warnock which reached voters on the last day of early voting and will be replayed again on election day.\n\nhello, georgia. this is michelle obama, reminding you that you have the power to change things in the upcoming senate runoff election, she says in the message. i'm asking you to vote for reverend raphael warnock, because i know he'll work with joe biden to help make health care more affordable and together, they'll finally take the coronavirus seriously, passing the economic relief georgia families need and helping get people back to work.\n\nsee: betting markets see republican win in georgia's crucial runoffs, while polls give edge to democrats\n\nthis article was first published on nypost.com
wall street closed the books on 2020 with a decidedly good year for u.s. stocks. but as is so often the case, your performance varied significantly depending on what you owned.\n\ni'm not talking about stock-picking; picking the right index was just as important. consider that for the year, the nasdaq-100 ndx, +0.38% increased roughly 44%, its fifth-best year ever. the s&p 500 spx, +0.29% had a pretty good year too, but its returns of about 16% were only roughly a third of the nasdaq-100's gains. lagging even farther behind was the dow jones industrial average djia, +0.58% , up only 7% on the year.\n\nthe root cause lies in the fact that the nasdaq-100 has more than 40% of its assets in tech and only about 2% in financial services. full diversification obviously reduces your risk, but also prohibits you from notching big gains.\n\nso if you're looking for outperformance in 2021, it may be worth biasing your portfolio just a bit toward a high-growth sector. it doesn't have to be something as vanilla as technology, as a universe of sophisticated funds allow investors to zero in specific trends without buying individual stocks.\n\nhere are five such tactical sector funds that may be worth looking into to tap into significant outperformance over your standard index funds.\n\nmarijuana etfs\n\nin november, voters in new jersey, arizona, montana and south dakota legalized recreational marijuana in their states. that makes 15 states and washington, d.c., that have legalized marijuana for adults — and 36 states that allow medicinal use of marijuana. furthermore, incoming president joe biden has embraced the notion of decriminalizing possession at the federal level.\n\nthis trend has captivated many investors, but volatility in individual stocks has means you could be in for a wild ride as the emerging cannabis industry struggles through its growing pains. after all, many dot-com stocks didn't make it thanks to misreading the market or being outmaneuvered out by competitors. for those interested in playing this broader trend, then, a basket of marijuana stocks rounded up in an etf could be just the ticket.\n\namong the funds in the marijuana space, the etfmg alternative harvest etf mj, +1.35% is the largest and most established with almost $1 billion in assets. its biggest holdings include aphria apha, +2.13% and canopy growth cgc, +3.97% . in 2020, this etf fell 11.6%, after taking into account reinvested dividends.\n\na new and fast-growing etf worth a look is direct the advisorshares pure us cannabis etf msos, +0.89% that launched in september. it is actively managed and includes indirectly related companies, microcap marijuana startups and other interesting twists on this trend. the etf is reasonably established with $250 million in assets, and could be worth a look for those looking to cast a wider net on the sector.\n\nread: cannabis stocks stage strong rally as prospect of democratic senate spurs reform hopes\n\nfintech etfs\n\ncoronavirus created quite a disruption to the global economy in 2020, and complications still linger. however, the pandemic proved once and for all the power and portability of digital technologies. this is old news to retailers, many of whom have been feeling the pain at bricks-and-mortar stores for years, but it's a trend other areas of the economy have been slower to embrace — including financial services.\n\npaypal pypl, +0.87% may be the first name many marketwatch readers think of in the fintech arena, as they have likely used one of its mobile payments services, including venmo or xoom. but fintech applications run much deeper than what consumers may see. a good example is new zealand-based xero xrolf, +4.99% , which offers cloud-based accounting services to small businesses, or the $75 billion powerhouse fiserv fisv, -0.48% that provides automated compliance and fraud-protection technologies.\n\nthese kind of enterprise-oriented services always had a place, but amid social distancing and remote working, they proved their true potential to businesses — and those customers could likely double down on them in 2021.\n\nglobal x fintech etf finx, +0.60% is one of the best options to look at if you believe in the fintech megatrend. this $1 billion etf is a who's who of the space, with big names like paypal as well as smaller firms with a lot of growth ahead of them like digital invoicing firm bottomline technologies epay, -0.55% . there are other etfs out there, some of which play specific trends like mobile payments or blockchain if you're into that, but this is an established option with a lot of interesting holdings.\n\n5g etfs\n\ni'm sure you've run across your fair share of ads that sing the praises of one wireless provider's 5g network over the others. as an investor, you should worry more about who's upgrading all these networks rather than which provider is truly faster.\n\nthe real opportunity here for investors is that obsolete telecom infrastructure necessarily means big business for firms helping the likes of at&t t, +0.53% and verizon vz, +0.20% upgrade their networks. this includes communications chip maker qualcomm qcom, +0.20% , networking service firm ciena corporation cien, -0.56% and a host of others.\n\nit remains to be seen whether big telecom can squeeze more profits out of all this or whether 5g is just a costly exercise in customer retention, but either way it creates a big opportunity for the companies building and maintaining next-gen telecom networks.\n\nthe first trust indxx nextg etf nxtg, +0.18% is a great tactical etf to consider if you want to play this long-term investment in telecom infrastructure and ride this growth trend in 2021. it holds a wide array of interesting names, from direct plays like chipmakers to opportunities that are a bit removed like data center and cloud-computing infrastructure giant digital realty trust dlr, -0.74% . it's also an established fund with $800 million in assets and excludes the legacy telecoms you may find in other funds.\n\nclean energy etfs\n\nwith democrats seizing control of both congress and the white house, climate change is firmly back on the national agenda. europe is already well ahead of u.s. alternative energy efforts, with the european union hammering out its green deal that plans to make the entire continent carbon-neutral by 2050.\n\nread: electric car sales jump to record 54% market share in norway in 2020 but tesla loses top spot\n\neven the u.k., which formally left the eu thanks to brexit, has

things for clean energy stocks, particularly names in the wind and solar space that already have seen strong interest from wall street over the past few years.\n\nthe most established etf to play this trend is the ishares global clean energy etf icln, -2.75% , which covers companies in every geography and in every segment of alternative energy and boasts almost $5 billion in assets. perhaps most important, while it does have some plays with vague ev applications, such as hydrogen fuel cell stock plug power plug, -7.85% , it is indeed a play on alternative energy — unlike the some funds, like the invesco wilderhill clean energy etf pbw, +0.35% that roughly tripled last year thanks to boasting nio nio, +2.47% as a top holding.\n\nif you want to play evs, there are plenty of ways to do that.

the pandemic. i expect the biotech fads to fall away in 2021 and the more established long-term bets on innovation and next-gen cures to shine.\n\nat the top of the list of the best etfs to play this megatrend would be the spdr s&p biotech etf xbi, +1.12% . this biotech-focused fund is deep, with roughly 170 holdings. it's also not market-cap weighted like other funds that rely on just two or three big picks in the space; not a single position is weighted at more than 1.2% at present. that ensures investors can tap in to the smaller names with the biggest long-term potential.\n\nto top it off, it is incredibly liquid with almost $7 billion in assets and volume regularly north of 2 million shares daily.\n\nsure, this etf rode the coronavirus trend to more than 50% gains last year. but more important is the long-term performance of more than 630% gains since the end of 2010—profits that roughly three times that of the s&p 500 in the same period. the hard reality is that the world faces a host of serious conditions, from cancer to alzheimer's, and the innovative medical stocks researching potential cures will remain in high demand.\n\njeff reeves is a marketwatch columnist. he

the drumbeat of bearishness is reaching a crescendo. scary, attention-grabbing headlines have become the norm in a market overwhelmed by fear after u.s. stocks kicked off 2016 with the worst calendar-year beginning ever. and it isn't as if 2015's returns were anything to be cheerful about.\n\nregular readers on marketwatch, for example, have been subjected to headlines ranging from it isn't a good time to buy to the more extreme calls to sell everything.\n\nbut for average investors with a retirement account or 401(k) plan, those recommendations aren't exactly helpful, according to michael batnick, who runs financial blog the irrelevant investor and is director of research at ritholtz wealth management.\n\nfor a lay person, the 'sell everything' type of stories have no value and are pure entertainment and should be taken as such, batnick said.\n\nin a recent blog post, batnick attempts to put the current rout in the market — which he admits may turn deeper — into a historical context, explaining why short-term fluctuations should be ignored.\n\nin a chart, dating back to 1926, batnick shows annual returns for the s&p 500 spx, -0.20% and points to three distinct secular bear markets. a secular bear market is a trend when prices fall or move sideways for years or even decades to regain their last peak.\n\nsecular markets are only seen after the fact\n\nas you can see, within secular bear markets there are smaller bull markets or years of positive returns. during the last bear market between 2000 and 2013, nine of the 13 were positive, for example.\n\nin 2007 a lot of people thought the bear market was over. the problem is that you can see secular bear markets only after the fact, he said.\n\nthe point he makes with that chart is that investors shouldn't try and time the market and that downturns tend to be followed by swings higher, eventually. with that in mind, an average investor should have a rule-based asset allocation plan, preferably put together before big storms and selloffs, and let the plan do the work in bull and bear markets.\n\nmarket timing only works if you not only make one good call at the top, but also the second good call at the bottom. over several decades, markets will have multiple corrections, but not many people can make those right calls consistently, he said, stressing that studies show that investors consistently buy at highs and sell at lows.\n\nin the long term, stock prices do follow earnings, but in the short term, there is too much noise. even if you had a crystal ball which said with a 100% certainty what earnings next year would be, nobody has any idea what the multiple is going to be or where the interest rates are going to be—there are so many variables that it's impossible to predict where the prices will end up, he continued.\n\nthe only sure way to successfully grow your investments is to have an asset allocation plan that you stick to and continue to contribute over a long period. that way you are buying stocks when they are cheap as well as when they are expensive. and a diversified portfolio will smooth out volatility. the only thing to avoid is to rush and change the plan whenever the market changes, he said.\n\nfor those investors who still would like to time the markets, it would be wise to look at track records of the smartest people. it is far from perfect.
the irs has released the new-and-improved form 1040 for your 2018 individual federal income tax return. the good news is the return is now postcard-sized if your tax situation is super-simple. the bad news is it's probably not — in which case the new form 1040 is just alarmingly different than before rather than simpler. so if you really hate change, stop here and hire a tax pro to prepare your 2018 return. otherwise, please keep reading, but make sure you're sitting down.\n\nkey point: the due date for your 2018 form 1040 is april 15, 2019, unless you live in maine or massachusetts, in which case your deadline is april 17, 2019. you can automatically extend your return to oct. 15, 2019 by filing form 4868 with the irs on or before the applicable deadline. find form 4868 at www.irs.gov.\n\nthe base postcard return\n\nthe base form 1040 for 2018, first unveiled last summer, is a two-sided postcard that looks like this.\n\nthe new postcard-sized form 1040. irs\n\nthe front side of the postcard is just for informational stuff like your name, address, social security number, dependents, and filing status. your signature also goes on this side.\n\nthe back side is for numbers (income, deductions, taxes, and credits). it bears a family resemblance to the bottom half of page 1 and page 2 of the old form 1040.\n\nin the simplest situations, you only have to file the base postcard return. more likely, you'll also have to file one or more of new schedules 1-6.\n\neven if you only have to file the base postcard return, you may have to fill out some worksheets that are included in the form 1040 instructions. for example, if you claim the new deduction for qualified business income from pass-through entities (sole proprietorships, llcs, partnerships, and s corporations), there's a worksheet to calculate your allowable deduction. you don't file these worksheets with your return, but you should keep them with your tax records for the year.\n\nkey point: forms 1040a and 1040-ez, which were simplified versions of the old form 1040, have been eliminated for 2018. everybody now files the base form 1040 plus any additional required schedules and forms.\n\nthose may include:\n\nnew schedule 1 (additional income and adjustments to income)\n\nif you have additional income and/or adjustments to income, you must file the new schedule 1 with your base postcard return. for example, you must file schedule 1 if you had business income, capital gains; unemployment compensation; alimony received; or gambling winnings. you must also file schedule 1 if you are claiming so-called above-the-line deductions for things like deductible ira and self-employed retirement plan contributions; self-employed health insurance premiums; 50% of self-employment tax; hsa contributions; student loan interest; or educator expenses.\n\nnew schedule 2 (tax)\n\nfile this if you owe the alternative minimum tax (amt) or have to repay excess advance obamacare premium tax credits that were sent to your health insurance company.\n\nnew schedule 3: (nonrefundable credits)\n\nfile this if you are claiming nonrefundable tax credits other than the child tax credit or the new $500 credit for other dependents. these include the credits for higher-education expenses, child and dependent care expenses, adoption expenses, retirement savers, residential energy-saving expenditures, electric vehicles, and foreign taxes.\n\nnew schedule 4 (other taxes)\n\nfile this if you owe other taxes such as the 10% penalty tax on early retirement account withdrawals, the penalty tax for not having obamacare-compliant health insurance coverage, the additional 0.9% medicare tax on higher earners, or the 3.8% net investment income tax on higher-income individuals.\n\nnew schedule 5 (other payments and refundable credits)\n\nfile this if you have tax payments or refundable credits (treated the same as tax payments) that cannot be entered directly on form 1040. these include quarterly estimated tax payments, the tax payment with an extension request on form 4868, the obamacare health insurance premium tax credit, and the credit for overpaid social security tax if you had several employers last year.\n\nnew schedule 6 (foreign address and third-party designee)\n\nfile this if you have a foreign address or want to allow another person (other than your paid preparer) to discuss your return with the irs.\n\nyou may still have to file some old-school schedules\n\nas in the past, you may still have to file one or more of the following additional schedules with your base form 1040.\n\n* schedule a if you itemize deductions. however, many folks won't be itemizing for 2018, because the standard deduction amounts were almost doubled by the tax cuts and jobs act. for 2018, the standard deductions are $12,000 for unmarried individuals, $24,000 for married joint-filing couples, and $18,000 for heads of households.\n\n* schedule b if you had more than $1,500 of income from interest and/or ordinary dividends or if you had certain types of interest and dividend income (such as tax-free interest from u.s. savings bonds used to pay qualified higher education expenses).\n\n* schedule c if you had a profit or loss from one or more business activities.\n\n* schedule d if you had capital gains or losses.\n\n* schedule e if you had royalty income or income or loss from rental real estate, a partnership, an llc treated as a partnership for tax purposes, an s corporation, or an estate or trust.\n\n* schedule f if you had income or loss from a farming or ranching activity.\n\n* schedule se if you owe the self-employment tax.\n\n* schedule h if you owe payroll taxes for household employees.\n\n* schedule eic if you are claiming the earned income tax credit.\n\n* schedule 8812 if you are claiming the refundable additional child tax credit.\n\nyou may still have to file some old-school forms, too\n\nas in the past, you may still have to file one or more additional tax forms with your base 2018 form 1040. for example, if you owe the amt, you must file form 6251. if you had capital gains, you must form 8949 in addition to schedule d. if you claim the credit for child care expenses, you must file form 2441. as in the past, the list goes on and on.\n\nhas anything really changed?\n\nas with most tax questions, the answer is yes and no. in the simplest situations, taxpayers can now file the postcard-sized base form 1040 and be done with it. good for them. these folks may be able to dispense with paid tax preparers. but if your tax situation has any degree of complexity, preparing your 2018 return won't be any easier than before. but it will be different. and your paid preparer may charge more than before as a result. sorry about that.
remember the old saw about not spending more than 30% of your salary on rent?\n\ngood luck with that. in 2017, that metric is achievable in only 14% of major metro areas, according to a report out thursday from attom data solutions. in fact, the median amount renters spend across the nation is 38.6%.\n\nattom's rental affordability report compiles information about the cost of renting and of purchasing a median-priced home in more than 500 metro areas to enable comparisons about which option is more affordable.\n\nbut as attom vice president daren blomquist told marketwatch, while crunching the numbers can be an interesting exercise, in many markets it's pick your poison — both are pretty unaffordable.\n\nrenters in the marin county/san francisco metro area will spend over 77% of their salary, on average, to pay rent in 2017. but purchasing a home there would cost even more: 104% of the average paycheck for the median-priced home, which is a whopping $950,000. that means that it's more affordable – for now – to rent there, even though attom forecasts rents will rise 29% over the coming year, compared to a 4.4% increase in the price of homes for purchase.\n\nsan francisco is well-known for its outsize housing costs, but it's far from the only city where the decision to rent or buy means spending most of your paycheck or all of it.\n\nattom's data shows that buying is more affordable than renting in two-thirds of all metros. (the median amount of income required to buy a home nationwide is a bit lower than what's required to rent, at 36.6%).\n\nthe two metros where it's priciest to buy, to rent, and the two that match the national median for both.\n\nbut blomquist points out that rising mortgage rates may change that equation significantly.\n\nread: housing's big question — what will happen when buyers think 4% rates are 'crazy'\n\nbut whether americans choose to rent or buy, the lack of affordability for both options, throughout so much of the housing market, not just swanky coastal areas, is its biggest risk in the future, blomquist said.\n\ni think the risk is that you see a widening gap between who can afford to buy a home and who can't and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy that those folks who aren't able to afford to buy can't build wealth through real estate. that's not a healthy broad-based housing market, it's a housing market that's the realm of the few.
this story has been corrected to reflect that kpi-121 did not meet the primary symptom endpoint of the second trial.\n\nkala pharmaceuticals inc. kala, -4.13% shares dropped 8% in extremely heavy morning trade on friday after the company released results from two late-stage trials for its dry eye therapy kpi-121. kpi-121 had statistically significant results for some but not all endpoints in the two trials, which enrolled about 900 patients each. in particular, the therapy was not statistically significant for the primary symptom endpoint of the second trial, stride 2, measuring ocular discomfort severity change from baseline to day 15. although we did not achieve statistical significance for the primary symptom endpoint in stride 2, we did observe a strong trend towards a positive treatment effect in symptoms in more symptomatic patients, for which we achieved statistical significance in stride 1, said mark iwicki, chief executive of kala pharmaceuticals. the company will continue to analyze the results and expects to discuss them with the food and drug administration, he said, noting the company's $114 million cash balance. kala also emphasized that the therapy was well-tolerated, with the most common side effect being instillation site pain. dry eye disease, which has symptoms such as chronic pain, dry eyes, eye discomfort and variable vision, is a major market primed for new entrants. allergan's restasis agn, +2.32% has long been a powerhouse dry eye therapy without much competition, bringing in $1.4 billion in revenue for the company in 2016. kala shares have dropped 31% over the last three months to $15.94, compared with a 7% rise in the s&p 500 spx, -1.48% and a 10% rise in the dow jones industrial average djia, -0.46% .
stop us if you've heard this one before: after years of bond- and money-market-fund inflows and equity-fund outflows, investors grow fearful of a rebound in yields and the potential for capital losses in fixed-income, sparking a great rotation out of bonds and into equities.\n\nthat scenario, which implies the potential for a final, euphoric surge to what's often been described as the most hated bull market in stock-market history, has been regularly predicted ever since the 2013 taper tantrum that drove a temporary spike in treasury and other bond yields. indeed, such predictions are now usually met with derision, acknowledged julian emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at btig, in a wednesday note.\n\nread:where will the s&p 500 go in 2020? here are the most bullish and bearish strategists\n\nbut such a phenomenon has marked the late innings of all great bull markets, he argued. and the current run-up from the march 2009 low is unlikely to be an exception.\n\nafter almost 11 years of equity market rally off the 2009 low, it is futile not to call this a 'great bull market.' it is, emanuel wrote. and the public will 'fall in love' with stocks once more — potentially sending prices materially higher from these already 'commanding heights' — before the bull market ends.\n\nstocks have indeed soared despite equity fund outflows. the s&p 500 spx, -0.16% rallied more than 28% last year for its best performance since 2013, while the dow jones industrial average djia, -0.39% rose more than 22% for its best year since 2017. over the last decade, the nasdaq composite provided a total return, including reinvested dividends, of 347%, according to deutsche bank, while the s&p 500 returned 256%.\n\nneed to know:irrational exuberance? why last year's stellar returns may have been a reversal of 'excessive pessimism'\n\nmeanwhile, individual investors did put money into equity funds in the week ended dec. 26, but that was only the third weekly inflow since late in the second quarter of 2017, according to data from epfr.\n\nemanuel noted that the public remained a huge buyer of bonds and a steady seller of equities over the latter half of the last decade as money-market balances rose to levels seen only during the worst days of the 2007-09 financial crisis (see charts below).\n\nbtig\n\nso what would finally bring a long-awaited fund-flow inflection to bear? emanuel said two, discrete catalysts would provide the signal.\n\nsee:the stock-market rally means it will take the average worker a record 114 hours to buy one unite of the s&p 500\n\nthe first would occur if global long-term yields broke above round numbers, emanuel said. that means 0% for germany and japan and 2% for the 10-year u.s. treasury yield tmubmusd10y, 1.639% .\n\nthe yield on the 10-year german government bond tmbmkde-10y, -0.319% , known as the bund, stands at -0.0437%. the 10-year japanese government bond tmbmkjp-10y, 0.093% is hovering near 0%, where the bank of japan has virtually pegged it via its yield-curve control program. the 10-year treasury yield was down around 4 basis points thursday at 1.879%, having rebounded from levels below 1.5% last fall as recession fears faded.\n\na move above those round numbers could alert the investing public to the potential for capital losses in bond funds in 2020, as central banks continue to want more inflation and fiscal stimulus globally (particularly for infrastructure/climate change projects) looks set to accelerate, emanuel wrote.\n\nmeanwhile, the continued democratization of investing, as evidenced by growth in zero-fee index funds and fractional trading offered by brokers and funds, as well as the race to zero-fee online stock trading by a number of high-profile brokerages, could provide the second catalyst, he said. discount-broking pioneer charles schwab corp. schw, -1.31% saw a surge in account openings in october, the month it eliminated trading commissions on stocks, exchange-traded funds and options.\n\nand fund giant vanguard on thursday joined other brokers in eliminating trading commissions on all online stock and options trades (etfs were already available commission-free).\n\nit's too early to tell for certain, but such accounts are likely to provide another source of equity demand, emanuel said, adding that it seems likely the average age of the new account opener is younger than the typical brokerage-account profile.\n\nthat's of particular interest with surveys showing millennials under-invested in equities compared with other generations, he said, noting the oldest baby boomers will turn 75 in 2020, while the oldest millennials turn 40, heading into their peak earning and savings years.\n\nsurveys show millennials remain under-invested in stocks relative to other generations, but that's likely to change, he argued, as millennials begin to receive their inheritances from the boomers and realize that, in a time where both interest rates and likely inflation/inflation expectations are troughing, equities, as has been the case for the last 100 years, continue to represent the best alternative for wealth preservation and accumulation in a diversified investment portfolio.\n\nin other words, this time isn't different.
when boomers gather, there's a pretty good chance that two topics of conversation will be their portfolios and their putting. now, a financial adviser and avid golfer has found a way to link them and has written a useful personal-finance book about it.\n\nin getting to the green: golf, financial planning and life, not necessarily in that order, altair m. gobo, a certified financial planner and partner at u.s. financial services in fairfield, n.j., points out how lessons learned on the course can be applied in investing — and, maybe, vice versa.\n\nas a frequent golfer and someone looking to better my own financial game, i spoke with gobo recently and asked him to share some money-management tips. (incidentally, gobo told me his handicap in 2017 went up to a 19. i took one lesson this year and i never made time to practice, he said. full disclosure: my handicap is 22.)\n\nhighlights from our conversation about what golf can teach us about managing money:\n\nnext avenue: what are the main similarities between playing golf and investing?\n\naltair gobo: it's been said many times that golf is a microcosm of life. golf has many challenges. some we cannot control, like the weather. some we can sort of control, like hazards. there's risk: do you try to get it over that pond on a 200-yard shot or do you lay up, hitting it short but safely to set up your next shot?\n\nthere's diversification: you don't have a bag full of nine irons. you get 14 clubs that do different things. you can apply that to wealth management: you don't have a portfolio full of just cds or high-end stocks — you diversify.\n\nand in both golf and investing, you have to remain flexible. you start with a game plan and if something's not working out, you need to change that plan.\n\neverything we thought about millennials' money habits was wrong\n\nthere's an element of what in golf we call 'course management.'\n\nright. that starts with understanding your strengths and weaknesses, setting expectations that are realistic. i cannot hit the ball 300 yards; i know that. likewise, someone with $10,000 who has a plan to have a million dollars by the end of the year — that's not realistic.\n\n it's been said many times that golf is a microcosm of life.  — altair gobo\n\ni know a guy who's close to a 30 handicap. he just stinks, but he does nothing to improve. he'll hit the most terrible shot in the world and he slams his club down and says, 'do you believe it?' and i'll be in the back snickering and saying, 'of course i believe it! you hit the same shot every day! and you do nothing to improve! so why do you think you'll start hitting better shots today?'\n\nsame in financial planning. if you don't develop a cash flow, a budget, spending habits and saving habits, how can you expect to accumulate money?\n\ntalk about the role of the pro in both disciplines.\n\nwhen i started playing golf, i tried to get better on my own. one day it dawned on me: this wasn't going to work. so i had my first lesson with a pro. he started with the grip, then changed where the ball was in my stance. i was gripping the club too hard, swinging too hard, swinging too fast.\n\nsame thing in financial planning. as financial planners, it's our job to sit down with the client and see what's realistic and what's important.\n\nyou write about choosing your shots carefully in golf and money management, especially in the decision-making. in golf, after a bad tee shot, you're often faced with the choice of trying to hit the ball forward in the little opening between the trees — risking even worse trouble — or taking your medicine and knocking it sideways to the fairway where you'll have a clean shot.\n\nthat's right. it's about risk and reward.\n\nin golf, i might hit the one-in-a-million shot and get through those 15 trees and land on the green. whereas if i chip out to the fairway, i'm definitely not going make it to the green, but i'm guaranteed to get out safely and maybe my third shot is on the green. in investing, it's the exact same thing. if you want to get the potential reward of a portfolio that's 100% invested in stocks and you're willing to take that risk, fine.\n\nin both, you have to sit there and decide: what's my worst outcome? for me, i'm always looking for a safe bailout position, where i might not be on the green, but at least i'm not in the pond.\n\nthat's called having a good golf iq. it's the same thing when you're investing. how many people by accident just developed a portfolio? in some cases, believe it or not, it works out ok. it's like hitting that three-wood and you skull it and somehow it gets to the green.\n\nwhat's referred to as 'a good miss.'\n\na good miss! i got to the green because of some element of luck. same thing with those portfolios. but most people don't want to depend on luck — they want to have a strategy.\n\nyou also write about something that's very important in both disciplines: 'know when to lay up.'\n\nwithout a doubt! a distance of 200 yards to the green is not the same every single time. if i have 200 yards right up the middle with no distraction, no hazard, i'm going for it. if i have 200 yards with sand on the left or right, a hazard in the middle — wow, now i have to think. i have to hit the perfect shot to get there.\n\nin the market we have now, where [indicators seem] to be green every day, i have people telling me, 'we should be more aggressive.' i'm saying, 'more aggressive? the market's at its height and i'm not sure what it's going to do. why don't we take it slow?'\n\ni'm like a caddie saying, 'do you really want to try to get over the water? and if you do want to give it a shot, you have to gauge the consequence if you miss.'\n\nyou talk about the importance of remaining flexible. it changes a lot as we get older.\n\nthat's why god invented advil! mental flexibility and emotional flexibility are critical.\n\none difference is, in finance, you don't get mulligans — the do-overs where you can decide not to use your bad first shot.\n\nin financial planning, you kind of do get mulligans. if you have five investments and one of them does badly, you have the four others that may have done just as well or better. so you do have the chance to temper the sting of that loss.\n\nit's like being on the tee box and choosing to mark on the scorecard only the best of your five tee shots.\n\nyou got it! and imagine if you only get one shot, where would you put your money? well, you don't only get one shot. you get multiple places to put money today.\n\nfinding places to put money is the easiest thing in the world. it's getting to that decision of where you'll put it that's difficult and that's what takes time.\n\nsame thing with golf equipment. today, callaway, titleist, ping — every year they want to sell you the new and improved: the big bertha. the bigger big bertha! there's always something out there you can purchase.\n\nso very often we feel that if we have the best equipment that will change our lives. very often that's not the case. same thing with investing. we feel that if we have that one stock, that will change our lives. but there's enough information that shows that it's not the one investment, it's the design of the portfolio that did it.\n\ndo you have one final piece of advice for all of us golfing investors?\n\nwhen people ask me to autograph their books, i write, 'true success is measured by family, friends and that occasional great round of golf.'\n\nwell, for me, two out of three is good…i haven't had that third one yet.\n\n[laughs] ok, i might change that to …family, friends and that occasional great shot.\n\nthat works!
investors have noticed that the stock market has gone through a radical change in the past few months.\n\nveteran investor mark d. cook, who pointed out red flags a year ago, feels vindicated. finally, stock prices confirmed what he saw in 2014: we're in a bear market and about to go over the cliff, he says. here is a chat i had with cook over the weekend.\n\nwhy do you still believe we're in a bear market?\n\nfirst, the oil and gas situation is a huge problem, and it will continue. we're not getting bounces. instead, oil investors just want to sell. the second problem, and it's just getting started, is china. china is like an athlete that twisted his ankle and needs time to heal. if the ankle doesn't heal, it will get worse, and that's what is happening right now.\n\nis there anything technical that you are looking at?\n\nyes. first, every rally in a bear market has no traction. in a bull market, rallies will hold for days or weeks. now we're getting sharp one-day wonders that fail. every hope is dashed. that is a strong characteristic of a bear market. second, the nyse tick is registering no institutional activity on the buy side. every rally is a chance for mutual funds to lighten positions. and this is only january. wait until people look at their january statements. many will be shocked.\n\nif this is a bear market, how will investors react in the months ahead?\n\nthere are four psychological stages that people go through during a bear market. right now, investors know the market is struggling but most believe it will come back. in fact, many see this as a buying opportunity. here are the four stages:\n\nstage 1: denial\n\nright now, we're in the denial stage. anyone who is bullish is too stubborn to change his or her view. many people have their head in the sand, and some may not even look at their january statements. many believe the market will come back. right now, many are still buying the dips, which does not work in a bear market. this is similar to what has happened to oil.\n\nstage 2: high anxiety\n\nin this stage, many investors are like a deer in the headlights. they are frozen and nervous but don't do anything. they are told by brokers and financial experts to stay calm and don't panic. we haven't reached this stage yet.\n\nstage 3: fear\n\nin this stage, the rampant bulls finally realize they are in trouble. if they have bought stocks on margin, they might be getting calls from their broker to add money to losing positions. in this stage, they are watching in fear as their portfolio burns. they reluctantly start to take action as fear increases. often they say to themselves, when my stock gets back to even, i will sell.\n\nstage 4: panic\n\nthis is what i call the uncle stage. this is when panicked investors throw in the towel and take action. they want to get out of the market while they still have something left. at this stage, there is huge downside volume and double-digit declines on the indexes. at the end of stage 4, many people vow to never buy stocks again. we are not even close to this stage yet. typically, we hit bottom when investors capitulate after losses of 20% to 50% in their stock portfolios.\n\nwhy did you think we were in a bear market a year ago?\n\nthe weakening internals told me we were in a bear market but prices hadn't confirmed it yet. it's like a vacant building with a gas leak. the longer the leak is undetected, the greater the explosion. if the market had corrected 18 months ago, the coming decline would not be as bad. unfortunately, central banks around the world interfered with the market and delayed the day of reckoning.\n\ncan the federal reserve do anything?\n\nthe fed is losing credibility quickly. they had their 15 minutes of fame and their days have passed. if they announce qe [quantitative easing], people will throw rotten tomatoes at them. the fed doesn't have many bullets left in its chamber. when they do shoot, it will be more like a bb gun when they really need a cannon.\n\nwhat should investors do?\n\nthere are three actions they can take but they probably won't take any of them.\n\n1. go to 100% cash. their portfolios are already on fire so they need to go out and save it. this is the simplest solution in a bear market. don't forget that bear markets typically last from 12 to 36 months, so there is still time to minimize damage. as one character in the movie margin call said: if you are first out the door, it is not panicking.\n\n2. investors can play defense by hedging. this means buying a non-leveraged inverse etf to reduce pain in case the indexes plunge. you can also buy put options to hedge against individual stocks.\n\n3. for a small minority, they can learn how to trade in a bear environment. this includes shorting strategies such as buying inverse etfs and put options. bear markets are usually the most lucrative environments for active traders.\n\nany final comments?\n\nbear markets are nothing like bull markets. the buy-on-the-dip strategy that worked in a bull market does not work in bear markets. bull markets are slow-moving and methodical, and you may get many days in a row that are green. bear markets, however, are violent and volatile. you can short-sell almost every rally. rallies are short-lived while the declines last longer. in a bear market, nearly every buy-on-the-dip purchase turns

after months of waiting for the 10-year treasury yield to break above the 1% level, market participants now say the runoff elections for the u.s> senate on tuesday could offer the decisive impetus for a breakthrough.\n\nthe distribution of covid-19 vaccines and accompanying hopes of a return to economic normality so far have not done much to lift treasury yields, as bond buying by the federal reserve has been more than able to offset any bearish pressure associated with recovering economic growth and rising inflation expectations.\n\nbut analysts say the chance for a more aggressive fiscal policy under a democratic-controlled senate, based on the possible outcome of tuesday's vote, could send long-term bond yields higher.\n\nthat's a growing possibility, with polls showing democratic candidates, jon ossoff and rev. raphael warnock, in a tight race with their republican incumbents.\n\nnominal yields on the other hand have flatlined since early december, in a sign that investors believe that the fed will continue to suppress yields even as inflation expectations normalise, said padhraic garvey, regional head of research for ing in the americas. additional fiscal thrust to the economy could change that dynamic however.\n\nsee: here's why the georgia runoff elections for the u.s. senate could turn into a 'big deal' for markets\n\nthe 10-year treasury note yield tmubmusd10y, 1.664% was at 0.94% on tuesday, a few basis points away from its december high of 0.986%. a push beyond that milestone would set the benchmark note yield on track towards the 1% level that has contained the maturity since march.\n\neven as yield have remain capped, inflation expectations, as measured by inflation breakeven levels, have steadily climbed, pushing through the key 2% threshold for the first time since november 2018.\n\nanalysts say the divergence between rising inflation forecasts and the muddled trading in government bonds has been underpinned by the possibility the fed could still tweak its asset purchases to keep longer-dated rates anchored.\n\nit's why ian lyngen of bmo capital markets estimates a democratic victory over both senate seats may not do much to benefit the bond bears, only pushing the 10-year yield up by around 10 to 15 basis points.\n\nthat would be enough to push the benchmark rate above 1% but not enough to spark the full-blown bond-market selloff that many feared could occur in 2021.
back in may, michael binger, a senior portfolio manager with gradient investments llc, told marketwatch about six of his favorite dividend stocks at that time.\n\nbinger's outlook has changed a bit since then, and he thinks dividend stocks as a group are looking pricey. he's now looking beyond the u.s. for attractively valued dividend stocks.\n\nthe change comes after a successful 2016, a year in which value stocks have beaten growth, particularly after the election. here's how his gradient 50 strategy of 50 stocks has performed, according to information verified by orion advisor services:\n\ntotal return - 2016 avg. return -3 years avg. return - 5 years avg. return - since strategy inception, june 1, 2009 gradient 50 strategy 20.4% 8.8% 12.8% 15.0% s&p 500 12.0% 8.9% 14.7% 14.9%\n\nin this table, total return for the gradient 50 strategy includes cash dividends, while total returns for the index include the reinvestment of dividends. binger said his firm's clients tend to be at or near retirement age, so many take their dividends in cash to generate income. as cash from dividends builds up in the fund, it is reinvested in stocks, just not automatically in the same ones that are paying the dividends.\n\ngradient investments is a registered investment adviser based in arden hills, minn., with about $1.3 billion in assets under management for affiliated advisers. the gradient 50 strategy, one of several strategies binger and his colleagues pursue, seeks to outperform the benchmark s&p 500 spx, -1.48% by selecting stocks of what they consider high quality u.s. companies, and where dividend yields exceed that of the index. they will sell stocks that have become expensive relative to earnings or cash flow and seek opportunities to buy shares of companies that have temporarily fallen out of favor with the market.\n\nthe aggregate dividend yield for the s&p 500 is 2.07%, according to factset. gradient generally selects stocks with yields of at least 2.5% for the gradient 50 strategy, and the portfolio's dividend yield now is roughly 3.5%. the 50 stocks held within that portfolio are rebalanced each quarter, so each stock tends to amount to about 2% of the assets.\n\nmichael binger, senior portfolio manager for gradient investments, llc. gradient investments, llc\n\nthis chart shows how high the s&p 500 is trading relative to the past 12 months' earnings. by this measure, the index hasn't traded this high since january 2004:\n\nthe s&p 500 hasn't been this high, measured against the past 12 months' earnings, in 13 years. factset\n\nasked if there were alarming signs for stock valuations, binger replied: sure there are. at the current time, i would say the dividend-paying group, as a whole, is subjectively overvalued. if i have a group of 50 dividend paying stocks and the portfolio was up 20% while the market was up 12% [in 2016], what does that tell you?\n\nthis is why binger said it was a pefect time for his firm to roll out a new strategy, which it calls the gradient 40 international. the portfolio includes 40 stocks, and binger said each needs to be a blue-chip company domiciled outside the u.s. they also need to be publicly traded in the u.s., or have american depositary receipts (adrs) traded on u.s. exchanges.\n\nrather than shifting the holdings of the domestic g50 strategy, binger said his firm was suggesting that affiliated advisers with clients worried about u.s. stock valuations reduce exposure to the g50 and consider investing in the g40-i, because he believes global markets are a little bit cheaper than their u.s. counterparts.\n\nbinger named 10 stocks held in the new g40-i portfolio. here they are, sorted by dividend yield:\n\nrevisiting the g50\n\nwhen marketwatch spoke with binger in may, he had just sold the g50's holdings of at&t inc. t, -0.46% and verizon communications inc. vz, +1.00% . but as long-term interest rates shot up after donald trump's election in november, the share prices of both companies declined sufficiently for binger to buy them again.\n\nhe called the major telecom stocks a steal on dec. 5:\n\nand on jan. 11 he told marketwatch he would still buy them, even though they had risen since dec. 5.\n\nbinger saw another bargain in kohl's corp. kss, -1.44% , which sank 19% on jan. 5 as investors showed their ire over disappointing holiday sales.\n\nthe drop from $52 to $42 in one day looked like an opportunity for us, binger said, so we bought that position and exited another position, diebold nixdorf inc. dbd, -7.00%\n\nbinger said he remains very comfortable with kohl's because the retailer's free cash flow provides plenty of coverage for its dividend. according to factset, the company's free cash flow for the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 totaled $689 million, while dividends on common shares totaled $264 million. that's a dividend payout ratio of just 38%.\n\nthis makes me feel comfortable that the [4.85%] dividend yield isn't in any danger at all, binger said.
ahead of its annual meeting of world leaders, business honchos and celebrities, the world economic forum has laid out five of the biggest threats facing the planet in 2017.\n\nthe biggest threat according to the wef would come from the skies in the form of extreme weather events, at the top of its list, followed by large-scale involuntary migration, major natural disasters, large-scale terrorist attacks and a massive incident of data fraud/theft.
if you're a woman over 50 who, for decades, played by the career book rules, dutifully following a traditional course of college study and related industry jobs, pursuing promotions, raises and titles and still feel unfulfilled, it's time to create a new chapter in your career that will provide success and fulfillment. a career change may be just what you need and more possible than you think.\n\nas a women's career and leadership coach, i spend much of my time identifying the strengths and growth areas of ambitious and purpose-driven professionals of all ages. people are multifaceted, yet often find themselves in positions that represent a one-dimensional version of themselves which is severely limiting. the key is to align who you are with what you do.\n\nthere is strength in embracing everything that makes you unique. so, if you're ready to bring your authentic, whole self to work, here are four essential tips to get started:\n\n1. question your 'shoulds'\n\namong the biggest obstacle to people's ability to create a career they love is a preconceived notion of where they should be and what they should do. but success doesn't have to follow a scripted narrative that says college grads need to find a job that relates to their major and stay on a singular career path over their lifetime.\n\nwe can veer off that path at any time to explore our interests, passions and personalities, to create a career that truly fulfills us.\n\nthe key is to take an inventory and pay attention to how you feel (what fuels and drains you) so you can create a path that is aligned with who you are.\n\nstaying in a job because you think it's what you should be doing can come at a significant cost. the stress and energy of dedicating yourself to a company or role that isn't truly aligned with who you are at this moment in your life can compromise your physical, emotional and spiritual well-being.\n\nto take the leap, you need to fundamentally believe that it's never too late to transition into a career that aligns with who you are.\n\ndon't miss: older women will soon rule the world, mit professor says\n\ni often encourage clients who are thinking about making the transition to chat with others who have already done so. it provides a lot of reassurance to know that others, who did the seemingly impossible, are so much better for it on the other side.\n\nwhat to do in your 50s to build wealth for your retirement\n\n2. embody the totality of your experiences\n\nbefore i started my career and leadership-coaching firm, i was the head of global strategy & growth for facebook's creative shop. and, well before that, i began my career coding software for an it firm. in between, i had roles in change management, strategy, advertising, education and style blogging. from the outside looking in, it seemed unlikely that i would be able to transition from one industry to another.\n\nin fact, i'm often asked, how did you transition from consulting into advertising? or how did you transition from advertising into tech? i did it by transferring my skill sets from one role to the next, distinguishing myself as a blend of experiences, perspectives and approaches. as it turns out, i was a little of everything — something i never could have planned for.\n\nyou are the totality of your experiences, and the key to success and fulfillment in your career is taking everything you've learned over the course of your life and bringing it to your next role.\n\nin fact, when you're in your 50s, you're at a new professional peak, ripe with the experience and wisdom needed to fuel a successful career change. the key is to ensure that you're connecting the dots for your future employers so they understand how your skills, experiences and the lessons you've learned along the way are transferable.\n\nbut first, you have to be willing to take the leap.\n\nyou might like: what would you accomplish if you forgot you were over 50?\n\n3. unite your personal and professional self\n\nwhether you have a one-year vision or a lifetime career plan, it's not always clear how or where to start. as a coach, i work with clients to ensure that they have a career strategy in place — one that unites, rather than separates, their personal and professional self. clients define the developmental goals they would like to work toward. then, we create a customized, multi-tiered action plan to bridge the gap from where they are to where they want to be.\n\nensuring that your finances are stable is a must. i recommend my clients create a financial cushion for themselves before, during and after the transition.\n\nfor some, that might include a temporary side gig to generate incremental income. for others, that might mean setting a delayed exit date from their current position before making the move.\n\nalso read: how women can save more money for retirement\n\nwhen you have a vision, goals and an action plan tailored to who you are and what you want, you'll be able to focus each day on making progress toward creating a career that is meaningful and motivating for you.\n\n4. accept that your career is beautifully messy\n\nas you think about a transition, remember that careers are rarely linear. you can find passion in your work, whatever that may be, but it requires peeling back layers to understand who you are and what makes you tick.\n\nyes, embracing your whole, authentic self and accepting that your career is beautifully messy will make you feel vulnerable. but i promise you this: it will be an experience worth working for.
christmas is the great leveler for britain's big four supermarket chains.\n\nthe grocery giants update on trading for a similar basket of products, over a similar period in time, providing a perfect snapshot for investors seeking to dodge a ftse 100 dog or spot a stock market star.\n\non wednesday, the uk's second-largest food chain, sainsbury's sbry, +2.93% , posted a worse-than-expected fall in christmas sales, a day after smaller rival morrisons mrw, +2.71% also disappointed.\n\ntesco tsco, +1.80% , the biggest of the four, updates on thursday and walmart-owned asda, which is merging with sainsbury's, will wait until next month to provide details in its quarterly update.\n\nit has been a tough 12-months for retailers in both food and clothing. they have faced a cocktail of changing consumer habits, millennials' aversion to shopping and big brexit clouds.\n\nlast year, privately-owned department-store group house of fraser collapsed into administration before being rescued. at toys r us and electronics retailer maplin, the shutters came down for good.\n\nspending on clothing, electronics and gifts is very much discretionary when the going gets tough. but it is a different story for the grocers, which fare better because everyone needs to eat.\n\nread:sainsbury sales fall on weakness in nonfood unit\n\nthe latest grocery market share figures from kantar worldpanel, published on tuesday for the 12 weeks to dec. 30, 2018, show consumers still spent an extra £450m on groceries compared with the same period a year prior.\n\nso what's behind the disappointing updates from morrisons and sainsbury's?\n\non tuesday, morrisons said underlying sales for its grocery and wholesale business, excluding fuel, rose 3.6% in the nine weeks to jan. 6 — below average forecasts of 4.1% and the 5.6% sales growth seen in the previous quarter. the shares fell as much as 4.8% at one point yesterday.\n\nthis was despite sales at its core supermarket business rising 0.6%, which was ahead of forecasts of 0.5%.\n\nsainsbury's like-for-like sales, excluding fuel, fell 1.1% in the 15 weeks to jan. 5 — well below the 0.2% fall forecast by analysts. in the previous quarter, sales had risen 1%.\n\nthere was a 0.4% rise in grocery sales offset by a 2.3% fall in general merchandise (clothing, toys and electrical goods). around three years ago, sainsbury's snapped up argos owner home retail group and has been busy cutting costs and integrating the business.\n\nsome analysts believe this has caused two problems — a distraction among management and issues with poor stock availability. the company denies both.\n\nread:tesco's new discount chain will rival aldi, lidl\n\nanalysts say cost-cutting, which saw the removal of a tier of middle managers with expertise ensuring shelves were kept replenished, was behind availability issues.\n\nclive black, an analyst at broker shore capital, wrote in a note on wednesday: we have noticed that sainsbury's had poor availability and wider store standards for sometime now, and we are not alone, in our view.\n\nsuch a relatively weak offer is concerning to us as sainsbury's shoppers tend to be that little bit wealthy and arguably more discerning about standards. accordingly, we continue to wonder, we may be wrong, if sainsbury's changes to its labor process hasn't delivered all that was desired and we worry about its absolute and relative performance.\n\nwe also posit that sainsbury's may be erroneously cutting itself to a profit outcome, albeit we know messrs. coupe [chief executive] and o'byrne [finance director] would robustly resist such a claim.\n\nmike coupe said on wednesday: there has been a general sort of down trading, so people have been very, very careful in the way that they spent their money.\n\nwe can see that reflected in our grocery business where in effect we saw people down trading and being more careful in the items they bought that meant the average item price was lower than we would have expected.\n\nso there is definitely caution out there, and of course as we go through the next period of uncertainty, i suspect that will continue to be reflected in the way that customers behave.\n\nmorrisons has highlighted a change in consumer behavior in november, amid uncertainty over britain leaving the eu. ceo david potts said: going into november there was just a sense that customers were a bit more cautious.\n\nit has a rapidly expanding wholesale business, supplying products to amazon amzn, +0.33% and mccoll's retail group and it was disappointment in this division, which weighed on the shares tuesday.\n\nthe firm has been going through a transformation program under potts after trouble integrating rival safeway in 2003, which meant it was late launching convenience stores and online. it also failed to modernize, having outdated systems that meant, until recently, its supermarkets had to order stock by pen and paper.\n\nread:uk supermarkets

has undergone a marked recovery under ceo dave lewis, its update on thursday is likely to show it has not been immune to these challenges.\n\ntesco, along with its rivals, has seen an impact from shoppers heading to budget chains aldi and lidl, which offer less selection but cheaper products.\n\nconsultancy kantar worldpanel said two-thirds of all british households shopped at either aldi or lidl over the 12 weeks to dec. 30, resulting in their highest-ever combined christmas market share of 12.8%.\n\nthey have also hurt asda, which historically set itself apart on price and little else.\n\nshoppers have also changed the way they buy their groceries, replacing one weekly shop with multiple visits to smaller convenience stores to save waste and money.\n\nthis has benefited chains such as the co-op, which has a skew to smaller local shops and has hurt asda, which mainly has larger warehouse-style stores.
the securities and exchange commission's go-to-group of industry professionals on the stock market will meet all day on tuesday to discuss a single day of trading last summer that raised questions over the operation of exchange-traded funds and equities more generally .\n\nthe sec's equity market structure advisory committee, made up of regulators, academics and representatives of fund managers, brokers and stock exchanges, will meet all day on feb. 2 to discuss the events of aug. 24 and certain issues affecting customers in the current equity market structure.\n\non aug. 24, u.s. stocks and equity-related futures markets experienced extraordinary volume and significant price volatility, particularly at the 9:30 a.m. start of regular trading hours. there were big gaps between the value of underlying indexes and the exchange-traded funds that track them, and many of the largest-cap stocks experienced brief swoons that were 10% or more below their previous close.\n\nit's not the first time the sec looked into that day.\n\non dec. 29 the sec's division of trading and markets issued a research note that explains what happened without drawing conclusions about why the volatility and pricing dislocations occurred or what should be done to prevent such occurrences in the future. the report does discuss the opening process at primary listing exchanges, the triggering of trading pauses and the effects of the market volatility on trading in exchange-traded products, or etps.\n\nthe day started on a bearish tilt — global asset manager blackrock, in an october research report, describes global market sentiment in late august weighing bearishly on stocks. even before the markets opened in the u.s. that day, global equity markets were down 3% to 5% and the e-mini s&p 500 future was limit down 5% in pre-market trading. investors responded to these global macro concerns with aggressive orders to sell, including four times the number of market orders observed on an average trading day, according to new york stock exchange data.\n\nsome big names like j.p. morgan chase jpm, +3.96% , ford motor co. f, +1.81% , and general electric ge, -0.92% experienced temporary price declines of more than 20%.\n\nmany new york stock exchange-listed stocks opened for trading later than 9:30 a.m. on the nyse even though they were traded at other exchanges and off-exchange venues before and after 9:30. until nyse-listed constituents of the s&p 500 index were opened on the nyse, the s&p 500 index still reflected nyse closing prices from august 21.\n\nthe index declined on the opening by 5.2% from the previous friday close, according to the sec report. it remained substantially higher than the prices of the spdr s&p 500 etf trust spy, -0.23% which declined 7.8%. the most actively traded equity-related futures contract, the e-mini s&p 500, declined to its limit down price of 5% below the previous trading day's closing price and was paused for trading from 9:25 to 9:30, the sec report said.\n\nthe s&p 500 index is a reference point used by sec's rules to determine whether market-wide circuit breakers are triggered. because it did not decline by 7%, the level required to trigger market-wide circuit breakers, there was no 15-minute trading pause.\n\nin a note to clients, themis trading said they have raised this issue consistently over the past few years and even published a paper titled phantom indexes where they called on the index providers to change their calculation methodology. in october s&p's dow jones equity indices team issued a consultation to the investment community, asking them to comment on whether it should change its methodology for calculating the index during market disruptions. a decision has not yet been made.\n\nthe disconnect between halts on underlying stocks within indices and the need to price the index resulted in the pricing volatility seen in exchange-traded products. in the october report blackrock told clients that a combination of factors impacted market makers, on aug. 24. seeing an absence of quotations or price indications on many etp portfolio holdings, unable to effectively hedge due to [limit-up, limit-down] halts, and lacking clarity regarding erroneous trades, market makers were temporarily unable to participate in the 'arbitrage mechanism' to align prices properly for a number of etps.\n\nthe limit-up, limit-down issues on august 24 were centered at the nyse, according to the sec's report. more than half (51%) of nyse's 78 halts lasted more than 6 minutes, with one lasting over 18 minutes. there weren't as many or as long on the nasdaq ndaq, +1.17% , and bats only had three halts but one lasted 28 minutes.\n\na spokeswoman from the new york stock exchange did not respond to a request for comment.\n\njoe saluzzi of themis trading says he thinks too much emphasis is being placed on this particular quick fix. there's a mistaken consensus that tweaking [limit up, limit down] will solve all our problems. that's a smokescreen to avoid addressing tougher issues like market fragmentation. another issue that should be addressed is index pricing. the index providers continue to use only primary market data for their calculations when they should be using the consolidated tape.\n\nbloomberg reported that some of the world's largest issuers of etfs, including blackrock inc. blk, +1.06% , vanguard group inc. and state street corp. stt, +3.46% , have held talks with stock exchanges on the issues raised by the aug. 24 volatility.\n\nblackrock told its customers that market and stop-loss orders that demand liquidity at any price added to selling pressure and proved especially risky on the morning of aug. 24.\n\na stop order is an order to buy or sell a stock when it passes a certain price. it then becomes a market order, but it may or may not execute at exactly the stop price. if the order is good till canceled it remains open until an investor cancels it or a trade is executed. if a trader put in a market sell order on aug. 24 they may have been shocked to discover later that it sold down 10 or 20%.\n\nthe nyse has become the latest exchange, after bats and nasdaq, to announce plans to no longer accept stop orders and good-till-canceled orders, beginning feb. 26. from its statement: many retail investors use stop orders as a potential method of protection but don't fully understand the risk profile associated with the order type. we expect our elimination of stop orders will help raise awareness around the potential risks during volatile trading. some brokers may continue to take stop orders, but those will be executed by internalizers like citadel not at the major exchanges.
daniel packer, a 29-year-old data analyst at an online advertising agency in los angeles, knows more responsibilities will stack up as he hits the big 3-0 this summer, so he's been religiously stashing away money in his retirement accounts the last few years.\n\nretirement is a long ways away for him, he says — at least 30 years — but saving money early on means not worrying about putting away as much later down the road if he weren't able to do so. he's already seeing his strategy pay off, given he has a 1-year-old daughter and raising kids is expensive (try somewhere between $284,000 and $600,000). i'm glad i was able to take advantage of [saving] for the last nine years, he said.\n\nread: this is how your finances should look in your 20s\n\nread: this is how your finances should look in your 40s\n\nread: this is how your finances should look in your 50s\n\nread: this is how your finances should look in your 60s\n\nthirtieth birthdays are an excellent time to take stock of your future funds, especially as short-term financial obligations solidify, such as continuing to pay off the last of student loans, living on your own (or maybe starting a potentially three-decade stretch of mortgage payments) and raising children. millennials, the generation 20s to mid-30-year-olds fit into, have delayed marriage and home ownership from happening in their 20s (as was the norm decades ago). now 57% of today's 30- year-olds are or have been married, 47% are living with a child and a third are homeowners, according to the united states census bureau.\n\nsee:how our 'everyone gets a trophy' culture can lead to financial ruin for millennials\n\nhere's all you need to do in your 30s for a great financial future\n\nby 30, you should have a decent chunk of change saved for your future self, experts say — in fact, ideally your account would look like a year's worth of salary, according to boston-based investment firm fidelity investments, so if you make $50,000 a year, you'd have $50,000 saved already. by 35, you should have twice your salary, the firm said. the median retirement savings for a worker in their 30s was $45,000, according to transamerica center for retirement studies, which looked at workers' retirement accounts including employer-sponsored accounts and individual retirement accounts.\n\nthe problem? not everyone is saving — or can save — that much toward retirement. either they're living paycheck to paycheck, don't know about the accounts available to them or simply aren't thinking about the amount of money they'll need in their futures. only a third of americans are saving money in an employer-sponsored or tax-deferred retirement account, according to the u.s. census bureau.\n\ntoday's 30 year olds (and the soon-to-be 30 year olds) are plagued with crippling student debt, which just hit a record $1.31 trillion and affects millennials more than any generation before them. on top of that, some millennials are skipping starter homes altogether for a bigger home and, as nice as that is, home prices are rising as are mortgage rates. some may also be splurging for a wedding — scary fact: the average american wedding costs about $35,000. the last thing someone in their 30s should do, though, is leave retirement to the wayside.\n\nsee also:how we got to $1 trillion in debt: an illustrated history of student loans in america\n\nit's important to be saving for retirement while doing all these things at the same time, said alexander rupert, assistant portfolio manager at laurel tree advisors in cleveland, ohio. retirement savings should be growth-oriented for someone in their 30s, he said, which means they should be stashing money away whatever they can and considering a high risk tolerance. market ups and downs will affect the portfolio, but young investors should remember their money (and they) are in it for the long haul, rupert said.\n\nand if you're not investing in an employer-sponsored account (after all, only 14% of employers offer such plans, according to the u.s. census bureau) consider a roth ira, which more forgivingly allows investors to use those assets for an emergency should a situation arise. as opposed to other accounts, like a 401(k) plan, that place penalties on individuals who withdraw money from these accounts, investors can take money out of a roth ira penalty-free so long as they only take out the money they invested, and not the investment earnings of those assets. some 30 year olds, like packer, have numerous accounts. packer and his wife, for instance, have been maxing out their 401(k) plans and roth iras for a few years.\n\nit will take a load off my shoulders later, packer said. setting ourselves up now will pay benefits in the future.\n\nwondering what your savings should look like during a major money milestone? send your questions to personal finance reporter alessandra malito.
it's a tough monday morning for chicago bears place kicker cody parkey — but at least he's being compensated for it.\n\nthe kicker missed a late 43-yard field goal that would have won sunday's wild-card-round game against the philadelphia eagles, ending his overachieving team's bid to advance in the playoffs and toward its first super bowl appearance since 2007. the missed field goal has already been called among [the] most brutal in nfl playoff history. the kick looked like a winner until its leftward drift resulted in its hitting the upright, then the crossbar, drawing gasps from the crowd.\n\nparkey, 26 and in his first season with chicago, told reporters after the game: it's one of the worst feelings in the world to let your team down, so i feel terrible. i'm going to continue to put things in perspective and just put my best foot forward, and sleep at night knowing i did everything in my power. speaking of his teammates, he added, every single one of them said they've got my back and love me.\n\ndon't miss: 'venmo us!' why more charities may soon be asking for your money with this app\n\neagles fans, however, were elated that he'd missed — and appreciative. immediately after the game they began rewarding (or, you might say, taunting) parkey by sending him money via the payment app venmo. one dollar per point you left on the board, wrote one eagles fan in a note accompanying a payment to parkey. thank you for sucking! go birds! wrote another.\n\nother messages consisted entirely of eagle and football emoji. the payment app does not show payment amounts, only that a payment was made. notes describing payments can be seen by anyone using the app unless users make them private.\n\nparkey's profile was public but has since been made private, and venmo does not show the total number of payments made for a particular reason, even if the person in question has privacy settings on public.\n\nsavvy venmo users were quick to cash in on the kicker's misfortune. one user name was opportunistically changed to cody parkey pleasehelpmepayforschool and another became not cody parkey but need beer money. by monday morning, dozens of fake cody parkeys had flooded the platform.\n\nthe phenomenon underscores the facts that venmo transactions are entirely public unless users change their privacy settings and that users can easily look up anyone on the platform and see their payment history.\n\nin fact, many people use the app to keep tabs on exes or on public figures. it's another reminder of the importance of making your venmo account private — not least if you're an nfl kicker. the platform makes a massive amount of data about users' lives public by default, a report released in july found.\n\nmeanwhile, even bears fans got busy directing funds to another cause: getting rid of parkey. bears fans set up a gofundme page (which is now inactive) with the goal of buying out the remainder of parkey's reported four-year, $15 million contract.\n\nalso see:is my golfing buddy the cheapest guy in america? he asked me to venmo him $1.50\n\nthe platform was previously investigated by the federal trade commission for misleading users about the fact that they needed to change two separate privacy settings to make their transactions completely private. the company reached a settlement with the ftc.\n\nas the backlash against venmo's privacy policy continues, the company has added push notifications to alert users as to how they can make certain transactions private. venmo did not immediately respond to a marketwatch request for comment but has said in the past that it added privacy options in response to the investigation.\n\nto make your venmo account private, go to settings and click privacy. under the privacy setting, users can select private as a default privacy setting for all future payments. there is an option to make all past transactions private as well, which you should probably do — unless you're trying to get paid for a missed field goal.
with the new year here and a democratic-controlled senate looking increasingly likely after the runoff senate elections in georgia, president-elect joe biden's tax plans are unlikely to suffer from any lack of bipartisan support.\n\naccording to the committee for a responsible federal budget, an independent, non-profit, bipartisan public-policy organization based in washington, d.c. that examines federal budget and fiscal issues, biden's tax plan would raise $3.35 trillion to $3.67 trillion over a decade if enacted in full starting next year, or 1.3% to 1.4% of gross domestic product.\n\nthe biden tax plan is highly progressive, increasing taxes for the top 1% of earners by 13% to 18% of after-tax income, while indirectly increasing taxes for most other groups by 0.2% to 0.6%, the committee said, adding, the ultimate fiscal, economic, and distributional impact of president-elect biden's tax policies will depend on how newly raised revenue is spent or allocated, it added.\n\nmajor proposals by the biden campaign would raise $1.6 trillion to $1.9 trillion over a decade from corporations, $1 trillion to $1.2 trillion from high earners through the income tax, and $800 billion to $1 trillion from social security payroll taxes on high-wage earners. biden also supports a fee on banks, which we believe will raise $100 billion, tax credits for renters and first-time homebuyers that we estimate will cost $300 billion, and an increase of the child and dependent care tax credit, which we estimate will cost $100 billion.\n\nwhile on the campaign trail, biden told abc news: i will raise taxes for anybody making over $400,000. the very wealthy should pay a fair share. corporations should pay a fair share. the fact is there are corporations making close to a trillion dollars that pay no tax at all.\n\nhe told the network that his administration would not raise taxes on 90% of the businesses out there are mom and pop businesses that employ less than 50 people. he said the coronavirus pandemic has taken a toll on these businesses. we have to provide them with the ability to reopen. we have to provide more help for them, not less help, he added.\n\nwith that in mind, it's time to consider moves that will lower your 2020 tax bill, and hopefully position you for tax savings in future years too.\n\nfederal tax outlook for 2021-2022\n\ngame the standard deduction\n\nthe tax cuts and jobs act (tcja) almost doubled the standard deduction amounts. for 2020, the basic standard deduction allowances are:\n\n* $12,400 if you are single or use married filing separate status.\n\n* $24,800 if you and your spouse file jointly.\n\n* $18,650 if you are a head of household.\n\n* slightly higher standard deductions are allowed to those who are 65 or older or blind.\n\nhere's the plan. if your total itemizable deductions for 2020 will be close to your standard deduction amount, consider making enough additional expenditures for itemized deduction items before year-end to exceed the standard deduction. those prepayments will lower this year's tax bill. next year, your standard deduction might be a bit bigger thanks to an inflation adjustment, and you can claim it then. or it could be smaller, if major tax-increase legislation passes, which i think is unlikely.\n\n* the easiest deductible expense to prepay is included in the house payment due on january 1. accelerating that payment into this year will give you 13 months' worth of itemized home mortgage interest deductions in 2020. although the tcja put new limits on these deductions, you're probably unaffected. but ask your tax adviser to be sure.\n\nnext up on the prepayment menu are state and local income and property taxes that are due early next year. prepaying those bills before year-end can decrease your 2020 federal income tax bill, because your itemized deductions total will be that much higher. however, the tcja decreased the maximum amount you can deduct for state and local taxes to $10,000 or $5,000 if you use married filing separate status. so, beware of that limitation.\n\nwarning: the state and local tax prepayment drill can be a bad idea if you will owe the alternative minimum tax (amt) for this year. that's because write-offs for state and local income and property taxes are completely disallowed under the amt rules. therefore, prepaying those expenses may do little or no tax-saving good if you will be in the amt zone. thankfully, changes included in the tcja took millions of taxpayers out of amt danger, but not everybody. ask your tax adviser if you're in the clear for this year or not.\n\n* consider making bigger charitable donations this year and smaller donations next year to compensate (more about charitable donations later). that could cause your itemized deductions to exceed your standard deduction this year.\n\n* finally, consider accelerating elective medical procedures, dental work, and expenditures for vision care. for 2020, you can deduct medical expenses to the extent they exceed 7.5% of your adjusted gross income (agi), assuming you itemize. next year, the deduction threshold is scheduled to rise to 10% of agi, but i doubt congress will allow that to happen.\n\nsee also: 6 tax moves to consider before the end of the year — from roth ira conversions to prepaying college tuition\n\ncarefully manage gains and losses in taxable investment accounts\n\nif you hold investments in taxable brokerage firm accounts, consider the tax advantage of selling appreciated securities that have been held for over 12 months. the federal income tax rate on long-term capital gains recognized in 2020 is only 15% for most folks, although it can reach the maximum 20% rate at high income levels. the add-on 3.8% net investment income tax (niit) can also bite at high income levels. so, the true maximum rate for high-income individuals is 23.8%: the advertised 20% top rate plus 3.8% for the unadvertised niit.\n\nto the extent you have capital losses this year or capital loss carryovers from earlier years, selling winners by year-end will not result in any tax hit. in particular, sheltering net short-term capital gains with capital losses is a tax-smart move because net short-terms gains will otherwise be taxed at your higher ordinary income rate of up to 37%, plus another 3.8% if the niit bites. ouch.\n\nwhat if you have some loser investments that you would like to unload? biting the bullet and taking the resulting capital losses this year would shelter capital gains, including high-taxed short-term gains, from other sales this year.\n\nif selling some losers would cause your 2020 capital losses to exceed your 2020 capital gains, the result would be a net capital loss for the year. no problem. that net capital loss can be used to shelter up to $3,000 of 2020 income from salaries, bonuses, self-employment income, interest income, royalties, and whatever else ($1,500 if you use married filing separate status). any excess net capital loss is carried forward to next year and beyond.\n\nin fact, having a capital loss carryover could turn out to be a pretty good deal. the carryover can be used to shelter both short-term gains and long-term gains recognized next year and beyond. this can give you extra investing flexibility in those years, because you won't have to hold appreciated securities for over a year to get a lower tax rate. you'll pay 0% to the extent you can shelter gains with your loss carryover. if there are future tax rate increases (which i think are unlikely through at least 2022), capital loss carryovers into future years could turn out to be really valuable.\n\npresident-elect biden's major tax proposals\n\n1. higher maximum rate\n\nthe pre-election biden tax plan would raise the top individual federal income rate on ordinary income and net short-term capital gains back to 39.6%, the top rate that was in effect before the tax cuts and jobs act (tcja) lowered it to 37% for 2018-2025. biden also said he would generally raise taxes on folks with incomes above $400,000 without supplying specifics.\n\n2. itemized deductions\n\nbiden has said he would limit the tax benefit of itemized deductions to 28% for upper-income individuals. in other words, each dollar of allowable itemized deductions could not lower your federal income tax bill by more than 28 cents, even if you are in the proposed 39.6% maximum tax bracket.\n\nfor upper-income individuals, biden would reinstate the pre-tcja rule that reduces total allowable itemized deductions above the applicable income threshold. allowable deductions are reduced by 3 cents for every dollar of income above the threshold.\n\nbiden would eliminate the tcja's $10,000 cap on itemized deductions for state and local taxes.\n\n3. higher maximum rate on long-term capital gains\n\nupper-income individuals would face higher capital gains taxes under the biden plan. under current law, the maximum effective federal income tax rate on net long-term capital gains and qualified dividends recognized by individual taxpayers is 23.8%, as explained in the main body of this column. under the biden plan, net long-term gains (and presumably dividends) collected by those with incomes above $1 million would be taxed at the same 39.6% maximum rate that is proposed for ordinary income and net short-term capital gains. with the 3.8% niit add-on, the maximum effective rate on net long-term gains would 43.4% (39.6% plus 3.8%). that would be almost double the current maximum effective rate of only 23.8%.\n\n4. higher social security taxes for upper-income individuals\n\nunder current law, the 12.4% social security tax hits the first $137,700 of 2020 wages or net self-employment income. employees pay 6.2% via withholding from paychecks, and employers pay the remaining 6.2%. self-employed individuals pay the entire 12.4% out of their own pockets via the self-employment (se) tax. for 2020, the 12.4% social security tax cuts out once 2020 wages or net se income exceed the $137,700 ceiling. for 2021 and beyond, the social security tax ceiling will be adjusted annually to account for inflation. as things currently stand, the 2021 ceiling will rise to $142,800.\n\nthe biden tax plan would restart the 12.4% social security tax on wages and net se income above $400,000. this is the so-called donut hole approach to increasing the social security tax. over the years, the donut hole would gradually close as the lower edge of the hole is adjusted upward for inflation while the $400,000 upper edge of the hole remains static.\n\n5. elimination of basis step-up for inherited assets\n\nunder current law, the federal income tax basis of an inherited capital-gain asset is stepped up fair market value as of the decedent's date of death. so, if heirs sell inherited capital-gain assets, they only owe federal capital gains tax on the post-death appreciation, if any. this provision can be a huge tax-saver for greatly-appreciated inherited assets — such as personal residences that were acquired many years ago for next to nothing and are now worth millions. the biden plan would eliminate this tax-saving provision.\n\n6. elimination of real-estate tax breaks\n\nthe biden tax plan would: (1) eliminate the $25,000 exemption from the passive loss rules for rental real estate losses incurred by middle-income individuals, (2) eliminate section 1031 like-kind exchanges that allow deferral of capital gains taxes on swaps of appreciated real property, (3) eliminate rules that allow faster depreciation write-offs for certain real property, and (4) eliminate qualified business income (qbi) deductions for profitable rental real estate activities.\n\n7. increased child- and dependent-care credits\n\nunder current law, parents can collect a credit of up to $2,000 for each under-age-13 qualifying child. this is a refundable credit, which means you don't have to have any federal income tax liability to collect the credit. in other words, the child credit is free money.\n\nunder current law, another credit of up to $2,100 is allowed to cover expenses to care for a qualifying dependent, including an eligible child, or up to $4,200 for expenses to care for two or more qualifying dependents. in most cases, however, an income limitation reduces the maximum allowable credit to $1,200 or $2,400 for two or more qualifying dependents.\n\nthe biden tax plan would increase the maximum refundable child credit to $4,000 for one qualifying child or $8,000 for two or more qualifying children. families making between $125,000 and $400,000 would receive reduced credits. apparently, the same rules would apply to an enhanced credit for expenses to care for qualifying dependents.\n\nbiden would also establish a new credit of up to $5,000 for informal caregivers.\n\n8. new credits for homebuyers and renters\n\nthe biden plan would create a new refundable tax credit of up to $15,000 for eligible first-time homebuyers. the credit could be collected when a home is purchased, rather than later at tax-return filing time. biden would also establish a new refundable tax credit for low-income renters. the credit would be intended to hold rent and utility payments to 30% of monthly income.\n\n9. 'green energy' tax changes\n\nbiden would reinstate or expand tax incentives intended to reduce carbon emissions — such as deductions for emission-reducing investments in residential and commercial buildings and restored credits for buying electric vehicles produced by manufacturers whose credits have been phased-out under current law. biden would also eliminate federal income tax deductions for oil and gas drilling costs and depletion.\n\n10. and finally…\n\none of the biggest changes in the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act (tcja) was the installation of a flat 21% corporate federal income tax rate for 2018 and beyond. before the tcja, the maximum effective rate for profitable corporations was 35%. the biden plan would increase the corporate tax rate to 28%. this change would raise an estimated $1.1 trillion or so over 10 years.\n\nthe biden plan would impose a new 15% minimum tax on corporations with at least $100 million in annual income that pay little or no federal income tax under the regular rules. an affected corporation would pay the greater of: (1) the regular federal income tax bill or (2) 15% of reported book net income. this new tax would raise an estimated $160 billion to $320 billion over 10 years.
abankrom, ghana — yaa amekudzi bounces along dirt roads in a sport-utility vehicle from one village to the next as part of a $1 billion scramble by the world's top chocolate makers to fix the industry's most vexing problem.\n\ndemand for chocolate is stronger than ever, especially now that more consumers in china and india are buying bars and bonbons long considered an unaffordable luxury. but cocoa production is down, including a steep slide last year in ghana, the second-largest cocoa-growing country. cocoa prices have jumped nearly 40% since the start of 2012.
netflix is a much-loved stock on wall street, and for good reason. it's one of the faang stocks that has captivated investors with its momentum — a leap of more than 1,400% since the beginning of 2013.\n\nbut netflix nflx, -3.75% isn't bulletproof, and 2018 may be the year this stock suffers some serious damage.\n\nsure, it has regularly obliterated the returns of the s&p 500 index spx, -1.48% as well as other large-cap tech stocks. and sure, investors who have naysaid the run because the stock is overvalued have been proven wrong time and again.\n\nbut a closer examination of netflix in 2018 reveals a much different company than just a few years ago. and worse, it shows netflix lacks the advantages of the other faang stocks: facebook fb, -1.90% , amazon.com amzn, -3.44% , apple aapl, -3.39% and google parent goog, -2.62% googl, -2.92% .\n\nit's indeed hard to argue against big tech right now, and i expect these dominant megacaps to keep thriving. but the reality is that netflix shouldn't be included in that group — and that poses a big risk to stockholders and wall street puts increasingly higher expectations.\n\nhere's why i see trouble for netflix's stock in 2018.\n\nnetflix is big, but not big enough\n\nfor starters, let's look at how the other faangs differ, and you'll quickly see why netflix faces threats that the others simply don't have to worry about.\n\n• each of these other faang megacaps are north of $500 billion in market value; netflix is still under $100 billion.\n\n­• the others each generate over $10 billion in net operating cash flow annually while netflix can't even break even.\n\n• the others have at least $25 billion in cash in the bank, while netflix had less than $2 billion as of last quarter.\n\ndisney to charge 'substantially' less than netflix for streaming\n\ni'm not saying netflix is some fledgling business doomed to fail. but if you think it has the same scale and security as these other companies, you're fooling yourself.\n\nfurthermore, the very nature of the netflix model lacks the wide moat we see for the other faang stocks. as peter thiel famously said, competition is for losers in silicon valley — and netflix clearly has the shallowest moat among the faangs given that dozens of streaming video companies are seeing success.\n\njust a few instances of very real competition to netflix include amazon (which just won best comedy series at the golden globes), walt disney co. dis, -1.52% (as it launches a much-anticipated over-the-top service that mashes up its huge library of content) and international threats such as china's tencent tcehy, -0.12% 700, -2.03% (which has 43 million subscribers overseas and counting). each of these companies has both the know-how and the capital to pose serious headaches for netflix.\n\nreed hastings may like to joke that the biggest competitor to netflix is sleep, but investors better hope he's taking real-world risks to the business quite seriously.\n\nand investors better think twice before thinking netflix is a tech firm with deep enough pockets to weather setbacks the same as the big guys.\n\nlittle room for error\n\nof course, netflix has continued to grow even amid competition. higher-than-expected subscriber numbers reported in october were the best in its history and lifted the stock to a new high.\n\nthe bulls feel justified in this continued share appreciation. however, keep in mind that the current share price isn't a validation of october's growth but reflect expectations about expansion. and that leaves little room for error this year.\n\nafter all, the company doubled down on that trend with a forecast of 6.3 million additional subscribers in the fourth quarter on hopes that second seasons of stranger things and the crown brought in move viewers. but it better have similarly enticing offerings in 2018 to keep that train running.\n\nnetflix is trying to protect its margins with a $1 monthly price increase to $10.99 for over 50 million u.s. subscribers at the end of 2017. the company has made clear that the move is not the last, either, as it needs more cash for more programming spend.\n\nread:which technology in netflix's black mirror will change our lives first?\n\nit's worth wondering how many price increases the company can get away with, particularly in light of competing services. but it simply has to charge more to offset content costs as well as international expansion despite a lack of profitability abroad.\n\nthe hope is that by reaching scale the company will eventually see a return on its investment, in typical tech-stock style. but wall street will eventually expect it to deliver.\n\nthere are a lot of pieces to that puzzle. and while netflix delivered in third-quarter numbers back in october, investors don't award points for past performance.\n\nany earnings miss on any of these fronts in 2018 will be greeted with some serious backlash.\n\nnetflix is more under armour than amazon\n\nnow, let's talk about the boogeyman of valuation — a sticky subject with stocks like netflix, but one worth addressing.\n\nright now, the stock has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 100 and a trailing price-to-earnings of about 200. for the record, i don't think a valuation reading this high is categorically a bad thing. but i do think it needs to be justified — and in the case of netflix, it isn't.\n\nbetween the amazing run for quasi-nonprofit amazon and the general uptick in valuations across the entire market over the last several years, it's easy to just shrug and say a high p/e doesn't mean what it used to.\n\nbut there are plenty instances when fast-growing companies imploded after being bid up too far. and one of the most telling examples for netflix investors, i think, is the recent turmoil at under armour ua, +0.88% .\n\nthat stock increased roughly 10-fold from 2009 through 2015 as investors kept bidding the stock higher. forward price-to-earnings ratios regularly topping 50 and trailing ratios hovering around 100 at times.\n\nat least they were until the momentum slowed. and after under armour reported its first-ever sales drop a few months ago, the stock hit a low of under $12 — a fraction of its highs above $100 a share.\n\nfinding the perfect product to sell on amazon\n\nlook, amazon is allowed to trade for a nosebleed price-to-earnings ratio and operate at razor-thin margins because its scale is simply staggering and it's nigh impossible for any competitor to knock it off its perch. it makes $40 billion in revenue each quarter — 10 times what netflix does — and has grown aggressively into different areas via acquisitions like audible audiobooks and zappos shoes, or product launches like its alexa voice assistant.\n\nbut under armour was just an apparel company. it had a good brand and a good record, yes, and was able to see organic growth for quite a while.\n\nultimately, when changes in competition and consumer taste caused headwinds, there wasn't a new growth path to fall back on… and things fell apart.\n\nsound familiar?\n\ni'm not saying netflix will necessarily tank in two weeks after earnings. and i'm not saying investors should prep for a 90% peak-to-trough drop in 2018 as subscribers leave in droves.\n\nbut history has given us plenty of examples where a stock faces incredible expectations despite rather obvious outside risks. after all, under armour is still a much bigger company from a revenue perspective compared with where it was back in 2014; its top line has soared from just over $3 billion in fiscal 2014 to a projected $5 billion or so last year.\n\ntoo bad its stock crashed and burned despite this.\n\nkeep this in mind. netflix is more like under armor and less amazon, and wall street is sure to treat it the same way at the first clear signs of trouble.
it wasn't a great week for fourth-quarter earnings, as fewer companies beat expectations than usual, and the outlook for the first quarter fell deeper into the red, which would mark the first year-over-year decline in nearly three years, if it holds.\n\nmeanwhile, the percentage growth in the latest quarter is on track to be double-digits for a fifth-straight quarter, but was still about half the average of the first three quarters of the year.\n\nfactset publishes a blended growth percentage change for earnings per share for the s&p 500, representing a blend of year-over-year growth of actual results already reported and the average estimates of surveyed analysts of upcoming results.\n\nwith about 90% of the s&p 500 companies having reported results through friday, the overall blended eps growth consensus for the s&p 500 held steady on the week at 13.1%. that's still a marked improvement from an estimate of 10.6% growth at the start of earnings season, according to factset. see earnings watch.\n\nand since dec. 31, the increase in the blended growth estimate has been less than a third of the average increase seen over the last five years, according to factset senior earnings analyst john butters.\n\nthe current growth estimate compares with the average reported growth of 25.5% for the first three quarters of the year, and would represent the lowest expected growth since 7.3% in the third quarter of 2017. and for the first time since q3 2017, the growth isn't expected to be unanimous: the utilities sector is the only one of 11 s&p 500 sectors expected to report an earnings decline.\n\njonathan golub, chief u.s. equity strategist at credit suisse, estimated that more than half the earnings growth for the quarter is related to the tax reform implemented last year. the sectors benefiting most form tax reform are consumer discretionary and financials, golub said.\n\nthe overall expected growth is down from the 16.31% that was expected at the end of the third quarter, as concerns over the negative effects of a strengthening u.s. dollar, rising input costs and worries over a trade the trade war with china have pulled down analyst projections.\n\nthe s&p 500 index spx, -0.16% tumbled 14% during the fourth quarter, compared with a total 9% gain for the first three quarters of the year. it has advanced 7.5% since earnings season kicked off ahead of the jan. 14 open, through afternoon trade friday.\n\nso far, the beat rate has slightly below historical averages. butters said this week that 70% of companies reporting results have beat earnings expectations, just below the five-year average beat rate of 71%.\n\ndon't miss: citigroup kicks off fourth-quarter earnings season with a revenue miss.\n\nwhat might be of more concern to investors, is that the blended eps estimate for the first quarter continues to worsen, to a decline of 2.9% from a drop of 2.4% last week. that's a stark change from estimates for growth of 1.9% on jan. 11 and of 6.7% on sept. 30.\n\nif the decline holds, if would be the first since the second quarter of 2016, when eps fell 2.5% to mark a fifth-straight quarter of declines. through friday, seven of 11 sectors are now expected to suffer eps declines, with energy xle, -2.85% , information technology xlk, +0.75% and xlb, -0.83% expected to show the most weakness.\n\nalthough its common to see forward eps estimates fall as a quarter progresses, the cuts for the first quarter have been more pronounced than usual this year. butters said he during the past 20 quarters, the average decline in the

many are hoping that when donald trump—one of the most divisive u.s. presidents in the past century or more—leaves office, the historically elevated levels of partisanship in u.s. politics will at least begin to subside. but the opposite is vastly more likely.\n\n\n\n\n\nthere are short- and intermediate-run, as well as long-run reasons for this result that have little to do with the trump phenomenon. most important and immediately, there is a gigantic and increasingly unbridgeable divide on economic policy. and the outcome of this ongoing fight will have an enormous impact on the lives and livelihoods of most americans.\n\n\n\n\n\nfiscal policy lessons\n\nfirst and foremost, there is fiscal policy: the federal government's use of spending and taxation, in this case to facilitate an economic recovery. the republicans will try to block most helpful spending as much as possible, perhaps most important as a fundamental part of their political strategy.\n\n the republicans, not surprisingly, are fighting and will continue to fight against all of the structural reforms that would democratize this country. \n\nthey learned something from the great recession of 2008-09. they fought and reduced democratic stimulus plans—which were not big enough to begin with—as much as possible. the end result was unemployment in october 2010 was still at 9.4%; and millions more jobs were lacking if we look at the decline in employment since the recession, rather than the unemployment stats only.\n\nthis was a resounding success, from their point of view. in the november 2010 elections, republicans picked up 63 seats in the house, flipping control of the chamber, and gained six seats in the senate.\n\n\n\n\n\nthis strategy also coincides with a long-established tendency of republican party leadership, since the 1970s, to run up federal budget deficits when they are in power and then return to fiscal conservatism when the democrats take office. and finally, there are also some true believers in high republican places; mitch mcconnell used some of these in the senate to tell trump no can do just before the election, when trump leaned on republican senators to reach a deal with the democrats on the heroes 2.0 covid stimulus bill. trump backed off, perhaps calculating that a fight with senate republican leadership just before the elections was not worth the risk.\n\n\n\n\n\nsenate republicans also showed their determination to deprive the unemployed of benefits as far back as july, when they waited until just four days before unemployment benefits expired, before even responding to the democrats' proposal that would renew them.\n\n\n\n\n\ndetermining the level of employment\n\nfiscal and monetary policy are in general the main determinants of the level of employment and unemployment in our economy, as well as economic recovery at present.\n\nnearly four million people have now been without work for six months or longer.\n\nthis is of course vitally important when the economy is still down more than 9 million jobs since february. we have an estimated 26 million people who are going hungry in the united states, and some 7 million to 14 million at risk of eviction. and many of the jobs lost in the hardest-hit industries, such as retail and hospitality, will not be coming back. many workers will have to change occupations and some will be unemployed long-term; at present, the percent of unemployed who are long-term (more than six months out of work) is at 36.9%, up from 19.2% in february.\n\nnow read this: u.s. economy may have lost jobs in december for first time since earliest stages of coronavirus pandemic\n\n\n\n\n\nmuch more spending will be necessary just to pull the economy back to the levels of employment and unemployment that we had before the covid recession, and to help the millions who have been hurt by the pandemic. we still don't even know how much worse the pandemic itself will get before the effects of vaccination can seriously reduce infection rates.\n\nyet republicans have fought tenaciously—even contributing to their own loss of the presidency—in order to block desperately needed funding for health care and education to state governments.\n\nmore on the economy: former obama economist questions wisdom of stimulus checks\n\n\n\nit appears that the republican leadership's recent willingness to finally negotiate a covid relief package was driven by the risk that continued refusal could result in losing the jan. 5 runoff election for the two senators from georgia. this election will determine who controls the senate.\n\n\n\n\n\nthe tyranny of the minority\n\nall this is just a glimpse of what one part of one big policy difference—on fiscal policy—between the two parties in power would mean for the most of americans in the immediate and near future. over the longer run, it means much more. for it is now well-established that america is structurally set up for minority rule. and that minority is the republican party.\n\n\n\n\n\nin the past four decades these structures have grown in their political importance, size and scope. this applies to gerrymandering, as in the republicans winning a 33-seat majority in the house of representatives in 2012, with more than a million fewer votes than the democrats. it applies to the electoral college, with eight of the past 20 years under republican presidents (george w. bush and donald trump) who lost the popular vote; and to the senate, where about half the u.s. population elects 80% of the senate, while the other half gets 20%. and then there is voter suppression that targets minority and poorer voters, and disenfranchises them disproportionately.\n\n\n\n\n\nstructural reforms will be needed just to make the country into enough of a democracy so that we can actually vote for governments that might treat some of the pathologies that have been cultivated over the past few decades.\n\nthese include an explosion of inequality that has doubled the income share of the richest 1%, and the institutional racism that in 2020 set off the largest protests in u.s. history. not to mention the democratic governance we would need to move forward on the investments necessary to tackle the climate crisis before it is too late.\n\nthe republicans, not surprisingly, are fighting and will continue to fight against all of the structural reforms that would democratize this country, and that would thereby vastly reduce their chances of holding national power. together with the policy differences between the parties, this reality will remain the long-run, material basis for an increasing partisan divide, until these structural problems are resolved.\n\n\n\nmark weisbrot is co-director of the center for economic and policy research in washington, d.c. he is also the author of failed: what the 'experts' got wrong about the global economy (2015, oxford university press).\n\nsuggested reading:\n\n\n\n5 ways joe biden can accelerate america's shift to electric vehicles\n\npaycheck protection program has gone from business lifesaver to a mess\n\nfixing america's crumbling infrastructure might bridge the partisan divide this time—this is what's realistic under joe biden
the lean years are unlikely to be over for energy companies amid rising crude-oil inventories and global uncertainty, but the industry is expected to start spending again after years of belt-cinching.\n\nopec and other major players have agreed to cut production starting this month, but the market continues to be plagued by concerns that some oil-producing countries will not comply with the terms.\n\ncrude futures are off about 2% so far this year but gained 45% in 2016 after two years of double-digit losses that peaked with a 46% slide for 2014.\n\nsee also:13 'black swans' that could hit oil investors in 2017 (including elon musk)\n\nto face the precipitous price declines, companies have cut their expenses, laid off employees, and sold so-called non-core assets. spending ticked higher by the end of last year, and wall street expects that trend to continue.\n\nwith opec putting a floor on prices, exploration and production companies have greater confidence to drill and complete, although the early stages of the recovery will be uneven, analysts at barclays said in a recent note.\n\nnorth american e&p companies are seen as the biggest spenders this year, with barclays projecting a spending increase of 27% for the year. overall, spending is seen up 7% globally, barclays said, citing the results of a yearly survey it conducted with more than 200 companies worldwide. spending dropped 26% in 2015 and 23% last year.\n\ntillerson and putin: when the oilman met the strongman\n\ntwo major oil companies announced multibillion-dollar deals this week, aiming to beef up their holdings in west texas' permian basin, an area that has about as many rigs as the rest of the u.s. combined.\n\nrelated:the u.s. is increasingly looking at this texas region for oil\n\nnoble energy inc. us:nbl has agreed to buy clayton williams energy inc. for $2.7 billion, and exxon mobil corp. xom, -4.31% announced plans to buy family-owned companies also in the permian for $5.6 billion in exxon shares and up to $1 billion in additional cash payments.\n\ndespite relatively stable oil prices around $50 a barrel, however, one concern is higher inventories and little expectations of big draws, said stewart glickman, an analyst with cfra research.\n\nwith high inventories and stagnant prices, not every play out there is going to make sense, but we are starting to see some optimism, glickman said. he expects the uptick in capital spending to be in the high single digits.\n\nread more:oil slides as skepticism over opec output deal nags\n\nearnings are likely to come in a little higher this year, but no dramatic changes, he said.\n\nthe energy information administration has forecast brent crude futures to average $53 a barrel in 2017 and west texas intermediate to average $52, close to their levels in the last three weeks of 2016. prices next year are likely to ride to $56 a barrel and $55 a barrel, the eia said.\n\nthe biggest hurdle, however, are rising inventories, despite the recent opec agreement, eia expects global petroleum and other liquid inventory builds to continue, but at a slowing rate, in 2017 and 2018.\n\naccording to factset, analysts expect the 36 energy companies that make up the s&p 500 's energy subindex to end 2017 with earnings of $17.18 a share, compared with earnings of $3.86 a share at the end of 2016. roughly two thirds of the companies are expected to report rising earnings and sales estimates.\n\nanalysts at raymond james said the outlook for the sector is meaningfully better than this time last year, not only in terms of companies' financial health but also in terms of drilling efficiency and productivity gains.\n\nraymond james' top pick among north american large-cap e&p companies include concho resources inc. cxo, -6.02% , continental resources inc. clr, -7.54% , marathon oil corp mro, -8.40% , and pioneer natural resources co. pxd, -4.37% .\n\nsmall and midcap favorites include antero resources corp. ar, -9.46% , cabot oil & gas corp. cog, -3.45% , and carrizo oil & gas inc. us:crzo.\n\nfor integrated giants exxon and chevron corp. cvx, -3.62% , cfra's glickman said he expects exxon struggling to meaningfully increase production this year and to find enough catalysts for share increases: it's a tepid outlook, he said.\n\nexxon is, of course, also going through a change of guard after longtime chairman and ceo rex tillerson was picked by president-elect donald trump to serve as u.s. secretary of state. darren woods, who rose through the ranks in exxon's refining business, took over jan. 1.\n\nrelated:senators on fence about tillerson\n\nchevron has more balls in the air, glickman said, and wall street will keep a close eye on whether the company will maintain its dividend and continue efforts to streamline itself. glickman has a hold rating on both stocks.
if 2019 taught us anything, it was that it's just a matter of time before hackers find our personal information online.\n\nafter a string of major hacks affecting millions of internet users, there are few people left online who haven't been affected. with 100 million capital one cof, -3.10% customers having their sensitive data exposed on top of last year's equifax breach efx, -0.62% exposing the data of 148 million customers, marriott mar, -1.91% exposing 500 million users' information, and exactis exposing the data of more than 340 million people, your information is at a higher risk than ever.\n\nhere are five easy steps you can take to make yourself — and your finances — less hackable.\n\nuse a password manager\n\ntoo many people still use passwords like 123456 and password to keep their accounts secure, according to a report from software company splashdata on the '100 worst passwords of the year.' passwords that are that easy to guess put you at risk — and it isn't hard to do better. using a password manager will keep all of your accounts secure with unique and complex passwords, and you only have to remember one: the master password.\n\nto do this, set up an account at a well-known manager service like lastpass, 1password, dashlane, keeper, or password boss. while there is a negligible risk the password manager itself could be hacked, experts say any manager is still safer than trying to remember your own passwords.\n\nturn on two-factor authentication\n\nmake sure to turn on two-factor authentication on your password manager as well as for accessing individual websites. this security feature verifies your identity before you log on to a site by sending a code to your phone through text message or email. the website turn it on: the ultimate guide to two-factor authentication, allows users to search for any site they are logging into to see if it offers the feature. besides text verification, there are other two-factor options, including a yubikey, a $45 usb device that you can plug into a computer to verify that you are the correct user.\n\nchange your router password\n\nafter several high-profile breaches involving internet routers, it would be wise to change the default password on any device in your home that's connected to the internet. often when you purchase an internet router, it comes with a default string of letters and numbers as the password. these passwords are easily available on online forums, on the dark web and the regular internet, making it possible for hackers to get into your home network and every device connected to it. changing your home network password is one of the most simple ways to avoid getting hacked.\n\nchange your default dns\n\nan easy way to strengthen your online security in just a few clicks is to change the default domain name system (dns) used by your internet service provider to a safer alternative. changing the address to google, 8.8.8.8, or cloudflare 1.1.1.1, or quad9, 9.9.9.9 offers better protections against hacking. this can be done through control panel on a windows device or system preferences on a mac device.\n\nfreeze or lock your credit\n\na 2018 federal law made it free for consumers to freeze their credit at all three major credit bureaus: equifax, experian expgf, +4.68% and transunion tru, -0.41% . meanwhile, the three bureaus have made freezing or locking one's credit report much easier by introducing mobile apps that allow consumers to block or un-block access to their credit information on the go.\n\ngiven how common it is for companies to get hacked these days, this is a simple step that can prevent hackers from stealing a consumer's information and using it to open fraudulent credit accounts.\n\nthis story was originally published in january 2019.
gold prices climbed friday, adding to a weekly gain—their fourth in a row—buoyed by weakness in the u.s. dollar and uncertainty surrounding donald trump's presidency.\n\ngold was clobbered thursday as the dollar gained on the combination of inaction on interest rates from the european central bank and relatively hawkish comments from federal reserve chief janet yellen this week.\n\non friday, uncertainty surrounding the early presidency of trump hovered over financial markets. trump recently suggested he favored a weaker dollar and his treasury secretary pick, steven mnuchin, worked hard thursday to clarify that stance.\n\nread:how gold tends to perform in presidential inauguration years\n\ngold for february delivery us:gcg7 tacked on $3.40, or 0.3%, to settle at $1,204.90 an ounce, only briefly dropping below the closely watched $1,200 level intraday.\n\ngold retreated on wednesday as well, but the contract on tuesday finished at its highest level since nov. 17, according to factset data, and that move helped preserve the week's advance of roughly 0.7%.\n\nmarch silver us:sih7 added 3 cents, or 0.2%, to $17.032 an ounce, for a 1.6% weekly gain.\n\nit will take some time for the trump administration to begin enacting its economic policies and for them to take effect, brien lundin, editor of gold newsletter, told marketwatch. in the meantime, the markets will be looking for any hints of what's to come.\n\nso far, trump and his advisors and appointees have given indications that they'll favor a weaker dollar. this is bullish for gold, and investors should look for any further hints that they'll lean in this direction, he said.\n\nthe ice u.s. dollar index dxy, +0.42% was trading less than 0.3% lower friday, poised for a loss on the week.\n\nthe dollar strengthened thursday as mnuchin said the u.s. prefers a strong dollar long term, working to walk back comments from the president-elect during an interview with the wall street journal last friday, which he declared the dollar too strong.\n\ngold and the dollar typically trade inversely because a stronger greenback can make commodities pegged to the buck, including metals, more expensive to buyers using other monetary units.\n\nin a research note, analysts at capital economics said they doubt that the latest revival in [gold] prices will prove sustainable…\n\nfirst, we expect the fed to tighten monetary policy by more than investors are discounting. second, the u.s. dollar is likely to appreciate further this year as the spread between the fed's interest rates and those of other central banks widens. and finally, we suspect that consumer [india's and china's jewelry demand in particular] and central bank demand will remain subdued, they said.\n\nthe capital economics analysts concede that geopolitical risks could give a lift to gold prices at times over the course of this year, but said tightening u.s. monetary policy is likely to prove too much of a headwind. they forecast the price of gold will fall to $1,050 per ounce by end-2017.\n\nelsewhere on comex, march copper us:hgh7 rose 1.5 cents, or 0.6%, to $2.625 a pound—but ready for a weekly loss of 2.4%. april platinum us:plj7 tacked on $19.60, or 2.1%, to $976 an ounce, ending about 1.1% lower on the week, and march us:pah7 rose $37.25, or 5%, to $788.40 an ounce, for a weekly advance of 5.2%.\n\npalladium's rise, in particular, is driven by a very strong outlook for continued strong global auto sales in 2017, according to maxwell gold, director of investment strategy at etf securities.
it's a good bet that most of donald trump's news conference wednesday will focus on that dossier of unverified allegations surrounding ties to russia that the president-elect has dismissed as a total political witch hunt.\n\ncheck out: a live blog of trump's news conference\n\nwall street is so far shrugging off the latest chapter of the russia saga. stocks traded modestly higher, with the s&p 500 spx, -1.48% up 0.1% ahead of the news conference. equities rose to a string of new records following trump's nov. 8 election victory, but the rally has subsequently cooled.\n\nsee:here's why trump's inauguration could mark a near-term top for stocks\n\nstock-market investors will be pining for information on a range of topics, particularly given the lack of detail surrounding the incoming administration's ambitious but vague economic plans. trump is slated to talk to the press at 11 a.m. eastern in his first full-scale news conference since july.\n\nread:the biggest risk as markets shrug at the trump-russia imbroglio\n\nhere are some of the potentially hottest topics:\n\ncorporate tax reform\n\ntrump made an overhaul of the corporate tax code—and tax cuts for individuals—a centerpiece of his economic agenda during the campaign. trump's plan included a call for a one-time break that would give u.s. companies an incentive to repatriate cash held overseas.\n\na reduction in the top corporate tax rate to 20% from 35% could add $5 to $7 a share to s&p 500 earnings in 2017, said russ koesterich, co–portfolio manager of blackrock's global allocation fund, in a blog post. that would go a long way toward closing the gap between wall street expectations for earnings and reality, he said, providing a real-life tailwind, in the form of faster earnings growth, to a market increasingly driven by hope over experience.\n\nat the same time, corporate tax reform won't cure all ills and isn't a win for everyone. changes to deductions and potential border adjustment measures, which would change tax treatment for both importers and exporters, will create winners and losers.\n\nit's unclear how much detail trump can provide wednesday. many of the details will need to be worked out between trump and republican lawmakers, who have their own ideas on elements of the tax plan.\n\ninfrastructure spending\n\ntrump vowed to ramp up spending on infrastructure, including roads, bridges, airports, the electrical grid and other elements. trump's pledges to boost infrastructure investment were credited as a driver of the postelection stock-market rally.\n\nfew hard details of trump's infrastructure plans have been revealed. the trump campaign called for $1 trillion in infrastructure spending over the next decade. but often overlooked is the fact that the plan outlined by the campaign calls for the spending to be funded by tax credits that would provide incentives for private businesses to invest in infrastructure projects.\n\nmore detail on infrastructure plans could be of significant interest to investors in resources, construction and other companies that would be tapped to carry out infrastructure projects.\n\ntrade\n\nso far, investors have largely shrugged off trump's campaign threats to label china a currency manipulator and to impose tariffs on imported goods. since then, he's barely mentioned the protectionist measures that had been a substantial part of his campaign, noted craig erlam, senior market analyst at oanda.\n\nshould he tread a similar line today then markets may once again be buoyed by his focus on growth friendly policies as opposed to populist measures that threaten to destabilize and inhibit global trade and growth, erlam said, in a note. should he focus on protectionism it will be very interesting to see how markets respond because they have strongly bought into growth friendly policies.\n\noverall, the market is unlikely to get knocked off track by the news conference, said randy frederick, vice president for trading and derivatives at the schwab center for financial research, in an email. with that in mind, the only thing likely to unsettle the markets would be if trump were to cancel the news conference. and there's no sign that's in the cards.\n\nthe markets seem very willing to give him the benefit of the doubt under most circumstances. if the press conference is cancelled, i think the markets could get uneasy, frederick said, in an email.\n\nmark decambre contributed to this report.\n\nread: at the mar-a-lago doorstep, beside don king, a trump news conference of sorts

and how can others know when it's time to stop what they're doing and feed their soul?\n\nwe can sense this in our bodies; our bodies give us messages. not just 'i'm getting old,' but maybe 'i shouldn't be doing this; it doesn't feel good anymore.'\n\nit started for me in my early 40s. i began a five-year search of what's next for me. that was quite a process. it involved a lot of prayer — the same prayer every day, which was 'please god, give me something else to do.'\n\ni believe we are encoded beings, driving toward some kind of meaning. it doesn't matter how old you are. i know some 88-year-olds who live lives of meaning and some who don't. and i know some 20-year-olds who live lives of meaning and some who don't.\n\nwhat about people in their 50s and 60s?\n\nas we get older, we have greater opportunities to find meaning in life if we're willing to look for it. the main reason it's true is we have an understanding of what it means to have a broken heart, otherwise known as sorrow. we can examine that and then begin to figure out what's next.\n\nwhy does experiencing sorrow matter?\n\none of the central quotes in my book is from kahlil gibran [author of 'the prophet'], and i'm paraphrasing: our greatest joy is our sorrow unmasked.\n\nin my book, i talk about the sorrowful, joyful experiences in my life. my dad died of lung cancer when i was 14. it was just terrible; he was my hero and i was with him at the time and wasn't expecting it. that was the most sad and sorrowful i've been in my whole life. seventeen years ago, i founded a grief center for children in southwest missouri — the lost & found grief center. when i work with teens who have a parent who died, can you imagine the joy i feel when i leave that group?\n\nthe writer steven jenkinson [die wise: a manifesto for sanity and soul'] says we shouldn't try to fix our broken heart. the idea is to recognize and understand how brokenheartedness leads to meaningful days and lives.\n\nhow can people find meaningful work in their 50s and 60s?\n\nemployees can go to work and think: 'how do i find meaning in my work?' maybe you don't think you have the power to change the whole company. in that case, it's important to remember the story of when jfk was visiting nasa and saw a gentleman sweeping the floor. kennedy asks: 'what do you do?' and the man looks at the president and says: 'i'm helping to send a man to the moon.' he was a janitor, but his attitude was one of participating in the mission of the organization.\n\nfor those who think 'i don't have power in my organization,' ask yourself: 'what power do i have?' you have great power to reformulate how you view your job through one word: dignity. in work, that doesn't come from the title of your job, but from the attitude you have toward your work.\n\nand how can someone who wants to become an entrepreneur or change fields find meaningful work?\n\nif you're working now and thinking 'i'm going to leave my job and start x,' i would ask that person: 'why do you want to do this? what is your purpose? do you hate your job or do you love this thing that you must do?'\n\nexplore what is meaningful to you: what does a day look like that is a good day? what was a day when you felt you contributed to someone else's well-being or someone else contributed to your well-being? before you show me your business plan, i encourage you to stop and reflect on what is meaningful to you.\n\nand then once someone is ready to make a business plan?\n\ndo the hard work and put together a forecast for your business. this is where the rubber meets the road. is the thing you want to do sound financially? can you feed your family and put your kids through college and live the life you want to live? understand how the business will impact you financially.\n\nalso, ask yourself: 'what is my level of risk tolerance and how will starting this business affect other people in my life?'\n\nwhat if someone is a small-business owner but is nervous about starting something new — is there a way to pursue a calling through the business?\n\ni say: 'look. i understand. i've been there. take one step toward your dream of engaging employees and helping out in the community and you will find these doors in the universe will open in ways you could never imagine. the universe conspires to help us serve other people.\n\nin the book, you talk about discovering the 'internal space where you can ponder your next steps with clarity.' what do you mean by that?\n\ni would say that if you're like i am — a very type a person who's constantly doing, doing, doing — if you don't discover the internal space where you can ponder your next steps with clarity, you will never find what you're looking for. it can take a long time; for me, it took about five years.\n\nis serving on a nonprofit board a way to find meaningful work and a calling?\n\na lot of people think they can serve on a board and that that's enough. nope. that will not work. many people in their 50s and 60s are on boards and find that meaningful, but it's not what i'm talking about. i believe it's a more hands-on approach, of rolling up your sleeves and being with people who need you. it can be the most rewarding experience of your life.\n\nyou're a big fan of going on a retreat to help find meaning in life. can you talk about that?\n\nwe think of a retreat as a retreat from something, like the enemy facing me. but i mean it as a way to separate ourselves from our daily life. it's a time of rest, but also a time of solitude. many people are uncomfortable with solitude, especially these days with instagram and facebook. they find it even painful.\n\nbut i encourage people to think about ways they can retreat from everyday life and find a place of rest and solitude. we have a lot of thoughts hanging around in our minds. if we can let them settle down and make peace with them, that will give us resilience in our daily lives once we leave the retreat.\n\nyou can practice solitude whether you have an hour or a week. it helps us live longer, happier lives.
if i were marty mcfly from back to the future, i would travel back and warn everyone against borrowing money from their future selves.\n\ndoes that sound crazy? well, financial companies, the federal reserve, banks, and brokers all claim that they act in your best interests, yet your retirement statements prove otherwise. we are seeing the deepest gap ever between the haves and have-nots with savings erosion through covid-19, a devastating recession, and lack of government support that has left people wondering who is serving their needs.\n\nread: this bitcoin fund just went up over 1,000%. beware\n\nthe lack of real interest in investing in the future by younger generations is due to the confusion caused in trying to put away for tomorrow by these traditional financial channels. interest rates are near 0% from banks; there's no return to be had on bonds, all while things like rent, tuition cost keep climbing faster than the rate of inflation.\n\nthere are hopeful solutions that are not yet mainstream from financial technology companies that prove they can do better for the consumers in the fight for financial independence. here are three steps anyone in their 20s can take immediately to make sure they have a chance to see retirement one day:\n\nunderstand what it means to be 'financially free'\n\nto save for your retirement, you must first understand what it means to be financially free. financial freedom means preserving your capital, earning yield on the wealth you're creating, and budgeting for your savings to outlast your days on this planet. the goal of financial freedom is to get to the point where your monthly income is greater than your monthly expenses. when you're spending, you'll be spending against your own earned money and not against what you hope you'll earn in the future. when rates on deposits drop below the inflation rate it becomes impossible to save for the future and so one must invest in more risky assets or in non correlated assets to escape this impossible savings conundrum.\n\nread: worried about retirement? you'll find plenty of company here\n\nthe united states is a credit society: $922 billion in outstanding credit card debt pays a 24% average rate of interest back to the banks. add $1.6 trillion in student loans and $1.2 trillion in car loan debt. we are being forced to borrow from our future selves at rates of 12% to 24% when we can barely earn 1% on our money from traditional financial institutions.\n\nhoping you choose to spend against your future earnings is what banks and credit card companies would like you to do, but this year has proven that borrowing from the future is unpredictable. when banks get you to borrow from your future self at 24% interest, they are grabbing someone else's dollars on which they pay them 0.1% to let you have instant gratification and spend now what you cannot afford otherwise.\n\ncan you see the dangerous trap here if you can't pay it back?\n\nthe current policies by the federal reserve also stifle retirement plans for the younger generation. current approaches cause low or nonexistent income for most savers, and there is no indication of it getting better for the foreseeable future. decades ago, with social security and a pension from an employer, a person could expect to sustain themselves in retirement. now, too many people find themselves retiring with student loans, car loans, and more that make retirement difficult to realize.\n\nthink outside the banks\n\nstart asking yourself this every time you spend a dollar: do i want to spend this dollar now, or do i want this dollar to earn for me for the rest of my life? changing your overall mind-set of how money should be put to use can change your life.\n\nputting your dollars to work through high-interest earning offers an alternative that revolutionizes how you can build your retirement plan.\n\nboston college's center for retirement research found that most people world-wide are what you'd call passive savers or people who pay little attention to tax incentives currently given by traditional financial policies. instead, they adapt and adjust their spending to their take-home pay. this mentality makes the idea of saving and earning more responsive to initiatives like auto-enrolment.\n\nif you put money away into an asset that is not linked to the usd or your local fiat currency it will grow faster than inflation, if it also pays interest income on 35 different digital assets, such interest rates can be greater than inflation and get you closer and closer to financial independence each month. add on top of that compounding interest and you have the trifecta of how to reach retirement. so here you are, we gave you the secret but unless you press the financial launch button nothing happens, you need to take action and put yourself on the right track for retirement.\n\nmany companies focused on financial freedom are cryptocurrency-based. the blockchain technology and community around it has a belief in helping users find financial freedom. you do not only have to invest in a 401(k) or ira to save money. although good options, you'll find that there are other ways to buy, save, and earn from assets like cryptocurrency, gold, and stablecoins to break free from what the banks have long convinced us are the only options for saving.\n\nstop reading this, and start saving now\n\ncompounding interest is interest on your interest, your new dollars plus the original dollars calculated based on both the initial amount and the accumulated interest from previous periods.\n\nthere are many companies offering ways to begin earning for yourself, so start right out of high school or right after you read this. the banks have created an addictive model of spending and borrowing to earn and grow wealth through credit cards and rewards point programs. there are many blogs dedicated to hacking these programs, but just like in las vegas, the house always wins in the end.\n\nby putting away the average cost of your credit card's monthly payment (around $123.88) in the right service, you can earn up to $420,000 after 20 years. with monthly earnings of nearly $20,000 by your 40s. a much better average monthly payout than social security provides at an average of $1,503 a month.\n\njust as we looked to startups like uber uber, -4.23% and facebook fb, +1.69% to revolutionize their industries, financial technology companies in blockchain are now mature enough to provide real alternatives. services that can earn users up to 15% in interest a year. that isn't 24% owed to the banks for future income, that is your dollars earning for you — while you're at work, while you're asleep, and while you're focusing on your family or friends. the future of retirement is here and ready to help you be free.\n\nalex mashinsky is one of the inventors of voip (voice over internet protocol) with a foundational patent dating back to 1994 and is now working on moip (money over internet protocol) technology. over 35 patents have been issued to alex, relating to exchanges, voip protocols, messaging and communication. as a serial entrepreneur alex has raised more than $1 billion and exited over $3 billion. alex is the chief executive and founder of the celsius network, a crypto lending platform that provides members with curated services unavailable through traditional institutions.
resolving to get healthier is admirable. elbowing through the mosh-pit gym crowds in january is impressive, if not pretty. not using the gym at all by june, even after paying for a yearlong contract, is, well, disappointing.\n\nand it's a waste of money, even if your intentions were good.\n\nafter all, joining a gym seems like the answer to healthy resolutions, and maybe redemption for those fifth and sixth helpings of eggnog. gyms are ready for this annual jolt of workout motivation — all you have to do is sign an annual contract.\n\nannual contracts don't seem so bad, but …\n\npromotions and marketing aren't all that make a yearlong financial commitment tempting.\n\nthere's a weird way where we think if we're spending money we're accomplishing our goals, says kit yarrow, consumer psychologist and author of decoding the new consumer mind.\n\nif we do anything, we feel like we're taking a step toward our goal. and a lot of times, the easiest thing to do is spend money.\n\nit's also easy to think spending upfront will motivate you to hit the gym often and get your money's worth, says kevin volpp, director of the center for health incentives and behavioral economics at the university of pennsylvania. but he says it's common to get a few months into the contract and view the money that's been spent as a sunk cost, which is no longer very motivating. while you're deciding whether or not to schlep to the gym on a busy weekday in june, you probably won't be considering the money you dropped on a membership in january.\n\ngood for gyms, maybe not your lifestyle\n\nannual contracts (and resolutions) don't account for how your life may change later in the year, yarrow says. you lose interest; you shift priorities; you get busy — for whatever reason, you may not be a gym-goer come june.\n\nread: this is the insane amount millennials are spending on fitness\n\ngyms don't mind when you and other members drop off, because you're already financially hooked for the year. the business model is based on the fact that most people who sign up and join aren't going to go, says dixie stanforth, senior lecturer in the department of kinesiology and health education at the university of texas at austin. if everybody showed up who had a membership, you wouldn't be able to fit them in the gym.\n\nin fact, a 2014 episode of the planet money podcast found that a planet fitness in new york had about 6,000 members but the capacity for only 300.\n\nsay you think you'll be one of the members who is still showing up in june and that an annual contract is your best choice. before signing, consider your lifestyle. aim for a gym that's near your home or workplace, and determine how you'll fit gym sessions into your schedule, stanforth says.\n\nalso read the fine print of the contract, stanforth says, and check if you'll be automatically charged a higher rate next year.\n\nmore cost-effective ways to exercise\n\nthere is nothing magic about a gym — and certainly nothing magic about a gym you don't go to, stanforth says. any kind of movement has value. here are a few ways to get moving:\n\nuse technology. need some guidance for exercises you can do anywhere, no membership required? ask the internet. google starting a walking program or training for a 5k, stanforth says. or search within youtube: yoga for beginners, body-weight exercises or 7-minute workout.\n\ntry fitness apps, too. use workout-tracking apps to create incentives, like rewards for exercising a target number of times per week or month. fitness apps that allow others to see how often you work out can also be helpful. they create some sanction around how active you are, volpp says.\n\ncommit to friends, not contracts. you'll probably be more motivated to exercise if you've promised to do so with a friend, volpp says. so walk the dog with neighbors; bike to the office with co-workers; join a running group; start a weekly pickup soccer game. you're not only getting motivation (and fun!) from hanging with friends; you're also spending next to nothing.\n\nother social workouts may be worth putting down some money. for example, stanforth suggests hiring a personal trainer for a small group of friends and splitting the cost. or sign up for a niche gym or fitness group — cycling, yoga, crossfit — in which other members will count on you to be there, she adds.\n\nsee: 5 reasons to workout with your co-workers\n\nthese smaller-group routines may wind up costing more than an annual gym membership. but if you can afford them, stanforth says their value will be greater, because you'll be more likely to attend classes and achieve long-term success.\n\nafter all, the more expensive membership is the one that's bought and never used.\n\nmore from nerdwallet:
if you are upset about something on your credit report, you're not alone.\n\nof all the complaints posted to the consumer financial protection bureau's website in 2016, the highest percentage were complaints about credit reporting — more than 43,000, or about 23% of the total 186,000 complaints.\n\nthat's according to an analysis of the complaints by the personal finance company lendedu.\n\nmortgages and debt collection were the next most complained-about topics, each taking about 21% of the complaints for the year.\n\nthe cfpb releases an annual roundup of the most complained-about topics and most recently released data about 2015 complaints (it hasn't released an analysis 2016 data to the public yet, but lendedu did its study based on the cfpb's publicly available database of complaints). but the cfpb has found relatively consistent numbers about how many consumers complain about their credit reports.\n\nthe most common complaints about the credit reports were that it contained incorrect information (nearly 74% of complaints said this), followed by complaints about the credit reporting company's investigation (such as that it took too long or they received inadequate help on the phone), inability to get a credit report or score, improper use of their credit reports or complaints about credit monitoring or identity protection.\n\nwhy were credit reports the most complained-about topic?\n\nalthough mortgages, debt collection, payday loans and other consumer products may have their own issues, credit reports encompass many aspects of consumers' financial lives (including loans and debt), which may be one reason they received the most complaints in lendedu's study, said the company's co-founder and chief executive nate matherson.\n\nthe cfpb doesn't collect data about how often consumers' complaints about their reports containing incorrect information are actually true.\n\nthe federal trade commission has studied this problem; in 2012, the commission found that one in five consumers had an error that was subsequently corrected by a credit reporting agency after it was disputed. when the ftc followed up with 121 consumers it had worked with in 2012 who still had errors on their reports, 84 said in 2015 that they still believed at least some of the information they disputed remained incorrect.\n\nalthough some consumers may in fact have errors on their credit reports, some make complaints when they don't understand aspects of their report that aren't actually incorrect, said liz weston, the author of your credit score: how to improve the 3-digit number that shapes your financial future, who is now a columnist for the personal finance company nerdwallet.\n\nthe cfpb database is not a perfect reporting tool and measurement of consumer complaints as it may fail to distinguish between bona fide consumer complaints [and] innocuous disputes, said eric j. ellman, the interim president and chief executive of the consumer data industry association, in a statement.\n\nit is important to note that consumers who are reviewing their credit reports for the first time might question an item they don't recognize or understand and then lodge a complaint on the portal.\n\nthat said, people really do have trouble negotiating with the credit bureaus (the three major ones are equifax efx, +0.41% , transunion tru, +0.15% and experian expn, -1.01% ; equifax and transunion were fined by the cfpb this month after the bureau said they misled consumers about their credit scores) when they have problems with their reports, weston said, which has created a cat and mouse relationship with credit bureaus for years. (for example, she said, consumers may dispute an item on their credit report with a credit bureau, but creditors might insist to the bureaus that the item in question is correct.)\n\nthe cdia and credit reporting agencies are continuously looking for new ways to better serve consumers through technology investments and improvements to systems and processes, ellman said.\n\nconsumers should learn as much as possible about their credit scores, weston said, most importantly knowing that it's a three-digit number that presents a snapshot of their financial lives, there are many types of credit scores (not just one, which is a common misunderstanding) and that they change all the time based on consumer behavior, she said.\n\nif consumers really do have a problem with their reports, the cfpb recommends contacting both the credit-reporting company that provided the credit report and any other company that may have distributed information about one's score (there are many third-party websites, such as credit karma or some credit-card companies, for example, that provide credit scores) to track down a potential error. that complaint should include what information consumers think is wrong, why they think it's wrong and copies of any documents that can back up that claim.\n\nthe cfpb can also submit credit reporting complaints on behalf of consumers and will give consumers a tracking number for their case.\n\nhow credit scores predict what you will buy next\n\nhow to improve your score\n\na credit score is made up of the amount an individual owes (including loans), payment history (paying bills on time), the length of one's credit history, the credit mix a consumer currently has (the combination of credit cards and loans one has, for example) and new credit, or the number of accounts a consumer has opened in a short period of time (which could indicate risk), according to the fair isaac corporation, an analytics company known for giving credit ratings (fico).\n\nconsumers are allowed one free copy of their credit report from each of the credit reporting bureaus (equifax, experian and transunion) every year by visiting annualcreditreport.com. it's a good idea to check that report for any errors, then dispute them with the credit bureau who distributed the report (and if necessary, bring that complaint to the cfpb.)\n\nif the report has no errors, consumers can improve their scores by paying off debt, consistently paying bills on time (setting up automatic online payments can help with this) and using as small percentage of credit available to them as possible. (this is known as the credit utilization ratio; personal finance experts recommend using less than 30% of total credit, such as 30% of a total credit card limit.)\n\nthat said, if consumers have had credit problems, it may take a while to build their scores back up. even when a collection account is paid off, it stays on a credit report for seven years, according to fico.\n\nfor those who are struggling, it may pay off to contact one's creditors to try to renegotiate terms, or to visit a credit counseling service, which can provide resources.
the u.s. dollar edged lower against the yen and euro friday, reversing gains rung up earlier in the session, as investors began to second guess a report on december jobs growth released earlier in the session.\n\nits declines cemented the dollar's worst weekly performance against the yen since august 2013 — and its worst weekly performance against the euro since early december of last year — as chinese stocks and the yuan dropped sharply, with global ramifications. the dollar was down 2.6% against the yen on the week, while the euro rose 0.6% against the dollar.
yahoo inc. will still be yahoo after (if?) it is sold to verizon communications inc., and marissa mayer will be chief executive of the company until that date and possibly beyond.\n\nthose two facts did not change after yahoo us:yhoo disclosed plans monday afternoon that were misconstrued in some corners of the internet, including by news organizations.\n\nthe yahoo that internet users know for email, fantasy sports and other internet services is in the process of being purchased by verizon for $4.8 billion, as long as large-scale hacks of yahoo users' info don't scuttle the deal. verizon vz, +1.00% has not officially said if mayer will continue to lead the company when and if it is a verizon subsidiary, but verizon does hope to continue yahoo's popular services under the same name — all those eyeballs are a major reason it is buying the flagging property. mayer, for what it is worth, said she wanted to stay at yahoo after the verizon deal was announced.\n\nhowever, verizon is only buying the core business of yahoo, and the company owns a lot more than that. as marketwatch wrote about in detail after the verizon bid for yahoo was announced, yahoo's stakes in alibaba group holding ltd. baba, +1.32% and yahoo japan, as well as billions in cash and other assets, are not part of the deal. the $30 billion-plus entity that holds on to all of that, which will exist only if the deal with verizon goes through, would eventually be called altaba.\n\naltaba, though, will do virtually nothing but hold these assets, as what is known as an investment company. because there is little decision-making involved in being basically a ticker symbol, altaba does not need a full board of directors, so it will slash the size of the current yahoo board in half. among those who will no longer be on the board are mayer, who could still be acting as the head of yahoo under verizon leadership, and yahoo co-founder david filo.\n\nhis or her intention to resign is not due to any disagreement with the company on any matter relating to the company's operations, policies or practice, yahoo noted in the securities and exchange commission filing that launched a thousand confusing tweets.\n\nso yahoo will still be yahoo, altaba will be a zombie company comprising a bunch of assets and few, if any, tasks, and mayer may or may not still be running the actual yahoo. no matter what anyone on twitter says.
no more drama in this family affair.\n\nrepublican national committee chairwoman ronna mcdaniel stressed thursday that her harsh words for her uncle mitt romney — the junior senator from utah who criticized president trump's character and conduct in a recent op-ed — had nothing to do with family and everything to do with fostering unity as party chair.\n\ni love my uncle. my tweet yesterday had nothing to do with family, mcdaniel, who dropped the maiden name romney after assuming her rnc post, said on fox and friends. i would have done this to any freshman incoming senator, and i would have said, 'hey, let's focus on the real issues here, which are the democrats, who are proposing dangerous policies for our country. and let's remind americans about the good things that have come out of the trump administration.'\n\nmcdaniel, following romney's swipe in the washington post at trump's leadership, had tweeted, for an incoming republican freshman senator to attack @realdonaldtrump as their first act feeds into what the democrats and media want and is disappointing and unproductive. the reality is, i acted as party chair, she later told fox news. he's going to act as senator. romney had given her advance notice of his op-ed, she added, and sent her a note after she tweeted.\n\nwhile the rnc chair and the republican senator serve separate employers with different goals, there's a lesson in their public clash for how family members who work together — whether it's in a family business or just a company that employs them both — ought to interact in the workplace and off the clock.\n\nfor instance, workers in a family-owned business need to learn that they wear different hats on different occasions, like the family hat, the business hat and the business-ownership hat, barbara spector, the editor-in-chief and associate publisher of family business magazine, told moneyish. are you talking to someone as if he's your dad and you're his child, or are you talking to him as if you're the employee and he's the boss? she said. that can be hard to navigate.\n\nhere's how to decide whether working with your own flesh and blood is a good idea — and how to make sure your relationship survives intact. (if you're either considering or regretting working with a romantic partner, read moneyish's tips for couples who work together and advice on how to work with an ex.)\n\nmake sure you both can handle working together. brianna marshall, a las vegas-based licensed marriage and family therapist, urged having a frank conversation about whether your relationship can weather the potential conflicts. we know ourselves: are we able to leave it here at work and not have this interrupt our personal family life? she told moneyish. if we can't do that, then maybe we shouldn't be doing this. and that's ok — it's not a weakness of any sort.\n\ntalk through worst-case scenarios, advised johnny c. taylor jr., president and ceo of the society for human resource management. as an extension of the interview and hiring process, he said, both parties should sit down with a certified hr professional to role-play various hypotheticals: could you stay objective if your mom were consistently late to work, or if your brother passed you over for a promotion? what would you do if a family member were caught stealing? are you prepared to call law enforcement on your son, your daughter, your cousin, your mother? taylor said. if the answer is no, then both of you can't work (there). the third-party hr presence can help push the conversation forward and pick up telling body language, he added.\n\nset parameters. (it) depends on the job and the kind of work, but in general i think firewalls are good, psychologist mary alvord told moneyish. it is nice to have separation of work time and work issues versus family time. have clear boundaries on when and where it's ok to discuss work stuff, marshall said, and designate a work-free zone where you don't discuss business. it's generally understood that to the extent that you are working with a loved one, then work is work and home is home, and we really try everything we can to avoid bringing those two things together, taylor added.\n\nstay above board. a family member shouldn't join your workplace if they're not prepared to be treated like every other employee, taylor said. in some ways it's an even (more) heightened standard, because once people realize you two are related, they're expecting favoritism to come into play, he said. for the good of the morale of the organization, you almost have to go one step further to prove that this person does not have an unfair advantage.\n\ntaylor says transparency was key during his previous tenure at the thurgood marshall college fund, where he was ceo and his sister worked as a vp who didn't report to him. while her married surname could've made it easy to obscure their sibling status during the three years they worked together, the two opted to inform everyone up front. perception is everything, he said. employees need to know that you're not hiding anything. his sister understood she was subject to the same consequences as anyone else, he added.\n\nrevise your old assumptions. siblings and cousins, for example, may need to redefine their relationship to think of each other as business partners, spector said — after all, their reputations as kids may have been the flaky one or the screw-up. it's hard to realize that 'ok, that was decades ago, and now this person is an adult and a competent professional,' she said. don't pigeonhole people. if you're the one trying to shake an outdated image, she added, demonstrate your capability, your competence, your credibility in your role.\n\ndon't be afraid to change course if it isn't working. agree to reassess within the first year or six months of working together, taylor said. if there have been a number of uncomfortable instances in which work and personal issues bled into each other, he said, we should agree that one of us is going to go the other way.
the holidays were a time for celebration — but they also spawned litigation.\n\nthe new year consistently brings batches of new lawsuits fueled by holiday revelry that goes wrong or snaps long-strained marriages, according to attorneys and experts.\n\n the wednesday before thanksgiving to new year's eve to super bowl sunday the 'triangle' that makes for more than half of her 450 cases across the country. \n\nthe first month of the new year is also traditionally the time that splitting spouses act on the auld lang syne lyrics asking, should auld acquaintance be forgot, and never brought to mind?\n\njanuary always seems to be the time people want to start anew and start their lives over again, said peter walzer, a california matrimonial lawyer practicing for 36 years. about 35% to 40% of his cases are filed in january and february, he said.\n\nu.k.-based divorce support service amicable, said typically more than 40,500 people will search divorce online in january. the american academy of matrimonial lawyers, says there's usually a spike in divorce filings and inquiries of 25% to 30% every year in january.\n\n 'january always seems to be the time people want to start anew and start their lives over again.'  — —peter walzer, a california matrimonial lawyer practicing for 36 years\n\na twist this year already has divorce lawyers working overtime ahead of their busy season. federal tax overhauls from the tax cuts and jobs act are ending the deductibility of alimony payments. as a result some lawyers across the country are scrambling to lock in divorce judgments before the new rules take effect january 1.\n\nwalzer, the current president of the american academy of matrimonial lawyers, says he can't convince any of his bar association colleagues to help out with organization matters right now. it's like 'call me next year.'\n\nof course, it's not like the holidays are the most gloomiest time of the year for everyone. many people love the holiday season. for example, 69% of participants in a 2013 pew research study said their favorite thing about the holidays was spending time with friends and family.\n\nsplitting marriages\n\nlike personal injury cases, it's tricky to track the sheer number of divorce cases, which are filed in state courts. but many come around the start of the new year, lawyers told marketwatch.\n\nthe timing is sometimes because parents are playing nice during the holidays for their kids, or sometimes because the proverbial last straws come during a stressful time of year. other times it's a calculation to get a clear financial picture for the task of carving up the couple's money.\n\nmost people are reacting on emotion and not tactically, said walzer.\n\nfor pending divorces, the holidays are especially trying if there are kids and family traditions in the mix, according to lee rosenberg of saltzman chetkof & rosenberg in new york. fights over who gets the kids for what days get heated quick, leaving lawyers to hash out drop-off times to the exact time and location.\n\nsomething's going to go wrong and it's going to be fodder for more litigation, rosenberg said, later adding, it becomes a quid pro quo of how bad you can be to the other person, regardless of how it affects the children.\n\nthere's some extra fuel on the fire this year, with the end of alimony being tax deductible in 2019. the federal tax code change could raise an estimated $6.9 billion for the government. but it also means the end of a tax advantage that's long been on the books.\n\nthis tax law is the biggest change in family law since i have been practicing, walzer said.\n\noakland, calif.-based attorney deborah marx said she was burning the candle at both ends herself. working is about all i'm doing, she said late last month. i'm not doing any work that doesn't involved these deadlines.\n\naccountants are also feeling the burn. a recent survey from the american institute of certified public accountants on the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act said over a quarter of surveyed accountants saw more clients trying to wrap up their divorces before 2019.\n\nit's put lawyers in a frenzy and courts in a frenzy, rosenberg said.\n\nbad weather and alcohol are a bad combination\n\nmeanwhile, research says divorce rates are falling while the national highway traffic safety administration statistics show alcohol-impaired driving is involved in fewer holiday driving fatalities.\n\nthe worst period for accidents appears to have just passed. research shows people hospitalized in late december face increased risks for readmission or death, while another study said christmas eve poses a particular heart attack risk for older and sick people.\n\nhowever, elizabeth trendowski, an expert witness retained by plaintiffs and defendants in alcohol-fueled personal injury cases, agrees. she calls the period from the wednesday before thanksgiving to new year's eve to super bowl sunday the triangle that makes for more than half of her 450 cases across the country.\n\npeople are often off to holiday parties in december and held-over parties in january when drunk driving makes for disaster. it couldn't be more sad, she told marketwatch.\n\ndrinking and the 'dram shop'\n\ndrunk driving is less of a problem than it was 30 years ago, but there was still an uptick in alcohol-related traffic crashes around the holidays, according to the nhtsa. though there's no comprehensive data on how often those crashes lead to lawsuits, anecdotal evidence suggests the holidays fuel cases.\n\nyou see the increase, said christopher mcgrath, a new york-based personal injury attorney told marketwatch. if there's some sort of drunk driving arrest with someone hurt, mcgrath said it's a good bet a lawsuit is bound to come out of it for the driver, and possibly even the establishment that supplied the booze.\n\nbars, restaurants and other alcohol purveyors can be on the hook under so-called dram shop laws. though the burdens of proof and scopes can vary, 42 states and the u.s. virgin island have laws exposing watering holes to legal liability if they serve an intoxicated person who then causes mayhem on the roads or elsewhere, according to the national conference of state legislatures.\n\n bars and clubs are well aware of the laws and are increasingly focused on training staff to spot drunken revelers, calm tense situations.  — —juan carlos diaz, president of the american nightlife association, a trade association\n\njuan carlos diaz, president of the american nightlife association, a trade association, says bars and clubs are well aware of the laws and are increasingly focused on training staff to spot drunken revelers, calm tense situations — and limit their own liability in the process.\n\nwhat's important, they're trying to do something, instead of not doing anything….gone are the days of the roadhouse, diaz said, citing the 1989 patrick swayze cult classic movie that's spilling over with barroom brawls.\n\nbut if alcohol-fueled cases are slowing in this day of ride-sharing, trendowski, the founder of dram shop forensics, says she's not seeing it. however, she only sees the cases where things go wrong, she acknowledged.\n\nher job involves reviewing all sorts of evidence, including reports and depositions, for clues on whether bars served a visibly drunk customer. it's not always an easy call. there are times where the bar is very busy and they do communicate with somebody, but they don't exhibit the behavior until after they leave the bar, she said.\n\ntrendowski said many cases settle. i really believe a jury doesn't want to hear about drunk driving. they just don't want to hear about the drunk driver and they don't want to hear about the bar, she said.
americans have a savings crisis on their hands.\n\nroughly 40% of americans don't have enough in savings to cover an unexpected $400 expense, according to a report released in may by the federal reserve. and a separate report by personal-finance website bankrate found that one in five americans have more credit-card debt than they do in emergency savings.\n\nmeanwhile, a post from marketwatch that suggested consumers should ideally save twice their salary by the time they're 35 set twitter twtr, -1.47% ablaze as users balked at how lofty a task that seemed to be.\n\nbut saving money doesn't have to be difficult. indeed, by taking just a few simple steps, consumers can easily start building that nest egg — or at least an emergency fund. here are five new year's resolutions to put you on the path to building up savings and creating a strong foundation for your financial futures.\n\nread more:from solar panels to changing your diet — 11 ways you can combat climate change\n\nstop ordering in food\n\nas one reddit user recently discovered, ordering food to be delivered rather than cooking at home can become quite the budget buster. the reddit user, whose handle is cottoncandyskylines, described how a once-a-week burger king qsr, -0.09% habit morphed into ordering food daily using apps like skip the dishes and uber eats.\n\nall told, the user found themselves spending around $900 a month on food. with some self-motivation, they've managed to cut that amount markedly in recent months to just $150. i now have over $5,000 in savings and there's potential for so much more if i can keep cutting food expenses, they wrote.\n\nthat reddit user is not alone. a recent study from meal-kit subscription service home chef found that americans spend roughly $70,000 on food takeout and delivery over their lifetimes on average. it can be a hard habit to break, in part because food delivery services don't make deleting your account easy.\n\nbut there are ways to curb one's bad eating habits beyond deleting their food delivery accounts and simply cooking more. for starters, consumers can make sure that their credit card numbers and other personal information aren't saved in their food delivery accounts. that way ordering food will take longer, giving them time to consider whether it's really a good idea.\n\nanother option, as some reddit users suggested, is to order groceries instead. while consumers will still be paying a fee in this case, making grocery shopping easier can save a consumer significantly in the long run. plus, cooking your own food is healthier, which has its own financial benefits.\n\n— jacob passy\n\ncomparison shop when it comes to your car\n\na little bit of research can go a long way for consumers eyeing a new car in 2019. the prices dealers offer are not necessarily set in stone — the auto industry wouldn't dub possible price tags as the manufacturer's suggested retail price for nothing.\n\nsites like kelley blue book, edmunds and truecar can all be useful guides on the going prices for vehicles.\n\neric lyman, senior vice president of industry insights at truecar, previously told marketwatch, that in addition to the price research, drivers should also pay attention to auto loan rates. the rates are expected to climb in the new year due to the federal reserve's interest rate hike.\n\nbefore talking numbers with a dealer, lyman recommended shoppers get a quote for an auto loan from financial institutions they have worked with in the past for other banking needs. dealers may be able to work with a car maker's affiliated lenders to match or beat those loan terms, lyman said.\n\nthe same thinking on comparison shopping applies to car insurance policies. websites like nerdwallet.com and compare.com aggregate price quotes for drivers. not all drivers are created equal in the eyes of insurers.\n\nfor example, millennial drivers living with their parents typically pay far higher annual premiums ($1,750) versus other demographics, a compare.com study determined. but those price premiums are just the average, according to the website's ceo, andrew rose. that makes shopping around all the more important, he said.\n\n— andrew keshner\n\nalso see:how to give gifts that truly pay off for friends and family\n\ntalk to your doctor about your healthcare costs\n\nmedical bills can get expensive, but patients sometimes have more control over these costs than they realize. patients can cut costs simply by asking their health practitioners questions, starting with whether a doctor and their affiliated labs — where a doctor may send you to get tests — are in network. healthcare professionals belong to networks, and though patients can see doctors outside of their network, it will cost more.\n\npatients may mistakenly assume that any specialist their doctor refers them to is in-network, but that's not always the case. unfortunately, patients might not know this until a surprise bill comes in the mail.\n\npatients could even save money on their medications by asking doctors and pharmacists about less-expensive versions. many americans assume medical expenses at set at a fixed price, but they're not, and patients can comparison shop to reduce costs. patients can lose thousands of dollars a year by not looking around before going with a medical procedure or prescription, researchers at harvard, yale and columbia universities found. fewer than 1% of individuals used price transparency tools, including websites or apps, to find the best prices for medical procedures and medications.\n\nit beats the alternative, which is avoiding medical visits, procedures and medications because they're too expensive. one in four americans has refused medical care because of the cost, a 2017 study from bankrate.com found, but doing so could lead to worse health and other medical issues in the future.\n\namericans can save even more with tax-advantaged health plans. some employers offer health savings accounts (or hsas), which offer tax-free contributions, growth and withdrawals. workers must have a high-deductible health plan to qualify however (which means they'd be paying more up front for their medical expenses before the insurer begins covering costs). flexible spending accounts allow employees to contribute a specific amount of their salary upfront, and then use that money to spend tax-free on medical expenses throughout the year. money in an fsa must be used before the end of the year or will be forfeited.\n\n— alessandra malito\n\npay attention to interest rates\n\nthe federal reserve has increased interest rates multiple times throughout 2018 and plans to hike rates further in the year ahead. consumers can do themselves a favor by staying abreast of how rising interest rates will affect them.\n\namericans had more than $420 billion in credit card debt as of late 2018, according to personal finance website nerdwallet, and the average household with credit-card debt has nearly $7,000 in revolving debt that carries over from month to month. and those households are paying a hefty sum in interest.\n\ncredit card rates have risen steadily over the past year, as have the rates for other types of loans. the average annual percentage rate for credit cards was 17.21% as of dec. 19, nearly a full percentage point higher than the previous year, according to creditcards.com. therefore, households could stand to save thousands of dollars by avoiding pay credit card interest.\n\nbeyond paying off their full card balance each month, consumers can achieve this by applying for a balance-transfer credit card with a 0% interest introductory offer. these cards give consumers a chance to pay off their debts without digging themselves into a hole via interest payments.\n\nadditionally, consumers should be aware how much interest they're earning on their banks accounts. stock-trading platform robinhood made a huge splash in december when it announced banking accounts that were set to earn 3% interest. though the company has since delayed the rollout of these accounts amid regulatory scrutiny, the public's enthusiastic reaction to the announcement — some 850,000 people joined a waitlist for the accounts — shows that americans are hungry to earn interest on their cash.\n\nwhile accounts earning 3% are hard to come by, consumers should investigate ways to earn more in interest. for instance, many online banks offer above 2% interest on their accounts. another option is to take out a certificate of deposit — many banks offer 1-year cds with annual percentage yields above 2.5%.\n\n— jacob passy
a finger tap is the most common and necessary action we take on our computers and devices. it's also the most dangerous.\n\ncybersecurity — the personal behaviors and actions you take to protect yourself in the online world from identity thefts, frauds and other crimes aimed at stealing your personal information and data — is a serious personal issue. so we all need to know how to protect ourselves. below are five action steps to do it; most take 10 minutes or less. (the book has 13 more.)\n\naction step 1: create a secret email address\n\nestimated completion time: less than 10 minutes\n\ncreating a secret email address will boost your security by reducing the number of places hackers may find the email you use for your financial accounts.\n\nemail address: avoid using any personal information about yourself when you create your email address — the portion that comes before the @ sign.\n\npassword: naturally, for your secret email, you'll want a very strong password. include some numbers and symbols.\n\ntwo-step protection: set up your account so it has a two-step login process, which all good email providers offer.\n\npassword reset: if offered, choose the safer telephone recovery option to reset your password. if not, make certain you pick a password reset question that's difficult to guess.\n\naction step 2: get a password manager\n\nestimated completion time: less than 30 minutes\n\na password manager will enhance your safety and make your online life easier by eliminating the need to clog your brain remembering weak passwords. it lets you store your passwords in an encrypted file on your computer or in the cloud, protecting all your passwords with one strong master password. be sure to familiarize yourself with the way your password manager works and how it appears on your computer and devices.\n\nmost password managers have paid and free versions of their software. the free versions usually work only on one device; with a paid version, you can sync your password manager to your computer, smartphone, tablet and any other device you use.\n\nsome options include: dashlane (its paid version is dashlane premium, costing $39.99 a year); lastpass, which stores your encrypted passwords in the cloud rather than on your local device (its paid version is lastpass premium, costing $12 a year); 1password ($64.99 purchase for a single user; $5 a month for up to five people with 1password families); icloud keychain, which is apple's free password manager for certain iphones, ipads and macs and keepass, a free open-source program you can download and use on all your devices.\n\naction step 3: tighten your privacy settings on social media\n\nestimated completion time: less than 10 minutes\n\nthe fun in social media involves sharing news and photos with your friends and family. unfortunately, hackers have taken advantage of people's loose security settings to obtain their personal information to use in hacks and other frauds.\n\ngood cybersecurity requires having strong privacy settings. review yours on all your social media profiles, including these:\n\nfacebook: click the triangle next to account, select settings and then privacy. select the privacy option that best fits your needs. facebook fb, -1.90% also has a feature called privacy checkup, which can also be found in the drop-down box on the upper-right corner of your facebook page. it lets you check and edit your basic privacy settings in one place.\n\nfacebook's two-step verification is called login approvals; it requires you to enter a code sent to your mobile device when logging in to your facebook account from an unrecognized device. you can opt into login approvals by choosing account security in your account settings page.\n\ntwitter: the default public setting means anyone can see your tweets and follow you without your approval. however, by setting your twitter twtr, -4.96% account to protected, only those you've approved as followers can view your tweets. go to the security and privacy setting section on your twitter feed, find the tweet privacy section and check the box next to protect my tweets. you'll need to enter your password to save the change.\n\ntwitter has login verification, which sends a six-digit code to your mobile number on file when logging in to your account. go to the account settings page of your twitter account and select verify login requests. you'll be prompted to enter your phone number and a confirmed email address.\n\naction step 4: use free public wi-fi cautiously\n\nestimated completion time: less than five minutes\n\nwhile it's ok to use free wi-fi — except for checking your email or conducting financial transactions — if you need to use public wi-fi often, you should have a virtual private network (vpn). this program will encrypt your activities, preventing thieves from watching and recording what you do.\n\nsome free vpns will give you basic security, but are usually supported by ads. you can also purchase a subscription to a virtual network service, for $2 to $10 a month. paid vpn services typically work on up to five devices.\n\nyou'll want to use a vpn app not just for your computer, but for your smartphone and tablet if you use free wi-fi often.\n\na few vpn services to consider: nordvpn ($48 a year); private internet access ($39.95 a year), spotflux premium ($37.99 a year or $29.99 for one device); hotspot shield elite ($29.95; also comes in a free version) and cyberghost (free with ads).\n\naction step 5: secure your home wi-fi network\n\nestimated completion time: less than 60 minutes\n\nto secure your home wi-fi network, you'll need to gather some information about your router: its name (typically under the router); its model number (same place) and its ip address.\n\nnext, create a new username and password. then, find the wireless security or wireless network setting to change the wireless encryption type to the most secure option. choose wpa2, wpa2-psk or wpa2-ent. then, restart your router and reconnect all your devices.\n\nnext, disable wps (wi-fi protected setup). the wps feature lets you quickly connect your devices to your home network without needing to enter your wi-fi password. if you don't disable it, you will have a huge security hole.\n\nto disable wps, log in to your router again and look for wi-fi protected setup or wps in the interface. from there, see your options for disabling wps. if you can, disable wps altogether. if you're not allowed to do that, at the very least, disable the pin or put a limit on the number of guesses someone can take before gaining access.\n\nfinally, update your router's firmware (a fancy word for the software installed on your router). this keeps your wireless network secure. type your router's ip address into your browser, then log in with your router's username and password. then you'll see the firmware version your router currently runs. to see if it's outdated, go to the router manufacturer's site and click downloads for the newest version of its firmware.\n\nto update your firmware, connect your router to your computer with an ethernet cable. go back to your router's default gateway landing page (you found it by entering the ip address) and click on the security or administration tab. find firmware upgrade, open it and then start upgrade.
as we enter the new year it's a good time to reflect on major life changes that may have occurred for you and your family during the past year.\n\nchanges like; a marriage, birth of a child, death of a family member, a change in health status, divorce, change of jobs, caring for a special needs child, entering retirement, charitable giving decisions, selling of a primary residence or investment property. any one of these events could trigger the need to revise your estate plan by making adjustments to your will or creating an amendment to your trust or reassigning beneficiary(s); both primary and contingent.
bears beware—one of the most bearish strategists out there has changed his tune and singled out a potentially bright spot in the stock market.\n\nalbert edwards, société générale's permabear, usually spooks investors with his downbeat views at his bank's annual strategy conference in london, but this year shocked attendees by squeezing a rare optimistic take on japanese equities.\n\ni'm gonna try and be quite bullish about something: japan, he said at the conference, also referred to as woodstock for bears, earlier this week. so there will be a slightly more upbeat part of my presentation for a change.\n\nedwards said the japanese economy has a lot of positives at the moment, including strong household incomes, surging corporate profits and the prospect of a rapid pick up in consumption.\n\nit's a cheap market, if you are looking to invest, that is the bright spot. you can see the japanese corporates and the economy doing pretty well, he said.\n\njapan's nikkei 225 nik, -1.41% has jumped almost 15% over the last three month, reaching its highest level since november 1991 earlier this week. even so, valuations for aren't as stretched as in the u.s. the forward price-earnings ratio for the nikkei stands just above 19, while it's at 21 for the s&p 500 index spx, -1.48% .\n\nandrew lapthorne, head of socgen's quantitative analysis team said sky-high valuations have been a reason investors have been scared of snapping up japanese stocks, but that headwind has been dissipating.\n\non valuations, japan looks attractive relative to its global peer group, so one of our reasons we are interested in japan it's not just because it's profitable but also because the valuation headwind has turned into a tailwind. so japan is interesting, he said.\n\nsociété générale\n\nand société générale isn't alone in touting japan as a solid stocks story. in the 2018 markets outlook, investment banks such as ubs and j.p. morgan chase & co. also highlighted the asian nation as a go-to place for investing.\n\nhowever, there'd be no woodstock for bears without at least a few depressing messages. at the london conference, edwards shared some concerns over what could eventually upend the recent global stock market rally, pointing to japan as one of the potentially triggers.\n\nthat's because, even with his newfound optimism in japanese shares, there is a risk inflation will rise faster than expected and prompt the bank of japan to halt its aggressive easing program, edwards warned.
yahoo inc. shares rose 0.6% wednesday in a declining market, shrugging off the latest salvo against the company from activist investor starboard value lp.\n\nstarboard delivered a strongly worded letter to the company earlier, urging it to accept that major changes are needed, including a shake-up of management, a redrawing of its board, and an overhaul of strategy and execution.\n\ndespite over three years of effort and billions spent on acquisitions, the management team that was hired to turn around the core business has failed to produce acceptable results, in turn, causing massive declines in profitability and cash flow, starboard wrote in the letter.\n\nread also:selling yahoo's core business would be complicated\n\nyahoo us:yhoo responded by saying it's in the midst of a multiyear transformation and will share additional plans for change on or before its fourth-quarter earnings call.\n\nwe attract more than a billion people every month and we've built a profitable, billion dollar business in mobile, video, native and social that we expect will drive sustainable growth, the company said in an emailed statement.\n\nthe company appeared to admit it needs help in december after years of financial struggles, when it said it is evaluating a spinoff of its core business into a separate publicly traded company.\n\nstarboard has long sought changes at the internet company and on wednesday it said investors have lost all confidence in the management team and the board. most of yahoo's current value stems from its investment in alibaba group holding ltd. baba, +2.01% over 10 years ago, and the good fortune that alibaba's management team has executed well such that this investment today is worth over $30 billion, it said.\n\nread also: yahoo on road to crazytown with latest spinoff idea\n\nyahoo's current market cap is about $30.5 billion, which starboard said is either a massive tax liability, or reflects the fact that the company's core business is worthless, or a combination of the two.\n\nwe are confident that a separation of these assets can be accomplished through either a sale of the core business or a spinoff of the core business, said the letter.\n\nstarboard is convinced there are interested and credible buyers for yahoo's core business, but said media reports suggest management has declined to engage with interested parties.\n\nthis is unacceptable, the letter asserted. it went on to threaten a proxy fight, in which it would urge shareholders to elect a board that would truly represent their interests and come up with a viable turnaround plan.\n\nyahoo said it is in regular communication with shareholders and strives to deliver value to them.\n\nyahoo shares have fallen 34% in the past 12 months, while the s&p 500 index has eked out a small gain. analysts have speculated that a number of third-party buyers might be eager to take a look at the company, including a major media company. such a deal would be comparable with verizon communications inc.'s takeover of aol, and would give a buyer a stake in yahoo's ad technology, mobile research capabilities, digital content, such as video, and treasure trove of patents.\n\na verizon executive said in early december that the company would take a look at yahoo's web properties if they hit the market.\n\nthe letter adds to the pressure on chief executive marissa mayer, the company's fourth ceo in four years. mayer has come under fire in recent months from a wide range of critics for failing to deliver on a promised turnaround plan.
am i smarter than the stock market, or is the market smarter than i am?\n\nthat is the one question every investor must ask himself. your answer may have a sizable impact on your results.\n\ni'm biased.\n\nin 1990, after reading the bill o'neil classic how to make money in stocks, i became a chartist. i retired my crystal ball. i began substituting fact and precedent for opinion and prediction. i realized that it didn't matter what i thought; the market would go about doing what it was going to do anyway — either with me or without me.\n\nso i chose to admit that the market was smarter than i am. now, that can be an exceedingly difficult thing for an investor to admit.\n\n admitting that the market is smarter than you means respecting trends and not fighting them. \n\nbut the fact of the matter is that the market does not know who you are, what ivy league school you attended, or what a success you are in your non-investing career. none of that matters.\n\nfor those who took exception to last week's column (while a short-term decline of up to 5% is always a possibility during a bull market, the prospect of the major averages stopping dead in their tracks and reversing for good is faint), i cannot predict whether donald trump will completely destroy our economy, as bryan korte fears. i also do not know what a trade war with china would do to global growth.\n\ni am not smart enough to know that. i am, however, just smart enough to know that the market is smarter. and that is the key.\n\nwhat i do know is that the market is quite good about discounting, or pricing in, everyone's opinions and forecasts. and, fortunately, that is all that is needed to be on the right side of the market.\n\nadmitting that the market is smarter than you means respecting trends and not fighting them. a trend can go longer than most would imagine. that was the lesson of the '90s bubble era. at the time, those who prospered were the ones who paid attention to what the market was actually doing, not their own crystal ball.\n\nas discussed in last week's column, two reliable indicators of a long-term trend are currently out of harm's way. they are not infallible. (as it happens, they did not signal the s&p 500's spx, -1.48% 21.6% drop on an intraday basis in 2011, though they both signaled caution prior to the 2007 bull market top.)\n\nsee:the trump scoreboard: track the markets and economy under trump in one graphic\n\nfor intermediate-term speculators, or those seeking gains lasting several weeks to several months, the two best general market indicators are the price-volume behavior of the major averages and the action of the leading stocks. for a speculator, this mode of analysis should always take precedence over long-term signposts.\n\ncurrently, both the averages and leaders are acting well. while the s&p 500 has been treading water for five weeks, it does so on generally light activity. this is bullish, as it objectively indicates an absence of worrisome profit-taking.\n\n©tradestation technologies, 2001-2017. all rights reserved.\n\nfor its part, the nasdaq composite has outperformed the s&p 500 in nine of the past 12 outings. this reflects a healthy rotation out of the so-called trump stocks, those expected to benefit from the new administration's policies, and into larger nasdaq issues such as amazon.com amzn, -3.44% and facebook fb, -1.90% .\n\namong the companies, tal education group tal, -2.39% should grow earnings by 5% in the february 2017 fiscal year, followed by 42% in the february 2018 fiscal year, per most wall street analysts. the chinese provider of after-school tutoring services has racked up an impressive set of quarters showing high revenue growth.\n\nover the past eight quarters, the top line has jumped by 42%, the slowest, to 83%, the fastest. on jan. 19, tal's latest earnings release showed a beat on earnings and revenue, while guiding the next quarter's sales higher.\n\nthe stock's industry group has outperformed 92% of all segments over the past six months, while tal itself has bested the performance of 88% of all stocks in the past year.\n\nafter the release of the earnings report, the stock bolted 7.5% to clear a head-and-shoulders continuation pattern on volume that was 277% above average. the move cleared a cheater entrance (one that is below the top of a sideways basing pattern) above last week's high of $77.83. aggressive speculators might consider entering around jan. 19's close of $80.50, which is 3% past the cheater entry.\n\n©2017 marketsmith incorporated. all rights reserved.\n\nas always, a protective stop should be used to mitigate risk, along with a starter position that is half, or less, the normal size. this initial position could be added to if the stock proves itself. in most cases, a position should not be entered when price is extended, i.e. more than 5% past the top of its base for buys.\n\nyou either believe you know more than the market or the market knows more than you do. if your crystal ball is not enabling you to make much headway, perhaps it is time to chuck it and simply stay in gear with the market, no matter what.\n\nfighting the tape isn't much fun.\n\n— kevin marder\n\nfor intraday market comments and stock ideas: https://twitter.com/mardermarket\n\nearnings estimate data provided by thomson reuters.\n\nthe views contained herein represent those of marder investment advisors corp.

the very stable genius calling the shots in the white house loves dangling the freight-training stock market in front of america as an affirmation of his bigly productive first year. and investors, if the latest reading from the aaii survey is any indication, are betting the enormously consensual president will keep driving those record gains. or at least not get in the way.\n\nas you can see from our chart of the day,via dana lyons of j. lyons fund management, individual investors haven't been this heavy into equities since back in 2000, during the fragile peak of the dot-com bubble.\n\nthe december reading shows stock allocation jumped from 69% to 72%, which trails the 77% level reached before the epic implosion nearly two decades ago. the 3-percentage-point jump is the biggest monthly increase in four years. does that mean a collapse is imminent? of course not. maybe.\n\nin the near-term, the stock market will do whatever it wants, lyons writes in a blog [ost. that includes the possibility of rallying for several more years, despite the present elevated reading.\n\nhe notes that stocks managed to rally for years following the 72% reading registered in 1997. lyons, however, isn't exactly feeling bullish about a repeat of that.\n\nthis reading implies a significant level of potential longer-term risk, he says. if the market does start to head meaningfully lower, this condition could exacerbate the decline, given the amount of capital with the potential to exit the market. in such an event, the substantial potential risk could, thus, become manifested risk.\n\nread more:bullish sentiment for u.s. stocks is at a seven-year high\n\nkey market gauges\n\nit's a flat morning so far in u.s. markets, with the dow djia, -0.46% and s&p spx, -1.48% slightly lower as the nasdaq comp, -3.02% sneaks into positive territory. europe sxxp, +0.40% , meanwhile, is up a bit. asian equities adow, -0.94% were mostly higher ahead of the region's earnings season this week.\n\nbitcoin btcusd, +0.94% is back below $16,000, pacing a retreat for the broader crypto market. gold us:gch8 is leaning lower, while crude us:clh8 is higher. read market snapshot for more.\n\nthe buzz\n\nshh! elon musk's spacex successfully launched a falcon 9 rocket carrying a secret government payload into orbit on sunday night from cape canaveral. not much in the way of details about the classified mission have emerged, other than that it includes a satellite built by northrop grumman noc, +1.41% .\n\nactivist shareholders want apple aapl, -3.39% to help kids kick their iphone addictions. the stock is off fractionally early.\n\nchip maker nvidia nvda, -4.64% , which enjoyed a huge 2017, has landed uber as a self-driving tech partner to kick off the ces conference.\n\ncelgene us:celg says it will buy blood-disease specialist impact biomedicines for as much as $7 billion. the stock is off on the news.\n\nsee:why 2018 is a make-or-break year for pharma\n\npfizer pfe, -0.06% is done trying to discover new drugs for alzheimer's disease and parkinson's disease. too costly and, to this point, too futile. the cutback will cost 300 jobs in cambridge and andover in massachusetts and in groton, conn.\n\nthe call\n\ngeneral electric ge, -2.65% was the dog of the dow in 2017, losing almost half its value during the broad market rally. well, 2018 is a completely different story so far, with ge and its 6% surge beating all other blue chips.\n\nof course, it's only been a few days, but that's enough to trigger a potential breakout, according to the street's jonas elmerraji, who uses this chart to paint a bullish picture for the coming months.\n\nafter lagging the rest of the dow in a big way for the last year, this is a mean-reversion trade, elmerraji writes. now, just to be clear, higher ground for the last four or five sessions alone isn't a signal that ge's last year of selling is over. instead, that turnaround is being signaled by where those recent sessions have left shares.\n\nspecifically, he says ge is now trading around its 50-day moving average, and a move above that means a change in trend that could deliver the goods. this could be the start of a big, sustained move in this industrial sector giant, he says.\n\ncheck out:2018's best-performing blue chips support the dogs of the dow theory\n\nthe quote\n\ni think that what the point is, is that his role has been greatly exaggerated, whereas the president hasn't gotten the due that he deserves for the movement that he put together to tap into the kinds of people whose life concerns don't get a lot of attention on cnn. — oh, which one to choose?

the cost of college is a major challenge for students interested in pursuing a degree. for students behind bars, affordability can be an obstacle that's essentially impossible to overcome.\n\nnew research suggests that making it easier for people in federal and state prisons to pay for college would not only benefit the inmates themselves, but could provide also a broader economic boon.\n\nif lawmakers were to lift the ban on prisoners accessing pell grants — the money the federal government provides to low-income students to pay for college — the wages of all formerly incarcerated people would go up by $43.5 million during the first year of release, according to a report released wednesday by the vera institute of justice, an advocacy organization focused on the criminal justice system, and georgetown university's center on poverty and inequality.\n\nthe researchers estimate that if 50% of the eligible prisoner population took advantage of the program and took post-secondary classes while behind bars their likelihood of employment after release would on average jump by nearly 10%. the employment rate among all formerly incarcerated workers would also rise 2.1%.\n\n 'having a post-secondary credential is one way to demonstrate that this person a has the skills and wants a life of economic opportunity.'  — —margaret dizerega, a project director at vera institute of justice\n\nwhat's more, making it easier for prisoners to pay for college while incarcerated would actually save states money — to the tune of $365.8 million per year — by cutting down on the likelihood that participants would return to prison.\n\ngiven that some college is becoming more necessary than ever to compete in today's economy, it only makes sense that making it easier for students to take classes behind bars would improve their chances of success once they leave, said margaret dizerega, a project director at vera and one of the authors of the study.\n\npeople with conviction histories face a lot of barriers to employment and housing, dizerega said. having a post-secondary credential is one way to demonstrate that this person a has the skills and wants a life of economic opportunity like anyone else.\n\nthe findings come amid increased urgency from both sides of the political aisle to address the consequences of mass incarceration on those who wind up in the criminal justice system and on society more broadly. the research suggests making college more affordable is one tool policymakers could use to mitigate some of these challenges.\n\nright now, about 64% of inmates in state and federal prison are academically qualified to take college courses, according to the report, but most don't have access to these programs and even if they do, they likely can't afford the tuition, dizerega said.in 2014, the latest year for which data is available, just 9% of incarcerated people received a certificate from a higher education institution while in prison.\n\n a provision in the 1994 crime bill banned prisoners from accessing pell grants. if lawmakers were to lift that ban, 463,000 prisoners could become eligible. \n\none reason it's so difficult for people behind bars to take college courses — a provision in the 1994 crime bill banned them from accessing pell grants. if lawmakers were to lift that ban, 463,000 incarcerated individuals would become eligible for the funds, the study found.\n\neven if every single one of those students took advantage of the opportunity to use a pell grant, an extremely unlikely scenario, costs to the financial aid program would only rise about 10%, the report published wednesday found.\n\nthere appears to be some momentum for reversing the ban. the obama administration launched a pilot program in 2015 to provide access to pell grants for some prisoners as a way to test the impact of a possible policy change.\n\nthough, at the time, some republicans criticized the notion of spending federal financial-aid funds on incarcerated individuals, that experiment continues under the trump administration.\n\nthere's a much greater understanding of the size and the scope of our mass incarceration problem in this country, then when lawmakers put ban on providing pell grants to inmates in place, dizerega said.\n\nincreasing access to higher education for people behind bars is part of a broader conversation that has bipartisan support to think about how to help people successfully come back to our communities, she added.
the powerball jackpot is now so big that someone might actually win all of it.\n\nthat's not about the odds or the pace of actual ticket sales and how many numerical combinations will be covered by the tickets. it's about the way the jackpot is paid out, and how this jackpot is so ginormous that it might change the way the typical lottery winner claims their prize.\n\nthe thought process is worth covering because while you aren't winning this lottery (again), work may someday give you the same choice as the winner on whether to take a lump-sum payment or go with long-term distribution of money you've earned.\n\nthe current lottery frenzy has revived stories of losers turned lucky, folks who squandered their winnings in a storm of bad decisions, mis-spending, family greed and more.\n\n it never occurs to most winners that the annuitized payout is really about putting a damper on stupidity, mistakes and greed. \n\nread:what time is the powerball drawing?\n\nbut those tales of woe start when the winner takes his jackpot in one big check instead of annuitizing the returns over 30 years.\n\nwhen someone claims their jackpot in a lump sum, the only way she is paid the actual amount everyone is talking about is by taking it in payments spread over three decades.\n\nin a lottery with a more pedestrian jackpot of $400 million, the lump sum for a solo winner amounts to a bit less than $225 million, pre-taxes. the 30-year payout distribution of the full $400 million would start with a payment of $7 million, and grow over time.\n\nstill, you can understand why a winner promised hundreds of millions wants something much bigger — and less budget-conscious — as they transition to their new, rich life.\n\nalso see:these are the taxes you'd pay on a powerball jackpot\n\nit never occurs to most winners that the annuitized payout is really about putting a damper on stupidity, mistakes and greed.\n\nthis week, however, the grand prize is so big that even the annuity payments are staggering.\n\naccording to usamega.com, if one person wins the current lottery and the jackpot is $1.5 billion, the lump-sum payout will be $930 million. after federal taxes are withheld — and uncle sam requires that 25% of the winnings are withheld, but the winner presumably owes closer to 40% overall — the payment is a bit under $700 million, which may face additional state withholdings. if state tariffs are at the 5% or 6% rate, the net payout will be at or below $650 million. (the confusing discrepancy between what is withheld versus what someone at the top tax rate must pay is why plenty of past lottery winners wound up in tax trouble with uncle sam.)\n\nnow let's figure out the annuity payout, which amounts to 30 average annual payments of $50 million, pre-tax. after the federal tax withholdings, that's an average of $37.5 million per year, according to usamega.com. a 5% state tax would reduce it to an average of $35 million.\n\nhere's where people misunderstand how the annuity works.\n\nin that example with the $35 million average payment, the first net payment — after the 25% federal withholding and the state taxes — would be about $16 million. the 30th installment would be north of $65 million.\n\nthe total pre-tax payout would be the $1.5 billion, with the winner (and family/heirs) collecting $1.05 billion.\n\nburied in all that math are some targets of the decision-making that investors and savers go through.\n\nyou've won the $1.5 billion powerball. whom should you call?\n\nthe basic decision here for most people is simply: which way gives me the most money in the end?\n\nthat result would depend on how much of the lump-sum is invested and the rate of return that money generates, weighed against not only the annuity payout but any savings/investing done with portions of that money.\n\nwhile the annuity puts a cap on how much dumb stuff the winner can do in any given year, any person analyzing an annuity needs to be comfortable that the firm behind it is not going to default.\n\nconsidering whether the payee will honor the annuity is where the lottery choice can actually help investors looking at lump-sum payouts offered as a retirement incentive or as a means for a company to get former employees out of a pension plan.\n\nin these cases, the saver can either keep their pension benefits or take a lump sum. as with the lottery, the lump-sum option is very attractive, even when it's not some enormous amount.\n\nlike a lottery winner, people focus on what they can do now with the $25,000 or $50,000 they're offered for a small pension, rather than on the ability to secure a lifetime income.\n\nask a financial planner for help and they are likely to say to take the payout, because you can put the money to work and get a better result in the end; they're right, so long as they're also not giving stupid advice about what you invest in when trying to generate those superior returns.\n\nhere's what i tell everyone who gets that offer to trade a pension for a lump sum, said stan haithcock, known as stan the annuity man. about 80% of the time, the issuing company has a higher payout than you could get on the street, meaning you are better off sticking with the pension.\n\nhaithcock said that if the pension was going to generate retirement income of $3,000 per month, the person considering a lump-sum offer should see if the big payout could buy an annuity that replaces or improves upon the pension payout.\n\ndo an apples-to-apples comparison to at least see if the lump-sum offer is a good one, haithcock said. you have other decisions to make about what you might be able to do if you invest the lump-sum and in evaluating the safety of your pension and the company's ability to pay it, but start with a direct comparison of what you can get with the money they are offering you.\n\nin the end, there's not really a right or wrong decision, so much as mistakes that lottery winners and ordinary workers with pension benefits want to avoid. ultimately, it's important to consider the choices rather than lunging at the fast-cash-now option. after all, the odds of having any additional jackpots are even longer than the chances you have with a big choice on a lump sum in the first place.\n\nread:america's biggest powerball players live in this little state

futu holdings ltd., a hong kong–based online brokerage that is backed by chinese internet giant tencent holdings ltd., has become the first big asian initial public offerings of 2019.\n\nthe company

smartphone, tablet or desktop computer and offers news, data, research and analytical tools and social media.\n\nhere are 5 things to know about futu ahead of its ipo:\n\nit has a young and loyal customer base\n\nfutu says its average client is 34 years old and is typically a high earner, with 45% working in the it, internet and financial services fields. since the beginning of 2017, it has retained about 97% of its paying client base, according to its prospectus.\n\nhow alibaba and tencent became dominant in mobile payments\n\nfutu designed its platform with the aim of allowing access to low-cost investment for everyone, including customers with little or no market experience. its commission rates are about one-fifth of the average rate offered by the leading players in hong kong, according to its prospectus, citing an industry report that it commissioned from oliver wyman consulting (shanghai) ltd. that same report found that hong kong is the world's fourth biggest online securities market, with annual trading volume growing to $1.6 trillion in 2017 from $404.5 billion in 2012, equal to a compound annual growth rate of 31.3%. the market is expected to grow to $3.1 trillion by 2022.\n\nthe company is expecting to benefit from china-based investors deploying more of their overseas investable assets in online securities trading, especially in hong kong and the u.s. the market for overseas online retail securities reached $297.5 billion in 2017, according to oliver wyman. it's expected to grow to nearly $1.4 trillion by 2022, equal to a cagr of 35% from 2017 to 2022.\n\nit's operating in a market that is still evolving — with an uncertain regulatory outlook\n\nthe hong kong online-based brokerage service industry is in the early stages of development, and regulations and other requirements are still in flux and may change over time.\n\nwe are subject to extensive and evolving regulatory requirements in hong kong, noncompliance with which, may result in penalties, limitations and prohibitions on our future business activities or suspension or revocation of our licenses and trading rights, and consequently may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operations and prospects, reads the ipo prospectus. in addition, we are involved in ongoing inquiries and investigations by the hk sfc.\n\nthe investigations in question related to anti-money-laundering laws, practices relating to protection of client assets and handling and monitoring of client orders and trading. the company is also involved in regulatory inquiries relating to client onboarding, and it concedes that it does not strictly follow the steps set out by the hong kong authorities when dealing with clients from mainland china.\n\nif our online account opening procedures are deemed to be not in compliance with the applicable laws, regulations, guidelines, circulars and other regulatory guidance, we may be subject to regulatory actions, which may include, among other things, reprimands, fines, remediation, limitations or prohibitions on our future business activities and/or suspension or revocation of futu international hong kong's licenses and trading rights, says the prospectus.\n\nit has a risky corporate structure that is typical of chinese ipos\n\nlike other chinese companies with listings outside of china, such as alibaba group holding ltd., futu is a variable-interest entity, or vie, a structure created in the 1990s as a workaround for chinese companies not allowed to have direct foreign ownership.\n\nunder the vie structure, the chinese company creates two entities, one in china that holds the permits and licenses needed to do business there and the other an offshore entity, in this case in the cayman islands, in which foreign investors can buy shares. the chinese entity, which is usually owned by top executives, pays fees and royalties to the offshore company in contractual arrangements. the risk is that foreign investors don't actually own stock in the company, and local management or even the chinese government could force a split with the listed company, leaving u.s. investors high and dry.\n\nyou may face difficulties in protecting your interests, and your ability to protect your rights through u.s. courts may be limited, because we are incorporated under cayman islands law, the prospectus cautions.\n\nit's not planning to pay dividends any time soon\n\nlike many newly listed companies, futu is not planning to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. that means shareholders will have to count on share-price gains for returns.\n\nit's exempt from certain disclosures\n\nfutu has applied to list as an emerging-growth company, a category that exempts it from the full disclosures required of big public companies. but it has its accounting challenges and has already identified a material weakness in its internal controls dating back to 2017 and acknowledges that, as a private company, it did not have the accounting expertise and resources needed to address the issue.\n\nif we fail to establish and maintain adequate internal controls, we could suffer material misstatements in our financial statements and fail to meet our reporting obligations, which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. this could limit our access to capital markets, adversely affect our results of operations and lead to a decline in the trading price of the adss, says the prospectus.
a joint session of the new congress will meet on wednesday, jan. 6, to count the electoral votes cast following the november presidential election and officially confirm joe biden as the next president of the united states.\n\nthough this outcome is all but certain, supporters of president donald trump are intent on using the session to promote their commitment to him and trump's baseless claims, according to election and constitutional experts, that he lost the election due to widespread voting fraud.\n\nhere's what to know as the vote approaches:\n\nwhat happens on jan. 6?\n\nthe constitution and federal law dictate that a joint session of congress will convene at 1 p.m. eastern time at the capitol, in the house of representatives chamber, to count the electoral votes.\n\nvice president mike pence will preside over the session in his constitutional role as president of the senate. (if for any reason, pence is forced to step away from the proceedings, sen. chuck grassley would fill that role as president pro tempore of the senate, the iowa republican said tuesday.) in alphabetical order, he will open the electoral-vote certificates presented to him and hand them to tellers to have them read aloud.\n\nwho will challenge the results?\n\nat least 12 republican senators and potentially upwards of 140 house republicans will formally object in writing to the electoral results submitted by battleground states including pennsylvania, michigan, wisconsin, arizona, georgia and nevada, according to reports.\n\nit had been known for several weeks that house republicans planned to submit formal challenges, but under federal law, pence would have been required to dispense with them unless a senator joined in the protest.\n\nin recent days many republican senators have come forward, including missouri republican josh hawley and texas republican ted cruz, to say that they will also formally challenge the results in several states.\n\nwill alternate electors be considered?\n\nin the aforementioned battleground states, republican state legislators there met to protest the official vote count in their state and to vote on an alternate slate of electors who support donald trump.\n\nthough these republicans argue the constitution gives state legislatures the ultimate say in who wins a state's electoral votes, in none of these states were these votes officially held by state legislatures, rather they were put forward by informal groups of elected officials.\n\nnevertheless, there is speculation that vice president pence will submit these trump electors for congress to consider.\n\nto the extent such sham electors have transmitted documents to the joint session, it would be proper for vice president pence to disregard them outright, wrote attorney joshua matz in a monday report issued by the nonpartisan voter protection project. if he does open and read such documents, members of the house and senate should be prepared to submit objections.\n\nwhat happens following a challenge?\n\nif both a representative and a senator object to a slate of electors, the joint session will recess and both the senate and house of representatives will debate the question for a maximum of two hours. if republicans force two hours of debate for each of the half dozen states in question, it could mean the proceedings drag on to the early hours of thursday morning.\n\nafter that time, each chamber will hold a vote by simple majority on whether to accept or reject the objection. given that senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and several other prominent republicans in the senate have urged their colleagues not to mount these challenges, it's unlikely that even a republican senate would vote to accept these objections.\n\nwith democrats in control of the house of representatives, it's difficult to imagine that the body would vote to reject any states' slate of biden electors. according to federal law, for a state's slate of electors to be rejected, both houses of congress would have to agree to do so.\n\nthere can be no doubt that the joint session will select joe biden as the next president of the united states, matz tweeted monday. there may be sound and fury on january 6, but it will not change the outcome.

in his excellent new book, the longevity economy, mit agelab director joseph f. coughlin makes a compelling case that too many businesses fail to recognize or understand older consumers. let me tell you about a new and intriguing business that's bucking this trend by wisely serving people 50 and above. it's called the freebird club and it might change the way you or your parents travel.\n\nthe freebird club: an airbnb for people 50+\n\nthink of the freebird club as the airbnb for the 50+ set, with a hint of match.com thrown in.\n\nthe freebird club, founded by a young, zealous irishman named peter mangan, lets people 50 and older host in their homes other people who are 50+ and traveling. the one requirement for hosts of the peer-to-peer social travel and homestay club: they can't just hand over the keys. they need to be home some of the time their guests are visiting so they can mingle and have fun together.\n\nthe freebird club (not to be confused with the lynyrd skynyrd power ballad signature song) isn't just about helping people 50+ find a place to stay on vacation. it has two greater purposes: 1) providing income for older people who need it and 2) curbing social isolation among older people by letting travelers and their hosts share time together. according to a 2013 national academy of sciences study, social isolation and loneliness are associated with a higher risk of mortality among people 52 and older.\n\n'building bridges to an age-friendly world'\n\nin reality, most freebird members are in their 60s and older. i was going to do the freebird club for people 60 and older, mangan told me. but all the advice i got was to attract people in their late 50s and up by keeping the minimum membership age down to 50.\n\nmangan's slogan for the freebird club: connecting senior explorers and building bridges to an age-friendly world.\n\nhis dad, owen — a retired, widowed veterinarian — was the inspiration for the travel service. peter, who lives in dublin, had been renting out a cottage he had in county kerry, ireland, through airbnb to bring in extra income. his dad, who was in his 70s, took care of the property.\n\nmy father was doing most of the meeting of the guests on my behalf. he was living alone and adjusting to that phase of life. and he was using words like 'boredom' a lot, says mangan, a former banker. but what was enjoyable for him was meeting the older guests who came to stay. they'd go to the pub together and go sightseeing and have dinner. there was real bonding. the common denominator was their age group.\n\nmangan realized this was something airbnb wasn't doing. if i could make it a social club more than a travel accommodation, i can really do something in the aging space, he thought.\n\nwhen it comes to retirement, 60s are the new 50s\n\nthe freebird club: winner of a 2015 competition\n\nafter tinkering with the idea a bit, mangan brought it to the 2015 european social innovation competition, run by the european commission, and he won. at the time, mangan was senior manager for research innovation at university college dublin (ucd), his alma mater.\n\nnext, mangan moved to london for three months to enter a boot camp accelerator program with mentors in the aging and business sectors.\n\nwhen i went to london, the first thing i did was search airbnb for two weeks, looking for older-looking hosts i could stay with to see what it would be like. there were very few, says mangan. i stayed with nine hosts and found some wanted to chat and some didn't — they just wanted to give me their keys.\n\nin 2016, mangan left his college job to become a full-time freebirder and the freebird club won the aging 2.0 global startup search in london. the site went live with a soft launch in september 2016; it launched officially in april 2017.\n\na club to empower older adults\n\nwe don't want to be considered just another travel accommodation site, mangan says. we're more of a club for older adults. freebird, he adds, is about empowering older people and giving them opportunities to be mobile and vibrant.\n\nit costs 25 euros (roughly $30 currently) to become an approved freebird club member. initially, mangan says, i thought it would be free to join. but experts didn't like that. they said people will trust it more if only people who paid are in the club and that this would increase the level of security and trust. plus, it would generate some upfront income.\n\nyou can charge any amount you like to rent out your home as a freebird member. freebird's fees are similar to airbnb's: it charges guests 12% above the rental fee and charges hosts 3%, to cover processing costs. in the u.s., freebird members often charge guests between $50 and $100 a night.\n\nthe freebird process: you click on the join club button, provide a few basic personal details, complete a simple profile description and pay the one-time membership fee. once you're a member, you can list your available accommodation by clicking on the become a host button. if you prefer to travel as a freebird guest, you can search on the site for places you'd like to visit and look for freebird hosts there.\n\nfreebird staffers — at least 50% of whom must be over 50 — interview all prospective hosts and read reviews from hosts and guests after each stay.\n\nfreebird also has a buddy system for security: an adult child might be the buddy of a parent traveling through freebird, gaining access to information about the hosts and notifications about the parent's stay. we don't want to be 'big brother,' but we want to provide a sense of comfort for people who'd never dream of using airbnb, says mangan.\n\nits no. 1 nationality: americans\n\nafter aarp ran a piece about the freebird club last year, we got 300 to 400 people in three or four days. it was really amazing. the idea really resonated with a lot of people, says mangan.\n\nalready, freebird has 1,500 members in 38 countries from australia to the u.s.; americans are its no. 1 nationality. twenty-five percent of members who joined last month are american, says mangan. there are currently 30 freebird hosts in the u.s., spread across the country.\n\nto build an in-house tech and web development team, amp up marketing and boost its customer service, the freebird club is now raising money through a crowdfunding campaign on indiegogo, which ends dec. 16. the goal: 150,000 euros.\n\nmangan hopes freebird will ultimately spread its wings and help members search online for things to do together so they can meet up around interests.\n\nsome members have said jokingly that they could see a romance part taking off, he says. we'll see where it goes.
before the holidays, we talked about how u.s. mortality improvements have fallen behind other high-income countries so that the united states is now at the bottom of that group in terms of life expectancy. it is also interesting to look at how the rate of mortality improvement in the united states has varied over time.\n\nthe figure below shows the u.s. age-adjusted mortality rate from 1900 to the present. in 1900, about 28 men out of 1,000 died in a given year; by 2016 that number had dropped to 9. mortality rates have always been higher for men than for women, although the gap appears to be narrowing in recent years. with the notable exception of the flu pandemic in 1918, mortality rates have generally dropped year after year.\n\nthe question of interest is the pace at which mortality rates decline — rapidly or slowly. the figure below shows the annual improvement in mortality rates for men and women combined since 1900. two points are worth noting. first, the rate of change varies significantly over time. second, we are currently in a downward part of the cycle today.\n\nlooking at the most recent period between 1975 and 2016, the pattern of declining, then increasing, and now declining rates of mortality improvement could be explained as follows:\n\n1) declining mortality improvement between 1975 and 1989. this period could be characterized as one in which the new drugs and technology for heart disease and stroke identified in the 1970s and 1980s were only beginning to have a positive effect and the impact of male smoking two or three decades earlier continued to have a negative effect on mortality improvement. further, the initial surge in mortality improvement due to the introduction of medicare and medicaid had petered out.\n\n2) rise in mortality improvement between 1990 and the mid-2000s. on the favorable side, the new drugs and technology became more universal and the decline in male smoking began to have a favorable impact. in addition, the decline in female smoking had a positive effect in the 2000s. at the same time, improvements were tempered by the rise in obesity.\n\n3) decline in mortality improvements since 2005. the decline could be attributed to the exhaustion of the positive effects of the cardiovascular drugs and technology. that is, once everyone at risk of heart disease is already taking a statin, further dissemination cannot increase the rate of mortality improvement. similarly, the gains from the decline in male smoking have mostly run their course, although the gains in the decline in female smoking continue. and the negative effects of obesity are hampering improvements in mortality.\n\nwhat to do in your 50s to build wealth for your retirement\n\nthe question is whether recent fluctuations say anything about mortality projections over the next century. will the future mirror the past, with mortality rates of improvement fluctuating around the long-term rate of about 1% a year, or are the big gains behind us, with mortality improving less rapidly in the future? it matters.
donald trump meant what he said during the campaign about trying to keeping american jobs in america.\n\nas the opening salvo in his make america great again playbook, the tweeter-in-chief has been shaming american companies that offshore high-paying american jobs to factories in other countries, with some apparent minor successes that will do more to burnish trump's reputation as a dealmaker than they will to help working americans struggling to make ends meet.\n\non tuesday, ford motor co. f, -1.58% announced a reversal of its plan to invest $1.6 billion in a factory in mexico to build small cars, and said it would invest a lesser amount in a factory in michigan to build electric vehicles. that news came just hours after trump slammed general motors co. gm, -1.30% for importing compact cars into the u.s. from its mexican production facility.\n\nmy ride: restoring america's first muscle car\n\non the surface, it looks as if trump's bullying tactics are working, even before he takes the oath of office and makes good on his threat to impose hefty tariffs or taxes on any imported products manufactured in those offshored factories.\n\nfirst, united technologies corp.'s us:utx carrier heating and cooling unit backed off from a plan to offshore a few hundred jobs from an indiana plant to mexico, and now ford is doing the same thing. but we never hear about the thousands of jobs that are lost quietly. or the thousands of new hires that don't make the evening news.\n\nalso read: ford's mexico shift shows trump's bully pulpit has some value\n\ntrump has been focusing his ire almost exclusively on american companies that are moving production to mexico as he prepares to make good on his promise to tear up and renegotiate the north american free trade agreement (nafta) with canada and mexico.\n\nbut, as with a few other corporate announcements that trump has touted as endorsements of his plans to rewrite the rules of global trade, there was less than met the eye in the ford announcement. yes, ford ceo mark fields flattered trump in his statement, but it's clear that ford made the decision to cancel the new mexican factory for one reason only: it no longer made economic sense.\n\nalso read:ceos pandering to trump risks dangerous 'caudillo capitalism'\n\nthe ford announcement reveals the hidden danger of trump's bullying tactics: corporations may be eager to give trump some credit for decisions they'd make anyway, which will bolster trump's confidence that there's nothing wrong with american manufacturing that can't be solved by getting tough. tear up the treaties, impose some tariffs, bully some ceos, and — voila! — america is back!\n\nthe reality is more complex, of course. american companies (and european, and japanese and chinese companies as well) aren't putting some of their production in mexico just to take advantage of a poorly negotiated nafta. they are investing in mexico because it's a great place to do business. and trump can't change that reality with a tweet or a tariff.\n\ngerman, japanese and korean auto makers are expanding their production in mexico not to take advantage of any claimed unfair rules under nafta, but because mexico is a good place to build cars. for starters, labor costs are much cheaper in mexico ($8.24 an hour vs. $46.35 in the u.s. and canada). the manufacturing supply chains are robust. the mexican peso usdmxn, +0.01% is weak, giving its manufacturers another advantage.\n\nbut perhaps the biggest advantage mexico has is something donald trump doesn't want to talk about: mexico has free-trade agreements with more countries than anyone else. those treaties mean that, if you want to export cars to north america, to south america, or even to europe, it makes sense to build them in mexico.\n\nread more from the center for automotive research about mexico's auto industry.\n\ntrump thinks he can bully ford and gm into abandoning mexico, and maybe he can, sometimes.\n\nbut the economics of manufacturing in mexico (and in many other low-cost regions around the world) are too compelling for any multinational corporation to ignore. trump can probably make it prohibitively expensive to import anything into the united states, but that wouldn't reverse mexico's advantages in producing for a global market, especially if our trading partners retaliate with tariffs or otherwise restrict u.s. exports.\n\ntrump thinks he can reverse centuries of globalization with a tweet or two. he thinks he can restore america's glory by building tariff walls against the world. but trump cannot repeal the laws of economics that give multinational corporations every incentive to cut their costs any way they can.\n\nu.s. factories assembled more than 12 million vehicles in the past year, not far from the peaks set in 1979 and in 2000.\n\nyou never heard trump say it on the campaign trail, but ford, general motors, fiat chrysler us:fcau, toyota tm, +2.65% and the rest still build cars in america because it's the smart thing to do. we have competitive advantages too.\n\namerican workers need a president who knows america's strengths as well as its weaknesses.
hong kong (marketwatch) — those fearing that china is the big risk in the year ahead for global markets hope that the first trading day of 2016 does not set the tone for the rest of the year.\n\nbetween a 7% fall in shares that triggered new circuit breakers on the shanghai shcomp, +0.51% and shenzhen stock exchanges 399100, +0.81% and accelerated weakness in the yuan, there is ample fodder for china bears.\n\nthe question being posed anew is whether 2016 will be the year beijing finally throws in the towel on its attempts to coerce multiple asset markets upwards, while its economy continues to sink in a sea of debt.\n\nwhile yet more weak industrial activity numbers from the caixin china december pmi got the new year off to a flat start, the bigger concern is whether the leadership still has the will or the ability to continue holding up stock prices as its confronts ever more painful policy choices.\n\nchinese markets slammed shut after stocks tumble\n\nthe black start to january trading had its roots in the controversial government intervention last summer to rescue stocks from a rout, which wiped over $4 trillion off share values and sent shock waves around global markets.\n\nthis appeared to have paid off after a subsequent partial market rebound, yet it always left a worrying overhang both from resulting heavy state ownership and the imposition of a six-month ban on major shareholders (over 5%) from selling positions.\n\nwith that six-month moratorium ending this coming friday, investors were spooked that there could be an avalanche of pent-up selling.\n\nand this time around will the government still be around to come in as buyer of the last resort?\n\nlast week i wrote that as the value of both china's currency and equity markets are so dependent on government intervention, this presents an important and hard-to-quantify risk factor.\n\nmust read:china faces even more painful choices in 2016\n\nsome $500 trillion of foreign reserves were used up last year to support the yuan and money mobilized to buy stocks has been estimated at 5 trillion yuan or 10% of gross domestic product.\n\nthe beginning of the year already appears to signal that authorities are dialing back on intervention, at least to support the currency. the yuan trading fix on monday was set a full 100 basis points lower, putting it below 6.5 to the u.s. dollar usdcny, +0.03% for the first time in more than four years.\n\naccording to daiwa research, today's yuan gap down is likely due to continued capital outflows and stronger yuan selling pressure after the holidays. they contend beijing is trying to orchestrate an orderly currency adjustment lower, a view supported by the december change in moving to valuation based on a trade-weighted basket.\n\nbut the risk here is that it can be difficult to maintain control when expectations build that the currency is set on a depreciation path. this can lead to a snowball effect with capital outflows, says daiwa.\n\nthe japanese broker also forecasts that the dollar-yuan exchange rate could fall to 7.50 by the end of 2016. if a move of this size were to materialize you could still get a much less orderly exit out of the yuan and chinese assets, including equities.\n\nwhile there have been various comments from officials that there is no need to devalue the yuan, it is notable that chinese companies have been positioning for further currency weakness.\n\nas well as a reduction in yuan deposits in hong kong and taiwan, mainland chinese companies have been buying commercial property in the territory, which gives exposure to the hong kong dollar usdhkd, -0.01% . over the festive holidays there was unusual activity in the property market when an apartment sold at a record price of hk$594 million, or hk$100,000 per square foot.\n\nanother reason to be alert for a shift in government policy is the recent comment by president xi jinping. he was quoted in the mainland press saying that china will face increasing challenges over the next five years for which strong stimulus to boost development is no longer the solution.\n\nthe priority for beijing now appears to be restructuring its loss-making heavy industries, with painful commodity price falls showing few signs of easing up.\n\nanalysts warn this will come with a large bill to clean up bad debts and provide support for laid-off workers.\n\ngiven these shifting priorities, it is hardly a stretch to conclude that it would be politically difficult for beijing to keep extending unlimited funds to bail out equity investors.\n\nultimately when beijing created a market when it was the only buyer, it also placed itself in an extremely exposed position.\n\nif investors suspect the state is no longer ready or able to step in, expect chinese equities to fall fast.
scott rieckens and his wife taylor were living what many people might consider a dream life: renting a house across the bay from san diego, working hard but also playing hard, whether regularly hitting up hot new restaurants, joining the local boat club or enjoying flashy weekend trips. after their daughter jovie was born in 2015, they hired a nanny for $2,500 a month.\n\nin 2016, the couple brought home $142,000 after taxes and saved just over $10,000.\n\nso rieckens would hardly describe himself as frugal by nature.\n\nbut when he happened to catch an interview with a blogger who calls himself mr. money mustache (he's really pete adeney) discussing how to become financially independent and retire early, also known as fire, the then-33-year-old entrepreneur pulled over in his car and kept listening.\n\nthat moment in early 2017 launched his journey into the fire movement. more changes followed, including a search for a cheaper place to live. that led them to bend ore., a fast-growing city of around 100,000 from where taylor, now 33, works remotely for her family's recruitment business.\n\nalong the way, the couple, who met after college, have turned into savers. they have found new ways to communicate about money, including a monthly budgeting meeting bookended with pizza and a movie. they imposed a three-day waiting period on amazon purchases to curb impulse purchases.\n\ni can't tell you how many things are in the 'save for later' basket that have not been bought, he said.\n\nbut the journey to healthier finances — rieckens estimates it will be another six or seven years until they achieve financial independence — hasn't always been smooth.\n\nfriends didn't always understand what they were doing; one asked if they had joined a cult. they've wrestled with both straying from their budget, almost buying a house that was well above their new budget, and taking too extreme a view on savings.\n\nyour burning personal and credit-card debt questions, answered\n\nrieckens, who has written a book about their first year turning around their finances, titled playing with fire, and is putting the finishing touches on a documentary on the same theme, discussed the ups and downs with marketwatch. answers have been edited for clarity and length.\n\nq: what day did you start fire? not just hear about it but decide this is it, for real, and start?\n\na: the first day we felt we were 100% committed was aug. 1, 2017 -- the day we drove away from san diego and headed out for a cheaper life. there was no turning back.\n\nq: what's been a big challenge for you?\n\na: a lot of people we've met along the way were naturally frugal, we are the exact opposite. that was our first hurdle — we are going to have to significantly change the way we are living. and that's hard for anyone, no matter what you are accustomed to.\n\nwe had struggled with budgeting for years. we'd accumulate credit-card debt and pay it off. it was a vicious cycle. i can remember starting multiple times to cut back and then it would feel like deprivation. or three or four weeks without eating out felt like centuries and if you got that far, then you really had to go out to eat to celebrate not going out to eat.\n\nq: what's been the biggest surprise?\n\na: i was surprised at how simple this was. the simplicity is phenomenal, but that doesn't make it easy. it's a flexible framework. it's not hard-and-fast rules.\n\nq: you make no secret that your wife was not immediately sold on fire. how did you get her on board?\n\na: deprivation and frugality wasn't going to work. so i focused on happiness. i knew that would resonate with her. i asked her to write the top 10 things that make her happy on a weekly basis. a week is about as far down the road you want to look in a busy life.\n\ni looked at her list, and wine and chocolate were the only things that cost money. the beach was not on the list, and we spend a lot of money to live by the beach. so i said if you come on this journey with me, you can have lots of wine and chocolate because it's a lot cheaper than what we're doing now.\n\nit took longer to get the bmw out of the driveway.\n\nq: suze orman was recently quite blunt about fire, saying i hate it. i hate it. i hate it. i hate it. your reaction?\n\na: all i heard with suze's interview was fear. i thought what is your problem? i am just choosing freedom.\n\nread:mr. money mustache says suze orman has it wrong on financial independence and early retirement\n\nq: some say it's easy to talk fire if you make a lot of money. how about if you only make $50,000 a year?\n\na: the advice stays the same. the money we make is relative to our lifestyle. if you're having a hard time saving, look at the choices you're making.\n\nhousing, transportation and food are the three biggest expenses. but my advice is to start with the small stuff, because you're proving to yourself you can do it. you're building those habits. once you feel more confident, then you can start looking at those bigger purchases. at that point, you are taking significant steps to reduce your costs and then your $10 purchase doesn't matter as much.\n\nread:you can retire early without adopting mr. money mustache's extreme frugality\n\nq: your income hasn't changed much since you left san diego. what about your spending?\n\na: we were spending almost $3,000 a month in rent. now it's a $2,400 mortgage payment. we have one car, and we paid $6,500 in cash. it's an older car, so insurance is less. we used to spend $1,000 a month to lease two cars. our food bill has gone from $2,000 a month to $600.\n\nnew world library\n\nq: do you slip up?\n\na: that happens constantly, and sometimes i feel pretty bad about it.\n\nfor example, i still love going to a coffee shop and getting a coffee. i love the ambiance and talking to people. i just love it. so i want that $3 coffee, and then i feel like i'm not upholding my end of the bargain.\n\nour solution has been a monthly allowance. now it's guilt-free. you've got your 50 bucks and i've got my 50 bucks, and there's no judgment. and it's been great for our relationship.\n\nq: how much are you saving?\n\na: we got to a 70% savings rate, but that wasn't sustainable, and we had to pull it back. fire is not about losing your happiness. so now it's at 50%. some months are better, some less.\n\nq: what about feelings of being deprived?\n\na: we have never really been deprived while pursuing fire. that's because you must consider the thing you are denied or lacking to be a necessity. and one of the first gifts we received from the fire blogs and podcasts was the reframing of the necessities in our lives.\n\nq: any parting advice?\n\na: you don't have to get everything right. we have not gotten everything right. i judge it as are we better off than we were? and we are certainly better off than we were last year.
if the federal reserve had mechanically followed the simple mathematical rule for setting interest rates developed by stanford university economist john taylor, 2.5 million more americans would be out of work today, said minneapolis fed president neel kashkari on thursday.\n\nover the past five years, kashkari said the taylor rule would have called at times for much higher interest rates, almost has high as 3% over some periods, while the fed kept them close to zero.
one of twitter's most beloved features is set to change: the company is planning to extend its 140-character limit to as many as 10,000, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\ntwitter's twtr, -1.79% loud and devoted user base was quick to bemoan that such a change — expected to be announced by the end of march — would spoil the brevity and speed of the real-time service. the character limit that forces users to pen snappy tweets could give way to the longer essays found on facebook fb, -0.06% , for example. it could transform twitter into more of a public blogging platform rather than one that is succinct and well-suited to quips and breaking news headlines.
as we head into 2017 and consider new year's resolutions that usually involve dieting, here's an idea that can make you, or someone you care about, a lot of money: take full advantage of the company 401(k) match. yes, a lot of money.\n\nin may 2015, financial engines released the results of a study that concluded workers in the u.s. were leaving $24 billion a year on the table because they don't contribute enough to take full advantage of employers' matching 401(k) retirement-plan contributions.\n\na 401(k) is a tax-deferred retirement plan that allows you to contribute a portion of your salary before taxes. the money is then invested according to your selections and remains tax deferred. the price is that you cannot withdraw any of the money until the year you turn 59 and a half, without paying a penalty. then, when you are retired and begin withdrawing the money, it will be taxable income, presumably at a lower rate.\n\ndon't miss: ditch your new year's resolutions and set three realistic money goals for 2017\n\nbut what can be even more significant is that many employers offer matching contributions, up to a certain percentage of your salary.\n\nhow credit scores predict what you will buy next\n\nlet's say your annual salary is $75,000. your employer offers, for example, a match of up to 5%. (in my own experience, the lowest employer match i was ever offered was 3%, and the highest was 8%.)\n\nin this example, if you were to contribute 5% of your salary, or $3,750 a year, to your 401(k) account, your employer would also contribute $3,750 a year. contributions are typically made every pay period. the bottom line is: each of your contributions would earn an immediate 100% return — a doubling of your initial investment. you will need to check to see how long it takes for the employer's contribution to be vested. this means you may lose recent matching contributions if you change employers. for some companies, after an initial vesting period, all employer matching contributions are immediately vested.\n\nchances are, especially if your career has decades to go, that your 401(k) money will be invested in stock mutual funds, including low-priced index funds. that instant 100% return provides plenty of downside protection. yes, it's a tall order to sock away 5% of your gross pay. it may feel as if you took a painful pay cut. but watch your account grow, and you will be amazed.\n\nhow about a new year's resolution, each year?\n\ndespite that wonderful 100% return if you contribute what your employer is willing to match, you should consider, over time, working your way up to making maximum annual contributions to your 401(k).\n\nthe operative word here is consider. maxing out your 401(k) contribution isn't for everybody. your salary might not be high enough. or you might have another opportunity to invest money outside your 401(k) to make even higher returns. maybe so, but if you do not contribute to a retirement account, will you really make other investments, or will you simply spend the money on a larger house, a better car or more toys?\n\nthink about it.\n\nthe maximum annual 401(k) contribution is $18,000 a year, and you can contribute an additional $6,000 a year if you are at least 50 years old. here's more information from the irs.\n\nthat's a lot of money, especially for our example of a $75,000 salary, for which $18,000 in contributions would amount to 24%.\n\nbut you can start small. let's say that, in our example, you begin by contributing 5% a year to take full advantage of the match. over the years, as your salary increases or you get promoted or move on to higher-paying jobs, you might slowly increase your annual contributions. how about increasing it by at least 1% per year? eventually you will be maxing out your contributions, without feeing too much pain in any one year.\n\nhere's another example, this time with a $100,000 annual salary. you still receive a 5% match for your contributions, but you also max them out at $18,000 a year.\n\nthe employer's 5% match comes to 28% of your annual contribution. that is a wonderful instant return on your investment, and a very high level of downside protection, if the stock market has a bad run.\n\nand here's a bit more icing on the cake. check out this s&p 500 spx, -1.48% chart:\n\nmarketwatch\n\nas you can see, the three-year trend is favorable, despite the occasional decline. decreases may be worrisome, especially if you look at the stock market's results every day. but your 401(k) contributions would continue to be made as long as your employer pays you, so you would have paid lower prices and beaten the market's overall return.
a mob stormed the u.s. capitol on wednesday, but investors showed little reaction — lifting the dow jones industrial average to a record close and showing little appetite for traditional safe-haven assets despite violent scenes that temporarily interrupted the ratification of president-elect joe biden's electoral college victory.\n\nthat's because the invasion of the capitol did nothing to change expectations around the near-term political and economic outlook.\n\nread: presidential election confirmation paused in congress after protesters storm capitol building in washington\n\ninstead, the driving force behind the session's stock-market gains and other financial-market moves appeared to be optimism over the prospect for another, larger round of aid spending following a democratic sweep of a pair of runoff elections in georgia that will give the party control of the senate as president-elect joe biden prepares to take office on jan. 20. democrats retained control of the house in the nov. 3 elections.\n\nno matter the political consequences of today's takeover of the capitol, wall street continues to be encouraged by the economic-enhancement possibilities of a democratic 'trifecta,' sam stovall, chief investment strategist of cfra, told marketwatch in an email after wednesday's market close.\n\ninvestors have also remained upbeat about the potential for vaccine rollouts to allow a wider economic reopening, despite snags in distribution and worries about a more rapid spread of covid-19 as a result of new variants.\n\nsee: democrats win georgia's runoff elections, giving their party control of u.s. senate\n\nstocks were in rally mode before the onset of the violence.\n\nwhile stocks did pare gains, they finished the session solidly higher. the dow jones industrial average djia, +0.58% rose 437.80 points, or 1.4%, to close at a record 30,829.40 after earlier breaching the 31,000 threshold for the first time. the s&p 500 spx, +0.29% advanced 0.6% to close at 3,748.14, just 0.2% away from its all-time high finish, while the nasdaq composite comp, +0.40% lost ground to end the day with a loss of 0.6%.\n\ntreasurys, which tend to serve as a haven during periods of unrest and uncertainty, instead saw prices fall, driving up yields. the 10-year yield tmubmusd10y, 1.664% rose 8.6 basis points to 1.041%, finishing above the 1% level for the first time in nine months.\n\nthe u.s. dollar, which also tends to find support during periods of chaos, was also largely unfazed. the ice u.s. dollar index dxy, +0.08% , a measure of the currency against a basket of six major rivals, was little changed near 89.41.\n\nit was surprising, however, to see how little the market reacted overall, said edward moya, senior market analyst at oanda.\n\nfinancial markets knew president trump would not go away quietly, but they didn't expect this, moya told marketwatch in an email.\n\ncongress was set to resume the certification process, a key element in the peaceful transfer of power, on wednesday evening.\n\nin the end, the events at the capitol will not change the election outcome and likely raise the importance that the democrats were able to pull off the 'blue wave,' he said, referring to the sweep of the white house and both chambers of congress.\n\ninvestors, meanwhile, see significant ramifications for u.s. policy and the economy as a result of a united government, said kathy lien, managing director of fx strategy at bk asset management, in a note.\n\npresident-elect joe biden will be able to push through more aggressive stimulus packages and fund spending with higher taxes, lien said, noting that sen. chuck schumer, who will be majority leader, has deemed the passage of $2,000 stimulus checks to be a top priority for lawmakers.\n\nmeanwhile, investors are playing down worries over potential tax increases as they focus on prospects for immediate stimulus, she said.\n\nstovall, in a note earlier wednesday, underlined the market-positive factors associated with a unified government, which he said belied the widely held belief that market participants prefer a divided government.\n\nhe noted that all eight democratic presidents since 1900 have been accompanied by a democratic-controlled house and senate, and that the stock market posted above-average performances in the first year of such democratic trifectas six out of eight times, for an average gain of 11.3%.
in an earlier column, i summarized the most important changes in the tax cuts and jobs act (tcja) for small and medium-sized businesses. this column covers some less-publicized, but still-important, changes that can affect businesses and their owners.\n\nnew credit for employer-paid family and medical leave\n\nfor wages paid in tax years beginning after 12/31/17 and before 1/1/20, the tcja allows employers to claim a tax credit equal to 12.5% of wages paid to qualifying employees while they are on family or medical leave — as long as the employee is paid at least 50% of his or her normal wage while on leave. the credit rate is increased by 0.25% for each percentage point that the wage rate paid while on leave exceeds 50% of the normal rate. however, the maximum credit rate is 25%. finally, to be eligible for the credit, the employer must give all qualifying full-time employees at least two weeks of annual paid family and medical leave. part-time employees must be given proportional leave time.\n\nfaster depreciation for some real estate\n\nfor property placed in service after 12/31/17, the separate definitions of qualified leasehold improvement property, qualified restaurant property, and qualified retail improvement property are eliminated. under the tcja, they are now lumped together under the description of qualified improvement property, which can be depreciated straight-line over 15 years. under prior law, such property generally had to be depreciated over 39 years, which is a long, long, time.\n\nfaster depreciation for new farming machinery and equipment\n\nthe tcja shortens from seven to five years the depreciation period for new machinery and equipment that is placed in service after 12/31/17 and used in a farming business (other than grain bins, cotton ginning assets, fences, or other land improvements).\n\njeff bezos's vast wealth has reached uncharted territory\n\nless-favorable treatment for carried interests\n\nprivate equity funds and hedge funds have historically been structured as limited partnerships. under prior law, so-called carried interest arrangements allowed private equity fund and hedge fund managers to give up their right to receive current fees for their services and instead receive an interest in future profits from the private equity/hedge fund partnership. these arrangements are often called carried interests because the private equity/hedge fund manager doesn't pay anything for the partnership profits interest. also, the private equity/hedge fund manager is not taxed on the receipt of the carried interest because it's not considered a taxable event.\n\nthe tax planning objective of carried interest arrangements is to trade current fee income that would immediately be treated as high-taxed ordinary income and be subject to federal employment taxes for a partnership profits interest that is expected to generate future long-term capital gains that will be taxed at lower rates. nice. you can see why this ultra-favorable tax treatment of carried interests is controversial.\n\nfor tax years beginning after 2017, the tcja imposes a three-year holding period requirement in order for profits from certain partnership interests received in exchange for the performance of services to be treated as low-taxed long-term capital gains rather than higher-taxed ordinary income. that's an improvement.\n\nself-created intangibles no longer qualify for capital gains tax rates\n\neffective for dispositions in 2018 and beyond, the tcja stipulates that certain intangible assets can no longer be treated as favorably-taxed capital gain assets. this change affects inventions; models and designs (whether or not patented); secret formulas; and processes that are: (1) created by the taxpayer or (2) acquired from the creating taxpayer with the new owner's basis determined by the creating taxpayer's basis (such as an acquisition by gift or by contribution by the creating taxpayer to another entity such as a corporation or partnership).\n\npartnership/llc technical termination rule eliminated\n\nunder prior law, a partnership (or an llc treated as a partnership for tax purposes) was terminated for federal income tax purposes if, within a 12-month period, there was a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the partnership's (llc's) capital and profits interests. this so-called technical termination rule is generally unfavorable because: (1) it can require the filing of two short-period tax returns for the tax year in which the technical termination occurs, (2) it restarts the depreciation periods for the partnership's (llc's) depreciable assets, and (3) it terminates favorable tax elections that were made by the partnership (llc). thankfully, the tcja repeals the technical termination rule, effective for partnership (llc) tax years beginning in 2018 and beyond.
millennials, the generation born between the early 1980s and the mid-to-late 1990s, make up about one-third of today's u.s. workforce. they are better educated than previous generations, with a greater proportion of them possessing a college degree. because they have lived through the great recession, they are more risk averse. they are also more likely to begin to save earlier in their careers.\n\nmany millennials believe they will need to take action on their own to save for their retirement. four out of five millennials surveyed are worried that social security will not be there for them when they are ready to retire. not surprisingly, 55% cite self-funded savings as the expected primary source of retirement income according to a recent survey by the transamerica center for retirement studies.\n\nread: millennials are getting older — and that's good for stocks\n\nbut today's 53 million millennial workers face challenges when it comes to saving and investing for their retirement. this generation is disproportionally burdened by money-related stress, with 24% reporting that student loan debt is the source of this stress, according to a recent survey by charles schwab. and 72% of millennial workers surveyed by transamerica agree that they do not know as much as they should about retirement investing and, among those participating in a retirement plan, a quarter admit to being unsure of how their savings are invested.\n\nread: this is how your finances should look in your 20s\n\nhelping the youngest workers today understand the importance of securing their long-term financial well-being is an investment that will yield significant benefits. how soon and for how long an individual saves is important because of the power of compound interest. for example, compare a person saving $100 a month starting at age 27 with a person saving the same amount starting at age 37. the first will have contributed just one-third more by age 67, but would accumulate twice as much in savings, assuming a 6% annual rate of return.\n\neverything we thought about millennials' money habits was wrong\n\njob mobility creates challenges\n\ntoday's younger workers are more likely to work in nontraditional job settings and more likely to switch jobs than other age groups, according to bureau of labor statistics (bls) data. the median job tenure among workers age 25 to 34 (2.8 years) is less than one-third of older workers age 55 to 64 (10.1 years). what's more, 55% of jobs held by those ages 18 to 28 lasted less than one year, and 70% of jobs lasted no more than two years. the challenges that come with frequent job changes include not staying long enough to become fully vested in the company 401(k) plan, the failure to roll over their retirement savings into new retirement plans, or forgetting about their account altogether when they change jobs.\n\nit's not only job mobility that can hinder saving for retirement. millennials either out of necessity or because they are attracted to the schedule flexibility often freelance or work more than one gig job. today almost half of working millennials do freelance work and one-third of them are full-time freelancers, according to a 2017 study by upwork and freelancers union.\n\nread: experts say this is the ideal retirement savings timeline\n\nbut this often means greater income instability and losing access to benefits such as employer-sponsored retirement plans. workers are much more likely to save if their employer provides a retirement plan. more recently, new state-facilitated retirement savings programs as well as new low-cost, simplified mobile fintech (financial technology) platforms offer the potential for greater access to ways to save for gig employers and workers.\n\neverything you need to do in your 20s for a great financial future\n\nthe value of behavioral nudges and financial wellness\n\nworkers under 30 are more likely to identify as do it for me investors than workers over 30, expressing that they want advice from investment professionals, and indicating they would appreciate notifications such as alerts when they are not saving enough, according to j.p. morgan asset management. they also prefer features in their 401(k) plans such as automatic enrollment and automatic contribution escalation. such nudges could prove effective, especially when transamerica reports that 52% of millennials surveyed admit that they guessed the figure needed to save for retirement and only 10% used a retirement calculator or work sheet.\n\nmillennials have a lower level of financial literacy than older workers. many of the most important financial decisions, including investing in higher education, saving for retirement, and purchasing a home, are made early in adult life. addressing common budget challenges young workers might face such as paying off student loans, mortgages, and credit card debt, could help them save for retirement. for example, it is not necessarily true that a young worker cannot or should not save for retirement if they carry any debt. while it certainly makes sense to pay off a high-interest loan, a young adult may be better off in the long run putting some money away for retirement while also paying down a low-interest student loan. providing opportunities to focus on the bigger picture of financial wellness can help workers better navigate these competing financial demands while encouraging planning and budgeting for unexpected expenses.\n\nthe greatest success and gains in strengthening retirement security will not come from helping workers who are already close to retirement age. it will come from helping the youngest workers understand the importance of starting to save as early as possible, and making saving easier.\n\nin a recent survey of retirement plan participants by american century investments, 90% would tell their younger selves to save more. in 2016, the population of millennials surpassed the baby boomers. with the rise of the gig economy and the lack of access to traditional employer-sponsored retirement plans, new thinking about financial education and wellness, new retirement savings products and programs, and the value of behavioral nudges is needed to encourage young working adults to begin to save sooner so they can save more for their retirement.\n\nangela m. antonelli is a research professor and the executive director of thegeorgetown center for retirement initiativesat the mccourt school of public policy.
did you ever think a faang stock might be considered a value stock?\n\nthey're not near that level yet, but the group of large-cap technology stocks suffered during the fourth quarter of 2018, and with another year of excellent sales growth expected for most of them, you might be looking at buying opportunities.\n\nhere's a chart showing total returns for the faangs — facebook fb, +2.02% , amazon.com amzn, +0.33% , apple aapl, +1.27% , netflix nflx, +0.73% and google holding company alphabet's class c shares goog, +1.26% — since the end of 2017:\n\nfactset\n\nnetflix and amazon came out well, despite the fourth-quarter pain.\n\nhere are returns since the end of the third quarter:\n\nfactset\n\nyes, they are ugly, but you might return to being a believer in some of the faang stocks when you see the consensus sales growth expectations. first, take a look at forward price-to-earnings valuations, based on consensus estimates for the following 12 months, for the group:\n\nfacebook's forward p/e ratio didn't decline significantly from the end of september. however, the stock was already down 7% for 2018 through the third quarter, and the consensus earnings per estimate for the company for 2019 has declined 9% to $7.42 a share from $8.15 at the end of september.\n\nlofty valuations for netflix and amazon — paradigm shifters that always trade high to earnings — have declined significantly.\n\nread:can netflix clear a high bar of investor expectations for a change?\n\napple and alphabet have also seen big declines in forward p/e valuations. investors weren't surprised when apple ceo tim cook explained a tremendous cut in the iphone maker's sales forecast on jan. 2; the stock was down 32% during the fourth quarter (with dividends reinvested).\n\nprice targets and 'buy' ratings\n\nanalysts expect double-digit share-price increases for all the faang stocks from these reduced levels over the next year:\n\nso a clear majority of sell-side analysts polled by factset favor all the faang companies except for apple, for which slightly less than half of analysts have buy or equivalent ratings on the shares, with all remaining analysts having neutral ratings for apple.\n\nyou might be wondering how much the price targets have dropped since the end of the third quarter:\n\nprice targets are down for all the faangs except netflix.\n\nbacking up the enthusiasm\n\nfor the faang companies, investors remain fixated on sales growth. here's what analysts expect:\n\nanalysts expect slower economic growth in the u.s. in 2019 in great part because sales and especially earnings received a tremendous boost from the dramatic cut in federal corporate income-tax rates. sales for s&p 500 spx, -0.16% companies are expected by analysts to increase by 5.3% in 2019 and again in 2020, slowing from 9.3% in 2018.\n\napple stands out, as you can see, with analysts expecting a slight decline in sales this year and marginal improvement during 2020. then again, it is, by far, the cheapest stock among the faangs on a p/e basis. it will be fascinating to see if cook decides an acquisition would be a good way for the company to deploy its mountain of cash.\n\nhere are analysts' expectations for earnings per share:\n\nanalysts expect eps for the s&p 500 to increase 21.8% for 2018, followed by 6.5%in 2019 and 11.1% in 2020.\n\ndon't miss:these beaten-down stocks are expected to roar back in 2019\n\ncreate an email alert for philip van doorn's deep dive columns here.
dear moneyist,\n\ni would like to know your advice about how adult children can protect themselves from the financial obligations of their parents.\n\nmy brother and i were raised in poverty and my mother still lives beneath the poverty line with government assistance covering some of her expenses. she has many medical issues and does not work. she is approaching 70 years of age.\n\nmy brother has a wife and two children and lives in another state. i am married with no children and live a few miles from my mother. we both have decent jobs and are what i would consider middle-class suburbanites.\n\nour relationship with my mother has been strained for many years. there is not a lot of contact between my brother and our mother, or expectation of assistance emotionally or financially. it has been this way for many years. there are no hard feelings on this front. my relationship with my brother is strong.\n\ni have assisted my mom financially since i started working as a teenager. about 10 years ago, i got married and bought a house, had a very demanding job plus responsibility for my mother's medical, financial and emotional well-being. when i had medical issues of my own, it was all too much to handle and i landed in therapy.\n\nread:i (secretly) charge an hourly rate for caring for my mom\n\nwhile i still care for and provide for my mother, i learned the co-dependent relationship i had with her was unhealthy and i have scaled back significantly.\n\ni pay for her to have high-speed internet service at her home. i activated the service to be able to work from her house during a stretch of major medical issues where she needed someone to be with her. she now has a home health aide (government provided) three days a week and i have not found myself in that situation in over a year, but i still consider the wi-fi insurance, so i keep it. i also include her on my family cellphone plan. i bring her household items and groceries on every visit.\n\n i no longer pay for any more of her debt. she uses her money on things i would consider careless and frivolous, but it is her money and i no longer intervene or express my frustration.  — cindy in n.y.\n\ni no longer pay for any more of her debt. she uses her money on things i would consider careless and frivolous, but it is her money and i no longer intervene or express my frustration. she

bring to my attention in the past and i would pay past-due balances, late fees and reconnection fees — regularly. i no longer offer to do that. over the years she has gotten the message and she really doesn't push them on me anymore. it has relieved a lot of stress from my relationship with her. however, now they are just ignored and pile up without any action.\n\ntoday, it is very important to me to focus on my well-being, which means not returning to our previous relationship which left me damaged financially and emotionally. at the same time i have a lot of stress and anxiety about where this will leave me if and when (a) she passes on, (b) a decision has to be made to change her living situation (in my home or a nursing home) or (c) something major happens, like a legal judgment against her.\n\nmy husband is financially smart. without him, i would have likely traveled down the same financial road as my mother. with him, i have had the guidance and support to pay off years of mounting debt, buy a house and start saving for retirement. the thought of taking a hit to everything we have worked so hard to build causes a lot of stress. my husband has concerns about me not acquiring her debt and/or expenses when the time comes and he feels it will destroy us financially. i don't disagree with him. i just struggle with doing right by everyone.\n\ni don't know what i would be responsible for financially as her daughter when she is truly incapable. i'm not sure if it's smarter to move her in with us or start to look into assisted living/nursing homes, especially if

with your brother and a relationship with your mother that is based on love and service, while maintaining healthy emotional and financial boundaries. you have since learned that you can't do everything, nor should you have to do everything.\n\ni'm glad that you finally realized that you cannot live her life for her. you deserve a happy life, one where you are free to enjoy the small moments and look forward to a secure future. that's nothing to feel guilty about. plenty of children would have walked away. you didn't. this is something that your mother was either unable or unwilling to provide for you. in the face of remarkable odds, you provided it for yourself. and yet you are still thinking of others.\n\n you deserve a happy life, one where you are free to enjoy the small moments and look forward to a secure future.  — the moneyist\n\nmoving your mom in with you seems to run counter to your desire to maintain healthy boundaries, says anne tumlinson, founder of daughterhood, a washington, dc-based organization that provides information and resources to people caring for aging parents. that's not necessary in new york. additionally, your mother is already obviously on medicaid so you don't need to worry about whether your mother will qualify, which is usually a huge thing given people's assets and incomes that usually need to be spent-down first.\n\nyou are not alone. an estimated 43.5 million adults in the u.s. have provided unpaid care to an adult or a child within the prior 12 months, according to the 2015 report caregiving in the u.s. by the aarp public policy institute, the advocacy group for americans aged 50 years and older. more than 18% of the respondents interviewed reported being caregivers. the majority of caregivers are female (60%), the aarp said, and the average caregiver is 49 years of age.\n\nthe moneyist: how to deal with a stingy friend\n\nit's highly unlikely that you would be held responsible for your mother's debts when she passes on. don't co-sign any loans and maintain a clear line between her finances and your own and keep an eye on your credit score, in the unlikely event that your mother would take out a loan in your name (especially if you shared the same first name). unless you are a co-signer on a debt, you are in no way liable for your mother's debts, says blake harris, an attorney at mile high estate planning in denver. there isn't anything you need to do aside from continuing to follow your husband's wise financial advice.\n\nsome 28 u.s. states have so-called filial responsibility laws, which can be traced back to colonial times and (in theory) impose a duty on adult children to support their impoverished parents. those states don't include new york. here's a list of the other 28 that do have those laws, even if they don't practice them. one of those states is pennsylvania, which did use filial responsibility to force an adult child to pay his mother's bill. in 2012, pennsylvania court ruled that john pittas must pay his mother's $93,000 nursing home bill after she moved to greece. otherwise, they are rarely enforced.\n\nthe aarp and other organizations have helpful guides for preparing to care for an elderly parent. this includes figuring out what your mother's needs might be and forming a team (that includes your brother and husband). there are many online resources to see if she qualifies for public benefits of state, federal, and private programs that help pay for groceries, prescription drugs, health insurance and home help. the best time to think about these issues is now, before there's a crisis. and, as my former colleague elizabeth o'brien wrote, take care of yourself too.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance,

expansions don't die of old age. they get murdered. — ben bernanke\n\nall it took was some wild swings and big losses in u.s. stock prices for the r word — recession — to start tripping off people's tongues.\n\nand not just run-of-the-mill observers.\n\nalmost half of the 134 u.s. chief executive officers surveyed by the new york times last month said they expect the u.s. economy to be in recession by the end of 2019. that forecast was echoed by almost half of the chief financial officers who participated in the duke university/cfo global business outlook survey in december. (it would appear that the inhabitants of the c suite communicate with one another!)\n\nalso read:powell says fed is 'watching and waiting' on interest rates\n\nthere is nothing in the data to suggest that the u.s. economy is about to hit the skids. yes, global growth is slowing, and tariffs are starting to bite, disrupting global supply chains, raising input costs and cutting into corporate profits. but the domestic economy, especially the labor market, has yet to show any significant signs of stress.\n\nto the contrary, friday's powerhouse of an employment report for december, with its 312,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls, upward revisions to the previous two months, rising labor-force participation and the biggest increase in hourly earnings for production and non-supervisory workers since the great recession, was nothing if not encouraging for an expansion that will turn 10 in june.\n\nexpansions don't die of old age, of course: an adage former federal reserve chairwoman janet yellen reiterated last week at a panel discussion with her predecessor, ben bernanke, and successor, jerome powell, at the annual meeting of the american economic association in atlanta. two things usually end them, she said.\n\none is financial imbalances, and the other is the fed.\n\nyellen went on to say that when the fed is the culprit, it is generally because the central bank is forced to tighten policy to curtail inflation and ends up overplaying its hand. (she didn't mention that the fed's monetary policy may have a hand in creating financial imbalances.)\n\nwith inflation showing little sign of veering from the fed's 2% target, and inflation expectations well-anchored, the fed is under no pressure to bring out the heavy artillery.\n\nbernanke elaborated on yellen's point, accusing the central bank of, in essence, murder. it takes an aggressive act on the part of the monetary authority to bring an expanding economy to a halt and cause it to shift into reverse.\n\nbernanke has history on his side.\n\nthe fed's murder weapon is aptly encapsulated in the pictorial representation of the yield curve, or term structure of interest rates. when the central bank raises its benchmark, short-term rate to a level that exceeds that on a risk-free, long-term rate, such as the 10-year treasury note tmubmusd10y, 1.619% — that is, when the term spread inverts — a recession is sure to follow, with an average lead time of 14 months.\n\nan negative term spread suggests that the expected short-term rate, as reflected in the long rate, is below the current short-term rate. the implication is that the economy will require an infusion from the monetary authority — specifically, reductions in the benchmark rate — to revive it.\n\nin the past, the fed has consciously inverted the curve, finding all sorts of reasons to assert that this time is different, that an inverted curve doesn't mean what it has always meant in the past.\n\nthis time around, there has been such intense focus on the curve, both instructive (fed research on the powerful signal inherent in the term structure) and frivolous (market chatter that attaches some importance to a short-lived inversion between, say, 3- and 5-year notes), that the fed may be more circumspect about tapping the brakes if the next adjustment in interest rates is certain to push the funds rate above the yield on the 10-year treasury.\n\nin an interview with the wall street journal on wednesday, st. louis fed president james bullard warned against additional rate increases in the absence of inflationary pressure, citing the recession risk being telegraphed by the long end of the bond market, which is driving the yield-curve flattening.\n\nten-year treasury yields declined by almost 70 basis points in the last two months: from 3.24% in early november to 2.55% last week amid the stock market rout before inching their way back to 2.72% in the wake of friday's solid jobs report. in that same period, the fed has raised the funds rate by a mere 25 basis points to a range of 2.25% to 2.5%.\n\nwith long rates defying the fed, policy makers really need to be patient because one more rate increase, all things equal, will invert the term spread.\n\npowell used all the right buzzwords and phrases to calm markets on friday. he said (i'm consolidating here) that there is no preset path for policy; that, given muted inflation, the fed can be patient and see how the economy evolves; that we are listening to the markets and are always prepared to adjust policy quickly and flexibly to promote our statutory goals of maximum employment and stable prices.\n\nand that willingness to change policy applies to balance-sheet normalization as well as to interest rates.\n\nthe stock market could not have written a more perfect script. and the wait-and-see message was re-enforced wednesday with the release of the minutes of the dec. 18-19 meeting, the tone of which was much more deferential to global economic and financial market considerations than powell let on at the time of his post-meeting press conference.\n\nthe current spread between the effective funds rate and 10-year treasury is about 30 basis points. historically, a spread that narrow has been either a precursor to inversion (the fed ignores the signal and keeps raising rates) or the start of a capitulation (the fed realizes the error of its ways and begins to ease aggressively).\n\nshould the fed, with malice aforethought, invert the curve, i am confident this time will not be different in terms of the economic outcome. the only thing we can hope is that the fed's response is different.
last thanksgiving, after months of planning a trip to paris around a sweet $350 round-trip flight deal i had found, i made my way to the airport after a day of stuffing my face with friends in brooklyn — but not quite quickly enough.\n\ni left my friend's apartment in brooklyn two hours before my 11 p.m. flight and called a local car service. everything that could go wrong went wrong. the driver arrived 20 minutes late, complained he hadn't slept in three days, and erratically took the slowest route to jfk through crowded holiday traffic. i arrived at 10:10 p.m. — an hour after i had left my friend's place and 50 minutes before my flight.\n\nnorwegian air nas, -0.26% informed me its system does not allow passengers to check in less than an hour before a flight, and no amount of pleading could change it. (airlines must submit passenger lists to u.s. customs and border protection.) determined to salvage my trip, i paid $600 for a flight the next day, kicking myself for not arriving earlier and vowing to be hours early from now on when i travel. i asked norwegian not to cancel the return leg of my $350 flight, and the airline agreed.\n\nmy replacement flight never left the runway\n\ni arrived at the airport five hours early the next day so as to not make the same mistake again. i sat in the terminal with a book. my flight was supposed to board at 8:30 p.m., but when that time came the flight had been delayed. and delayed again. and again. finally, after allowing passengers to board at 1 a.m., the pilot announced the plane had to be evacuated due to a mechanical error.\n\ni was back to square 1, and my flight, once again, was rescheduled for the next day. already three days late to the airbnb i had paid for in paris, i decided to give up, for now, on my dream of seeing the city of light. i called the airline to cancel my flight, and my credit card was immediately refunded the $600 one-way flight — as well as my $350 original flight, essentially erasing my dumb financial mistake of arriving to the airport late, because they were both on the same ticket.\n\nthen a facebook group for travelers alerted me to another silver lining: norwegian airlines owed me $700.\n\nthe reason for my unexpected $700 windfall\n\nunder eu regulation 261/2004, passed in february 2005, passengers whose flight arrival at its final destination is delayed by three hours or more are entitled compensation of between 250 and 600 euros, depending on the distance of the flight and the amount of delay. in my case, that amounted to €600, or $722 at current exchange rates.\n\nin europe many passengers know about the strict guidelines regarding long delays on airlines and are quick to claim what they're owed, said brian sumers, airline reporter for travel analysis site skift, but the refund policy is little-known in the u.s.\n\nthat's a shame, because for many passengers this is easy money, he said. sometimes airlines are open about what passengers are entitled to. other times they're more cagey and rely on travelers to do the research.\n\npassengers can also use a third-party service like airhelp that can badger an airline on your behalf, even taking it to court if it denies payment. airhelp takes a slice of the payment — around 25% — in exchange for its services: €63 ($78) on compensation of €250 ($301), €100 ($120) from compensation of €400 ($480) or €150 ($180) of €600 ($722). it only charges passengers if their claim is successful.\n\ncompensation rules are stricter for u.s. airline passengers\n\nunder u.s. regulations, benefits are scarcer: travelers are only entitled to food, water and access to toilets within two hours of the start of a delay. they are also entitled to updates every 30 minutes regarding the status of the flight and what's causing the delay, if known.\n\nhere's how workplace diversity can help companies boost profits\n\nairline travelers in the u.s. don't have as many rights as eu travelers when it comes to flight delays, cancellations and boarding denials on domestic flights, airhelp's chief executive officer, henrik zillmer, said.\n\nstill, airhelp recommends that passengers experiencing long delays or canceled flights hold on to their boarding pass and any other travel documents, request an alternate flight to their destination, and negotiate with the airline for compensation for inconvenience.\n\ncustomers who are individually bumped from a flight because it is overbooked, not because of a delay or cancellation, are entitled to 200% of their one-way fare in compensation in cash if their delay is more than one hour but less than two, according to federal regulations. if the delay is more than two hours, they are entitled to 400% of a one-way fare in cash.\n\nas for me, i continued to receive text updates about the flight i'd decided not to board to paris, which finally left three days later — after more than 80 hours of delay. i saved all of my receipts and sent a detailed invoice of expenses incurred in my 24-hour airport saga to norwegian.\n\nmore than a month later, i was contacted by a company representative agreeing to pay me $800: $700 for the eu regulation 261/2004, $50 for my taxi home after my first canceled flight, and $50 for food i ate at the airport. the $800 i received minus the $100 in costs incurred at the airport and $260 in money i lost on the airbnb left me with $440 in profit from my failed paris trip. i may use that money toward planning another vacation to europe in the new year. and what airline will i chose? despite all the delays — norwegian.\n\nbut next time i'll make sure to arrive early.
one of disney's dis, -1.28% most popular vacation promotions aims to feed travelers' hunger for savings, but is the deal all it's cracked up to be?\n\non wednesday, disney released the details of its latest free dining promotion for summer 2019. the deal gives travelers booking a stay at select walt disney world in florida hotels free access to the disney dining plan, which pays for meals at the theme parks and resorts around the complex. under the deal, guests who pay full price for a room essentially eat for free (although the deal doesn't include gratuities.)\n\nthis is the second time this year that disney had promoted a free food deal for this summer. disney previously announced a free dining promotion back in january, which some perceived as a sign that fewer people are booking trips to the most magical place on earth this summer. most people are guessing that they released it early to incentivize travel to disney world, said sue pisaturo, owner of small world vacations, a disney-authorized vacation planning company. it seems that people are holding off making plans until disney announces when star wars land will open later this year.\n\nthe free dining promotion first came about in the wake of the financial crisis and has developed a massive following among disney vacationers, said don munsil, co-owner of the vacation planning website mousesavers.com. people love free food, munsil said. it triggers some primitive impulse inside us.\n\nalso see: walt disney world to eliminate free overnight parking for hotel guests\n\nwhen jennifer mascitti, a stay-at-home mom from atlanta, booked a trip to disney world last september she opted against doing the free dining promotion as her family had done in the past. according to her calculations, the free dining promotion would have actually cost her family an additional $1,200 over what she had paid when she had initially booked her trip with a room-only discount. that's a lot of money to come out of pocket, she said.\n\nand those considering the deal this year might want to follow mascitti's lead. factoring in the other costs, the food is not exactly free. rather, the deal is an enticement on disney's part to get families to stay at its hotels and to visit its theme parks.\n\nhow the free dining deal works\n\nthis time around, disney actually released two different free dining promotions. disney visa chase v, +0.64% card holders will have access to the traditional promotion in which guests will get two free meals and two snacks for each night's stay. to get this deal, they must book a vacation package that includes a four-night stay at select walt disney world resort hotels and five-day theme park tickets with the park hopper option. disney visa chase jpm, -1.20% card holders must pay their deposit with their disney visa to qualify.\n\nthe types of restaurants travelers can eat at with the free dining plan depend on which hotel they are staying at — guests at more expensive hotels have access to a souped-up version of the dining plan.\n\ndisney also released a second dining promotion where guests who book a a non-discounted walt disney travel co. package that includes a four-night stay at the resort's lower-priced moderate or value hotels will get one free quick-service meal per day. the meal includes an entree and a drink. unlike the other promotion, this deal is open to any traveler.\n\nwill the free dining promotion actually save travelers money?\n\na family of four staying at disney's low-cost value resorts will generally pay at least $97 a night for their room. under the disney visa free dining promotion, they must pay the full cost for their room and are also required to purchase the upgraded park hopper or park hopper plus tickets for disney's theme and water parks (these tickets let guests visit different parks in a single day.) the offer may not be combined with any other discounts or promotions.\n\nso for a five-night, six-day stay at disney's all star music resort, a family of four with two kids over the age of 10 (at disney anyone 10 years of age or older counts as an adult) would essentially need to spend upwards of $500 for their lodging and more than $2,000 for their theme park tickets to qualify for the free dining promotion.\n\nmeanwhile, the quick-service dining plan that disney visa cardholders staying at this hotel can get during the promotion costs $52.50 per adult per night. this dining plan entitles guests to two meals at counter-service restaurants and two snacks per night of their stay, plus a refillable mug for drinks. for a five-night stay for a family of four, that would normally cost roughly $1,050. (the dining plan does not cover gratuity.) as such for travelers staying at disney's lower-cost hotels, the value of the free dining promotion can exceed the cost of lodging, making it a good source of savings.\n\ndon't miss:walt disney world will finally welcome dogs at (some) hotels\n\nbut the math changes for people staying at the more expensive moderate- and deluxe-tier hotels because of the higher cost of lodging. those staying at the deluxe hotels will get complimentary access to the standard dining plan through the free-dining promotion, which includes a sit-down meal, a counter-service meal and two snacks per night, plus a refillable mug for drinks. the standard dining plan typically costs $75.50 per night for an adult. they need to compare available discounts to see where the dollar and cents savings are the best, pisaturo said. it's not always free dining.\n\nthe traditional free dining promotion has some significant limitations. the promotion is only available for certain dates and hotels in may through august, and guests must stay at least four nights to qualify. and because travelers with free dining must also pay full price for their rooms and park hopper tickets, they could actually lose out on possibly better savings through getting a separate discount on their hotel room from disney, buying their park tickets through an authorized re-seller or staying at a non-disney hotel, said tom bricker, who owns disneytouristblog.com. you can do a number of things that can save you money, bricker said.\n\nfor instance, disney is also offering up to 25% off hotel stays at certain resorts from may 28 through august 28. those savings could potentially outweigh the value of the free dining plan, depending on the room.\n\nalso, in the past, guests had access to the standard dining plan during the free-dining promotion if they stayed at moderately priced resorts, where room rates start at $200 per night. but starting last year, guests at these hotels now get the quick-service plan during the free-dining offer, which has less value. now it's not quite as easy a decision to make, bricker said. they're not doing this out of some corporate benevolence — they want to increase their occupancy rate.\n\nas for the second promotion disney announced wednesday, which is open to any traveler, the savings are relatively paltry. this promotion is walt disney world's way of catching the attention of potential guests with those magic words that everyone loves (free food!), but without actually offering a great deal, bricker wrote.\n\nsince guests who book through this promotion are only getting a single free meal a day — and the most expensive counter-service meals don't add up to enough to represent true savings compared with other discounts that are available.\n\nread more:how to hurricane-proof a caribbean or florida vacation\n\na big change disney made last year that could benefit guests considering the free-dining offer is that alcoholic beverages are now covered by disney's dining plans. but this too is a situation where visitors' mileage may vary. for instance, families who plan to spend the bulk of their time at the magic kingdom won't see much benefit from the change if they get the quick-service dining plan, because only a few of the theme park's restaurants even serve alcohol. moreover, travelers who don't typically have big appetites won't get their money's worth if they find themselves skipping meals to take in the attractions. the added value can be illusory, bricker said.\n\nlooking to the future though, it seems likely that, if anything, disney will reduce the value of the free-dining offer rather than increase it, bricker said. though higher prices did prompt attendance to drop at walt disney world back in 2017, disney opened a new area at its hollywood studios theme park based on the toy story franchise last summer and is set to unveil a new area inspired by the star wars films this fall. with the record numbers of visitors expected to flock to florida for those attractions, disney won't have as much need for the free-dining incentive in the coming years.\n\npotential budget-busters aside, the free dining plan can be a good option, particularly for first-time travelers, as it removes a lot of the guesswork in planning for food, bricker said. i would definitely consider it, he said.\n\nthis article was updated on april 25, 2019.
democrats' apparent sweep in the georgia senate runoffs means they can dust off some of the lofty legislative plans for 2021 they made before the november election, but experts say they should temper their expectations.\n\nassuming jon ossoff's lead over sen. david perdue holds up, democrats will hold sway over the 50-50 split senate once vice president-elect kamala harris takes office jan. 20 to cast tie-breaking votes in the chamber.\n\nin the house, speaker nancy pelosi will lead a shrunken democratic caucus that will have the smallest majority in years.\n\nthose factors mean democrats will have a narrow path to write legislation that will please a resurgent liberal wing, leave moderates who took the worst losses in the last election mollified, and still be substantive.\n\nwhat's the issue? and then, depending on the issue, the question is whether you're going to lose democrats, said jim manley, a former spokesman for democratic senate majority leader harry reid.\n\nrelated: warnock projected winner, while ossoff clings to slim lead in second georgia race\n\nin the short term, the sweep means another round of economic stimulus to offset the effects of the coronavirus is likely to come sooner and be bigger than otherwise. analysts at goldman sachs said they would expect about $600 billion more in stimulus under a democratic congress, for example.\n\nsenate democratic leader chuck schumer signaled in a statement on wednesday that he expected more covid-19 aid would be coming.\n\nit feels like a brand new day, the new york lawmaker said. for too long, much-needed help has been stalled or diluted by a republican-led senate and president trump. that will change with a democratic senate, democratic house, and a democratic president.\n\nlong-term, given the filibuster and a united republican front, other priorities, like immigration, climate change and infrastructure, will face an uphill climb.\n\nstill, winning the senate has its perks — schumer would set the legislative agenda, hold committee hearings and exercise oversight of federal agencies.\n\ncertainly there are advantages to holding the senate majority —democrats would chair senate committees, set the agenda, and a democratic majority leader could help confirm biden administration nominees, wrote brian gardner, chief washington policy strategist for stifel nicolaus & co., in a note.\n\nhowever, the difference between a 50-50 senate and a 51-49 senate on the ability to pass legislation is small.\n\nrepublicans would still be able to use the filibuster to block major legislation, meaning 60 votes would be needed to move a bill forward and the narrow margin will continually tempt democratic senators to demand concessions from leadership in return for their vote.\n\nthat narrow margin could also incentivize bipartisanship, though. already, a small bipartisan group of senators, working with a similar group in the house called the problem solvers caucus, played a major role in developing the second big coronavirus aid package. it also called for senators to refrain from challenging the electoral college results when the votes were presented to congress.\n\nthe bipartisan group showed in the lame duck that just by demonstrating what is viable at the 60-vote threshold, they can exert significant leverage, said liam donovan, principal with bracewell llp's policy resolution group.\n\ni don't think that's going to be replicable on a regular basis, but if you're biden you look to that group as your legislative litmus test, and the gop rump you can conceivably work with even if the leader needs convincing.\n\nmanley was a bit more wary.\n\nthese groups, at least in recent years, don't have a good track record. they keep getting marginalized in the end, he said.\n\none major consequence of a democratic senate would be the nominees the biden administration sends to capitol hill for confirmation. faced with the threat of democratic filibusters, senate republicans during the trump administration turned to filling the federal judicial ranks with judges they hoped would be friendly to conservative causes.\n\na simple majority allows biden to move his nominees far more quickly, easily, and with a far broader pool of talent to choose from, donovan said.\n\nhaving the senate would also allow democrats to push through some types of legislation with a simple majority, using an optional process called budget reconciliation. while reconciliation bills are filibuster-proof, they are subject to strict requirements on subject matter and budgetary impact.\n\nrelated: biden could use gop trick to open door to 'big things' in 2021\n\nwhile reconciliation could be powerful tool — especially if democrats use it twice in one year, as republicans did in 2017 — the narrow margins in both chambers mean leaders will have to thread the needle in writing bills. repealing some of the 2017 tax cuts would meet the rules and have broad democratic support, for example, while the green new deal would likely have a tougher time on both counts.\n\nit depends on the issue, but in a very narrowly held senate, i don't think it's a given, manley said.\n\nhighlighting the potential ideological difficulties, donovan said reconciliation would allow democrats to within the strictures of the process, move anything that bernie sanders and joe manchin can agree on.
only a couple of the 17 top federal reserve officials pushed for the central bank to expand its purchases of longer-term bonds during the their meeting in december, according to minutes of the discussion released wednesday.\n\nthe fed has been buying $40 billion of treasurys per month since june, with the purchases coming across the yield curve. many economists have argued that concentrating the purchases on the long-end of the curve would add more stimulus to the economy.\n\nthe central bank is also buying $40 billion per month of mortgage-backed securities.\n\nahead of the fed meeting, many economists thought the fed would decide to concentrate more on the longer-end of the yield curve, but the actual support for the support for the move in the meeting was small.\n\nfed officials generally judged that the asset purchase program as structured was providing very significant policy accommodation, according to the minutes.\n\nsome fed officials left open the possibility of weighing purchases of treasurys toward the longer end if necessary, the minutes said.\n\na few officials said it was important that the fed continue to evaluate balance of the costs and risks of the purchases against the benefits.\n\nat the meeting, the fed adopted guidance on the asset purchases, saying the increases in asset holdings would continue until substantial further progress has been made toward reaching the committee's maximum employment and price stability goals.\n\nfed officials generally said that substantial progress was not based on specific numerical criteria or thresholds.\n\nmany fed officials noted that the fed should tell markets clearly its assessment of progress well in advance of the time when the central bank might change the pace of the purchases.\n\nlooming behind this was concern about another taper tantrum when just a brief mention of the possibility of slowing down asset purchases by then fed-chairman ben bernanke caused a rout in the treasury market in 2013.\n\nthe fed said that once the progress was achieved, it would slowly taper the purchases similar to the slow pace during the last program of 2013 and 2014.
(updated with jan. 3 market-close information.)\n\napple's stock has fallen 39% from the all-time intraday high it hit on oct. 3, including a 10% drop on thursday. but as painful as this decline has been for faithful investors, it's not the worst one of the iphone era.\n\nshares of apple aapl, +1.27% were down as much as 10% on thursday, after ceo tim cook said the company's sales for the holiday quarter would total about $84 billion, way down from the company's previous estimate of $89 billion to $93 billion.\n\nread: apple cuts holiday sales forecast on iphone and china weakness\n\nin a letter to shareholders, cook cited the rollout of new products, a strong u.s. dollar and the slowing economy in china as the main reasons for the lower-than expected sales. the new sales estimate of $84 billion for apple's fiscal first quarter would be a decline of 4.9% from $88.3 billion a year earlier. the company estimated its gross profit margin for the fiscal first quarter would be about 38%. a year earlier it was 38.4%.\n\napple's shares closed at $142.19 on thursday, down 39% from their all-time intraday high of $233.47 on oct. 3.\n\nduring the iphone era, which began on june 29, 2007, when the first model of the iconic phone was released for sale, there have been many declines of 20% or more, according to split-adjusted data provided by factset. rather than splitting hairs, to show declines within declines, here's a broad look at declines of 20% or more since the first iphone was sold. the table shows the date ranges of the declines from high to low:\n\nintraday high intraday low price change 07/27/2007 $21.27 08/16/2007 $15.95 -25% 11/07/2007 $27.53 11/12/2007 $21.52 -22% 12/27/2007 $28.99 2/26/2008 $16.49 -43% 05/14/2008 $27.46 07/22/2008 $20.93 -24% 08/14/2008 $25.78 01/20/2009 $11.17 -57% 09/21/2012 $100.72 04/19/2013 $55.01 -45% 04/28/2015 $134.54 05/12/2016 $89.47 -33% 10/03/2018 $233.47 01/03/2019 $142.00 -39% source: factset\n\nso the current price decline from the oct. 3 record high is the fourth-worst of the iphone era.\n\nan iphone-era chart puts the price action into more perspective, showing what an amazing upward run the shares had after their post-credit-crisis low in january 2009:\n\nfactset\n\na price-target cut, but also a 'buy' recommendation\n\nif you consider the challenges in front of apple, including the strengthening dollar, president trump's trade dispute with china, the partially related economic slowdown in china, longer upgrade cycles and some pushback against newer higher-end and higher-priced iphones, it might help to take the long view. economies ebb and flow, the dollar doesn't always rise and trade disputes tend to be settled. apple can also work on its product mix and marketing to recapture its buzz.\n\nin a note to clients on thursday, wedbush analyst daniel ives called apple's cutting of sales estimates late wednesday a bombshell negative preannouncement that will be a defining moment for cook & co. for years to come. he cut his price target for the shares to $200 from $275. but even the lower target would represent a 62% increase for the shares, based on their intraday price on thursday.\n\nives maintained his outperform rating for the shares and said their floor would range from $130 to $140.\n\n[w]e believe going forward this is an installed base story of 750 million active iphones worldwide with 350 million of those in the current window of an upgrade opportunity over the next 12 to 18 months, ives wrote. he then estimated a sum-of-the-parts valuation, assuming the services business valuation is roughly $400 billion on a standalone basis with $130 billion of net cash, would support a valuation between $200 and $210 over the next year.\n\nread:the best and worst stocks of 2018\n\ncreate an email alert for philip van doorn's deep dive columns here.
sterling, anyone?\n\nwith the pound gbpusd, down almost 20% and counting since the brexit vote, investors could be forgiven for giving the u.k. currency the cold shoulder.\n\nbut not if you are alan higgins, the contrarian chief investment officer at coutts & co. in london, the bank famed for having queen elizabeth ii among its clients. he sees the pound's pounding as nothing less than one of the best investment opportunities this year.\n\nwe are buying sterling now, he said. i must admit it's very uncomfortable first thing monday morning, when [a co-worker] says to me: 'are you still buying sterling after the news over the weekend? i said, 'yes, because our principle is looking for value and being contrarian.'\n\nhiggins' contrarian mindset has helped him make big returns before. when investors dumped russian assets in 2014 after the annexation of crimea, the coutts investment manager started to look for value in the region and has benefited from the market shooting higher.\n\nthis past monday morning, the pound slumped to an almost 31-year low against the dollar after media reports said u.k. prime minister theresa may wanted to lead britain out of the eu's single market as part of brexit. the reports were confirmed on tuesday, when may in a highly anticipated speech said she wants the u.k. to control its own border and courts, which isn't compatible with complying with rules that allow access to the single market.\n\nshe also promised to put the final brexit deal to a vote in parliament, spurring sterling to recover some of monday's losses. most analysts, however, still expect the pound to head lower — some even see parity with the euro and dollar — as brexit potentially starts to hit the economy.\n\nbut higgins sticks to his view that the u.k. currency is bound for a longer-term recovery.\n\nthe fact is that sterling is quite a mean-reverting currency against the dollar and the euro. so there's historical evidence to show it does mean revert, he said.\n\n we recognize the political risk and maybe we are wrong and brexit becomes so defining and such a change that it's not business as usual  — alan higgins, cio at coutts\n\nmean reversion refers to the theory that some assets over time eventually moves back toward a mean or average after big slumps or rallies. that indicates that the pound should rebound from its post-brexit slump, higgins explained.\n\nwe recognize the political risk, and maybe we are wrong and brexit becomes so defining and such a change that it's not business as usual, he said. but when looking at the sterling trading around $1.20 and sterling/euro at 1.15 we're saying there's value in the mean reversion trade.\n\nread:how the pound can find a silver lining in europe's 2017 stormclouds\n\nas for higgins's contrarian bet on russia, after a bumpy ride in the beginning, the strategy turned out to give absolutely stellar returns in 2016, he said. the russian micex index xx:mcx , for example, soared 26% in 2015, and by 24% in 2016.\n\nwe bought russian equity and russian debt when it was bumped out and everyone was talking about geopolitical risks. we just saw great value both in the bonds and in the equities. it was painful for a while, but that tends to happen when you have a value and contrarian approach, he added.
the european union is failing, and populism — ordinary folks are rebelling against the hubris of elites — is rising.\n\nthe eu's primary antecedent, european economic community (1957), was structured to bring down barriers to trade — a customs union with antitrust enforcement powers to crack the cartelization of national markets by private and public actors — and permit workers and capital to move freely across borders.\n\nit has since morphed into an expansive bureaucracy that dictates all manner of immigration, economic and social policies but has not attained the democratic institutions and fiscal powers necessary to manage a continental economy.\n\nfree trade always has victims, but the eec delivered dynamic growth from the consolidation of businesses across national boundaries. and just as international economic textbooks predict, the rising tide raised all boats. in recent decades, however, the eu's expanded bureaucracy reach and single currency have not delivered enough growth.\n\nprofessionals in big cities profit from globalization but the working classes in suburbs, smaller cities and rural communities languish. immigrants corrupt local cultures and incubate crime, and burdensome regulations and high taxes make starting a business and affording simple necessities too difficult.\n\npresident emmanuel macron sought to impose a new tax on petrol, which is already terribly expensive in france. the bankers in paris ride the subway but folks in the hinterland must fuel up to get to work. most discretionary driving has already been taxed away — the levy would have had little impact on co2 emissions but create much hardship.\n\nthe gilets jaunes riots inspired macron to react like a man controlled by an alien force. confronted by complaints that fuel taxes were crushing ordinary people, macron lectured about the need to lower carbon emissions and reminded when we change things, we shake up habits and people aren't necessarily happy.\n\nlet them eat cake!\n\nthe eu bureaucracy is now cracking down on duly-elected national governments to force italy to adhere to the eurozone's unworkable national budget rules, hungary to take down its border fence and stop enforcing its national immigration laws, and poland to block its efforts to make its judiciary accountable to polish values and not those of international civil society.\n\nin germany, chancellor angela merkel's open immigration policies have imposed disastrous social consequences and crime. meanwhile her designated successor, annegret kramp-karrenbauer, muses germany through the social market economy and our system of social partnership, we have a system where many issues and conflicts are always discussed and settled in orderly structures.\n\nlet them discuss kant.\n\nbritons sensing the madness voted for brexit but prime minister theresa may did not support leaving. in negotiations, she acceded to nearly every eu demand. now she can't get enough parliamentary or conservative party support for an open-ended transition agreement that could indefinitely impose eu trade policies, regulations and taxes on her countrymen.\n\nunable to keep the u.k. in the eu, may would make it a colony.\n\nbritons should read the declaration of independence, and get a new prime minister — pronto!\n\nthe new leader could inform european commission jean-claude juncker and all the other oligarchs of europe's ruling class that on march 29 — the date the u.k. is scheduled to leave — his government will declare unilateral free trade with europe. it would continue to permit eu banks and professionals to do business and work in the uk if the eu does the same.\n\nbrussels can take it or leave it — remember the continent needs london's financial sector and u.k. markets as much as the u.k. industries needs theirs. if the eu doesn't comply, then london doesn't pay the $50 billion divorce settlement and makes a hard break.\n\nthe transition would be painful for britain but europe will still need london's financial sector to enable its follies — european banking would no more move from london to frankfort than american banking would move to charlotte if manhattan became an independent country.\n\nanyway the future is in artificial intelligence and other such stuff where the u.k. will do a lot better unchained from eu dysfunction.\n\nitaly and others would follow and that would begin the process of returning the eu to its original but more limited mission — free trade!

turkey's central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates at its tuesday meeting. however, few expect it to provide much support for the country's battered currency, the lira.\n\na team of emerging-market strategists at unicredit spa, a large italian lender, said the central bank would need to raise interest rates by more than 3 percentage points to spur what it believes would be a one-to-three month rally in the lira. however, the team believes that such a dramatic move is unlikely.\n\nsuch a move would bring the central bank's benchmark one-week repo rate to 11% (it is presently at 8%). so-called repo rates are short-term repurchasing agreements that typically allow financial firms to borrow from the central bank in exchange for putting up certain securities as collateral. meanwhile, the overnight-lending rate would rise to 11.5% from 8.5%, and the overnight-borrowing rate would rise to 10.25%, from 7.25%.\n\nunicredit believes turkey's central bank will raise rates by three-quarters of a percentage point, a large interest-rate increase the standards of most developed-market, but short of what some economists say is needed for the emerging market.\n\nanything below 100 basis points, such as our base-case of a 75 basis point hike, will almost immediately disappoint…, the unicredit economists said in a note to clients published monday.\n\nto be sure, the central bank has disappointed economists before. at its december meeting, the bank left interest rates unchanged, disappointing economists who, according to a wall street journal survey, had expected the central bank to raise rates by at least a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nturkey's legislature recently backed laws that would drastically expand the powers of turkish president recep tayyip erdogan while allowing him to serve for an additional decade. the proposed constitutional changes must be approved in a referendum before they take effect.\n\nerdogan has frequently leaned on the country's central bank to keep interest rates low, despite sharp declines in the lira, saying it would help bolster the country's business environment by easing access to credit. the central bank cut its overnight lending rate for a seventh straight month in september, a move that elicited praise from the president.\n\nthe market is split on its expectations for tuesday's meeting, according to a bloomberg survey cited by brown brothers harriman. of the 22 analysts polled by bloomberg, four see no change to the central bank's benchmark repo rate, three see a quarter percentage point hike and eight see a half a percentage point hike, two see a three-quarters of a percentage point hike and five forecast a one percentage-point hike,\n\nwin thin, head of emerging-market currency strategy at bbh, believes the central bank will raise rates by half a percentage point, though it should hike by a full point.\n\nin december, president erdogan called on turkish citizens to exchange their euros and dollars for lira to help support the country's battered currency. the lira usdtry, -0.00% touched an all-time low on jan. 11, when it traded at just below four lira to the dollar. on monday, one dollar bought 3.76 lira, compared with 3.77 lira late friday in new york.\n\non jan. 17, the central bank introduced a new currency-swap facility to provide dollars to local banks in exchange for lira. if lira are auctioned at rates above the current market rate, the subsequent rise in borrowing rates could support the lira by fending off speculators hoping to short the currency, unicredit said.
can it possibly get any worse for general electric co.? investors will find out when the struggling industrial conglomerate reports fourth-quarter results before wednesday's open.\n\nthe last quarterly report, was a big surprise for investors, as ge missed earnings expectations for the first time in 10 quarters, but the stock erased an early loss to end higher on the day of the report for the first time in eight quarters. read more about how ge's profit miss and the stock's bounce was a shock.\n\nhowever, the stock's strength proved very short lived, as it fell for the next nine sessions—the longest losing streak in eight years. the outlook for the shares got even uglier after new chief executive john flannery unveiled the company's transformation plan in mid-november, with the stock taking a particular hit a shockingly large loss for its legacy insurance business was revealed.\n\nthe stock ge, -2.65% soared 4.5% tuesday, the biggest one-day percentage gain since oct. 5, 2015, to snap a six-session losing streak. the stock had closed monday at $16.17, the lowest close since dec. 2, 2011.\n\nsome analysts may feel the best thing going for ge is the thought that it wouldn't take much to beat expectations and give investor sentiment a lift, after such extreme underperformance relative to peers and the broader market and the sharp drop in earnings and revenue expectations in recent months.\n\nsince flannery said ge's power and oil and gas businesses were to blame for the disappointing third-quarter results, investors will keenly focus on those segments for are signs of improvement, or further weakness.\n\nj.p. morgan analyst stephen tusa, who rates ge at underweight with a $16 stock price target, said earlier this month that the best reason to reassess ge's outlook was the all hope is lost sentiment that seemed prevalent on wall street. while he saw no reason to change his bearish stance on ge, any further near-term weakness may be limited, given the stock has already hit his downside target.\n\nwhat to expect\n\nearnings: ge is expected to report earnings, excluding nonrecurring items, of 29 cents a share, according to the average estimates of 14 analysts surveyed by factset. that compares with 46 cents a share in the same period a year ago, and has fallen from a factset consensus of 34 cents just three months ago.\n\nfactset\n\nestimize, a crowdsourcing platform that gathers estimates from wall street analysts, as well as buy-side analysts, hedge-fund managers, company executives, academics and others, has a consensus eps estimate of 28 cents.\n\nge missed eps expectations last quarter, but that was the first miss since the first quarter of 2015.\n\nrevenue: that factset revenue consensus is $33.87 billion, up from $33.09 billion a year ago, but down from a consensus of $34.40 billion three months ago. estimize is projecting, on average, revenue of $32.59 billion.\n\nge has beaten revenue expectations the past three quarters, after missing 10 of the previous 12 quarters.\n\nstock price: the stock has tumbled 3.2% year to date, 24% over the past three months and 43% the past 12 months, making it the worst performer among the 30 components of the dow jones industrial average djia, -0.46% for all three time periods. in contrast, the dow has rallied 6.0% in 2018, 13% the past three months and 32% the past year.\n\nsee also: ge's stock plunge puts 110-year run in the dow industrials at risk.\n\nfactset, marketwatch\n\nthe average rating of the 19 analysts surveyed by factset is the equivalent of hold, split between six buy ratings, 10 holds and 3 sells. the average price target of $19.54 is 16% above current levels, but has dropped 21% from an average target of $24.81 at the end of october.\n\nalthough the stock rose 1.1% the day of ge's third-quarter report, it had fallen an average of 1.6% on the day of the previous seven quarterly reports.\n\noptions traders are expecting some fireworks from the results. a strategy known as a straddle, that involves the simultaneous buying of bullish and bearish options at current prices, is implying one-day post-earnings move of about 5% in either direction. read more about option straddles.\n\nmeanwhile, the average one-day post-earnings move in the stock over the past 20 quarters has been 2.0%, split between an average gain of 2.4% after nine reports and a decline of 1.7% after 11 reports.\n\nother issues\n\nge's outlook for taxes may be of interest after the passage of tax reform legislation, which ge applauded for upgrading the u.s. to a territorial tax system for the first time in history. the company said in october that the fourth-quarter tax rate was expected to be around zero, and the rate for 2017 was projected to be in the low single digits percentage range, which is below the new baseline corporate tax rate of 21%.\n\ndon't miss: here's what all 30 companies that make up the dow industrials think about the tax cuts.\n\nwinners and losers of the gop tax bill\n\nseparately, in ge's third-quarter conference call with analysts, the company said it would derisk volume assumptions in its power business for advanced-gas path (agp) sales, by slashing the outlook to 80 to 90 for 2017 from the previous forecast of 155 to 165. what the actual number is for 2017 could go a long way in determining how the results are perceived. agps are upgrades to ge's existing gas-powered turbines that help boost their power.\n\nand staying with ge's power business, operating income is expected to be $1.22 billion, according to factset, down from $2.07 billion a year ago, while power revenue is slated to rise to $9.41 billion from $8.48 billion last year.\n\nfor ge's oil-and-gas business, operating income is expected to decline to $248.3 million from $411.0 million, while revenue is expected to increase to $5.73 billion from $3.40 billion.\n\nthe following are the factset revenue consensus for some of ge's other business segments:\n\n• aviation: $7.16 billion.\n\n• healthcare: $5.25 billion.\n\n• renewable energy: $2.84 billion.\n\n• transportation: $1.00 billion.\n\n• lighting: $464.3 million.\n\n• ge capital: $2.36 billion.
as $600 stimulus checks roll out, some americans are anxiously awaiting their own direct payments to hit their bank account or show up in their mailbox.\n\nthat wait could be awhile in some circumstances — and offer little comfort for those who need the money right now.\n\nthe internal revenue service said tuesday it's not going to re-issue $600 payments that come back to the agency if a bank account listed on a 2019 tax return is now closed or inactive.\n\ninstead, the would-be recipients will have to claim the amount when they file their taxes this year, according to the irs. it's just as someone would have to do if they didn't get the $1,200 payment in the early spring's first round of payments.\n\nthe irs isn't engaging in do-overs on the $600 checks because another tax-filing season is approaching. the tax collection agency says it has to act fast under a compressed timeline.

(on friday several analysts upgraded the stock.) this means netflix can fly if there is some good news, such as earnings that are better than the whisper numbers. investors ought to pay attention to whisper numbers and not the consensus numbers because stocks move based on the difference between those two.\n\nread: netflix earnings: can the streaming giant clear a high bar of investor expectations?\n\nnote on the chart that the smart money flows are neutral in netflix. this goes back to what i said above. smart money tends to take risk into account. after the recent run-up in netflix, when risk is taken into account, in addition to the potential reward, the risk-reward is balanced. the momo crowd does not care about the risk and continues to heavily buy.\n\nalso notice the contrast between the non-risk-adjusted ranking of one and the risk-adjusted rankings of nine. i will explain rankings later.\n\n• as shown on the chart, momo crowd money flows are positive in amd amd, +0.30% and amazon amzn, +0.33% . short-squeeze money flows are extremely positive in amd and very positive in amazon. in plain english, this means that these stocks can fly on good news.\n\nin contrast, smart money flows are neutral in both amazon and amd. the rankings shown on the chart for amazon and amd reflect the contrast between taking risk into account and ignoring risk.\n\n• intel intc, +1.55% is the only stock among the popular 11 tech stocks shown on the chart with positive smart money flows. in contrast, the momo crowd does not like intel.\n\n• smart money flows are mildly positive in microsoft msft, +1.24% , google goog, +1.26% googl, +1.43% and facebook fb, +2.02% .\n\n• momo crowd money flows are positive in tesla tsla, -4.39% and short-squeeze money flows are extremely positive.\n\n• nvidia nvda, +0.76% has been the poster child of the most recent bull market. when nvidia was trading at $292, smart money flows in nvidia were negative but momo (momentum) crowd money flows were positive and at times extremely positive. since then, smart money flows consistently stayed negative on nvidia while momo crowd money flows stayed positive on nvidia until it gapped down. nvidia has traded as low as $124.\n\nduring the fall and at the top in nvidia, the arora report rating has been sell. however, now the zyx change method with the six screens is coming close to giving a buy signal if there is a major down spike in nvidia below the recent low. we will provide a specific buy zone along with a stop zone and a target zone, and the appropriate position size when the signal is given.\n\nnow after the big drop, smart money flows have turned neutral and a for a very short period when the stock traded below $127, smart money flows had turned positive.\n\n• when apple aapl, +1.27% was reaching its high at $233.47, smart money flows were neutral but momo crowd money flows were positive and at times extremely positive. since then, apple fell as low as $142.\n\nthe arora report's buy now rating during most of the apple fall and at the top was no. now momo crowd money flows have turned mildly positive in apple.\n\n• as the chart shows, momo crowd money flows are positive in alibaba baba, -1.45% but smart money flows are neutral.\n\nask arora: nigam arora answers your questions about investing in stocks, etfs, bonds, gold and silver, oil and currencies. have a question? send it to nigam arora.\n\nrankings\n\nthe chart also shows relative rankings of the 11 popular tech stocks. those rankings are based on the six screens of the zyx change method. please click here to learn about the six screens.\n\nrisk-adjusted rankings are more useful for medium- and long-term positions. non-risk-adjusted rankings are more useful for short-term positions or trade-around positions.\n\nwhat to do now\n\ninvestors need to accept that the character of the market is changing. what has worked over the past nine years may not work in the future. investors ought to shift their mindset from a buy, buy and buy mode. consider following a comprehensive adaptive model that has a proven track record in both bull and bear markets. it is important not to rely on static models because market conditions have changed. static models that may have worked in the past may not work in the future.\n\ndisclosure: subscribers to the arora report may have positions in the securities mentioned in this article or may take positions at any time. nigam arora is an investor, engineer and nuclear physicist by background who has founded two inc. 500 fastest-growing companies. he is the founder of the arora report, which publishes four newsletters. nigam can be reached at nigam@thearorareport.com.
welcome to capital confidential — a weekly diary column featuring the best tidbits from around the u.k.'s business and political landscape from sister publication financial news.\n\nthis week: goldman goes to new lengths to attract trader whizzkids; jpmorgan co-president offends music lovers; and nathan latka's secret to financial success...\n\ngoldman's desperate appeal to students\n\nnew year, same old goldman sachs gs, -1.25% . capital reported in october last year about goldman's madcap stunt where interns were confronted with a shortage of chairs. the investment bank is still going to desperate lengths to appeal to the next generation of trader whizzkids. surprised interns on existing goldman sachs programs have been asked by the bank if any of their friends can fill slots on its newer work experience placements. an email from kerry vanslembrouck, vice president of graduate recruitment at goldman sachs, seen by capital, informs interns the bank is engaging in some very direct marketing. she asks if the young recipients know any students studying correlated courses who can take part in our first internship program in consumer and commercial banking (marcus)… their profile requirements are rather different to our broader divisions.\n\nand then there is the recent christmas ecard sent to interns by goldman sachs's campus recruiting division and also seen by capital. not content with merely wishing interns the compliments of the festive season, the ecard goes on to inform students that we're looking forward to you joining the [applicable] analyst class in 2019. former chief executive lloyd blankfein might have famously once suggested the bank does god's work. but to feature such corporate housekeeping in a christmas card is surely a tad too promotional, even by the standards of the sender.\n\npinto and piano\n\nbeware the casual christmas anecdote. daniel pinto, co-president of jpmorgan jpm, -1.20% and head of its investment banking business, recorded a seemingly innocuous interview about receiving his worst ever christmas present as part of a wider segment on the subject for the bank's internal tv and web channel. pinto said his worst christmas present from a family member was an electric piano – [a] beautiful, very nice present except for the fact that i never played the piano. i didn't know how to play the piano, nor did i have any intention to learn!\n\nthis hasn't gone down well with music lovers at jpmorgan. i don't directly work with daniel but his musical disrespect and lack of interest in the piano isn't shared by the company, says the employee who sent capital the recording on condition of anonymity. we [jpmorgan] give money to the new london orchestra, the bournemouth symphony orchestra and the boston youth symphony orchestra, among others. pinto might not value musical culture but the company does.\n\ndressed for success\n\nnathan latka, the u.s. founder of private-equity firm latka capital and software company heyo, has outlined an unlikely secret to financial success: never change your wardrobe. in his forthcoming book how to be a capitalist without any capital, latka declares: my minimalist approach to getting dressed does save me money. i wear the same thing every day: a black t-shirt and black traveler slim cut pants, both from banana republic. patagonia black jacket if it is cold. i just have many copies of these items… when you bring gently used clothes back to banana republic, they give you a 30% discount off your next order. they donate the clothes for you. latka adds of his banana republic shopping habits: i get my t-shirts, which retail at $35, for about $12 each. henry ford, eat your heart out!\n\nthe special fund\n\nmanchester united manu, +0.64% fans are hardly mourning the departure of manager josé mourinho after he was sacked by the footballing giant last month. it transpires mourinho's alienating managerial style extends to the money management arena. an impeccable source says at one stage mourinho chose barclays capital to look after his not-inconsiderable fortune (he has made an estimated £51.5m from payouts alone). but the source adds mourinho wouldn't only demand to choose which money managers he would meet, but insist on selecting the specific room they would be meeting in. how special.\n\nup to speed\n\nmclaren, the supercar manufacturer spawned out of woking, has released more details about its latest, much-anticipated 250 mph roadster. tycoons, who have already dug deep to splash out £1.75m for its speedtail, can choose from a range of bespoke enhancements including a tasteful 18-karat gold badge. the vehicle also distinguishes itself from the competition by coming replete with three front seats – the main hot seat, along with space for a brace of passengers, one either side. one chauvinist petrolhead views this innovation as space for both the wife and the mistress.\n\nmatter of honor\n\nthe political battle over brexit shows no sign of slowing down in 2019. taking a sarcastic swipe at high-profile remainers, backbench tory brexiteer mp conor burns tells capital: initially i was resistant to george osborne being made a companion of honor in david cameron's resignation honors list [in 2016]. but now i believe it is fully deserved – for his services to brexit! his public interventions have been most helpful to those looking forward to leaving the eu. as for lord heseltine? he should be given the order of the garter!\n\nsnapchat goes to hollywood\n\none can be forgiven for suffering big tech fatigue, but over in hollywood they're just getting started. the black list, the celebrated survey of the hottest film screenplays yet to be produced, which in previous years has included the scripts for slumdog millionaire and argo, has just been unveiled. selections this year include frat boy genius, elissa karasik's story about an employee of social media platform snapchat who loathes chief executive evan spiegel; and drudge, a biopic about influential online news aggregator matt drudge, penned by cody brotter. capital hears the snapchat and drudge movie writers thankfully won't be enduring any tech dating horror stories of their own any time soon: karasik and brotter are dating each other.\n\nthis article also appears on financial news.
an earlier version of this story misidentified the company cryptzone.\n\nduring a 2014 cybersecurity drill, new york city officials held with intelligence agencies, the federal bureau of investigation posed several scenarios. what if the city noticed that the 911 system had shut down? what if criminals attempted to coordinate a computer attack on emergency infrastructure with a physical attack?\n\nthe city often had the same response: they'd call the fbi. unfortunately, they were told, that might not help. that's not what we do, leo taddeo, former head of the federal bureau of investigation's cyber and special operations division in new york, said he told them. we don't come and fix your computers.\n\nsecurity breaches at the federal government or large corporate levels tend to attract the most media attention, but cities, counties and states across the u.s. also grapple with questions of how to secure sprawling networks, which connect agencies with vastly different purposes, sizes and budgets, against cybercriminals.\n\nthey're hoping to avoid situations akin to the 2003 blackout in the northeast, when power failures left several states and new york city dark for hours or longer. while that blackout was caused by a power surge, security and it experts fear that criminals have the capability — and local governments have the vulnerabilities — to launch attacks of similar scope, hampering their ability to provide public safety, transportation and other key services and creating wide-ranging ripple effects.\n\nif someone wanted to impact the banking center, you wouldn't have to necessarily hack a bank or affect them, said taddeo, who is now chief security officer at security software company cryptzone. you could turn off the subways, and if the people couldn't get to work, the bank wouldn't open.\n\nthe risk can seem 'mind-boggling'\n\nevery year, the federal emergency management agency asks states to rank how prepared they are for various sorts of disasters. in a report released in march 2015, cybersecurity was ranked the weakest leg for the fourth straight year.\n\nwhen most u.s. cities designed much of the infrastructure residents take for granted — such as mass transit systems and utilities — computers didn't even exist. moving city systems online has opened them up for attack, both here and around the world.\n\nsan diego, for example, uses more than 400 different applications, some which are decades old and may not be up-to-date. the city is hit by an average of 60,000 cyberattacks a day, gary hayslip, the city's chief information officer, said.\n\nyou're kind of wondering, how the hell did we get here? said hayslip. the inherent risk in this could, at times, be mind-boggling.\n\ncyberattacks are growing in number and scale. every month, new york city faces about 80 million cyberthreats, ranging from phishing attacks to attacks meant to overwhelm websites that are usually caught by firewalls. iranian hackers broke into the control system of a dam 20 miles outside of new york city in 2013, the wall street journal reported recently, showing how infrastructure can become a target.\n\nthe issues aren't confined to the u.s. in 2008, a 14-year-old schoolboy hacked the tram system in the polish city lodz, derailing four vehicles. a cyberespionage campaign identified by security company symantec in 2014 sought to sabotage energy grids, major electricity firms and petroleum pipeline operators across the u.s. and europe.\n\na worker at a queensland, australia, wastewater treatment plant accessed its networks 46 times over four months in 2000 to spill more than 200,000 gallons of sewage into parks, rivers and hotel grounds. and attackers from china, russia and germany broke into a fake water control plant set up by security researchers from the firm trend micro in 2013, dispatching at least 10 attacks designed to cut off access to drinking water.\n\nhackers can tamper with traffic control systems, smart street lighting, city management systems that control work orders or other facilities, public transportation, cameras, smart grids, wireless sensors that control waste and water management or mobile and cloud networks, according to a report from cesar cerrudo, chief technology officer of the seattle-based security company ioactive labs.\n\nin 2014, cerrudo found that he could crack at least 200,000 traffic sensors in washington, d.c., new york, seattle, san francisco and other cities, giving him the ability to manipulate traffic signals or change electronic road signs displaying speed limits and instructions.\n\nmost cities are really vulnerable right now, cerrudo said. most of the time, they will test the technology for functionality to make sure the technology will solve a problem, but not carefully test its security. the possibilities to launch attacks are there.\n\nhacking has also become cheaper and easier in recent years. even the relatively unsophisticated can buy tools like botnets — hordes of infected computers that can be turned into a zombie army for attackers who send out spam — or services that will send a flood of traffic to a website to knock it offline for $1, according to tokyo-based trend micro.\n\nthe easy availability of these tools has led to a rise in hacktivism, or the use of computer hacking to achieve political goals. it's easier to go ahead and get hacking tools online than it is to go out in the street and protest, hayslip said.\n\npracticing the game plan\n\ncities are working to play catch-up on cybersecurity.\n\nin may, cerrudo launched a program called securing smart cities with dozens of other security experts. the group released guidelines last month for smart-city technology adoption, which include using strong encryption, designing systems that have strong protection against tampering and ensuring systems can only be accessed by people authorized to use them.\n\nnew york city created a cyber interagency working group with 90 members from 50 public and private organizations, including government offices, banks, internet service providers and local, state and federal law enforcement after the 2014 training exercise. the city wrote guidelines in 2015 as to how it would inform the public, restore systems and coordinate across agencies in the event of a citywide attack.\n\nand in michigan, a 50-person cyber civilian corps trains for emergencies as a kind of it version of a volunteer fire department. the group is working with other states to help develop similar response plans, said tonia cronin, its program manager.\n\ncity engineers can practice defense strategies with netwars cybercity, a program run by the sans institute, a computer security research center. the model includes power, water and transit infrastructure, as well as residential buildings, retail, banks and hospitals. courtesy of the sans institute\n\nto simulate the domino effect of a cyberattack on other city services, about 10 states practice their response plans using alphaville, a cyber village that includes a school, city hall, library, power grid and more than 10 virtual machines that users can customize to simulate their own networks. the sans institute, a computer security research and training center, runs a similar cybercity program.\n\npeople need a safe place to practice dangerous things, said cronin, describing alphaville. it's a full-on, living, breathing city. if a red team goes in and shuts down the power, all the lights go off in the whole city, and cars crash and everything.\n\ncronin compared cybersecurity to a football game. without a chain of command and playbook, the players have to guess where each teammate should run, and who's responsible for catching each throw. when the clock turns on during a game, she said, there's little time to think about how to coordinate each play.\n\nsimilarly, before an attacker breaks into a computer system, it is important to know which engineer handles each type of technology, what could be required of them, and what happens if you can't reach them. during one attack on san diego, hayslip said, the city wasted 45 minutes waiting for one engineer to reach a computer.\n\nif you talk to most people in government, what they would say to you is that their biggest fear is: what happens when [hackers] do something? said cronin. because they're probably already in our network.\n\nthis article was first published on jan. 4, 2016.
macy's inc. and j.c. penney co. inc. reported same-store sales increases during the holiday shopping period, while victoria's l brands inc., fresh off of an analyst upgrade, issued a profit warning.\n\nstill, shares are down for all three retailers, along with many others across the sector. macy's and j.c. penney shares were each down more than 5% in early thursday trading, while l brands took the largest tumble of 15%.\n\nmacy's m, -4.97% stock is down 3.7% in thursday trading and j.c. penney us:jcp is down 1.9%. l brands lb, -1.57% has taken the largest tumble, nearly 12%.\n\nmacy's said same-store sales during the months of november and december 2017 rose 1% on an owned basis and were up 1.1% on an owned-plus-licensed basis. the company saw double-digit growth online and improved holiday sales across macy's, macy's backstage, bloomingdale's and its outlet, and the beauty brand blue mercury.\n\nmacy's chief executive jeff gennette says the same-store sales result sets the retailer up for a positive fourth quarter. the fourth-quarter factset consensus is for same-store sales decline of 1.7%.\n\nsee: ulta beauty and adidas rank among wells fargo's top retail-stock picks for 2018\n\nhere's how robots can revolutionize e-commerce\n\nincluded in announced cost management efforts will be staffing adjustments, with some stores seeing reductions as others hire, and 11 store closures in early 2018. four of those closures were previously announced. stores will close in miami, los angeles, san francisco and other cities nationwide. that brings the number of shuttered stores since 2015 to 124.\n\nmacy's expects annual expense savings to total $300 million beginning fiscal 2018, and one-time charges of $160 million, or about 33 cents per share, which will be booked in the fourth quarter.\n\nmacy's also updated its guidance, and now expects full-year adjusted earnings per share of $3.59 to $3.69 including tax reform measures, versus previous guidance of $3.38 to $3.63. the company expects same-store sales on an owned basis to decline between 2.4% and 2.7%, and a decline between 2% and 2.3% on an owned-plus-licensed basis. sales are expected to be down between 3.6% and 3.9%.\n\nthe factset consensus is for full-year eps of $3.44 and a same-store sales decline of 3.4%. macy's expects a non-cash tax benefit in fiscal 2017 of $550 million to $650 million from the federal tax rate reduction.\n\nalso:can men save retail? nordstrom makes big bet on a once overlooked shopper\n\nthe holiday sales growth at macy's is a welcome change from the red numbers it usually posts, said neil saunders, managing director of globaldata retail. moreover, it sends a positive signal that other retailers are on course for a solid holiday season.\n\nstill, there are issues to be mindful of, including relatively weak growth that was far less than the overall sector, he said. saunders also expressed concerns that the improved performance comes as a result of the consumer's willingness to spend rather than any particular measures macy's has taken.\n\n[w]e maintain that the focus should be on growing the top line through improvements to stores, ranges and the general proposition, saunders said. in our view, macy's still has an enormous amount to work to do here.\n\nj.c. penney co. inc. reported a 3.4% same-store sales increase for the nine weeks ending dec. 30, 2017, and reaffirmed its full-year guidance. the fourth-quarter factset consensus is for same-store sales growth of 0.8%.\n\nthe retailer saw improved same-store performance across apparel, particularly in women's and kids, and double-digit sales growth in e-commerce, according to a statement from chief executive marvin ellison. and the company is now able to fill e-commerce orders from all of its brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nj.c. penney reaffirmed its previous guidance for full-year fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 2 cents to 8 cents and flat to a 1% same-store sales decline. the factset consensus is for eps of 7 cents and a same-store sales decline of 0.5%.\n\nread:neiman marcus ceo reportedly to step aside for outsider replacement\n\nl brands inc. reported of $2.52 billion for the five weeks ending dec. 30, up from $2.44 billion last year. same-store sales were up 1% for the period.\n\nthe company expects to report fourth-quarter earnings per share of about $2 before the impact of one-time items or tax reform measures, compared with guidance of $1.95 to $2.10. the factset consensus is $2.03.\n\nat victoria's secret, growth in the beauty and pink businesses was more than offset by a decline in lingerie, said chief investor relations officer amie preston on the pre-recorded earnings call, according to a factset transcript.\n\nvictoria's secret has struggled with its exit from the swim and apparel categories. however, l brands was upgraded at baird equity research on wednesday on 2018 earnings-per-share growth potential.\n\n[w]e monitor for consistent improvements in a more balanced lingerie assortment, which can help support price improvements, wrote cowen & company analysts led by oliver chen. further, we watch for prospects for improved store traffic (store comps -6% at victoria's secret during december) that is not driven by promotional activity, which could include targeted direct mail.
who says you have to be an energy drink to advertise like one?\n\ncanada dry, part of the dr. pepper snapple group inc. portfolio of brands, is making a push with the sporting crowd as the popularity of energy drinks grows among consumers. but it's not actually launching a new energy drink.\n\nthe ginger ale brand has previously pushed a message about relaxation in ads focused on the drink's ginger-farm roots. it's now turning to scenes from the gym for its latest spots, which will debut monday on espn and nbc sports. but the ads still hang on to their relaxation theme.\n\nconsumers are increasingly turning away from traditional carbonated drinks and toward beverages like energy drinks. cowen & company analysts suggested last month that coca cola co. ko, -1.31% acquire the remaining stake in monster beverage corp. mnst, -0.77% in order to take full advantage of this trend.\n\nwhile consumers are clearly showing increased concern over sugar consumption, the consumer has not rejected sugary beverages outright as we consistently see outsized growth for sugar beverage categories that also offer consumers a functional benefit to help justify that sugary beverage occasion, analysts wrote in a note.\n\nread also:it's time to sell coke and p&g stocks, goldman says\n\nthe new ad also comes on the heels of an upgrade of dr. pepper snapple us:dps by goldman sachs.\n\nwhile in general we do not favor large companies buying into growth, we believe the recently announced acquisition of bai, should it close on announced terms, is a strategic fit that could bolster dr. pepper snapple's sales growth and de-risk a potential distribution loss that could occur if bai is sold to another company, the monday note said.\n\nbai is a line of antioxidant beverages made with smart sweeteners like those from the stevia leaf.\n\nanalysts also believe that dr. pepper snapple is well-positioned if tax policies change.\n\n[i]n the even broader tax policy changes occur as currently proposed, dr. pepper snapple would be a relative beneficiary given its current high tax rate (35%), limited mismatch from a destination-based tax perspective, and low likelihood of sizeable incremental debt post the announced bai acquisition, the note said.
for the seventh year in a row, an eating plan that takes aim at high blood pressure has been named the best overall diet by a panel of experts in the latest u.s. news & world report rankings.\n\nthe so-called dash plan, which stands for dietary approaches to stop hypertension, tops the list—and just in time for your new year's resolution.\n\ndash entails emphasizing lower-sodium foods as well as those rich in potassium, magnesium and calcium. bottom line: fruits, veggies, whole grains, lean protein and low-fat dairy—good. sugary snacks, red meat and salty nibbles—bad. so, load up on brown rice, fish, fat-free yogurt and, of course, avoid the candy aisle and jack in the box tacos.\n\nfor a more detailed look at the dash approach, check out the u.s. department of health and human services website. here's a sample menu:\n\nthe u.s. news annual survey assessed 38 diet plans across nine categories. while dash continued its reign as the best diet overall—beating out the mediterranean and the mind diets—it didn't crack the top 10 in terms of weight loss. weight watchers us:wtw wins out on that front, and the stock rallied hard on the news, up more than 20%.\n\nour best diet rankings provide the millions of people around the world looking to make a lifestyle change a place to jumpstart their health and fitness goals, said angela haupt, u.s. news assistant managing editor.\n\ndon't miss: the two times of the day you're most likely to break your diet\n\nbringing up the rear on the overall list, the whole30 diet came in at number 38, scoring ok in terms of short-term weight loss but lagging in the long-term. it was also dinged because it is trickier to stick to than the others. the restrictive program lasts for 30 days and calls for absolutely no sugar, alcohol, grains, legumes or dairy of any kind.\n\nwithout careful planning, a strong support system and dogged dedication, a business lunch, flight delay or date night can throw you off and send you back to the start, u.s. news said.\n\nthe trendy dukan and paleo diets fared only slightly better than the whole30 plan. the experts said they are also too tough to follow over the long haul.
one of the most popular employee benefits is a 401(k) retirement plan.\n\nmany employers offer some sort of contribution on the employee's behalf. when an employer contributes to the plan, it usually occurs in one of two ways. first, your employer may offer a contribution that does not depend upon your participation. these employer payments may be labeled as either profit-sharing or safe harbor contributions. regardless of which type is offered, the employee does not have to add anything to receive the benefit. the second type of employer contribution is a matching contribution. to receive matching contributions, the employee must defer income into the plan.\n\nread: 5 ways life could change for retirees in 2018\n\ngenerally, an employer match is somewhere between 3% to 6%, but it could be more or less. the match can be made using one of many formulas. a common matching formula may be stated as a dollar for dollar match up to 3% of pay. under this scenario, to receive the full match, you would have to contribute 3% to your account. every time you contribute a dollar, your employer would match 100% of your contribution up to the first 3% of your pay. if you contributed 2%, the employer would match 2%. however, if you were to contribute 4%, the employer would only be obligated to match 3%. of course, if you did not contribute anything, the match would be zero.\n\nthat all sounds good, but there is a catch. there is a maximum dollar amount you can defer from your income. for 2018, that amount is $18,500. (there is an additional $6,000 catch up amount available for those aged 50 or over, but this amount will not be considered in this example since not all employers provide a match on the catch up amount.) once you reach the maximum deferral limit, your payroll deductions will cease.\n\nwhen it comes to retirement, 60s are the new 50s\n\nif your employer is making matching contributions, their payments will automatically stop when yours do. so, if you reach your $18,500 before the last paycheck of the year, your employer matching payments will stop before the end of the year and you may not receive your full match. ideally, you always want your last contribution to be deducted from your last payroll check of the year.\n\nlet's assume that your income is $150,000/year, or $12,500/month. your employer offers a very generous 5% match and you are excited to contribute as much as you can to the plan as fast as you can so you set up a 15% contribution. each month, $1,875 will be deducted from your paycheck (15% of $12,500) and your employer will match $625 (5% of $12,500) for a total contribution of $2,500 a month ($1,875 + $625).\n\nread: how much can i contribute to a 401(k) this year?\n\nafter six months, you have contributed $11,250 (6 x $1,875) and your employer has added $3,750 (6 x $625). however, if you continue on this path, you will reach your maximum $18,500 annual contribution in october. you will have contributed $16,875 through september (9 x $1,875) and will only be able to contribute the remaining $1,635 in october ($18,500 – $16,875). so, your contribution for november and december will be zero. and, since your employer only makes contributions when you do, their deposits will be zero as well. by funding your 401(k) too soon, you will lose two months of employer match, or $1,250 (2 x $625).\n\nread: money milestones: this is how your finances should look in your 60s\n\nthere is a very easy fix for this. simply divide the maximum dollar contribution of $18,500 by your annual salary and contribute the resulting percentage of your pay. so, in the example above, you would set up your contribution amount at 12.33% ($18,500 divided by $150,000 = 0.1233 or 12.33%). contributing 12.33% of your pay for 12 months will earn you $1,250 more employer match than contributing 15% of your pay will for 10 months.\n\nkeep in mind that should revise your contribution percentage in any year that your income changes or the annual 401(k) dollar limit changes.\n\nclark d. randall, cfp, is a financial planner and owner offinancial enlightenment, a comprehensive wealth management firm.

be careful — your child's connected teddy bear may be watching you. increasingly popular internet-connected toys pose a privacy concern for the children who use them and their families, as regulatory bodies work to crack down on violations.\n\nchildren's toy manufacturer vtech electronics limited vtklf, -5.09% settled with the federal trade commission on monday over charges that it violated a u.s. children's privacy law by collecting personal information from children without telling parents or obtaining their consent. vtech is required to pay a $650,000 settlement and implement a comprehensive data security program, which will be subject to independent audits for 20 years.\n\nthe toy company came under scrutiny after it was hacked in 2015, exposing the names and ages of more than 6 million children who used its toys. the complaint against vtech said the company failed to provide adequate notice to parents about the information it was collecting and failed to encrypt user data, despite saying in its privacy policy it would. the company said in a statement it has improved its security measures since the hacking incident.\n\nwe are pleased to settle this two-year-old investigation by the ftc, said allan wong, chairman and group ceo of vtech holdings limited. following the cyber attack incident, we updated our data security policy and adopted rigorous measures to strengthen the protection of our customers' data. we also took steps to address the technical notice and consent issues under [the children's online privacy protection rule].\n\nthere has been a rise in the number of high-profile hacks and data breaches affecting children. in april 2017, more than two million recorded messages from parents and children stored by cloudpets plush connected toy company were exposed to potential hackers, along with 800,000 emails and passwords. (cloudpets acknowledged the exposure, but said user information was not compromised.) in 2015, a hack of another toy company exposed the information of more than 200,000 children.\n\nthe fbi has been placing more of a focus on connected toys in recent months, said jim ivers, the vice president of marketing for the software integrity group at synopsys. the protection of children is a pretty emotional subject, he said. if child safety starts being compromised and manufacturers don't start looking out for it themselves, the government is going to step in and regulate. although the fbi recommended parents check the background of the toys they buy their children, he said there is no central location to do that. it comes down to parents taking action regarding each particular toy, he said.\n\nhere are some of the measures you can take when purchasing connected gifts for the children in your life to minimize security risks:\n\n1. turn off the toy when it isn't in use\n\nturn off recording capabilities and microphone permissions when a toy is put back on the shelf. and this doesn't just apply to toys. stickers made for laptops and other devices can also cover cameras while they are not in use to ensure that even if they are compromised, hackers won't have a window into your home.\n\n2. don't give away unnecessary information\n\nif the account requires personal information, simply give the bare minimum amount required, said alan brill, a senior managing director in kroll's cyber security practice. recognize you are not under oath there, you don't have to tell the truth, he said. many devices don't have gps services and there is no reason to give it your real address. people have to think about the consequences. users can even invent false names, ages, dates of birth, and other data to minimize risk in the case that the website is hacked.\n\nmalls struggle to compete with online shopping\n\n3. check the company's privacy policy\n\nthere is no government certification or central information resource informing consumers whether a specific brand of toy is hackable. however, a simple google search could alert you to past hacks or other problems in the company. aside from doing the obvious online search, buyers should also read the full privacy policies from the company and ensure the company will notify them in the case of a hack or data breach. ensure the company notifies users when privacy policies change. pay particular attention to where it stores user data and what security measures it takes to protect it, like whether the data is encrypted, and if it shares with (or even sells) data to third parties.\n\n4. use multiple, strong passwords\n\namericans are not great at passwords: 31% of people have used a pet's name, 23% have used number sequences, 22% a family member's name and 21% a birth date. passwords based on easily-discovered personal information are not effective. neither are number or letter series. the passwords most frequently cracked by hackers include 123456, password, 12345, football, and qwerty, according to a report from security service splashdata. experts suggest using password services like lastpass or 1password to generate and safe complex passwords for various accounts.\n\n5. don't accept gifts without vetting them\n\nit's a difficult scenario: your child opens a new connected toy from grandma at christmas, but you are not sure about its safety features. brill said it's important to do research on the toy before allowing a child to use it, and be willing to get rid of the device if it doesn't offer proper protection. in rare cases he has even learned of toys being sent to children randomly in the mail under the guise of them winning a prize in order to hack into the family's network and obtain sensitive information. never accept a toy, especially a connected one, from an unknown source.

the american dream seems more attainable overseas.\n\npresident trump on thursday reportedly used vulgar language to describe immigrants from haiti and african countries and said the u.s. needed more immigrants from countries like norway. on friday, trump denied using the word shithole countries, but said he used tough language. the president's reported comments were described as racist by rupert colville, the united nations spokesman for human rights. immigrants from poor countries come to america for a better life as, numerous studies show, social inequality in the u.s. has worsened in recent years.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-denies-questioning-migration-from-shithole-countries-1515766158\n\ndon't miss:less than half of americans say they're middle class\n\n immigrants from poor countries come to america for a better life as, numerous studies show, social inequality in the u.s. has worsened in recent years. \n\nin fact, norway ranked no. 1 for happiness and personal freedom, according to an analysis of three separate studies on life expectancy by the world bank, on civil liberties from freedom house, a new york-based nonprofit that conducts research on advocacy and democracy, on happiness from the sustainable development solutions network (sdsn), a group linked to the united nations, and on rule of law from the world justice project, a washington, d.c.-based nonprofit.\n\nthe analysis was released by information-analytics firm lexisnexis legal & professional, a relx group relx, -0.16% company, found that countries that have established a strong rule of law have significantly more success in securing measures of life, liberty and happiness for their citizens. sweden ranked no. 2 and canada was no. 3, followed by australia, the netherlands, finland and austria. the u.s. ranked no. 19 just behind the czech republic, japan and france. afghanistan ranked last at no. 98.\n\nnorway ranked no. 1 for happiness, the u.s. was no. 14\n\nnorway was also no. 1 out of 155 countries on the 2017 world happiness report, up from no. 4 the year before, followed by denmark (last year's no. 1), iceland and switzerland. the u.s. was trailing at no. 14. these four countries rank highly on all the main factors found to support happiness: caring, freedom, generosity, honesty, health, income and good governance. their averages are so close that small changes can re-order the rankings from year to year, the report said.\n\n 'norway maintains its high happiness not because of its oil wealth, but in spite of it. by producing its oil slowly, and investing the proceeds for the future.' \n\nthe world happiness report was released in march 2017 and involved polling of 1,000 residents per country by research organization gallup, and was put together by sdsn, a group linked to the united nations and led in part by economist jeffrey d. sachs, known for the end of poverty and other books. where necessary, gallup seeks the permissions of national, regional, and local governments. the interviews are conducted by phone and face-to-face.\n\nnorway moves to the top of the ranking despite weaker oil prices, the report noted. it is sometimes said that norway achieves and maintains its high happiness not because of its oil wealth, but in spite of it. by choosing to produce its oil slowly, and investing the proceeds for the future rather than spending them in the present, norway has insulated itself from the boom and bust cycle of many other resource-rich economies.\n\nu.s. has fallen on happiness list among oecd countries\n\nthe u.s. has seen its happiness slide happiness over the last decade. in 2007, it ranked no. 3 among the organization for economic cooperation and development countries. but it now hovers at 19th place, partly due to the political discourse. the predominant political discourse in the united states is aimed at raising economic growth, with the goal of restoring the american dream and the happiness that is supposed to accompany it. but the data show conclusively that this is the wrong approach, economist jeffrey sachs wrote in the report.\n\n the u.s showed less social support, less sense of personal freedom, lower donations, and more perceived corruption of government and business. \n\nexperts say the divisive political climate in the u.s. likely hasn't helped. the united states can and should raise happiness by addressing america's multi-faceted social crisis — rising inequality, corruption, isolation, and distrust — rather than focusing exclusively or even mainly on economic growth, especially since the concrete proposals along these lines would exacerbate rather than ameliorate the deepening social crisis, the report added.\n\nthe u.s showed less social support, less sense of personal freedom, lower donations, and more perceived corruption of government and business, it said. america's crisis is, in short, a social crisis, not an economic crisis… almost all of the policy discourse in washington, d.c. centers on naïve attempts to raise the economic growth rate, as if a higher growth rate would somehow heal the deepening divisions and angst in american society. this kind of growth-only agenda is doubly wrong-headed.\n\nkeeping a millennial staff happy, and more\n\nu.s. criticized for inequality and cuts in welfare\n\npresident trump's latest remarks about immigrants follows criticisms last month made by professor philip alston, the united nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, about growing inequality in the u.s. he released a report heaping scorn on what he described as the trump administration's dramatic change of direction in u.s. policies relating to inequality and extreme poverty. he cited the administration's current tax proposals and dramatic cuts in welfare.\n\n un special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, criticized the 'dramatic change of direction in u.s. policies relating to inequality.' \n\nalston spent two weeks traveling through california, alabama, georgia, puerto rico, west virginia, and washington d.c. and spoke with dozens of experts and civil society groups, met with senior state and federal government officials and talked with many people who are homeless or living in deep poverty. contrasts between private wealth and public squalor abound, alston said.\n\nearlier this week, a separate report examined mortality for the u.s. and other wealthy nations in the organization for economic cooperation and development for children from birth to age 19 from 1961 to 2010. from 2001 to 2010 the risk of death in the u.s. was 76% greater for infants and 57% greater for children ages 1 to 19, according to the study, child mortality in the us and 19 oecd comparator nations: a 50-year time-trend analysis,

federal reserve chairman jerome powell said friday the u.s. central bank can now be patient about further monetary policy and wait to see how conflicting signals from the market and the economy resolve themselves. in a conversation at the american economics association meeting in atlanta, powell said the central bank was open to changing course on rate hikes and reducing its balance sheet depending on how the economy evolves. in a brief opening remarks, powell pushed back on the market's djia, -0.39% pessimism about the outlook, saying most of the hard data remain quite solid and suggest ongoing momentum going into 2019.
house democrats are looking at formally censuring president donald trump over his weekend phone call to the george secretary of state asking him to find enough votes to tip the state outcome in the nov. 3 election in his favor, the house majority leader said tuesday.\n\nrep. steny hoyer said in a weekly phone call with reporters that he also thought trump may have committed both state and federal crimes in the conversation, a recording of which was obtained and published by the washington post.\n\nthis president is out of control. this president has no respect for democracy. this president is acting in a way that no other president has acted, period, the typically reserved hoyer said.\n\ntrump, in a phone call with georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger on saturday, asked raffensperger to reconsider the official tally and add votes to trump's totals that would swing the state's electoral college votes in his favor because of alleged voting irregularities, something raffensperger's office has not found in post-vote checks.\n\non monday night at a rally for the republican candidates in tuesday's dual senate runoffs in georgia, trump only briefly addressed the issue, saying, everyone loved my phone call.\n\ni believe there are members talking about some type of censure resolution with respect to the president's actions, which i do believe may well be a violation of criminal law, both from a state and a federal perspective, hoyer said tuesday.\n\nhe said if the call amounted to an attempt to entice, encourage or threaten somebody to take illegal actions to change the election result, there could be legal liability.\n\nhoyer also took a shot at some of trump's supporters who have backed his efforts to nullify the results of the nov. 4 presidential election.\n\nthis president's actions are inconsistent with the constitution and may well be criminal. and very frankly those who support his actions are undermining faith and trust in democracy, which is so important for democracy's success and survival, he said.
new haven, conn. (project syndicate) — speculative markets have always been vulnerable to illusion. but seeing the folly in markets provides no clear advantage in forecasting outcomes, because changes in the force of the illusion are difficult to predict.\n\nin the united states, two illusions have been important recently in financial markets. one is the carefully nurtured perception that president-elect donald trump is a business genius who can apply his deal-making skills to make america great again.\n\nthe other is a naturally occurring illusion: the proximity of dow 20,000. the dow jones industrial average djia, -0.46% has been above 19,000 since november, and countless news stories have focused on its flirtation with the 20,000 barrier, which might be crossed by the time this commentary is published. whatever happens, dow 20,000 will still have a psychological impact on markets.\n\ntrump has never been clear and consistent about what he will do as president. tax cuts are clearly on his agenda, and the stimulus could lead to higher asset prices. lower corporate taxes are naturally supposed to lead to higher share prices, while cuts in personal income tax might lead to higher home prices (though possibly offset by other changes in the tax system).\n\n the dow is up only 19% in real (inflation-adjusted) terms since 2000. a 19% increase in 17 years is underwhelming. \n\nbut it is not just trump's proposed tax changes that plausibly affect market psychology. the u.s. has never had a president like him. not only is he an actor, like ronald reagan; he is also a motivational writer and speaker, a brand name in real estate, and a tough deal maker. if he ever reveals his financial information, or if his family is able to use his influence as president to improve its bottom line, he might even prove to be successful in business.\n\nthe closest we can come to trump among former u.s. presidents might be calvin coolidge, an extremely pro-business tax cutter. the chief business of the american people is business, coolidge famously declared, while his treasury secretary, andrew mellon — one of america's wealthiest men — advocated tax cuts for the rich, which would trickle down in benefits to the less fortunate.\n\nthe u.s. economy during the coolidge administration was very successful, but the boom ended badly in 1929, just after coolidge stepped down, with the stock market crash and the beginning of the great depression. during the 1930s, the 1920s were looked upon wistfully, but also as a time of fakery and cheating.\n\nof course, history is never destiny, and coolidge is only one observation — hardly a solid basis for a forecast. moreover, unlike trump, both coolidge and mellon were level-headed and temperate in their manner.\n\nbut add to the trump effect all the attention paid to dow 20,000, and we have the makings of a powerful illusion. on nov. 10, 2016, two days after donald j. trump was elected, the dow jones average hit a new record high, and has since set 16 more daily records, all trumpeted by news media.\n\nthat sounds like important news for trump. in fact, the dow had already hit nine record highs before the election, when hillary clinton was projected to win. in nominal terms, the dow is up 70% from its peak in january 2000. on nov. 29, 2016, it was announced that the s&p/corelogic/case-shiller national home price index (which i co-founded with my late colleague karl e. case) reached a record high the previous september. the previous record was set more than ten years earlier, in july 2006.\n\nwill augmented reality or virtual reality win?\n\nbut these numbers are illusory. the u.s. has a national policy of overall inflation. the u.s. federal reserve has set an inflation objective of 2% in terms of the personal consumption expenditure deflator. this means that all prices should tend to go up by about 2% per year, or 22% per decade.\n\nthe dow is up only 19% in real (inflation-adjusted) terms since 2000. a 19% increase in 17 years is underwhelming, and the national home price index that case and i created is still 16% below its 2006 peak in real terms. but hardly anyone focuses on these inflation-corrected numbers.\n\nthe fed, like the world's other central banks, is steadily debasing the currency, in order to create inflation. a google ngrams search of books shows that use of the term inflation targeting began growing exponentially in the early 1990s, when the target was typically far below actual inflation. the idea that we actually want moderate positive inflation — price stability, not zero inflation — appears to have started to take shape in policy circles around the time of the 1990-1991 recession. lawrence summers argued that the public has an irrational resistance to the declining nominal wages that some would have to suffer in a zero-inflation regime.\n\nmany people appear not to understand that inflation is a change in the units of measurement. unfortunately, although the 2% inflation target is largely a feel-good policy, people tend to draw too much inspiration from it. irving fisher called this fixation on nominal price growth the money illusion in an eponymous 1928 book.\n\nthat doesn't mean that we set new speculative-market records every day. stock-price movements tend to approximate what economists call random walks, with prices reflecting small daily shocks that are about equally likely to be positive or negative. and random walks tend to go through long periods when they are well below their previous peak; the chance of setting a record soon is negligible, given how far prices would have to rise. but once they do reach a new record high, prices are far more likely to set additional records – probably not on consecutive days, but within a short interval.\n\nin the u.s., the combination of trump and a succession of new asset-price records — call it trump-squared — has been sustaining the illusion underpinning current market optimism. for those who are not too stressed from having taken extreme positions in the markets, it will be interesting (if not profitable) to observe how the illusion morphs into a new perception, one that implies very different levels for speculative markets.\n\nrobert j. shiller, a 2013 nobel laureate in economics and professor of economics at yale university, is co-author, with george akerlof, of phishing for phools: the economics of manipulation and deception.\n\nthis article was published with the permission of project syndicate.

intelsat s.a. investors were whipsawed for a second straight day on friday, as the stock took an early tumble after j.p. morgan analyst philip cusick said federal communications commission chairman ajit pai's proposal to quickly free up spectrum for 5g networks leaves little hope for equity investors, before bouncing sharply to close in positive territory.\n\ncusick downgraded the luxembourg-based satellite services company to a rare underweight rating, after being at neutral the past three months, and at overweight for seven months before that. he removed his price target of $9, writing in a note to clients that we see little to no fundamental equity value in shares given pai's proposal.\n\nonly 15% of companies covered by j.p. morgan analysts are rated underweight, while 41% are rated neutral and 45% are rated overweight.\n\nthe stock us:i slid as much as 15.5% intraday, then rallied to a gain of as much as 6.1% before settling to close up 0.3%.\n\non thursday, as pai gave his speech, investors were whipsawed multiple times intraday, swinging between a decline of as much as 13.4% to a gain of as much as 61.2% before closing up 0.5%. the stock was halted for volatility no less than 10 times on thursday.\n\nfactset, marketwatch\n\npai acknowledged in his that it will cost money for satellite companies to relocate operations within the c-band, or spectrum in the 3.7-to-4.2 gigahertz band which will be used to deploy 5g networks. he said the fcc estimates the cost to range from $3 billion to $5 billion.\n\nso under my draft rules, the winning bidders in the c-band auction would be required to reimburse satellite operators for their reasonable relocation costs, pai said.\n\nhe followed by proposing to give satellite operators the opportunity to receive accelerated relocation payments of $9.7 billion, to be split by the operators, if they meet milestones for clearing spectrum quickly.\n\nthis is well below our prior estimate of ~$12 billion, net of move costs, and coming over time rather than up front, rendering intelsat's equity worth little given its ~$14 billion debt load and 9.6x [debt] leverage, as well as its very challenged fundamental satellite business, cusick wrote in a note to clients.\n\nmoody's investors service said in october that given intelsat's leverage around 10x, it rated the company's credit at caa2, which is eight notches deep into junk territory.\n\nin november, the stock lost about three quarters of its value after pai decided to move forward with the public-auction option for new 5g spectrum, which would require that at least half of the auction's revenue be reserved for taxpayers.\n\ndon't miss: intelsat's stock sinks again as congress looks to 'rake' in revenue from 5g spectrum auction.\n\ncusick said it is possible that satellite companies negotiate for more money, but that's not likely enough to change his opinion on equity value.\n\nhere's how the c-band alliance (cba), which comprises intelsat, luxembourg's ses s.a. sesg, -0.03% and canada-based telesat holdings inc., responded to pai's proposal:\n\ntoday's comments by chairman pai are a significant development in this important proceeding. we look forward to reviewing the draft order, once issued, to place chairman pai's comments in full context.\n\ncusick said the fact that the cba didn't initially push back implies some level of knowledge and consent, and makes it likely that satellite operators will eventually accept the fcc proposal.\n\nthat said, not all analysts were so downbeat. raymond james's ric prentiss reiterated his outperform rating on intelsat, but acknowledged that could change once details are known about how they payments are split between the satellite companies.
more millionaires call the big apple home than any other city in the world.\n\nnew york had the largest population of high-net-worth individuals, whose net worth in assets totals between $1 million and $30 million, according to a recent report released by global wealth consultancy wealth-x. some 978,810 high-net-worth, or hnw, individuals reside in new york. that's nearly double the hnw population of tokyo (593,025 individuals), which came in at no. 2 on wealth-x's ranking.\n\n new york has more high-net-worth individuals than any other city in the world, and it also has the largest population of ultrawealthy people. the latter group comprises those with assets exceeding $30 million. \n\nnot only does new york have more hnw individuals than any other city in the world, but it also has the largest population of ultrawealthy people, defined as those who have assets worth more than $30 million. it regains this distinction after losing the title to hong kong in 2017. however, the tenuous relationship between the u.s. and china roiled the wealthy elite in hong kong, causing the hnw population there to drop by more than 11% last year.\n\nwealth-x's findings were based on its proprietary database of hnw individuals, which includes information such as the individuals' financial assets, career histories, family backgrounds and philanthropic endeavors, among other data points.\n\nread more:some of the wealthiest people on the planet got a financial wake-up call in 2018\n\noverall, america had six of the top 10 hnw cities, per wealth-x's list. dallas–fort worth, which has seen its wealth grow thanks in part to the strong energy sector, entered the list for the first time this year.\n\nhere is how the full rankings shook out:\n\n• new york (978,810 hnw individuals, down 0.6% from 2017)\n\n• tokyo (593,025 hnw individuals, down 3.3% from 2017)\n\n• los angeles (576,255 hnw individuals, down 0.7% from 2017)\n\n• hong kong (391,595 hnw individuals, down 11.1% from 2017)\n\n• london (372,270 hnw individuals, up 2.7% from 2017)\n\n• chicago (353,775 hnw individuals, down 0.8% from 2017)\n\n• paris (345,175 hnw individuals, up 4.5% from 2017)\n\n• san francisco (314,055 hnw individuals, down 0.4% from 2017)\n\n• washington, d.c. (301,495 hnw individuals, down 1.3% from 2017)\n\n• dallas (298,220 hnw individuals, up 0.1% from 2017)\n\nwhile the list of cities with the wealthiest populations may not appear diverse today, that could soon change. china boasts 32 of 40 fastest-growing hnw cities in the world currently, according to wealth-x. there is still no representation in the top 10 from china, whose largest city for uhnw and hnw is shanghai, with 123,000 hnw individuals, the report noted. but this belies the meteoric growth.\n\n nigeria has the fastest-growing high-net-worth population in the world, with the number of residents there worth $1 million to $30 million expected to increase 16.3% by 2023. \n\nmoreover, the concentration of extremely wealthy individuals in certain cities could be simply a reflection of different cultural approaches to wealth. london and paris are the european representatives in the top 10, with nucleated concentrations of hnw in their capital cities, in contrast to a more distributed pattern of wealth, for example, in german cities, the report's authors wrote.\n\nindeed, while the u.s. does have the world's largest hnw population, china ranks second, followed by a wide assortment of countries including japan, germany, south korea and australia. and nigeria has the fastest-growing high-net-worth population in the world, with the number of residents there worth $1 million to $30 million expected to increase 16.3% by 2023.
what makes the stock market move over the long term? while stocks have historically delivered positive returns year-over-year on average, it is not clear why stock prices rise more rapidly in one period than in any other.\n\nwith my colleagues, martin lettau of the u.c. berkeley haas school of business and sydney ludvigson of new york university, i set out to investigate what makes stocks move over time. what we found was surprising.\n\ndespite the widespread belief that firm productivity is a key driver of stock market returns, our results indicate that fluctuations in productivity play only a small role. far more influential over long periods is the economic redistribution between workers and shareholders — meaning how a company's profits are divided between employees and investors.\n\nour first step in this research was to consider which factors might be responsible for movement in the stock market in aggregate. each firm that is represented in the stock market index produces a stream of revenues. after paying a portion to workers, the rest is left over as profits that can be distributed to shareholders as dividends. the stock price will rise whenever the rewards to the shareholders increase, which can be caused by one of three separate forces:\n\nproductivity: the firm becomes more productive, increasing its stream of revenues. this increases the size of both slices, including the shareholders' slice. redistribution: the size of the pie remains fixed, but the firm pays a smaller share to the workers, increasing the shareholders' slice. market confidence: neither the size nor the division of the pie changes, but more risk-tolerant investors demand more stock despite there being no change in their current dividends.\n\ncombining theoretical analysis with statistical estimation on macroeconomic and stock market data, we were able to determine the relative strengths of these three forces.\n\nhere's what we found: at short-term horizons of one-quarter to several years, market confidence shocks are dominant, explaining nearly all fluctuations. essentially, short-run swings in stock prices are simply out of proportion to the movements in the underlying cash flows, ruling out the other two explanations.\n\nbut at longer horizons of a decade or more, we found that redistributions between workers and shareholders play an increasingly important role, explaining half of the variation in overall stock prices at a horizon of 25 years.\n\nthese redistributive shifts, taken individually, are quite small, and are not major factors in explaining quarterly returns. but unlike movements in market confidence, which tend to return to normal over a few quarters or years, these redistributive shifts are virtually permanent, allowing a sequence of small shifts to build up over time — with huge overall impact.\n\nhere's what trump means for health care\n\nfor example, we estimate that if there had been no redistributive shifts since 1980, which mostly went in favor of shareholders, the level of the stock market in 2012 would have been only 56% of its observed value. however, these changes do not always favor shareholders. case in point: the period from 1960 to 1980 saw substantial gains for workers at the expense of lower stock returns.\n\nfinally, fluctuations in productivity play little role over any time frame. certainly, improvements in technology are important, and changes in productivity may be central to the performance of individual stocks. but for explaining why the market as a whole rose more in one period than another — be it a quarter, year, or decade — differences in aggregate productivity growth are rarely the story.\n\nsince financial researchers often assume that productivity is the key driver of stock prices, our results suggest that a major rethinking may be in order.\n\nin the wake of donald trump's election, many are looking to the stock market to learn what is in store for the economy. while much of the short-run action likely reflects movements in market confidence or uncertainty, upcoming decisions on corporate taxes or labor policy may influence what shareholders ultimately receive. our research implies that expectations regarding redistribution, rather than forecasts of overall economic performance, may play a crucial role in driving stock prices as the political agenda is revealed.\n\ndaniel greewald is an assistant professor of finance at the mit sloan school of management.

such is the distrust toward polls that the late move toward the democrats in the georgia senate runoff elections was treated with skepticism on wall street.\n\nso financial markets have reacted to the news raphael warnock won one of two senate runoffs in georgia early on wednesday, with jon ossoff leading the other and the votes remaining to be counted centered in counties around atlanta. that puts the democrats on the precipice of control of an evenly divided u.s. senate, with vice president-elect kamala harris getting the tiebreaking vote.\n\nthe yield on the 10-year treasury tmubmusd10y, 1.664% rose as high as 1.04% in expectations of greater spending. the dollar fell, with the euro eurusd, -0.18% trading over $1.23.\n\nfutures on the small-cap russell 2000 rty00, +0.00% rose, while broader s&p 500 futures es00, +0.05% and nasdaq-100 futures nq00, +0.01% fell, with technology giants including facebook fb, +1.69% , google owner alphabet goog, -0.07% and microsoft msft, -0.28% trading lower in premarket action on fears of regulatory action. a cannabis etf mj, +1.35% rallied.\n\nwhile these probable victories raise the level of political uncertainty and certain sectors of the u.s. equity market may underperform (health care, tech for example), the macro implications of these election outcomes are clearly positive, said derek halpenny, head of research for global markets at mufg bank in london. there is now a chance of larger stimulus checks for u.s. households ($2,000 instead of $600) and an increased prospect of larger fiscal stimulus support in general going forward.\n\nif the democrats manage to pull off the upsets in georgia, then a key difference this time around, in my view, is that many of those same democrat players who were there in 2009 would likely use their latest opportunity to advance greater fiscal spending to support the economic recovery. in a more-pronounced economic recovery, we would expect an even further rise in treasury rates, tightening of municipal and corporate bond spreads, weakening of the dollar, and higher performance of value stocks and emerging market equities, added brian levitt, global market strategist at invesco, in a note ahead of the results.\n\nthe steepening yield curve — the gap between 2- and 10-year yields surged to the widest since 2017 — should help the banking sector. shares of jpmorgan chase jpm, +1.03% rose in premarket trade.\n\none big question will be whether there will be a desire to raise taxes on corporations or wealthy americans, a move advocated by president-elect joe biden.\n\nalthough a 'blue sweep' with a democratic win in georgia result may revive a discussion about u.s. tax hikes to come, we consider it unlikely that the new treasury secretary janet yellen would pursue policies that could stifle the u.s. economic recovery. given her dovish leaning, her focus will likely be on more stimulus instead, said holger schmeiding, chief economist at berenberg bank.\n\nthe buzz\n\nvice president mike pence will certify the congressional tally of electoral college votes, as president donald trump publicly lobbied him to overturn the result.\n\nthe minutes of the last federal open market committee meeting will be published, as the public comments from various officials in recent days show a split on the issue of bond purchases. adp reported a 123,000 decline in its estimate of private-sector payrolls for december, and after the open, the service-sector purchasing managers index will be released.\n\ntesla tsla, +3.68% saw its target price upped to $810 from $540 by morgan stanley, which reiterated an overweight call on the electric-vehicle maker. barclays, by contrast, reiterated its $230 price target.\n\ntrump signed an executive order banning alibaba's alipay baba, +2.82% and seven other chinese apps.\n\nunitedhealth unh, -0.68% agreed to buy change healthcare chng, +0.74% at a 41% premium to tuesday's close, and amerisourcebergen abc, +1.01% will buy the alliance healthcare wba, -1.11% businesses from walgreens boots alliance for $6.5 billion.\n\nrandom reads\n\na university is trying out vending machines for covid-19 tests.\n\nnasa's new telescope may unravel the secrets of the big bang.\n\nneed to know starts early and is updated until the opening bell, but sign up here to get it delivered once to your email box. the emailed version will be sent out at about 7:30 a.m. eastern.\n\nwant more for the day ahead? sign up for the barron's daily, a morning briefing for investors, including exclusive commentary from barron's and marketwatch writers.
online publishing site medium announced wednesday that it was cutting 50 jobs and shutting down its new york and washington d.c. offices as it works to change its business model. this past year was the best year for the site, with readers and published posts up 300%, according to a blog post from ev williams, chief executive of medium. but williams wrote that the site was being supported by an ad-driven model, which was a break from the innovative media platform it is striving to be. to continue on this trajectory put us at risk...of becoming an extension of a broken system, williams wrote. he said it is too soon to say what the new model for medium will be. the cuts reduce the medium team by about a third and include some executives from the two shuttered offices, according to the post.
get more from your money.\n\nfinancial uncertainty is in the air — with some experts predicting a coming recession, more stock market volatility and more consumers defaulting on their debts, among other issues.\n\n\n\nand while we don't know what will happen, that uncertainty makes 2019 a good time to shore up your savings, spend less so you can save more, pay down debt and invest smartly. so we asked experts what money moves they'd recommend taking in 2019. here are 15 of them.\n\n1. develop an investment policy statement, which is a document that outlines your investment goals and objectives and the strategies that you'll use to make them happen, says mitchell c. hockenbury, a certified financial planner at kansas city-based 1440 financial partners. it might include information on your asset allocation, risk tolerance and more. he recommends taking vanguard's investor questionnaire to help you develop the statement, or working with a professional on it.\n\na statement like this can be very helpful in financially uncertain times, says hockenbury: the purpose is to help you when you become anxious with big drops in the market. the last thing you want to do is to make poor investment decisions because of fear or greed.\n\n2. rebalance your retirement accounts, says darren l. zagarola, a certified financial planner at eks associates in princeton, making sure your asset allocation is in line with the goals from your investment policy statement. it can help to consolidate your 401(k) plans from old companies, which allows you to get a better handle on your investment strategy and risk level, says andrew westlin at betterment.\n\n3. make sure you have 3-6 months of income saved in an emergency fund, says leanna johannes, a senior wealth strategist at pnc wealth management in philadelphia. this is a savvy move particularly during uncertain financial times, as it can help protect you in the event of a job loss or other emergency.\n\n4. pay off your debt like this.consumer debt hit record highs in 2018 – so make this the year you tackle yours. the first step of your plan is figuring out the total debt you have, the type of debt and the interest rates on those debts, says johannes. then look for ways to consolidate your debt or lower your interest rates, she adds -- noting that you should negotiate lower rates if you can.\n\nto tackle debt, consider aggressively paying off the highest interest debt and then the minimum on all others; once that is done, then tackle the next highest interest rate debt; and on and on until you're debt free. and if you struggle with credit card debt, priya malani, the founding partner at stash wealth in new york, recommends tally, an app that consolidates credit card debt from multiple cards into one lower monthly payment.\n\n5. move your savings online, says malani. most savings accounts are paying out very low rates right now so you want to earn as much money as you can. that's why she likes online banks like ally and marcus. they pay a higher rate of interest on their regular savings account than a typical brick-and-mortar bank, she says.\n\n6. freeze your credit – even if you don't suspect any foul play. this can protect you from people taking out credit cards and loans in your name in the future – and as data breaches and identity theft are becoming more and more frequent, this may be smarter than ever. all three major credit agencies, equifax, experian and transunion, allow you to freeze your credit file for free. best of all, it only takes a few minutes to 'thaw' when you need to have your report pulled. this is the best way to be proactive in protecting your credit, says hockenbury.\n\n7. change your passwords for important logins like your bank, says zagarola. this can help protect your accounts from getting hacked. here's a guide on creating smart passwords.\n\n8. make a concrete budget. you've heard this advice before but that doesn't make it any less relevant this year. indeed, experts say this is the best way to get your spending under control, pay down debt and save more. this guide will help you make a budget in seven steps, or consider budgeting software like ynab to help. one of the things that trips many people up is the semi-annual and annual payments, hockenbury says -- which might include things like car insurance payments or annual memberships. take the extra time to think through these types of expenditures, hockenbury says.\n\n9. save with purpose, says malani. rather than have one big savings account for everything, you should have different accounts for different goals: in 2019, put purpose behind your savings. start by deciding what you're saving for (i.e. trip to portugal, new west elm couch, etc.). then set up a separate savings account for each thing or experience you're saving for. finally, nickname the savings account in accordance with its designated purpose. you'll be much less likely to 'borrow' money from your portugal vacay account than just a general savings account, she explains.\n\nand make that savings automatic so you actually end up saving the money, she adds. set up automatic transfers from your checking to your savings account at regular intervals. to boost savings even more, malani recommends the app digit: it will 'sneak' money out of it and save it for you. promise you won't miss it and before you know it, you'll have a few hundred dollars saved up, she explains.\n\n10. boost retirement contributions — even if it's just by 1%. at the very least, contribute enough to secure your employer's match, which is typically between 3% and 6%, says johannes. try to boost contributions every six months or so if you can.\n\n11. get smarter about your credit score. malani says you should check out your credit score using creditwise from capitalone (you don't have to be a capitalone customer to use it). it shows you your credit score, why your score is where it is, and simulates how decisions like applying for a new loan might impact your score. it also has fraud alerts to let you know if someone is trying to use your personal information. if your score is low, here's a guide to boost it.\n\n12. revisit your estate plan, says zagarola. review your wills to ensure that your wishes will be met at your death. review the beneficiary designations of retirement accounts and life insurance to ensure they marry up with your estate planning wishes, he explains.\n\n13. reward yourself. if you always pay off your credit card in full and on time, you should be earning credit card rewards. use this tool from nerdwallet to get the best rewards card for your lifestyle. love the idea of rewards but want to play it a little safer? malani recommends the app debitize. use your credit card as you usually would to get rewards, but link it and your checking account to debitize. buy something on your credit card, and debitize will pull the money out of your checking account each day and at the end of the month will pay your credit card bill in full.\n\n14. shop around for new insurance. this can literally save you thousands this year. on car insurance alone, a good driver could save more than $400 a year by switching companies.\n\n15. fight overdraft fees.overdraft fees have been steadily rising, with americans paying more now than they have since 2009. here are some tips for fighting those fees. you can also try the free app earnin, which allows you to borrow up to $100 from your pending paycheck rather than have to wait every two weeks and risk overdraft. the app allows you to pay what you think is fair for the service. just beware of the potential pitfalls, including blowing your budget and overspending.
would you be interested in an asset class that has risen in all but one of the stock bear-markets of the past 70 years — and isn't bonds? of course you would. but there's a catch: the asset class is residential real estate, and it's difficult to invest in real estate as an asset class.\n\ngiven how unattractive bonds are at today's low interest rates, and real estate's potential to benefit from some of the very factors that are anathema to bonds (such as inflation), even an imperfect approximation of the residential real estate asset class could be worth pursuing.\n\nconsider the performance of the case-shiller home price index, which is derived from information on repeat sales of homes across the u.s. monthly values for this index exist back to 1952, which enabled me to measure the index's performance during the 20 bear markets that have occurred in the subsequent 65 years. if we overlook one in which the index slipped just 0.4%, there was only one bear market in which residential real estate fell.\n\n(for the exact start and end dates for each of these 20 bear markets, i relied on a calendar maintained by ned davis research. though you might quibble with the exact criteria the firm uses for determining when bear markets begin and end, the firm's calendar contains all the obvious and usual suspects—such as declines of at least 20% in a major market index.)\n\nthat lone exception in which residential real estate fell was a doozy, however: the 2007-09 financial crisis. so perhaps the first issue to grapple with is whether the 2007-09 period was an outlier. insofar as it was an exception that proves the rule, then we can be at least moderately confident in real estate's ability to cushion equity bear markets.\n\ni asked robert shiller, the yale university finance professor and a co-creator of the case-shiller measure, whether he thought real estate's poor performance in the 2007-09 was an anomalous event. he said it was, since historically there is surprisingly little relation between home prices and the stock market. the implication: shiller does not expect that in the next bear stock market there [will] be anything unusual happening in the housing market.\n\nthe accompanying chart graphically shows the performance of stocks, bonds, and residential real estate since the early 1950s, which confirms shiller's comment about the lack of any correlation between home prices and the stock market. as you can see, the case-shiller index has produced almost identical annualized returns during both stock bull- and bear markets.\n\nsome people are surprised at this chart, since they thought residential real estate had produced much higher average annual returns — instead of rising at a rate even lower than long-term treasurys. hasn't real estate been the greater generator of wealth over the last half-century? but real estate's wealth generation is due in large part to leverage — buying a house with a mortgage — which magnifies the returns of the asset itself.\n\nthe chart also shows that bonds historically have had an even better record than real estate during equity bear markets. bonds even gained ground during the 2007-09 financial crisis, when real estate fell. so if it weren't for currently low interest rates, you might conclude that bonds are the superior hedge against bear markets.\n\nreal estate becomes particularly compelling when framed against higher inflation. for example, the 10-year treasury tmubmusd10y, 1.696% currently yields about 2.5%. if inflation over the next decade averages more than that, those investing in the 10-year today will be guaranteed to lose money. to put that in context, consider that the consumer price index (cpi) over the last 12 months rose 2.1%; it won't take much of an uptick in inflation for a 10-year treasury purchased today to produce a negative real return.\n\nin contrast to bonds, which will be hurt by higher inflation, real estate should benefit. consider the extent to which the 12-month rate of change in the case-shiller home price index is correlated with that of the cpi. the correlation coefficient — which ranges from minus 1.0 (inverse correlation) to plus 1.0 (positive correlation) and which is zero if there is no correlation — is a statistically significant 0.45. the comparable correlation with long-term bonds is negative, not surprisingly, at minus 0.19.\n\nread: why it's so hard to forecast home prices for 2018 — and why that should worry you\n\nanother hurdle is determining how investors can invest in residential real estate as an asset class. this is a big hurdle, since the performance of an individual home will largely be a function of idiosyncratic factors — location, location, location — having relatively little to do with real estate as an asset class.\n\nbig risks of international investing\n\nit would be ideal if there existed an exchange-traded fund that is benchmarked to the case-shiller index. a number of years ago a firm co-founded by shiller did offer just such an etf, but that fund subsequently shut down.\n\nthe next best alternative, as far as i can tell, is one of the etfs that invest in the residential construction industry. three that i analyzed for this column are:\n\n• ishares u.s. home construction etf itb, -4.35%\n\n• powershares dynamic building & construction portfolio pkb, -1.88%\n\n• spdr s&p homebuilders etf xhb, -1.26%\n\nfor each, i calculated the correlation coefficient of its 12-month rate of change with that of the case-shiller home price index. for all three the coefficients were high and significant. the etf with the highest correlation since may 2006, the point at which all three of these etfs existed, is the powershares etf, with a correlation coefficient of 0.70. the ishares etf had a coefficient of 0.63, and the homebuilders spdr had a coefficient of 0.59.\n\nbeware, however, that the powershares etf has the highest expense ratio of the three: 0.63%, or $63 dollars per year for every $10,000 invested. the spdr etf's expense ratio is the lowest of the three, at 0.35%, while the ishares etf sports an expense ratio of 0.44%.\n\nread: how much do you really know about real estate?

oil slipped tuesday as concerns over supply disruptions in the north sea and libya eased, but prices stuck close to the more than two-year high they settled at last week as rising tensions in major oil exporter iran underpinned the market.\n\nwest texas intermediate crude futures, the u.s. benchmark, had settled at $60.42 a barrel on the last trading day of 2017—the highest finish since june 2015.\n\nfebruary wti crude on the new york mercantile exchange us:clg8 fell by a nickel tuesday to settle at $60.37 a barrel. the u.s. benchmark rose 12.5% in 2017, according to data from dow jones.\n\nmarch brent uk:lcoh8 lost 30 cents, or 0.5%, to $66.57 a barrel on ice futures europe. the international benchmark for crude gained 18% for 2017.\n\nthe market has improved amid optimism about years of oversupply finally ebbing, capped by rising demand and the production-limit deal, led by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries, being extended through 2018.\n\nthe recent supply disruptions in libya and the north sea won't change the outlook for oil over the medium term, but rising potential global demand coupled with opec adhering to production cuts has helped to offset rising u.s. production, according to analysts at the sevens report.\n\nas we enter 2018, make no mistake that u.s. production will continue to drive the market medium and longer term, they said in monday's report. if u.s. production continues to rise that will remain a consistent and growing headwind on oil prices. and while clearly momentum is higher near term, we don't see oil breaking out materially from here.\n\ntraders will have to wait until thursday, a day later than usual due to the new year's day holiday, to see the weekly update on u.s. oil supplies and production from the energy information administration.\n\nmeanwhile, iran is facing its sixth day of demonstrations in some of the country's most widespread street protests in nearly a decade, with protesters demanding an end to the islamic republic regime and a change in leadership. that's raised some concerns over the potential for disruptions to oil production. iran is opec's third-largest producer.\n\nit is too early to say that because of the iranian government's crackdown that [u.s.] sanctions will be put back in place, said phil flynn, senior market analyst at price futures group. however, it is a possibility and oil prices holding above $60 for a second session could signal that oil is still in a breakout mode.\n\noil demand is expected to come closer to matching oil supplies in the second half of the year, after more than three years of excess supply bolstering global stocks.\n\nthe first quarter should be the weakest data of the year in terms of the weakest demand for crude oil due to refinery maintenance... it's in the second half of the year that it should tighten, said olivier jakob, managing director of petromatrix, an oil research firm in switzerland.\n\non nymex, february heating oil us:hog8 fell 0.5% to $2.058 a gallon. its close friday at $2.0755 marked the highest settlement since feb. 27, 2015. futures gained 22% for 2017. february gasoline us:rbg8 fell 1.8% at $1.763 a gallon. gasoline futures rose 8.1% in 2017.\n\nfebruary natural gas us:ngg18 settled at a one-month high of $3.056 per million british thermal units, up 3.5% for the session as frigid u.s. temperatures boosted demand. futures fell nearly 21% last year.
the possibility of weakness in the computer network software space in the current quarter raised its head late tuesday after two companies cut their forecasts for the quarter within minutes of each other, sending their respective shares significantly lower.\n\nshares of aerohive networks inc. us:hive fell 28% and shares of a10 networks inc. aten, -2.64% dropped 18% in wednesday morning trading.\n\nlate tuesday, aerohive warned that fourth-quarter revenue would be in the ballpark of $37 million, following its previous forecast of $40 million to $42 million. the company expects a net loss of $3 million to $4 million, but a non-gaap operating profit after subtracting stock-based compensation and other effects. analysts surveyed by factset had estimated break-even results on revenue of $40.9 million.\n\nfollowing the change in our sales leadership at the end of our third quarter, we uncovered underlying sales execution issues which became fully apparent in the last month of the fourth quarter, chief executive david flynn said in tuesday's announcement. we have taken actions to replace underperforming sales team members, and we believe that the new people we have been putting in place, combined with other actions, will enable us to capitalize on our improved product offering and exciting roadmap in 2018.\n\na10 networks forecast fourth-quarter revenue of $55.5 million to $56 million, down from its prior forecast range of $64 million to $67 million, and expects earnings of 5 cents to 6 cents a share, compared with a previous estimated range of 1 cent to 7 cents a share.\n\nanalysts surveyed by factset had estimated earnings of 3 cents a share on revenue of $65.1 million.\n\nwe are disappointed with our revenue results for the quarter, which were below our guidance primarily due to a shortfall in north america sales as we experienced lower-than-expected seasonal demand trends in the region, said lee chen, a10 president and chief executive, in a statement.\n\naerohive and a10 both expect to report fourth-quarter earnings on feb. 8.

square inc. on thursday announced a new debit card for small-business owners, a move that enables the fintech company to further participate in the economics of payment transactions.\n\nwith the square card, which is free to obtain and use, business owners will be able to spend their square sq, -3.13% balances immediately in stores and online. previously, those who used square for payment processing had to wait several days for their funds to transfer to their banks accounts, or else they could pay a small fee for instant access to their money.\n\nsquare earns transaction fees at the time sellers make their purchases with the card.\n\ndon't miss: square adds mobile pay as part of move upmarket\n\nalyssa henry, square's seller lead, said on a media call earlier this week that she expects the card to prove helpful with cash-flow management, a big pain point for sellers. the company gave the example of a man who manages a roofing-supply business and is able to immediately buy supplies for a project as soon as he's received payment from the customer.\n\nhenry also discussed how many small-business owners co-mingle personal and business expenses, which can make it difficult to determine the profitability of an enterprise. the square card will have tools that allow business owners to classify their various expenses as either business-related or personal.\n\nvideo: how automated digital payroll will change the way employees get paid\n\nsquare will give cardholders a 2.75% discount when they use the mastercard inc.-branded card to buy items from another square seller, a nod to the standard payment-processing fee that sellers have come to know from square.\n\nread: this $22 billion deal could be just the beginning\n\nthe company is no stranger to offering stored-value debit products, having launched the consumer-focused cash card in 2017. consumers don't pay to use the cash card, but square generates revenue from it via transaction fees.\n\ninstinet analyst dan dolev wrote in a november note to clients that the cash card is the fourth largest revenue component within square's software and services segment, based on his recent chat with the company's investor-relations team. the various software and services components together are expected to have brought in $253 million during 2018, according to factset estimates. square said in its second-quarter investor letter that cash app customers spent $250 million with the card last june, almost triple the amount spent in december 2017.\n\nsee also: fiserv stock upgraded to outperform at wolfe research on optimism for first data deal\n\nthe new business-oriented square card limits cardholders to only spending their square balances; users can't add funds to the card, which isn't fdic insured. square is working with ohio-based sutton bank to enable atm access through the card.
surging mortgage rates, dwindling inventory, and soaring home prices are taking a toll on americans' attitudes toward ownership, according to a survey released monday.\n\nthe home purchase sentiment index compiled by mortgage finance provider fannie mae fell in december, its fifth straight monthly decline.\n\nfannie's index has six components. in december, two were lower compared to november, two were unchanged, and two increased. but the index was 2.5 percentage points lower than a year ago, with only one component higher.\n\ndecember 2016 index change since last month change since last year good time to buy 32 +2 -3 good time to sell 13 0 +5 home prices will go up 35 0 -5 mortgage rates will go down -55 -4 -3 confidence about not losing job 68 +4 -4 household income is significantly higher 10 -5 -5 overall index 80.7 -0.5 -2.5\n\nthe surge in consumer sentiment that's been recorded since the presidential election is typical, fannie chief economist doug duncan noted in a statement, and whether buyers can withstand the corresponding jump in mortgage rates is an open question.\n\nin fact, it was the second yearly decline for the component that tracks the number of people who say it's a good time to buy. that was a net 36% in december 2014, a net 35% in december 2015, and a net 32% last month.\n\nwhile good time to buy and good time to sell are both subjective, respondents are also asked to weigh in on whether mortgage rates and home prices are likely to go up or down.\n\nmost people – a net 55% - think rates will go up, and most experts agree. of four professional forecasts compiled by marketwatch last month, the median is for rates to average about 4.5% throughout 2017 – 30 basis points higher than their level last week.\n\nread: housing's big question — what will happen when buyers think 4% rates are 'crazy'\n\nrespondents were less certain about the direction of home prices, though. a net 46% thought they'd go up. data provider corelogic agrees. the group forecast a 4.7% increase in rates from december 2016 to december 2017.
new york (project syndicate) — it's old news that large segments of society have become deeply unhappy with what they see as the establishment, especially the political class. the yellow vest protests in france, triggered by president emmanuel macron's move to hike fuel taxes in the name of combating climate change, are but the latest example of the scale of this alienation.\n\nthere are good reasons for today's disgruntlement: four decades of promises by political leaders of both the center-left and center-right, espousing the neoliberal faith that globalization, financialization, deregulation, privatization, and a host of related reforms would bring unprecedented prosperity, have gone unfulfilled.\n\nwhile a tiny elite seems to have done very well, large swaths of the population have fallen out of the middle class and plunged into a new world of vulnerability and insecurity. even leaders in countries with low but increasing inequality have felt their public's wrath.\n\nby the numbers, france looks better than most, but it is perceptions, not numbers, that matter; even in france, which avoided some of the extremism of the reagan-thatcher era, things are not going well for many.\n\npeter morici:britain should quit europe and unilaterally declare free trade\n\nwhen taxes on the very wealthy are lowered, but raised for ordinary citizens to meet budgetary demands (whether from far-off brussels or from well-off financiers), it should come as no surprise that some are angry. the yellow vests' refrain speaks to their concerns: the government talks about the end of the world. we are worried about the end of the month.\n\nthere is, in short, a gross mistrust in governments and politicians, which means that asking for sacrifices today in exchange for the promise of a better life tomorrow won't pass muster. and this is especially true of trickle down policies: tax cuts for the rich that eventually are supposed to benefit everyone else.\n\nwhen i was at the world bank, the first lesson in policy reform was that sequencing and pacing matter. the promise of the green new deal that is now being championed by progressives in the united states gets both of these elements right.\n\nthe green new deal is premised on three observations: first, there are unutilized and underutilized resources — especially human talent — that can be used effectively. second, if there were more demand for those with low and medium skills, their wages and standards of living would rise. third, a good environment is an essential part of human wellbeing, today and in the future.\n\nif the challenges of climate change are not met today, huge burdens will be imposed on the next generation. it is just wrong for this generation to pass these costs on to the next. it is better to leave a legacy of financial debts, which our children can somehow manage, than to hand down a possibly unmanageable environmental disaster.\n\nalmost 90 years ago, president franklin d. roosevelt responded to the great depression with his new deal, a bold package of reforms that touched almost every aspect of the american economy.\n\nbut it is more than the symbolism of the new deal that is being invoked now. it is its animating purpose: putting people back to work, in the way that fdr did for the u.s., with its crushing unemployment of the time. back then, that meant investments in rural electrification, roads, and dams.\n\neconomists have debated how effective the new deal was — its spending was probably too low and not sustained enough to generate the kind of recovery the economy needed. nonetheless, it left a lasting legacy by transforming the country at a crucial time.\n\nso, too, for a green new deal: it can provide public transportation, linking people with jobs, and retrofit the economy to meet the challenge of climate change. at the same time, these investments themselves will create jobs.\n\nit has long been recognized that decarbonization, if done correctly, would be a great job creator, as the economy prepares itself for a world with renewable energy. of course, some jobs — for example, those of the 53,000 coal miners in the u.s. — will be lost, and programs are needed to retrain such workers for other jobs.\n\nto return to the refrain: sequencing and pacing matter. it would have made more sense to begin with creating new jobs before the old jobs were destroyed, to ensure that the profits of the oil and coal companies were taxed, and the hidden subsidies they receive eliminated, before asking those who are barely getting by to pony up more.\n\nthe green new deal sends a positive message of what government can do, for this generation of citizens and the next. it can deliver today what those who are suffering today need most — good jobs. and it can deliver the protections from climate change that are needed for the future.\n\nthe green new deal will have to be broadened, and this is especially true in countries like the u.s., where many ordinary citizens lack access to good education, adequate health care, or decent housing.\n\nthe grassroots movement behind the green new deal offers a ray of hope to the badly battered establishment: they should embrace it, flesh it out, and make it part of the progressive agenda. we need something positive to save us from the ugly wave of populism, nativism, and proto-fascism that is sweeping the world.\n\nthis article was published with permission of project syndicate — from yellow vests to the green new deal.
oil prices have jumped to three-year peaks, as speculative bets hit all-time highs and a record-setting u.s. winter helps boost demand.\n\nif you had bought oil three months ago, you would have bagged a profit of roughly 25% at this point, scoring yourself one of the biggest returns in the financial markets (apart from the monster rallies in cryptocurrencies, of course).\n\nis it too late to jump on the oil bandwagon? there is still a way to score gains, if you just know where to look, according to strategists at j.p. morgan.\n\noil scratching $70 a barrel is perhaps a more interesting milestone than new highs on stocks, they said in a note dated friday, referring to brent's recent high.\n\nprices can stay high in this year's first half, and energy stocks are the only proxy that still trades cheap to current or even longer-dated oil futures, they wrote.\n\nequities stand out as cheap by 10-15% for the s&p energy, 5-10% for msci energy and 10% for msci russia, the analysts added, implying a rally.\n\nthe biggest energy equities etf — the energy select sector spdr etf xle, -4.49% — is up 7% in 2018 so far, but only up 14% over the past three months. that means it still has some catching up to do to reflect the more than 20% rallies in both crude and brent over the same period.\n\nbrent oil uk:lcoh8 briefly moved above the $70 mark last week and again early on tuesday, boosted by a decline in u.s. stockpiles, a weaker dollar and the cold spell that has gripped north america this winter. the continued efforts by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries to cut output has also helped the commodity march higher in recent months.\n\nboth benchmarks traded around their highest levels since december 2014, with west texas intermediate crude us:clg8 7% higher in 2018 so far, and brent up 5%. they are up 24% and 21%, respectively, over the last three months. wti traded around $64 a barrel on monday.\n\nwith the recent moves, oil has already exceeded j.p. morgan's 2018 year-end forecast of $65 per barrel for brent and $60.50 for wti. the wall street bank said prices are likely to stay high in the first half of the year, but could return to shaky ground in the second half if opec ends its production cuts and u.s. shale ramps up production in response to the recent rally.\n\nthat's why buying so-called oil proxies could offer a better risk-reward than snapping up oil futures. among popular oil proxies are energy stocks, russian equities, energy credit and petrocurrencies, such as the ruble usdrub, -0.06% , canadian dollar cadusd, -0.04% and the norwegian krone usdnok, -0.07% , the wall street bank said.\n\ntwo considerations matter: which asset trades cheapest to current oil prices, and which carries the least systemic risk (assuming the investor, for simplicity, does not want to hedge broader market exposure), the j.p. morgan strategists said.\n\nwe prefer energy stocks since their risk premium (cheapness) to oil is one of the largest in a decade, in an environment of limited downside risk to global stocks, they added.\n\ndata out over the weekend showed that speculative investors such as hedge funds increased their bullish net bets on wti to the highest level ever recorded. such data tend to raise concerns that the market is about to turn, because it could be an indicator the market is overheated.\n\na record position size, both long and short, carries an increased risk of a correction, said ole hansen, head of commodity strategy at saxo bank, in a note.\n\nfunds, however, will ride this rally as long the charts tell them to do so. on that basis there are currently no need to be alarmed, but given the size and one-sided nature of the position any sudden change in the outlook, both from a fundamental but also technical perspective could trigger a sizable correction, he added.
a measure of americans' sentiment toward the housing market worsened for the second consecutive month in december, reflecting rising concerns related to the pandemic.\n\nthe survey was taken before wednesday's events in washington, d.c. when a mob broke into the capitol building.\n\nthe home purchase sentiment index from fannie mae fnma, -1.05% dropped six points between november and december, as consumers became far more pessimistic about buying and selling homes, the mortgage giant reported on thursday. the index, which is based on a survey of more than 1,000 household financial decision makers nationwide, now sits at the lowest level since may of last year.\n\nthe percentage of americans who believe now is a good time to buy a home fell by five percentage points to just 52%, while the percentage of people who think it's a bad time to buy rose four percentage points to 39%. in december 2019, nearly two-thirds of americans believed it was a good time to purchase property.\n\nmeanwhile, it seems as if sellers are going to continue remaining on the sidelines of the market. only half of the survey respondents said they felt now is a good time to sell a home, down from 59% the month prior.\n\nit's the first time this measure has fallen since april, and the decline was large enough to erase the gains made in recent months.\n\nthe change implies that, at least temporarily, potential home sellers might wait to list their homes, doug duncan, fannie mae's chief economist, said in the report.\n\nif so, this could have the effect of perpetuating already-tight inventory levels and supporting additional (albeit lesser) home price growth, which could contribute to a further moderating of home sales, duncan added.\n\na separate report on thursday from realtor.com found that the number of homes for sale had dropped below 700,000 for the first time since the company began tracking this data.\n\nthe shortage of homes for sale nationwide has made it much more difficult to find a home to purchase, meaning that buyers are struggling to take advantage of the record-low mortgage rates on offer.\n\nfannie mae's report also pointed to a mixed view on the state of the economy, as coronavirus cases have risen to record levels in recent weeks. the percentage of people who said they were not concerned about losing their job decreased slightly, but remained high at 75%. however, only 20% of respondents said their household income is significantly higher than it was a year ago, down from 24% the month prior.
gold futures settled lower on friday as strength in the u.s. dollar and equities in the wake of the monthly domestic jobs report dulled investment demand for the precious metal.\n\nprices, however, gained for the week, buoyed by uncertainty surrounding the pace of interest-rate increases by the federal reserve.\n\nfebruary gold us:gcg7 fell $7.90, or 0.7%, to settle at $1,173.40 an ounce, after notching its highest settlement in five weeks on thursday. expectations about the pace of rate increases—a negative for gold that doesn't offer a yield—has cooled somewhat. for the week, the yellow metal tallied a 1.8% gain, according to factset data.\n\nmeanwhile, march silver us:sih7 was off 11.8 cents, or 0.7%, at $16.519 an ounce, paring its weekly rise to roughly 3.3%. march copper us:hgh7 added less than a cent to $2.546 a pound—up about 1.6% for the week.\n\nthe labor department reported that 156,000 jobs were added in december to cap off the sixth straight year in which the economy created more than 2 million new jobs. economists polled by marketwatch had predicted a 180,000 increase in new nonfarm jobs. the unemployment rate rose to 4.7% from 4.6%.\n\nan increase in wage growth, however, provided support for the argument that the employment market remains on a solid footing. average hourly wages jumped 0.4% to $26 last month, while hourly pay increased 2.9% from december 2015 to december 2016, marking the fastest 12-month increase since a recovery that began in mid-2009.\n\nstrength in the dollar, with the ice u.s. dollar index dxy, +0.42% , a measure of the currency against six rival currencies, tacking on 0.7% friday, weighed on gold, which is priced in the currency. a stronger buck makes assets priced in the currency more expensive to buyers using other monetary units.\n\nas gold futures settled, u.s. equities traded broadly higher, with the dow jones industrial djia, -0.46% just a few points short of the key 20,000 level. that drew more investor attention away from gold.\n\nbut the precious metal gained for the week, with traders and investors seeing it as oversold and a good value at these levels, mark o'byrne, research director at goldcore, told marketwatch.\n\nuncertainty regarding the soon to be inaugurated president-elect donald trump, the forthcoming elections in france, germany and the netherlands and the risks these pose to the eurozone is likely leading to a safe-haven bid, he said.\n\nsee:here's the right way to trade trump in 2017\n\no'byrne also said that the ongoing political spectacle this week between trump and sections of the intelligence community is a continuing geopolitical risk and shows how unstable the political situation in the u.s. remains.\n\ncolin cieszynski, chief market strategist at cmc markets, said momentum for a rise in gold has been aided by uncertainty raised about the pace of rate increases after the release on wednesday of minutes from most recent meeting of the policy-setting federal open market committee.\n\nfomc minutes reminded the street that the higher dollar may have done some of the fed's work for it, reining in inflation and economic activity, while members also reminded traders it remains uncertain what trump plans/is able to actually do, cieszynski wrote in a friday note.\n\nthe fed had indicated in december that at least three rate increases were in the offing for 2017, according to a forecast of interest rates from members of the central bank, known as the dot-plot.\n\namong other metals traded on comex, palladium was a standout.\n\npalladium futures rose friday, with the march contract us:pah7 up $20.15, or 2.7%, at $758.35 an ounce.\n\nprices for the metal saw a weekly gain of roughly 11%, which would be the largest gain of its kind since the week ended march 6, factset data show.\n\nanalysts at precious-metals consultancy metals focus said in a recent report that automotive demand should post another record high, driven by healthy demand in china and the u.s. palladium is used in automobile catalytic converters.\n\npart of the metal's expected climb will also likely be at the expense of platinum's use in diesel catalysts in europe, the analysts said.\n\napril platinum us:plj7 settled at $970.60 an ounce, down $5.40, or 0.6%—still ending 7.2% higher on the week.
billionaire investor carl icahn on thursday urged xerox corp. xrx, -4.69% to revise or even terminate its fuji xerox joint venture in the wake of an accounting scandal, and offered his support to darwin deason, the company's third-biggest shareholder. deason said wednesday that xerox should disclose its agreement with fuji and explore strategic alternatives regarding fuji. we are obviously in favor of renegotiating the joint venture agreement to make it more favorable for xerox, icahn wrote in an open letter to shareholders. this should have been done a long, long time ago. it is self-evident that the current management team is clearly incapable of doing so. icahn also criticized the long-tenured directors at xerox who refuse to acknowledge that change is needed. in december, jonathan christodoro, a former icahn employee, resigned from his role as member of the xerox board after a disagreement about strategy. xerox shares were down 0.8%, but have gained 15% in the last 12 months, while the s&p 500 spx, -1.48% has gained 23%.
there are lots of surprises when you become a grandparent for the first time – starting with how you get the news. the old-fashioned way is when the new dad calls you on the phone. that's how i spread the news when my wife and i became parents back in the dark ages. the newfangled way is, of course, by text.\n\ni left my maryland home on a friday morning knowing my daughter, living nearly 2,000 miles away in utah, had been in labor since the night before. i was worried that we hadn't heard anything but was not about to call. when you're in labor, probably the last thing you want is a phone call from dad saying, um, what's up?\n\nso i biked to work. i went to the locker room to shower but first checked my phone. there was a text from my other daughter: abba, you're a zaydie! (translation: abba is hebrew for father and zaydie is yiddish for grandpa.)\n\ni mean, it makes sense to use texts. still, i was surprised that texting was the method of delivery. it seemed so…untraditional.\n\nand that isn't the only surprising thing that occurs when you enter the demographic category of grandparent:\n\n1. tears are shed.\n\nwhen i got that text, droplets of moisture welled up in my eyes. caught up in my own busy life, i hadn't given a lot of thought to my daughter's pregnancy. i figured yes, she's pregnant. so she'll have a baby. i didn't expect i'd have such an outpouring of emotion. and those first tears were the harbinger of many tears to come.\n\nwhen i saw our new granddaughter, jolene, for the first time a week later, drip drip drop went the teardrops. when i had to say goodbye after our short visit, i sniffled. and now that i use her birth date as the passcode for my iphone, i sigh a little (and maybe cry a little) every time i enter the date.\n\nwhy all these tears? because a tiny new human being is really a miracle. and being a typical self-absorbed boomer, i couldn't quite realize that until it happened to me.\n\nwhen it comes to retirement, 60s are the new 50s\n\n2. you become a stereotypical grandparent.\n\ndid i tell you that she is the coolest baby ever? she instinctively knows how to look you in the eyes. she is an excellent sleeper. and even though she has no clue who i am, she would happily rest on my chest for hours, which makes me love her even more. best grandbaby ever!\n\n3. even if you are a person who can never sit still, you will sit still.\n\ni am always on the go. a vacation means: go for a run, go for a bike ride, take a hike. then it's time for brunch. at work, my restless legs take me on a stroll around the office every hour or so.\n\nbut there i was, sitting on the couch and holding that baby while she slept. an hour passed and then another and another, and i still wasn't ready to give her up because that's how absolutely fascinating and bewitching little babies can be. i didn't even check my phone for messages.\n\n4. you think deep thoughts.\n\ni look into my granddaughter's lively eyes and wonder: who will she become? what will she be like? what kind of world will she live in?\n\ndid my wife and i think these thoughts when our children were newborns? i don't believe we did because we were too sleep-deprived and too nervous about getting the parenthood thing right. but as a grandparent, i have the luxury of pondering the unfathomable potential of a new human being — and wonder if she'll be the one who invents such sorely needed products as a levitating sofa or a google translator for cat meows.\n\n5. you want to give advice to the new parents…but you don't.\n\nbecause you remember that when you were new parents you wouldn't have wanted your own parents and in-laws to say: you're holding her wrong! you're feeding her wrong! she's too bundled up! she's not bundled up enough!\n\nas a grandparent at work told me, let me give you some advice. never give advice.\n\neven though i am vowing not to be a back seat baby driver, i know i will sometimes be unable to stop myself. but i do swear to live by the sage words of a grandmother i knew: you can tell your kids something once. but don't repeat it. they really did hear you the first time.\n\n6. you change your mind about where you want to live and your career options.\n\nin the tiny town in utah where my fabulous granddaughter lives, i saw a help wanted sign for a busboy at the local diner. i'm updating my résumé with an emphasis on dishwashing skills.\n\n7. you kind of feel like you're a parent again — but with one big difference.\n\nall the memories of those early days of parenthood — the joys, the fears, the chores — come rushing back. only when the grandchild poops her diaper or gets hungry, you can say to the mom and dad, oh, i think the baby needs you now!\n\n8. you agonize over what the grandchild will call you.\n\ni cannot believe i am old enough to be a gramps or a grandpa. so i'm looking for alternatives. the paternal grandfather got dibs on pop pop. i do like zaydie, because it connects to my jewish heritage, but it also sounds to me like a bent-over eastern european dude with a scruffy beard.\n\nthen someone at work told me she just called her grandparents by their first names and that's who they were, her ethel and her frank. so i realized it doesn't matter what name i pick — as long as it doesn't make me feel old.
january is a natural time to take stock of your financial life, and to dream big dreams about 2018. could this be the year you make the leap to homeownership? or will you make a big change and trade in your mortgage payment for a landlord? while the housing market has slowly recovered from its dip in the 2000s, blind faith in housing gains has not. homeownership rates hit a 50-year low in 2015, and first-time home buyers are now waiting a record six years to move from renting to buying. in fact, young adults looking to upgrade out of their one-bedroom apartments are increasingly renting single-family homes rather than buying. single-family rentals — either detached homes or townhomes — make up the fastest-growing segment of the housing market, according to the urban institute.\n\nin the complex calculus that's required for the renting vs. buying decision, one variable stands out: which is cheaper? if that seems like a tough question to answer, there's a good reason: crunch the data from america's largest cities, and you'll learn it's a perfectly split decision. according to an urban institute analysis, among 33 top metropolitan areas in the u.s., there are 17 places where buying is cheaper, and 16 where renting is cheaper. home buying is a better option for those who plan to stay in one place for 3-5 years or more. it's also a good investment in many housing markets. according to the urban institute, here are 16 cities where buying is cheaper.\n\n1. miami\n\nwhile it's cheaper to buy than rent there, it would be a stretch to call the miami housing market a bargain. a median-priced home still consumes 32% of a median earner income, above the recommended 30%.\n\n2. detroit\n\nnot long ago, it was possible to buy a home in detroit for well below the median home price in the u.s. the detroit area has seen some revitalization in recent years, however, and while housing prices have gone up, it's still a better value to buy a home there than it is to rent one.\n\n3. chicago\n\nrent in chicago is on the rise faster than home prices. while they may level out in the near future, it's a good time to buy while you still can.\n\n4. philadelphia\n\nrenting is significantly more expensive than buying in the city of brotherly love. in fact, the average wage-earner would need a 36% raise to afford the average rent there. buying, however, is more affordable.\n\n5. tampa, florida\n\nfor roughly 90% of tampa communities, renting is more expensive than buying.\n\n6. pittsburgh\n\nthe average rent in pittsburgh is $1250 a month, whereas the average home price is just over $145,000. broken down, it's cheaper to buy in pittsburgh, as your monthly mortgage will be much less expensive than the average rent.\n\neverything we thought about millennials' money habits was wrong\n\n7. cleveland\n\nin this popular college town, a home buyer will save an average of $200 a month if they pay a mortgage instead of rent.\n\n8. cincinnati\n\nhistorically speaking, it's been cheaper to rent than buy in cincinnati based on the percentage of a person's income that went to housing costs. that number is now lower for buyers and higher for renters.\n\n9. orlando\n\norlando shutterstock\n\nin the home of disney world, the average monthly rent will cost you roughly double what the average comparable monthly mortgage payment will.\n\n10. houston\n\neven though median rents are falling in houston, it's still cheaper to buy, especially if you plan on staying in your home for three years or more.\n\n11. san antonio\n\naverage monthly rent for an apartment in san antonio will run you $1,226 (estimated as recently as december 2017). the price of a home in the area is $232,000. while the housing market is trending upward, it's still more advantageous to buy a home, especially if you plan to stay in the area for a long time.\n\n12. new york\n\nit's no secret that home prices in the new york city area (including newark and jersey city) are well above the national average. however, rental prices are even higher, so if you can afford to buy property here, you'd be better off doing so rather than renting.\n\n13. minneapolis and st. paul\n\nthe twin cities are becoming an increasingly popular to destination for young families to move, so it's a good time to invest in property here instead of renting it.\n\n14. kansas city\n\nboth rents and housing prices are low in the kansas city area (average rent will cost just under a thousand dollars, while the average home price is $126,100), but buying is better long-term, as it offers more benefits, including potential tax write-offs.\n\n15. columbus, ohio\n\nmany market experts consider columbus a no-brainer metro area as far as buying over renting. with affordable housing on both sides, the advantage goes to buying.\n\n16. boston\n\nwhile a buyer may need a large income (or two above-average incomes) to buy here, they'll need a slightly larger one to rent long-term.
if you're excited about the idea of investing in a bitcoin-tracking exchange-traded fund, you'll have to wait a bit longer to learn if you can—again.\n\nthe securities and exchange commission on wednesday designated march 11 as the date by which it would either approve or disapprove the winklevoss bitcoin trust etf, which would be the first to exclusively track the digital currency.\n\na decision would represent the end of a multiyear campaign to bring a bitcoin etf to market. tyler and cameron winklevoss, who run winklevoss capital, first announced plans for one in 2013; the pair also run both winkdex, a bitcoin price index, and gemini, a bitcoin custodian and exchange.\n\nwinklevoss capital didn't immediately return requests for a comment.\n\nwhat is the future of bitcoin?\n\nthe sec has delayed issuing a ruling on the proposed etf multiple times. in october, it declined to rule, saying it was instead seeking additional public feedback on the proposal. in a filing published on wednesday, the sec said it had subsequently received 30 comments.\n\nread:here's one easy way to get exposure to bitcoin ahead of the winklevoss etf\n\nthe proposed fund, which would trade on the bats exchange, was first published for public comment on july 14 of last year. the sec could have ruled on it on jan. 10—180 days after that date—but it is instead waiting until march 11, which is 240 days since july 14.\n\nthe commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider this proposed rule change, the sec wrote in a statement.\n\nbecause march 11 is a saturday, the ruling could actually be announced on friday, march 10, the final business day before the deadline.\n\nwhile investors can put their money into bitcoin directly, those waiting on an etf to get bitcoin exposure have missed out on some massive gains. the price of a single coin more than doubled in 2016, due to increasing adoption of bitcoin among professional investors, improving market fundamentals and a perception that the world's largest economies are growing increasingly unstable.\n\nsee also:bitcoin rally boosts rival digital currencies
a number of high-profile stocks have already made headlines this earnings season. but arguably the most important reports are yet to come, given that big names in technology are set to report over the next two weeks.\n\neven if you think you're not a tech investor because you're in index funds, you want to pay attention to these reports.\n\nthe s&p 500 spx, -1.48% is now dominated by big tech stocks, with just five megacap tech stocks representing almost 14% of the entire index. the nasdaq-100 ndx, -3.13% is even worse, with apple inc. aapl, -3.39% alone sucking up nearly 12% of the weighting.\n\nthese five companies are particularly worth watching because they are poised to move big on upcoming results. and depending on the numbers, that move may not be in an upward direction. mark your calendar.\n\nnetflix on jan. 22\n\nnetflix inc. nflx, -3.75% is coming off an amazing report last quarter, with higher-than-expected subscriber numbers lifting the stock to a new all-time high. all indications are that earnings will be tremendous yet again, which could fuel a continued rally for the stock.\n\nnetflix has forecast 6.3 million additional subscribers, which would set another record. as always, this number is the most important for investors to watch because wall street is focused on scale right now and not necessarily profits.\n\nhowever, the bottom line may be worth paying attention to as well. netflix recently raised subscription costs to fuel its international expansion efforts and fund new content like stranger things and the crown that have been so successful. it will be interesting to see the impact of this move.\n\nfor the record, i'm worried netflix faces some serious risks in the next year or two as competition heats up. however, the deck is stacked nicely in the short term, and i expect another beat and a continued rally in the coming weeks.\n\nread:did price increases send netflix customers packing?\n\nqualcomm on jan. 31\n\nqualcomm inc. qcom, -3.11% has been up and down over the last two years, but largely a disappointment to investors who didn't time the uptrends right. that's very disappointing, seeing as chip stocks have been on a tear lately, with the ishares phlx semiconductor etf soxx, -4.14% up an amazing 48% in the last 12 months.\n\nsome of the recent trouble includes a $1 billion lawsuit filed by apple over royalties, the inability to close a proposed buyout of nxp semiconductors nv nxpi, -4.68% and unfavorable rulings and fines from regulators overseas. throw in a hostile takeover bid from broadcom ltd. avgo, -4.02% , and things look ugly.\n\nbut the clouds recently have started to part. in fact, one analyst said the broadcom move is a gun to the head of management to get their act together. and some continue to hold out hope that the nxp deal will close very soon. that may set the stage for a move higher, if only the numbers are solid in this upcoming report.\n\nqualcomm stock has surged 30% since november thanks in part to renewed optimism. but it will be crucial for the company to reinforce that positive narrative — or else we could see the bottom drop out again.\n\nread:at ces, spectre haunted tech executives in public and private meetings\n\nfacebook on jan. 31\n\nfacebook inc. fb, -1.90% has softened up lately on the announcement that it will be making some big changes in user newsfeeds, in part a reaction to the presence of fake and misleading articles on its platform over the last few years. but in the coming earnings report, investors will be more focused on how it did last quarter then how the social media portal may change going forward.\n\nthat may also create some trouble, but for different reasons. back on nov. 1, facebook blew away expectations with its best earnings ever… but warned investments will impact our profitability going forward. that includes spending on security measures as well as hiring as many as 10,000 additional workers.\n\nthe biggest boon to investors in facebook has been the company's continued growth in profitability now that it has reached what is arguably critical mass for its social network. after all, with some 1.4 billion daily active users worldwide and over 2 billion folks logging in daily, it's getting really hard to imagine facebook scaling up significantly.\n\nfacebook stock has been in a prolonged uptrend, so it will be interesting to see if earnings reinforce that long-term narrative, or if softness adds to recent declines.\n\nread:how facebook's newsfeed change is stoking uncertainty about its future\n\napple on feb. 1\n\napple always is an important stock to watch around earnings season, but it's particularly important to pay attention when numbers are delivered each january. that's because apple has gotten accustomed to launching new iphones at the end of the year, and the gadget represented roughly 61% of net sales in fiscal 2017.\n\nthe iphone x went on sale in november to reasonably good buzz, but not without supply-chain issues. there were fears that initial demand may not have been met in december, so it will be important to see whether apple delivers — and, if not, whether that demand gets pulled forward.\n\nperhaps even more interesting to investors is the prospect of higher dividends and a more aggressive buyback strategy. the massive corporate tax cuts passed by congress late last year is a boon to cash-rich profit machines like apple, and wall street expects the tech giant to share its good fortune with shareholders.\n\na one-two punch of strong earnings and a big return of capital could spark an impressive rally for the stock.\n\nread:apple to contribute $350 billion to u.s. economy over 5 years, add 20,000 jobs\n\namazon on feb. 1\n\nthis earnings report from amazon comes on the same day as apple's. and after a killer end to 2017, investors are looking for some impressive results in amazon's fiscal first-quarter report.\n\nit's not just because amazon is the default choice for many americans doing their holiday shopping. it's also because its amazon prime subscription service continues to prove it is increasingly a way of life for many consumers.\n\nlast year, amazon started revealing sales booked under its subscription services arm that includes prime memberships. last quarter, that tally was $2.4 billion — up roughly 60% from $1.5 billion a year ago — and we're sure to see continued growth yet again here. an impressive trend here could result in an impressive move for the stock.\n\nto a lesser extent, investors will also be watching the bottom line. profits have never been the top priority as amazon spends aggressively on growth, but it's noteworthy that the highly profitable amazon web services division is what previously drove real earnings for shares. however, after leveling off overall spending in 2016 it was off to the races again in 2017 thanks to both the acquisition of whole foods, a big investment in a kentucky cargo hub and other efforts.\n\nscale and growth is still the biggest driver for amazon. but spending and investment trends are still worth watching, too, since they have a tendency to really create volatility in earnings per share and move the stock price.\n\nread:google assistant vs. amazon alexa: when will we get to choose our voice assistant?
the u.s. department of labor finalized a rule wednesday that could be a boon to app-based gig companies while potentially costing american workers billions of dollars in lost wages and benefits.\n\nthe rule establishes a test for determining independent contractor status under the federal labor standards act, giving more weight to two of five factors, which critics say are favorable to gig companies such as uber technologies inc. uber and lyft inc. lyft: the nature and degree of the worker's control over the work, and the worker's opportunity for profit or loss based on initiative and/or investment. the other factors are skill, permanence of the working relationship and whether the work is part of an integrated unit of production.\n\nthis rule brings long-needed clarity for american workers and employers, u.s. secretary of labor eugene scalia said in a statement.\n\nthe rule was proposed in september and its comment period was shortened to 30 days instead of 60 days, in what critics said was the trump administration's effort to rush it through before the end of his term. it is expected to go into effect march 8, the labor department said in a news release.\n\nthe proposal received 1,825 comments, including from the economic policy institute, which estimates that the rule will cost workers — from delivery and transportation workers to those who work at call centers, in agriculture, home health care and elsewhere — at least $3.7 billion a year in pay and benefits.\n\nthis loss to workers is composed of at least $400 million in new annual paperwork costs, and a transfer to employers of at least $3.3 billion in the form of reduced compensation, wrote heidi shierholz, epi's senior economist and director of policy. further, social insurance funds would lose at least $750 million annually in the form of reduced employer contributions, meaning this rule also results in a transfer of at least $750 million annually from social insurance funds to employers.\n\ntwo dozen state attorneys general and officials from new york city, chicago, pittsburgh and philadelphia asked the labor department to withdraw the rule, while business groups and chambers of commerce supported the rule change.\n\nopponents are optimistic that president-elect biden's incoming administration could stop the rule from taking effect and eventually rescind it. biden has expressed support for different criteria for determining worker classification, the so-called abc test, which is law in california but not for gig companies, which successfully backed a ballot measure to exempt them from the law in november.\n\nfor more: uber and lyft win fight to keep drivers as contractors instead of employees in california\n\n[the biden administration] will want their own rule, but would need to open that to public comment and of course that would take some time, said john logan, professor at san francisco state university's labor and employment studies department.\n\namong those that would benefit are uber, lyft and other gig companies, which have faced challenges around the nation over their treatment of drivers and delivery workers as contractors.\n\nnicole moore, a los angeles-based organizer with rideshare drivers united, said: let's be clear. taking labor rights away from app-based workers is the agenda of the trump administration that has never had frontline workers' interests in mind. but this is not in concrete and the new administration has the power to usher in a better future for all workers.\n\nwe appreciate the efforts made to modernize our nation's laws and look forward to working with policymakers to further this vision, uber head of federal affairs danielle burr said in a statement.\n\nthe incoming biden administration has not returned a request for comment. lyft has not returned a request for comment.
good news for all those parents on the look-out for new gadgets to keep their beloved infants safe. we have come a long way from the radio baby monitors of the past.\n\nthe first baby monitor, called the radio nurse, was invented in 1937 and worked using radio waves. you may have been just as likely to pick up sounds from nextdoor's baby. today, there are many ways to keep your baby under supervision when you aren't in the nursery. with the rise of extreme baby monitoring, parents can keep a closer eye on their children than ever before, tracking breathing, heartbeat, and a child's movement through many mediums.\n\ndevices don't have to use video or audio recording to monitor a child's every movement. raybaby ($269) says it's a non-contact baby monitor that uses ultrasound-like technology to monitor a child's breathing. the company claims to offer an accuracy rate of 98% while not requiring a child to wear any devices. while the app allows parents to take photos and videos of the baby, the alerts come largely from the ultrasound technology.\n\none review said the device could lead to needless panic because of the level of detail it collects. it's worth remembering that babies have their own built-in technology for telling you they're awake or need need your attention — it's called screaming, wrote mashable. (raybaby did not respond immediately to a request for comment.)\n\nhere are some of the newest technologies to track and care for your infant:\n\nvideo and audio monitors\n\nthe classic audio-based baby monitor has been upgraded through enhanced sound quality and range. the motorola audio baby monitor ($99) works in a range of up to 50 meters and uses sound to activate alerts that light up based on what sound is being heard when a child awakes. the baby's device comes with a night light feature and the signal transmitted between units is secured through encryption, eliminating the risk of picking up on other nearby radio frequencies, which was a problem in earlier monitors.\n\nvideo-based baby monitors have gotten an upgrade, too. cocoon cam ($150) claims to monitor breathing in real time without the use of wearables — that is, a device that needs to be worn by your child. it works by focusing a camera that can detect breath movement on a child and the company says it can send an alert if the child stops breathing. parents can also access the live feed of a child through the accompanying app.\n\nwhile i initially thought this was going a bit overboard in the 'paranoid parent' department, i found i actually did feel reassured by the breathing graph as i checked on my baby in the middle of the night, wrote a reviewer on the parenting product review site lucie's list. that reviewer noted that the cocoon cam was initially a little buggy, but that the company's customer service department was very helpful in resolving the issue. cocoon cam did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\nother video-based monitors, though they do not track breathing, work in a similar way. parents can use classic home monitor cameras (not specific to babies) to monitor a child. the motion-activated hawkcam pro home security camera ($129) follows a child's activity and can be watched through the accompanying app. it was named a top 10 nanny camera by independent review site safewise.\n\ninfant wearables\n\nsome monitors have wearable options so a parent can move around the house while still keeping an ear on their child. the summer infant babble band wearable audio monitor ($25) has a range of 800 feet. madeformums, a parenting review site, gave it four out of five stars.\n\na new generation of baby devices connects directly to a child's body for close monitoring. owlet, a $300 smart sock that wraps around a child's foot, claims it can monitor the infant's heart rate and oxygen levels while they sleep. parents can use the accompanying app for sleep data on their child and sounds and lights alert them if anything is out of the ordinary with a child's vitals, according to the list of uses on the device. a review on parenting site what to expect noted that the sock isn't a medical device that's been approved by the fda, but that it could be useful for parents of premature infants. however, it's one of the most expensive monitors out there.\n\nthe owlet device wraps around a child's foot. courtesy of owlet\n\nanother device, snuza hero, attaches to a child's diaper and monitors the baby's abdominal movements to track breathing. if a child does not move for 15 seconds, the company says the device will vibrate in an effort to rouse the baby. if movement has stopped for 15 seconds on three occasions, the parent will be alerted through an alarm, according to the company.\n\nthe device retails for $110 and, according to the manufacturer, aims to help prevent sudden infant death syndrome — which happens when babies suddenly stop breathing without warning — and give parents peace of mind. it has, however, not been proven to prevent sids and has no medical use for that purpose.\n\nmimo ($144), a baby onesie fitted with a sleep tracker, says it monitors a child's breathing through subtle rises and falls in the infant's chest. parents can access data collected from the baby using the accompanying app on iphone aapl, +1.27% and android.\n\nwearables don't come without some complications. sproutling ($250), a fisher-price mat, +0.60% monitor, can be strapped to a baby's leg. reviewing the product on engadget, terrence o'brien alleged that the gadget left his baby with an outbreak of eczema, despite washing the monitor and trying it on alternate legs. he said his son was prone to eczema, but wrote that it kept happening when the gadget was attached. (the company did not respond to request for comment on o'brien's review.)\n\nthe reviewer added, arguably the most important feature of the sproutling is its ability to alert you when your child falls asleep, wakes up, stirs or rolls over. none of these alerts ever went off with any predictability. often notifications that my son fell asleep came in 15 minutes or more after the fact. and notifications that he woke up would arrive long after he was out of his bassinet and already getting his morning feeding.\n\nmake sure you always change the password\n\nlike all smart home devices, oarents should proceed with caution when using these monitors. for any brand or variety of baby monitor, security should be a priority. because of the intimate nature of the devices, hacks can be particularly violating. in june, one woman in south carolina claimed her wi-fi connected baby monitor had been hacked. (the manufacturer did not respond to request for comment).\n\nin worst-case scenarios, such connected devices can also be co-opted and turned into botnets, giant networks of devices used to power major hacks on different service providers by flooding them with traffic. most connected devices off the shelf can be hacked within 30 minutes, a 2018 study from ben-gurion university in israel claimed.\n\nwe've already seen multiple examples of cameras, including baby monitors, hacked to display their feeds on the internet, or re-purposed for botnets, said david ginsburg, vice president of marketing at cavirin, a santa clara, calif.-based provider of cybersecurity. as more devices are cloud-connected, the potential for compromise only increases.\n\nother tips before choosing a baby monitor: be sure to research the brand of your monitor online to find out if it has ever been the subject of a hack or a breach in the past, ginsburg added. avoid products that are ridiculously cheap, and only buy from established brands, particularly those based in the u.s., and never use the default password on your baby monitor or wi-fi router, he added.
tokyo — japanese prime minister shinzo abe said tuesday he would continue to advocate free trade, and officials said they hadn't given up on the trans-pacific partnership despite president donald trump's decision to withdraw from the deal.\n\ngovernment spokesman koichi hagiuda said it was meaningless to have the tpp without the u.s. and tokyo wasn't considering revising it excluding washington.
the time's up women's-equality movement that took center stage at the golden globes last week is far from finished, a number of prominent women in hollywood said sunday.\n\nat the annual awards last week, many women wore black as a sign of solidarity and to protest sexual harassment, sexual abuse and pay inequality. now, many of the women who started the movement are determined to use their celebrity to help women who don't have a public platform, they told oprah winfrey in a discussion that aired sunday on cbs corp.'s us:cbs sunday morning.\n\n 'i feel like there's a constructive fury that has resulted in a resolute pursuit of equity. . . . something has galvanized, that we're all like, this is not just my hurt, this is more than my hurt, this is not just my anger, this is our anger. and instead of it just being a feeling, it's becoming an action.'  — tracee ellis ross, star of abc's 'black-ish'\n\nwinfrey, who gave an impassioned speech on the subject at the golden globes that sparked talk of her running for president, spoke with actresses tracee ellis ross, america ferrera, natalie portman and reese witherspoon, as well as lucasfilm president kathleen kennedy, tv producer shonda rhimes and entertainment attorney nina shaw.\n\nwe have to maintain the momentum of this conversation because they can't, kennedy said. we have to continue this work because we do have the spotlight.\n\ntime's up is hoping to strengthen sexual harassment and discrimination laws across the country and push for equal pay between genders in all industries, not just hollywood. the movement formed following revelations of decades of sexual misconduct and rape allegations against hollywood mogul harvey weinstein in the fall. since then, dozens of powerful and prominent men in the movie and tv industry have been implicated in misconduct.\n\ni think what we are experiencing right now is a tectonic shift underneath our feet, where women, and men, are feeling like we can no longer not say the truth, ferrera said. and when the truth is said, there is maybe a ripple in our culture right now that is going to allow for there to be a change.\n\ni think it's treating people as fellow humans, portman said. we deserve the same respect.\n\nthe women agreed that for many men, long-held attitudes need to change. and for men confused about how their actions are interpreted, shaw had a simple answer: you know the difference between right and wrong. is it a conversation that you would be comfortable going home at night and telling your wife or your mother that you had? if you are uncomfortable in telling them about this conversation, then you shouldn't have it.\n\nthey're also willing to forgive, the women told winfrey. i think there's a lot of room for reconciliation, witherspoon said. i think there's a time to approach people and tell the truth and have them listen thoughtfully and meaningfully and apologize sincerely.\n\ni was raised in a world in which i believe that there has to be a belief that people can grow, change and learn — and know better, rhimes said. i mean, not if you've committed a crime. i feel like you need to go pay — do your time for your crime, but i do believe people have to be able to grow, change and learn from their mistakes. at a certain point, there has to be room for reconciliation.
sears holding corp. has gotten another reprieve, care of a bankruptcy auction win for the company's chairman eddie lampert, but the problems that got the retailer into trouble in the first place still persist with little hope for change, according to experts.\n\nif confirmed, the bid would keep more than 400 stores open.\n\nwhile there is no doubt that a shrunken sears will be more viable than the larger entity which struggled to turn a profit, we remain extremely pessimistic about the chain's future, wrote neil saunders, managing director of globaldata retail. in our view, sears exits this process with almost as many problems as it had when it entered bankruptcy protection. in essence, its hand has not changed and the cards it holds are not winning ones.\n\nlampert's hedge fund esl investments inc. confirmed the auction win in a statement sent to marketwatch on thursday.\n\nsubject to its approval by the court, our going concern proposal will deliver a total consideration in excess of $5.2 billion and save tens of thousands of jobs, a spokesperson said. it will also fund certain severance costs incurred by sears during bankruptcy and reinstate severance benefits for eligible employees in a new company. in addition, it will honor commitments to loyal customers who purchased products with extended warranties and support affected vendors, who will retain a valuable source of revenue.\n\ndepartment stores have exerted great effort and made vast investments in their businesses, from digital capabilities and e-commerce, to staff and inventory management, to keep pace with shifting consumer shopping habits and online giant amazon.com inc. amzn, +0.33%\n\nread:these are the pieces of sears that still have value in a liquidation\n\nin recent days, retailers including macy's inc. m, -3.03% and nordstrom inc. jwn, -2.03% have reported disappointing holiday sales numbers despite favorable conditions such as a low unemployment rate.\n\ndepartment stores have the dubious distinction of being the weakest-performing sector in u.s. retail the past three years, wrote moody's analysts in a tuesday note. that said, the better capitalized companies have slowly been gaining ground thanks to positive sales.\n\nmoody's forecasts that department stores will narrow their operating income losses to 2% in 2019 from about 4% in 2018.\n\nto the extent sears reorganizes around a much smaller store base, major hurdles to its long-term business will remain, said christina boni, vice president at moody's. scale, which is critical to competing in retail today, will be lacking and its core customer proposition still remains in question. sears had been shrinking its store base and reducing costs in recent years but improvement in sales trends and profitability remained elusive.\n\none group that's happy about the latest development is sears shldq, +8.39% workers, who number as many as 50,000, though even they acknowledge that this could be temporary. one organization places the blame for sears' woes at lampert's feet.\n\nsee:where sears went wrong - from the writer of the definitive history of the retailer\n\npeople who have worked for years at sears and kmart are outraged by how sears' board chairman and former ceo eddie lampert drove the company into the ground, reads a statement from organization united for respect (our), a group that advocates for change at low-wage corporations. the group has pushed for higher pay and other improvements to working conditions at retailers.\n\nsince he bought control of sears in 2005, lampert has repeatedly stripped sears of its assets and sold them off piece by piece to corporations he controls or has major stakes in, the statement says. while these decisions have made lampert more than a billion dollars, he has destroyed more than 250,000 jobs in the process, leaving employees and their families without financial support.\n\nbankruptcy experts who are watching the sears saga unfold note the impact on workers.\n\nif there is no release for the claims against him and his companies, then this is a win-win given the options, because it preserves jobs while not letting the prior insider transactions off the hook, said david wander, a bankruptcy attorney at davidoff hutcher & citron, in a statement. wander notes that the details of lampert's latest offer had not yet been disclosed at the time of his statement.\n\nif the deal includes a release, then it sets up a battle between his bid and the creditor's committee's liquidation analysis.\n\nchuck tatelbaum, director at the law firm of tripp scott, says that while the deal still needs approval from creditors and constituents, there's no certainty that it will pass muster.\n\nwhile most of the focus has been on saving the jobs and keeping the stores open, little attention has been given to those suppliers that took the risk to extend credit to keep sears open, but now will face these potential losses, he said.\n\nrelated:macy's has only itself to blame for lackluster holiday performance, analysts says\n\ndon't miss:nordstrom shares sink as full-price business shows signs of weakness\n\non the clock: the craziest thing bought with credit-card points\n\nstill he notes that public pressure favors keeping sears going, an outcome that bankruptcy courts also like to see.\n\nand if the deal is approved experts wonder what lampert will do differently to actually turn around the business.\n\nwhile his ability to keep the chain alive is praiseworthy, his retailing skills leave a lot to be desired, wrote globaldata's saunders. if sears is to survive then it will require an enormous mind-set change in terms of the way the business is run. we just cannot see this coming about.
under armour inc. shares were down 8.4% in monday trading after the company was downgraded to underweight from equal-weight at morgan stanley, with analysts saying they prefer nike inc. stock instead.\n\nthe bank slashed its under armour ua, +2.70% price target to $62 from $103. the stock is trading at about $69 on monday.\n\nmorgan stanley rates nike nke, +0.01% shares as overweight, and expects it to rise through 2016. the stock was trading at about $59 on monday, and has gained about 24% in the past 12 months.\n\nunder armour is losing share of the apparel market for the first time in three years, according to the morgan stanley note. the bank used data from sportsscan, which provides sales data from retail stores and websites. analysts called the decline in women's apparel particularly acute, with asps declining at an accelerating rate.\n\nthe decline is taking place despite a $15 million marketing campaign targeting women.\n\nwomen's apparel is a much larger market than men's apparel and under armour has a much smaller share in it than it does in men's, the bank said in a note.\n\nfootwear sales at under armour are growing, with sportsscan reporting a 100% year-over-year increase. but asps are also dropping in this category, which is worrying analysts.\n\nunder armour running footwear prices are down 20% since jan. 2013, morgan stanley said, but industry prices are down by 4%. they attribute only part of the decline to a shift toward kids footwear.\n\nthe bank also believes that under armour's stephen curry basketball shoes are underpriced at about $130. they would like to see a price of $150 per pair.\n\nunder armour has always competed on brand image and innovation, rarely on price, the note said. this change in trend is a major concern because this positioning threatens to erode under armour's premium brand image and ultimately its long-term growth potential… this change in trend is a major concern because it suggests a fundamental shift in the under armour story.\n\nmen's, women's and children's athletic apparel, athletic footwear, international markets and connected fitness, which includes wearables, are the company's main sales drivers, according to morgan stanley.\n\nsince the company's shares are priced for perfection, analysts say these sales declines have caused a material change in their view of the stock.\n\nsmall changes in long-term growth assumptions can have big impacts on valuation, the bank's note said.\n\nmany retailers have been coping with issues related to the unseasonable winter temperatures at the tail end of 2015, and under armour was no exception. the company experienced a 2% holiday sales decline, according to sportsscan data with softness showing in sweats and fleeces.\n\noverall, under armour sales growth has decelerated on both a one- and two-year basis since spring 2015, the bank's note said.\n\nnike saw sales of sweats and fleeces increase in the double-digits in november and december, morgan stanley said.\n\nnike announced second-quarter 2016 earnings on dec. 22, reporting a 4.1% year-over-year increase in revenue to $7.69 billion. back in october, nike said it expects to reach $50 billion in annual revenue by 2020.\n\nmorgan stanley cites industry sources who say that under armour is in talks with kohl's corp. kss, +3.83% , which could open the company up to more women customers, but also to more risk.\n\n[t]he issue we would have is it risks eroding the premium image of the under armour brand, analysts said. kohl's is a mid-tier department store and highly promotional on a daily basis.\n\nsee also:kohl's considers going private

oil futures rose on monday, buoyed by optimism tied to trade talks between the u.s. and china as well as output reductions by major oil producers, but settled well below the session's highs as goldman sachs cut its price forecast on worries over energy demand and the potential for a supply surplus.\n\nsaudi arabia plans to cut its crude exports by 800,000 barrels a day from around 7.9 million barrels a day in november, in a move aimed at lifting prices above $80 a barrel, the wall street journal reported, citing comments from officials at the organization of the petroleum exporting countries. that followed upbeat jobs numbers issued friday that had calmed recession worries, helping to lift the outlook for energy demand.\n\nwti crude for february delivery us:clg9 added 56 cents, or 1.2%, to settle at $48.52 a barrel on the new york mercantile exchange, which was well below the session's high of $49.79. the front-month contract rose 5.8% for last week, according to dow jones market data.\n\nglobal benchmark march brent crude uk:lcog9 added 27 cents, or 0.5%, to $57.33 a barrel on ice futures europe, also paring much of its earlier gains, which saw prices rise to as high as $58.93. the contract settled up about 7.2% for last week.\n\noil demand optimism was lifted as senior officials from china unexpectedly attended negotiations between beijing and their counterparts in washington, in an effort to resolve longstanding trade disagreements that have underpinned uncertainty in global markets. according to bloomberg, chinese vice premier liu he, a top economic adviser to chinese president xi jinping, was among attendees, and some optimism has been drawn from the a top level official attended rather than lower-ranking officials.\n\ncrude prices had plummeted in the fourth quarter by roughly 40% from four-year highs reached at the start of october, weighed down by a supply glut and fears of slowing global demand.\n\nmore recently, price support has come as separate surveys showed that december crude output from major producers saw their biggest monthly declines since january 2017.\n\nproduction cuts from the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and its allies came into effect at the start of this month. opec and its production partners outside the cartel, led by russia, agreed in early december to collectively hold back output by 1.2 million barrels a day for the first half of 2019.\n\nif compliance by opec and the allied non-opec countries is similarly high as in the agreement two years ago, the oil market is likely to be rebalanced during the first half year, said commodities analysts at commerzbank in a note.\n\nalso monday, however, goldman sachs cut its outlook on spot prices for brent and wti. it expects an average of $62.50 a barrel for brent, down from a previous forecast of $70, and an average of $55.50 for west texas intermediate, down from $64.50.\n\nin a note, analysts at goldman sachs cited higher inventory levels to start the year, the persistent beat in 2018 shale production growth amidst little observed cost inflation, weaker than previously expected demand growth expectations ...and increased low-cost production capacity, for the cuts to the price forecasts.\n\nu.s. data monday also showed that service-oriented u.s. firms grew in december at the lowest pace since midsummer, with the nonmanufacturing index falling to 57.6 from 60.7 in november. downbeat economic data could hurt the outlook for energy demand.\n\ndata from the energy information administration, which were released friday— two days later than usual because of tuesday's new year's day holiday — revealed little change to u.s. stockpiles of crude for a second week in a row, though petroleum-product inventories saw hefty climbs.\n\nthe eia has said it will continue publishing and collecting data as usual, despite the partial government shutdown. the next weekly petroleum supply update is due wednesday.\n\non monday, february gasoline us:rbg9 fell by 0.5% to $1.341 a gallon on nymex, after tacking on 3.6% for last week. february heating oil us:hog9 added 0.5% to $1.778 a gallon, for a weekly rise of nearly 6.6%.\n\nread:gasoline prices could jump 35% by may, forecast says\n\nalso see:u.s. oil drillers aren't producing as much crude as forecast, finds wsj report\n\nfebruary natural gas us:ngg19 fell 3.2% to $2.944 per million british thermal units, after finishing last week down 7.8%.\n\nthe eia said last week domestic natural-gas stocks in storage declined 20 billion cubic feet last week. that was less than the 42 billion decrease expected by analysts polled by s&p global platts, and well below the five-year average fall of 107 billion cubic feet.
dear moneyist,\n\ni am 22 years old and just graduated from college in may with a bachelor's degree. i recently started my first full-time job and am making decent money. now that i am on my own, i am excited to start slashing away at my $10,000 in student-loan debt so that i can start saving and investing my money appropriately.\n\n i was raised in a financially 'well-off' home until the 2008 financial crisis that cost my mother her job, savings and, eventually, her house. \n\ni was raised in a financially well-off home until the 2008 financial crisis that cost my mother her job, savings and, eventually, her house. though she always made ends meet and ensured i was taken care of, i witnessed what it was like to go from having more than enough money to living paycheck to paycheck and, ultimately, to having everything taken from you.\n\ntherefore, i was able to learn firsthand how important financial responsibility truly is.\n\nthis leads me to my motive for this letter: my girlfriend.\n\ni have been dating a wonderful girl for nearly a year now and she brings me lots of joy. she is sweet, caring and loyal. she has a year left of school and then will start her career as a kindergarten teacher. not long after, she wants to start a family. she is everything i could ask for. i love her very much.\n\ndon't miss: americans who were 'scarred' by the great recession changed the way they spend\n\nhowever, there is just one flaw that i need help with: her spending habits. they drive me ****ing crazy.\n\n if her friends invite her on a vacation, daddy will cover it and, if not, it would be doomsday. she's entitled. \n\nbeing that she is still in college, she has no immediate expenses of her own. daddy takes care of everything. she treats him like an atm and knows it. she is constantly buying clothes she doesn't need and always saving items in her e-shopping carts. if her friends invite her on a vacation, daddy will cover it and, if not, it would be doomsday. she's entitled.\n\nthis worries me and scares me for our future.\n\ni have brought it up to her, but she acts like it is temporary. she says that she has no reason to save money until she is out of school and treats every dollar she earns at her summer job as disposable income. when i say anything, she acts like i'm being dramatic. because of her habits, basically anytime she talks about buying something new, it drives me nuts.\n\nwhat do i do? i love her and see a future with her, but i want to ensure a stable and successful financial future for myself and my family. how can i change her ways and make her realize she doesn't need to participate in every sale that her favorite women's clothing designer has to offer?\n\nportland patrick\n\ndear patrick,\n\ncongratulations! you have noticed some important patterns in your relationship that could come back to haunt you later. you are among those young people who have watched their parents survive the great recession and applied that harrowing experience to your own. while you may not exactly be scarred by it, you probably have a far more cautious approach to your finances as a result. and your choice of partner will be a big part of that.\n\nyou have clearly both had very different life experiences, so it's probably no wonder that your girlfriend is one of those lucky folks who has the luxury not to give too much thought about tomorrow. she has her parents' income to rely on and, likely, has some kind of sizable inheritance in her future too. that has given her a sense of freedom and, perhaps, folly. just because she can spend like there's no tomorrow does not make it (a) any easier to watch and (b) smart.\n\nalso see:these are the pricey summer camps where wealthy kids go to feel 'normal'\n\nbelieve it or not, 1 in 3 americans say their financial stability is dependent on inheritance. that's according to a survey released last week by merrill edge, an online discount brokerage service provided by bank of america merrill lynch bac, -0.29% . some 36% of generation x-ers, 32% of millennials and 20% of baby boomers say they're relying on their family fortunes. it's hard to read that without feeling something, somewhere in america has gone horribly wrong.\n\nrecommended:my fiancé postponed our wedding, secretly bought a house—and told me i could pay rent\n\nbut you have something in your favor. you have some mighty fine feathers in your own cap. you realize the fortunes of one's parents don't always last and there's something satisfying about paying one's own way. tell your girlfriend how your family's history changed your outlook and then explain how her profligate spending makes you feel. (maybe don't say profligate.) better to say how it makes you feel rather than attributing any value judgments to her behavior.\n\nshe may inherit a lot of money and/or marry someone who will keep her in the lifestyle to which she has become accustomed. you're 22. don't make a down payment on this relationship just yet. keep your eyes on the prize. for you, that could mean a modest home, a fulfilling job, living within or even below your means, and having peace of mind. write your budget plan on a piece of paper and show it to her .your girlfriend's idea of happiness might be something quite different.\n\nwhether you wear a swatch or a rolex, you will have your answer in good time.\n\n(this story was republished on sept. 25, 2019.)\n\nteenagers, just like their parents, want iphones more than ever\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
cambridge, u.k. (project syndicate)—covid-19 stormed across the planet in 2020, striking first in asia and then surging throughout europe and the americas in what seemed like an endless tidal wave of grief. with each passing milestone—the first 100 deaths in january, followed by the first 1,000 in february, 10,000 in march, 100,000 in april, and one million as of september—the question always has been when it will it end.\n\n even with these incredible successes, there is still only a slim chance that we will have a vaccine or treatment that is safe, universally available, and effective enough to stop the pandemic before the end of 2021. \n\ndespite its virulence, many simply assume that the pandemic will end sometime in 2021. but such hopes are misplaced. controlling an epidemic involves four fundamental components: leadership, governance, social solidarity, and a medical tool kit. most countries today have failed on the first three, all but ensuring that covid-19 will remain with us over the next year.\n\nwave after wave\n\nmost likely, winter in the northern hemisphere will bring a sharp rise in infections and deaths. the losses will be particularly pronounced in europe and north america, where daily infection rates were already spiking in mid-autumn. and just as the weather starts to warm in the north, south america will cool and another epidemic wave will crash over us.\n\nbreaking news: moderna expects to deliver 100 million doses of its covid-19 vaccine in the u.s. in q1\n\nas for the fourth component of epidemic control, many assume that vaccination or a lifesaving treatment is imminent. true, the pandemic has brought out the very best in science and medicine. researchers around the world have moved faster and collaborated more closely than ever before, identifying the virus, mapping its genetic makeup, and working toward potential vaccines and treatments.\n\n in new zealand and australia—both vibrant democracies—bold leadership and strong governance brought new infections down almost to zero. \n\nbut even with these incredible successes, there is still only a slim chance that we will have a vaccine or treatment that is safe, universally available, and effective enough to stop the pandemic before the end of 2021.\n\nat the time of writing in late 2020, we are just beginning to see published results for the vaccines that gained regulatory approval in december.\n\nbased on what we know today, we should assume that none of the vaccines under development will prevent infection or provide lifelong, lasting immunity. at best, they will limit the symptoms of those infected and minimize the number of covid-19 cases that progress to severe illness. moreover, the vaccines currently approved for use require multiple doses, with a delay of up to two months before the benefits kick in.\n\nno quick medical fix\n\nlikewise, lifesaving treatments for those with covid-19 will not come quickly. treatments that initially met with great fanfare—remdesivir, convalescent plasma, and dexamethasone—have since proven to have little to no effect on overall morbidity or mortality. and treatments with greater therapeutic potential, like monoclonal antibodies, are still many months away, and may ultimately prove too costly to be made widely available.\n\n assuming that sars-cov-2 is like other human coronaviruses, any country that places its hopes on a herd-immunity strategy will be endangering the rest of us year after year. \n\nthe absence of a medical quick fix will increase the need for leadership, governance, and social solidarity. political leaders must accept full responsibility for the lives that are lost. less than three weeks after scientists identified the virus, and after the first reported death in wuhan, chinese president xi jinping locked down 57 million chinese citizens in hubei province, preventing them from traveling to other regions or leaving their homes for anything other than necessities.\n\nchina showed that new infections could be halved in just two weeks through standard measures such as enforced mask-wearing, social distancing, and mandatory quarantine and isolation. by contrast, in countries like brazil, the united kingdom, and the united states, national political leaders dismissed the threat and dithered in marshaling the appropriate response.\n\nmany commentators have attributed china's success to totalitarianism, but a country's system of government is not really the deciding factor. far more important is whether political leaders are willing to trade short-term economic pain and quotidian conveniences for the safety of their citizens. in new zealand and australia—both vibrant democracies—bold leadership and strong governance brought new infections down almost to zero, and political leaders like new zealand prime minister jacinda ardern were rewarded accordingly at the ballot box.\n\nfoolish notions\n\nthe first year of dealing with covid-19 has taught us that piecemeal measures will only feed the pandemic. national and global crises call for national and global coordinated action. the u.s., the u.k., brazil, and other laggards have failed on both counts.\n\nindeed, some countries are still pursuing the foolish notion of herd immunity, despite scientific evidence suggesting that no such protection exists for this disease. there are four common (though rarely remarked upon) coronaviruses that infect up to 15% of the world's population each year, and that come back year after year, often reinfecting the same people. assuming that sars-cov-2 is no exception, any country that places its hopes on a herd-immunity strategy will be endangering the rest of us year after year.\n\nthough the chinese government made some critical misjudgments early on, one thing it did right was to warn the rest of the world that the virus was transmissible, airborne, and controllable only through drastic and immediate measures. the countries that ignored the warning have since suffered the most, both economically and in human terms. meanwhile, the countries that demonstrated social solidarity in controlling their outbreaks have been able to reopen their economies, though not necessarily their borders.\n\nin the end, though, a collective response merely reflects the sum of individual actions. in too many countries, individuals fear that acceding to protective measures amounts to giving up one's personal freedoms. yet in times of war, when the dangers are apparent, people have shown time and again how much they are willing to sacrifice for their fellow citizens.\n\nwe are at war\n\nclearly, a change in messaging is in order. we are at war with a virus. few doubt the importance of personal liberty, but this is a time when we all need to forego certain conveniences for the sake of those around us.\n\neach new earthquake, tsunami, or emerging disease reminds us that nature is a dangerous force. if there was a reason why many asian countries reacted more quickly and effectively to covid-19, it was because they still harbored memories of sars, h1n1, and the avian flu. their experience in recent years shows that public-health measures that are stringently applied through strong leadership, governance, and social solidarity can quickly bring a pandemic under control and limit the death toll.\n\nthat is the biggest lesson of 2020. if it is not incorporated into national policies in 2021, the pandemic may well last not just through the next year but for many more years to come.\n\nthis commentary

u.s. stocks have gotten so expensive in this eight-year bull market that even value shares aren't the bargain they usually are.\n\nthat's why david marcus, the ceo of evermore global advisors in summit, n.j., relishes finding companies going through a restructuring and those that take advantage at every turn by acquiring other businesses at low prices and making them more efficient. that way he can isolate investments that may perform better against the broad indices, some of which are trading at 15-year highs relative to earnings.\n\nthen again, marcus made clear that his investment style — finding special opportunities in companies undergoing transformations — has nothing to do with the performance of any index.\n\nmarcus is the manager of the evermore global value fund evgbx, -1.57% , which was established in january 2010 and has about $413 million in assets.\n\n a lot of investors wait on the sidelines [during a corporate restructuring] until there is clarity, but it is too late then.  — david marcus, ceo of evermore global advisors\n\nmarcus said in an interview jan. 19 that most investors like 'the after' — after restructuring.\n\nthat's when you have a high price, he said. i want it before, when you have a lot of execution risk. if a company is in the midst of change, our job is to assess management and figure out what they can do. a lot of investors wait on the sidelines until there is clarity, but it is too late then.\n\nhere's a look at how the fund has performed, net of fees, against the msci all countries world index 892400, -0.71% and the s&p 500 index spx, -1.48% :\n\ntotal return -

as most retirees and soon-to-retirees already know, social security is slated to run out of money in 2034 and, unless changes are made between now and then, beneficiaries beginning in that year will receive only 79% of what they otherwise would be owed.\n\nbut how likely is it that our politicians would actually let this come to pass? social security is widely assumed to be the third rail of politics, zapping politicians who dare to tinker with it. if so, then we need not worry about the subject of a recent column: what social security running out of money would mean for our retirement planning.\n\nto be sure, predicting what will come out of congress in the next few months is an inexact science at best, much less the next 15 years. but if anyone can gauge social security's real-world prospects, it should be andy landis, author of social security: the inside story. landis, for those of you who don't know him, is a former social security administration representative who has several decades of experience explaining the intricacies of social security to retirees and soon-to-be-retirees.\n\nin my interview with him, landis started by reviewing the amendments to social security that were enacted in 1983, which is the last time that changes were enacted. he pointed out that the social security trust fund was slated to run out of money in july of that year, and the changes that averted that possibility weren't enacted until march—with just four months to spare, in other words. landis characterized the changes as gentle, phased in, and targeted in the future. they included the gradual increase in the full retirement age and an acceleration of a previously-enacted payroll tax increase; in addition, up to one-half of the value of social security benefits were made potentially taxable.\n\nwith those changes, the social security system immediately began to run a sizable yearly surplus. the projection at that time was that the changes would postpone when social security would run out of money until the mid-2030s.\n\nlandis emphasized, therefore, that there's nothing new or surprising in the social security system's current projection that it will run out of money in 2034. that's almost precisely what the actuaries were projecting more than 30 years ago. there's no more of a social security funding crisis now than what was envisioned then after the 1983 changes were enacted.\n\nwhat lessons can we learn from this experience? one is that we shouldn't be surprised if our politicians will wait until the last minute to make necessary changes to the social security system. if so, then we probably should assume that social security's current payout rules will stay largely or completely in place for the next 15 years.\n\nthe other lesson, according to landis: changes, when they eventually do get enacted, are likely to be incremental rather than drastic. that's because draconian changes are not necessary in order to keep social security solvent.\n\nin fact, minor changes can have a large impact. consider, by way of illustration, the financial impact of reducing the annual cost of living adjustment by 1 percentage point over what it would be each year: the social security administration estimates that this would extend by 10 years the point at which social security runs out of money.\n\nto put such a cola modification into perspective, consider that the average monthly social security benefit is $1,404. the cola for next year is 2.8%, which would otherwise increase this monthly payment by $39. a reduction of that cola by 1 percentage point would reduce the monthly increase to $25, or $14 less.\n\n(let me hasten to say that, in providing this illustration, i am not recommending that this change be made. i am not taking a position on that. i am just using it to illustrate the magnitude of what could add 10 years to the solvency of the social security trust fund.)\n\nthe bottom line, according to landis: the doom and gloomers notwithstanding, the social security system is not in crisis. changes eventually will have to be made, but we've known that for decades.\n\nread: people who saved for retirement are being punished by social security taxes\n\nlandis also took issue with those who argue that, far from the social security system running out of money in 2034, it is broke now. those who make that argument point out that the much-vaunted social security trust fund of nearly $3 trillion doesn't really exist—the money was deposited with the u.s. treasury where it was long ago spent.\n\nlandis responds that of course the social security administration deposited its surplus with the u.s. treasury, since it is required by law to purchase u.s. treasury bonds with its surplus. and of course the u.s. treasury has spent the proceeds of the bonds it sold.\n\nbut the same could be said of any bond. when you purchase a bond from a company, for example, it's with the full expectation that the firm will use those proceeds rather than stuff them in a mattress. landis therefore made the following offer to those who insist that the u.s. treasury bonds purchased by the social security administration are worthless: he would be happy to take off their hands the allegedly worthless government bonds that they own.\n\nif you decline his offer, then you by extension have to concede that the social security trust fund is not empty.\n\nfor more information, including descriptions of the hulbert sentiment indices, go to the hulbert financial digest or email mark@hulbertratings.com.
the worst financial advice i ever got also happened to be correct.\n\nthis was in the fall of 2007. i was fresh out of college and had just started at my first full-time job, an entry-level reporting position where i covered corporate news and stock price movements, areas of the world i had little direct experience with. the nature of my beat made me interested in the market, and after a while i had the idea to save up $5,000 and invest it. i remember thinking that this would be a graduation and employment gift to myself as much as an investment; i figured i'd be more invested in my job if i had some skin in the game, and if i made some money in the bargain, all the better.\n\nmy stock of choice was netflix inc. nflx, -3.75% , which was at the time known more for its little red dvd envelopes than for binge watching, a term that wouldn't enter the lexicon for several more years. i started setting aside money, and at some point mentioned the plan to my dad, a retired accountant and savings junkie. to my surprise, he strongly cautioned me against it, and convincingly enough that i took his advice and bought some very boring index funds instead. here's what happened in the meantime:\n\na chart of netflix's share price over the past 10 years. the chart accounts for a seven-for-one stock split the company underwent in 2015.\n\nfrom the end of 2007 to the close of trading on tuesday, netflix has soared a staggering 3,397.1%, enough to turn my $5,000 into about $175,000. (it jumped even more after its results on wednesday, which took it to, sigh, still new records in afterhours trading.) this isn't enough that i could've retired by age 30, by any means, and it doesn't account for any taxes and fees i would've incurred, but it's a huge return i missed out on — one of the best trades of the decade.\n\nmy dad and i, we're still close.\n\nwhile i never miss an opportunity to bring this up (at least not until he points out the cost of raising a child through college), i can't hold his advice against him. for one thing, that mine-in-an-alternative-universe $175,000 assumes that i wouldn't have cashed out at any point over the past nine years. that's certainly debatable; as someone who once decided to quit while he was ahead after winning $4 at a casino slot machine, i imagine i would've been pleased as punch once my investment returned, say, 20%. and if for some reason i stuck around, i probably would've declared victory after it doubled, tripled or quadrupled, at which point i still would have missed the bulk of what was to come. (each time my hypothetical investment doubled, i told myself that the stock would surely begin a downtrend the second i jumped in.)\n\nopinion:the investing insanity of trying to find the next amazon\n\nbut more important, the advice was correct, even if i would have been better off not taking it. his argument had been simple: investing in single stocks is risky even if you've done your due diligence, so it's better to diffuse that risk by investing in the broader market, which is almost guaranteed to go up over time (especially over my timeline of a then-21-year-old kickstarting a nest egg).\n\nbelieve me, i understand this. i've written numerous articles about why active investing — where the components of a portfolio are chosen by an individual — is inferior to simply buying index funds. and i get that the day traders who try and beat the market are almost guaranteed to get hosed. admittedly these lessons don't apply completely here, as there's a difference between short-term speculation and my buy-and-hold plan, and i would've been happy with gains even if they didn't beat the market. still, it's hard to deny that if you want a big payoff, putting all your eggs in one basket — especially an untested one, as opposed to a market bellwether that pays a steady dividend — is extremely risky, a thousand-to-one shot. it just so happens that in this case, i picked the one.\n\nhere's what trump means for the tech industry\n\nthis should go without saying, but i didn't forecast that monster rally. (who expects their investments to rise by a factor of 30?) i didn't want to invest in netflix because i had analyzed and found value in its price-to-earnings and enterprise-value-to-sales ratios; i couldn't have even defined those terms back then. i was simply a voracious movie watcher, and netflix's dvd-by-mail system was not only more convenient than blockbuster (remember blockbuster?), but came with a vastly superior selection.\n\nread:netflix is developing a bond with customers that will help its stock price\n\ni was a simply fan of the company, and based my investment idea on that. this isn't the best reason to buy a stock, but there are worse ones; there's even an etf dedicated to companies with high levels of customer satisfaction (netflix comprises about 0.34% of the portfolio). i suppose you could argue that my being a customer helped me imagine the company's growth potential — i gave memberships as christmas gifts, knowing the recipients would find it a better deal than cable — but ultimately i got lucky. had i picked another stock, even one with its own fanatics, i could easily have lost money. remember how crackberries were a thing in 2007? blackberry bb, -6.07% is down 92% since then.\n\nof course, my decision stings because i literally could not have chosen a better stock. remember, netflix is up about 3,400% since the start of 2008. for comparison's sake, google parent alphabet inc. googl, -2.92% is up a mere 139.1% over that period, while apple inc. aapl, -3.39% is up 324%, a quadrupling in value that has made it the largest u.s. company by market cap. amazon.com inc. amzn, -3.44% is up 774.1% over this period; it has also become one of netflix's biggest rivals in the online streaming space, a category that barely existed nine years ago. among the other quadruple-digit percentage gainers, tesla motors inc. tsla, -6.93% is up 1,139.9%, although it only went public in june 2010. (too rich for my blood, i told a friend in 2012, right before it jumped 344% in the subsequent year.)\n\nthe s&p 500 spx, -1.48% is up 54.5% over this period, which makes for a pretty good annualized return, especially when you factor in dividends and the fact that the past nine years includes the carnage of the financial crisis (it has more than tripled since the bottom of that collapse). it only looks bad when you consider it in contrast to the fluke stock i nearly picked by chance.\n\nultimately it's better to be talked out of a good investment than talked into a bad one, which means i view this missed opportunity as more of a what if scenario than a decision that put me on the path to ruin. and so, while i'm reluctant to admit this in print, where it can be easily pulled out at the next family reunion, it should be said: my dad was wrong, but he was also correct.

two serious security vulnerabilities found in most computer chip designs around the world, dubbed meltdown and spectre by a group of academic and industry researchers, has the tech industry scrambling to protect systems, but it looks like consumers will just have to update and pray.\n\non wednesday, chip behemoth intel corp. intc, -3.12% hosted two conference calls, one for industry analysts and another for investors, after acknowledging a major vulnerability that could potentially affect all systems with its microprocessors designed in the past decade or more.\n\nsomeone has figured out a way to exploit the architecture that is built into all modern computer systems, said steve smith, intel's engineering lead who is investigating the issues.\n\nintel emphasized that the vulnerability was not a flaw in its chip designs and tried to play down the potential threat to systems or to its business. executives and engineers on the company's investor call said they were unaware of the threat actually being exploited and said they did not expect any material impact on the company.\n\ndon't miss: intel ceo sold millions in stock after company was informed of vulnerability, before disclosure\n\nbut for consumers, corporate users and it managers around the world, the potential threat is real. meltdown is specific only to intel processors, but spectre could affect devices with chips from intel, advanced micro devices inc. amd, -5.46% and arm holdings, now owned by softbank group corp. 9984, -2.46% the two security flaws, which involve the way processors use different techniques to work as quickly as possible, were disclosed on wednesday in two papers and a blog post from alphabet inc. googl, -2.92% goog, -2.62% .\n\nintel first learned of the vulnerability in june but said it took the lead working with software giants and other hardware makers on patches that would negate the effects of meltdown. consumers should update their devices when prompted to ensure that updates meant to stop meltdown are installed, but there apparently is no known cure for spectre at this time.\n\nsimply put, the vulnerability in meltdown occurs when the processor uses out-of-order execution, looking ahead to schedule subsequent operations to idle execution units of the processor. the vulnerability in spectre occurs in speculative execution, where it tries to guess the destination and execute ahead. both of these operations leave the system memory open to vulnerabilities, researchers discovered.\n\neverything we thought about millennials' money habits was wrong\n\nthe way we designed computers is we tried to make them smart as to where the instructions come from. if the computer has to go out to the drive every time it will be slow, said jack gold, principal analyst with j. gold associates. they go out to prefetch data, which speeds things up, he said.\n\nintel disputed parts of the register's scoop on the vulnerabilities, especially claims that a fix will slow down performance, saying the average computer user would not notice a change. but executives also acknowledged that any fixes could slow down computers, with the change in speed depending on the workloads. that could make a fix especially problematic for large-scale cloud providers like google, microsoft corp. msft, -2.67% and amazon.com inc. amzn, -3.44% , which all issued statements on their work to combat the issue.\n\nit's an architectural flaw brought about by a design decision made to increase performance, and it's baked into hardware. the required software fix will slow things down, said roger kay, principal analyst at endpoint technologies, in an email. now, many performance-oriented tasks, like gaming, don't switch much between user and kernel levels, but many cloud computing tasks do. and those servers are mission critical. they're right in the middle of the workflow. intel has almost all the server hardware locked up. this could open it for others, notably amd.\n\nopinion: intel suffers an epic security fail, offering a big opportunity for amd\n\nafter its shares were bruised badly in morning trading, intel said in the early afternoon it was working on updating its chip instructions via firmware updates and that software vendors like microsoft and linux developers such as red hat inc. us:rht were working on software updates. countermeasures will work on meltdown, but one such approach, which would be to disable out-of-order execution, would devastate performance, the researchers wrote. indeed, intel said that the patches will slow down performance anywhere from 3% to 30%.\n\nbut the researchers noted in their paper on spectre that there is currently no way to know whether a particular code construction is, or is not, safe across today's processors — much less future designs. a great deal of work lies ahead.\n\nthe best advice for now is to never save any passwords in your browser or cache, and take advantage of

pity about the panic on stock markets — so what else is new? — but financial practitioners and observers should really get wise about the yuan. the fundamental point about the international monetary fund's approval in november for the yuan to enter the special drawing right from oct. 1 is that the chinese currency should not, and will not, be pegged directly to the dollar.\n\nthe writing has been on the wall for some time. it has been in straightforward english and not mandarin. clearly, if the chinese authorities wish — as they certainly do — for their currency to become a reserve asset, then the yuan usdcny, +0.03% cannot be equivalent to the dollar. if it were, there would be no point in the currency entering the sdr.\n\na move towards dollar depegging has been the worst-kept secret in beijing for years.\n\nso there is no reason for the exaggerated fuss now that the chinese authorities, perfectly logically, have made the decision to keep the currency stable against a basket of 13 trading partners rather than the greenback.\n\nthis is all part of a move towards the much-trumpeted multi-currency reserve system, in which a batch of currencies will be competing for status and value vis-à-vis the dollar.\n\nas a matter of fact, the yuan has been stable against sterling gbpcny, -0.09% since last summer, fluctuating in a narrow band around £0.1 — but no one is protesting that the british currency is undergoing a calamitous devaluation.\n\nmarkets are digesting, too, the perfectly predictable (and predicted) likelihood that chinese growth will slow. a senior chinese official has just told us something blindingly obvious: that the country will face great difficulty in achieving economic growth above 6.5% over 2016-20.\n\nthe international stock markets have had a torrid new year opening — but it should have been fairly clear that they were heading for a correction. i remember a member of the european central bank executive board telling a small london dinner in april 2013 that equities in the german dax were in bubble territory. since then the german market (aided by the weak euro and the ecb's asset purchases) has moved 20% higher.\n\na report by the official monetary and financial institutions forum on the yuan and the multi-currency reserve system stated in january 2013: after six years of gradual appreciation against the dollar — amounting to 30% in nominal terms since 2005, as part of china's modification of the currency peg — the renminbi no longer seems fundamentally undervalued against the dollar. for much of this period, markets treated the renminbi as a one-way bet. however, over the course of 2012 and 2013, repeated periods of slight weakness indicated that this view would have to change.\n\nthe yuan is being unpegged from the u.s. dollar.\n\nthe chinese authorities have made clear that the currency can move down as well as up. massive accruals of foreign-exchange reserves have tailed off and given way to outflows, in line with china's own perception that the official reserves total of more than $3 trillion was excessive.\n\nessentially, china is aiming for a system under which barriers between pools of yuan on onshore and offshore markets are slowly dismantled — an aim that latest turbulence has hindered.\n\nas part of china's catchup with the west, the chinese state council, the people's bank and other agencies are learning the rudiments of running an international currency. the west needs to guard against hubris or arrogance. pivotal moments in the history of reserve currencies backed by centuries of capitalist development — britain's departure from the gold standard in 1931, the u.s. break with gold in 1971, drastic u.s. monetary tightening after 1979 or germany's disruptive policies on the deutsche mark in the european post-1990 currency upheavals — are hardly models of smooth management.\n\nall the same, beijing's assumption of reserve currency status is fraught with unique hazard. never before has either a developing country or a communist-run state won a seat at the top table of world money — and china is both.\n\nin the past 30 years, the world has seen a sizable increase in reserve holdings, far-reaching trade and investment globalization, the rise of emerging market economies, and the spread of financial markets linked by instant communications.\n\nconsequently, a far greater weight of global capital is jostling to find a home across a great variety of time zones in a much broader variety of instruments. reaching a steady equilibrium will take time — and this is what the multi-currency reserve system is all about. the transition will not be orderly.\n\nnote: the evolution of the multi-currency system has been on omfif's agenda since it was established in january 2010. one of the first analyses was by david marsh in the financial times in august 1979:
in a saturday telephone call, president donald trump urged georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger to overturn president-elect joe biden's victory in the state. trump spent much of the call angrily alleging voting fraud, ballot destruction and other charges, while raffensperger rejected pressure to further investigate an election in which there has been no evidence of widespread fraud.\n\nread: trump, on audio tape, presses georgia official to 'find' more votes\n\nbelow is a transcript of the jan. 2 call:\n\nconference call with president trump and georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger\n\n• president trump\n\n• brad raffensperger, secretary of state, state of georgia\n\n• ryan germany, general counsel and assistant commissioner of securities, state of georgia\n\n• cleta mitchell, partner, foley & lardner\n\n• jordan fuchs, deputy secretary of state, state of georgia\n\n• mark meadows, white house chief of staff\n\n• kurt r. hilbert, managing member and founder, the hilbert law firm\n\ntranscript by superior transcriptions llc\n\nryan germany: he was here a second ago. this is ryan germany.\n\nmark meadows: mr. germany, ms. fuchs –\n\nms. fuchs: hi.\n\nbrad raffensperger: and brad raffensperger here.\n\nmr. meadows: ok. all right. so, mr. president, everybody is on the line. and just so – this is mark meadows, the chief of staff. just so we all are aware, on the line is the secretary of state and two other individuals, jordan and mr. germany, with him. you also have the attorneys that represent the president – kurt and alex and cleta mitchell, who is not the attorney of record but has been involved – myself, and then the president. so, mr. president, i'll turn it over to you.\n\npresident trump: ok. thank you very much. hello, brad and ryan and everybody. we appreciate the time and the call.\n\nso we've spent a lot of time on this, and if we could just go over some of the numbers i think it's pretty clear that we won. we won very substantially georgia. you even see it by rally size, frankly. we'd be getting 25, 30,000 people a rally, and the competition would get less than a hundred people, and it never made sense.\n\nbut we have a number of things. we have at least two or three – anywhere from 250 to 300,000 ballots were dropped mysteriously into the rolls. much of that had to do with fulton county, which hasn't been checked. we think that if you check the signatures, a real check of the signatures going back in fulton county, you'll find at least a couple of hundred thousand of forged signatures of people with – that – who have been forged. and we are quite sure that's going to happen.\n\nanother tremendous number – we're going to have an accurate number over the next two days with certified accountants. but an accurate number will be given, but it's in the fifties of thousands, and that's people that went to vote and they were told they can't vote because they've already been voted for. and it's a very sad thing. they walked out complaining. but the number is large. we'll have it for you, but it's very – it's much more than the number of 11,779 that's – the current margin is only 11,779. brad, i think – i think you agree with that, right?\n\nthat's something i think everyone – (laughs) – at least that's a number that everyone agrees on. but that's the difference in the votes.\n\nbut we've had hundreds of thousands of ballots that we're able to, actually – we'll get you a pretty accurate number. you don't need much of a number because the number that in theory i lost by, the margin would be 11,779. but you also have substantial numbers of people, thousands and thousands, who went to the voting place on november 3rd, were told they couldn't vote – were told they couldn't vote because a ballot had been put in on their name. and you know, that's very, very…very, very sad.\n\nwe had i believe it's about 4,502 voters who voted but who weren't on the voter registration list. so it's 4,502 who voted but they were not on the voter registration roll, which they had to be.\n\nyou had 18,325 vacant address voters. they had no – the address was vacant. and they're not allowed to be counted. that's 18,325.\n\na smaller number, you had 904 who only voted where they had just a po, a post office box number. and they had a post office box number, and that's not allowed.\n\nwe had at least 18,000 that's on tape – we had them counted very painstakingly – 18,000 voters having to do with ruby freeman. she's a vote scammer, a professional vote scammer and hustler, ruby freeman. that is – that was the tape that's been shown all over the world that makes everybody look bad – you, me, and everybody else – where they got – number one, they said – they said very clearly and it's been reported that they said there was a major water main break. everybody fled the area. and then they came back – ruby freeman, her daughter, and a few people. there were no republican poll watchers. actually, there were no democrat poll watchers. i guess they were them. but there were no democrats, either. and there was no law enforcement. late in the morning, they went – early in the morning, they went to the table with the black robe – the black shield and they pulled out the votes. those votes were put there a number of hours before. the table was put there – i think it was – brad, you would know. it was probably eight hours or seven hours before, and then it was stuffed with votes. they weren't in an official voter box. they were in what looked to be suitcases or trunks – suitcases, but they weren't in voter boxes. the minimum number it could be – because we watched it, and they watched it for certified in slow motion, instant replay if you can believe it. but it had slow motion and it was magnified many times over, and the minimum it was was 18,000 ballots, all for biden.\n\nyou had out-of-state voters – they voted in georgia, but they were from out of state – of 4,925.\n\nyou had absentee ballots sent to vacant – they were absentee ballots sent to vacant addresses. they had nothing on them about addresses. that's 2,326.\n\nand you had drop boxes, which is very bad. you had drop boxes that were picked up. we have photographs and we have affidavits from many people. i don't know if you saw the hearings, but you have drop boxes where the box was picked up and not delivered for three days. so all sorts of things could have happened to that box, including, you know, putting in the votes that you wanted.\n\nso there are many infractions. and the bottom line, it's many, many times the 11,779 margin that they said we lost by. we had vast – i mean, you have – the state is in turmoil over this. and i know you would like to get to the bottom of it, although i saw you on television today and you said that you found nothing wrong. i mean, you know – and i didn't lose the state, brad.\n\npeople have been saying that it was the highest vote ever. there was no way – a lot of the political people said that there's no way they beat me, and they beat me. they beat me in the – (inaudible 17:07) as you know, every single state – we won every state. we won every statehouse in the country. we held the senate, which is shocking to people, although we'll see what happens tomorrow or in a few days. and we won the house. but we won every single statehouse and we won congress, which was supposed to lose 15 seats and they gained i think 16 or 17 or something. i think there's now a difference of five. there was supposed to be a difference substantially more.\n\nbut politicians – in every state, but politicians in georgia have been given affidavits and are going to that there was no way they beat me in the – in the election, that the people came out – in fact, they were expecting to lose and they ended up winning by a lot because of the coattails, and they said there's no way – that they've done many polls prior to the election. there was no way that they won. ballots were dropped in massive numbers, and we're trying to get to those numbers, and we will have them. they'll take a period of time, certified. but they're massive numbers, and far greater than the 11,779.\n\nthe other thing, dead people. so dead people voted, and i think the number is in the – close to 5,000 people. and they went to obituaries, they went to all sorts of methods to come up with an accurate number, and a minimum is close to about 5,000 voters.\n\nthe bottom line is when you add it all up, and then you start adding, you know, 300,000 fake ballots, then the other thing they said is in fulton county and other areas – and this may or may not be true, this just came up this morning – that they are burning their ballots, that they are shredding, shredding ballots and removing equipment. they're changing the equipment on the – on the dominion machines. and you know, that's not legal. and they supposedly shredded i think they said 300 pounds of – 3,000 pounds of ballots, and that just came to us as a report today. and you know, it's – it's a very sad situation.\n\nbut brad, if you took – the minimum numbers were many, many times above the 11,779, and many of those numbers are certified, or they will be certified but they are certified. those are numbers that are there, that exist, and that beat the margin – the margin of loss. it beat – they beat it, i mean, by a lot. and people should be happy to have an accurate count instead of an election where there's turmoil. i mean, there's turmoil in georgia and other places. you're not the only one. i mean, we have other states that i believe will be flipping to us very shortly.\n\nbut this is – this is something that's – you know, as an example, i think in detroit and i think there's a section of – good section of your state, actually, which – we're not sure, so we're not going to report it yet. but in detroit, we had i think it was 139 percent of the people voted. that's not too good.\n\nin pennsylvania, they had well over 200,000 more votes than they had people voting, and that…that doesn't play too well. and the legislature there is – which is republican, is extremely activist and angry. but i mean, there were other things, also, that were almost as bad as that.\n\nbut they had an example in michigan a tremendous number of dead people that voted. i think it was – i think, mark, it was 18,000, some unbelievably high number, much higher than yours. you were – you were in the 4 to 5,000 category. and that was checked out laboriously by going through birth cert…by going through the obituary columns in the newspapers.\n\nso i guess with all of it being said, brad, it's – the bottom line – and provisional ballots, again, you know, you'll have to tell me about the provisional ballots. but we have a lot of people that were complaining that they weren't able to vote because they were already voted for. and these are great people, and you know, they were shell shocked. i don't know if you call that provisional ballots. in some states we had a lot of provisional ballot situations where people were given a provisional ballot because when they walked in on november 3rd they were already voting – voted for.\n\nso that's it. i mean, we have many, many times the number of votes necessary to win the state. and we won the state, and we won it very substantially and easily. and we're getting – we have – much of this is very – you know, they're certified. far more are certified than we need, but we're getting additional numbers certified, too. and we're getting pictures of drop boxes being delivered and delivered late – delivered three days later, in some cases. plus, we have many affidavits to that effect.\n\nmr. meadows: so, mr. president, if i – if i might be able to jump in, and i'll give brad a chance, mr. secretary.\n\none, obviously, there is – there are allegations where we believe that not every vote or fair vote and legal vote was counted. that's at odds with the representation from the secretary of state's office.\n\nwhat i'm hopeful for is, is there some way that we can – we can find some kind of an agreement to look at this a little bit more fully? you know, the president mentioned fulton county, but in some of these areas where there seems to be a difference of where the facts seem to lead. and so, mr. secretary, i was hopeful that, you know, in a spirit of cooperation and compromise, is there something that we can at least have a discussion to look at some of these allegations to find a path forward that's less litigious?\n\nmr. raffensperger: well, i've listened to what…the president has just said. president trump, we've had several lawsuits, and we've had to respond in court to the lawsuits and the contentions. we don't agree that you have won and we don't – i didn't agree about the 200,000 number that you mentioned. but i could go through that point by point.\n\nwhat we had done is we gave out state senate about one-and-a-half hours of our time going through the election issue by issue. and then on the statehouse, the government affairs committee, we gave them about two-and-a-half hours of our time going back point by point on all the issues of contention. and then just a few days ago we met with our u.s. congressmen, republican congressmen, and we gave them about two hours of our time talking about this past election.\n\ngoing back, primarily what you're – what you've talked about here, focused in on primarily, i believe, is the absentee ballot process. i don't believe that you're really questioning the dominion machines because we did a hand re-tally, a 100 percent re-tally of all the ballots and compared that to what the machine said, and it came up with virtually the same result. then we did the recount and we got virtually the same result. so i guess we could probably take that off the table. i don't think there's an issue about that.\n\ni think what you're –\n\npresident trump: well, brad – brad, not that there's not an issue, but – because i – we have a big issue with dominion in other states and perhaps in yours, but we haven't felt we needed to go there. and just to, you know, maybe put a little different spin on what mark is saying – mark meadows – yeah, we'd like to go further, but we don't really need to. we have all the votes we need. you know, we won the state.\n\nif you took – these are the most minimal numbers, the numbers that i gave you. those are numbers that are certified: your absentee ballots sent to vacant addresses; your out-of-state voters, 4,925. you know, when you add them up, it's many more – it's many times the 11,779 number.\n\nso we could go through – we have not gone through your dominion, so we can't give them blessing. i mean, in other states we think we found tremendous corruption with dominion machines, but we'll have to see.\n\nbut we only lost the state by – by that number, 11,000 votes, and – 779. so with that being said, with just what we have and – you know, with just what we have, we're giving you minimum – minimum numbers. we're doing the most conservative numbers possible. we're many times – many, many times above the margin. and so we don't really have to – mark, i don't think we have to go through machines because –\n\nmr. meadows: right. right.\n\npresident trump: – because what's the difference between winning the election by two votes and winning it by a half-a-million votes?\n\nmr. meadows: right.\n\npresident trump: i think we probably did win it by a half a – you know, one of the things that happened, brad, is we have other people coming in now from alabama and from south carolina and from other states, and they're saying it's impossible for you to have lost georgia. we won – you know, in alabama we set a record, got the highest vote ever. in georgia we set a record with a massive amount of votes. and they say it's not possible to have lost georgia. and i could tell you by our rallies. i could tell you by the rally i'm having on monday night. the place, they already have lines of people standing out front waiting. it's just not possible to have lost georgia. it's not possible.\n\nwhen i heard it was close, i said there's no way. but they dropped a lot of votes in there late at night. you know that, brad. and that's what we are working on very, very stringently. but regardless of those votes, with all of it being said, we lost by essentially 11,000 votes, and we have many more votes already calculated, and certified too. so i just don't know – you know, mark, i don't know what's the purpose – i won't give dominion a pass because we found too many bad things, but we don't need dominion or anything else. we have – we have – we have won this election in georgia based on all of this.\n\nand there's nothing wrong with saying that, brad. you know, i mean, having the – having a correct – the people of georgia are angry. and these numbers are going to be repeated on monday night, along with others that we're going to have by that time, which are much more substantial, even. and the people of georgia are angry. the people of the country are angry. and there's nothing wrong with saying that – you know, that you've recalculated because the 2,236 on absentee ballots, i mean, they're all exact numbers that were done by accounting firms, law firms, et cetera. and even if you cut them in half, cut them in half, and cut them in half again, it's more votes than we need.\n\nmr. raffensperger: well, mr. president, the challenge that you have is the data you have is wrong. we talked to the congressmen and they were surprised, but they – i guess there was a person named mr. braynard that came to these meetings and presented data. and he said that there was dead people – i believe it was upward of 5,000. the actual number were two – two. two people that were dead that voted. and so that's wrong. that was two.\n\npresident trump: well, cleta, how do you respond to that? i mean, you tell me.\n\nmr. raffensperger: because –\n\ncleta mitchell: i will say, mr. secretary, one of the things that we have requested – and we – what we said was, and if you look at – if you read our petition, it said that we took the names and birth years, and you know, we had certain information available to us. we have asked from your office for records that only you have. and so we said there's a universe of people who have the same name and same birth year and died, but we don't have the records that you have. and one of the things that we have been suggesting formally and informally for weeks now is to try – is for you to make available to us the records that would be necessary to confirm – (inaudible 30:46) –\n\npresident trump: but cleta, even before you do that –\n\nms. mitchell: – that standing. that's a –\n\npresident trump: cleta, even before you do that, and not even including – that's why i hardly even included that number – although in one state we have a tremendous amount of dead people, so i don't know. i'm sure we do in georgia, too. i'm sure we do in georgia, too. but is that we're so far ahead – we're so far ahead of these numbers, even the phony ballots of ruby freeman – known scammer. you know the internet? you know what was trending on the internet? where's ruby, because they thought she would be in jail. where's ruby. it's crazy. it's crazy.\n\nthat was – the minimum number is 18,000 for ruby, but they think it's probably about 56,000. but the minimum number is 18,000 on the ruby freeman night where she ran back in there when everybody was gone and stuffed – she stuffed the ballot boxes. let's face it, brad. i mean, they did it in slow-motion replay magnified, right? she stuffed the ballot boxes. they were stuffed like nobody's ever seen them stuffed before. so there's a term for it when it's a machine instead of a ballot box, but she stuffed the machines. she stuffed the ballot – each ballot went three times. they were showing here's ballot number one, here it is a second, third time, next ballot.\n\ni mean, look, brad, this is – we have – we have a new tape that we're going to release. it's devastating.\n\nand by the way, that one event – that one event is much more than the 11,000 votes that we're talking about. it's – you know, that one event was a disaster. it just – you know, but it was – it was something that – it can't be disputed. and again, we have a version that you haven't seen, but it's magnified. it's magnified, and you can see everything. and she put – for some reason, they put it in three times, each ballot. and i don't know why, but you know, why – i don't know why three times. why not five times, right? but – yeah, go ahead.\n\nmr. raffensperger: you're talking about the state farm video. and i think it's extremely unfortunate that rudy giuliani or his people, they sliced and diced that video and took it out of context. so the next day we brought in wsb-tv and we let them show – see the full run of tape. i mean, what you'll see, the events that transpired are nowhere near what was projected by, you know –\n\npresident trump: but where were the poll watchers, brad? there were no poll watchers there. there were no democrats or republicans. there was no security there. it was late in the evening or late in the – early in the morning, and there was nobody else in the room. where were the poll watchers? and why did they say a watermain broke – which they did – and which is reported in the newspapers? they said they left – they ran out because of a watermain break. and there was no watermain. there was nothing. there was no break. there was no watermain break. but where – if you – if you take out everything, where were the republican poll watchers – even where were the democrat poll watchers – because there were none.\n\nand then you say, well, they left their station. you know, if you look at the tape – and this was – it – this was reviewed by professional police and detectives and other people – when they left in a rush – everybody left in a rush because of the watermain – but everybody left in a rush, these people left their station. when they came back, they didn't go to their station. they went to the apron wrapped around the table, under which were thousands and thousands of ballots in a box that was not an official or a sealed box, and then they took those, and they went back to a different station. so if they would have come back, they would have walked to their station and they would have continued to work. but they couldn't do even that, because that's illegal because they had no republican poll watchers.\n\nand remember, her reputation is – she's known all over the internet, brad. she's known all over. i'm telling you, where's ruby was one of the hot items – ruby, they knew her. where's ruby. so, brad, you know, there can be no justification for that. and, you know, i give everybody the benefit of the doubt, but that was – and, brad, why did they put the votes in three times? you know, they put them in three times.\n\nmr. raffensperger: mr. president, they did not put that – we did an audit of that, and we've proved conclusively that they were not scanned three times.\n\npresident trump: well, where was everybody else at that late time in the morning? where was everybody? where were the republicans? where were the security guards? where were the people that were there just a little while before when everyone ran out of the room? how come – how come we had no security in the room? why did they run to the bottom of the table? why did they run there and just open the skirt and rip out the – and rip out the votes? i mean, brad – and they were sitting there – i think for five hours or something like that, the votes – but they just all happened to run back and go – you know, brad –\n\nmr. raffensperger: yeah, mr. president, we'll send you the link from wsb that does the –\n\npresident trump: i don't care about a link. i don't need it. i have a much – brad, i have a much better link.\n\nms. mitchell: i have – mr. president and mr. secretary, i will tell you, i've seen the tape, the full tape. so has alex. we've watched it. and what we saw and what we've confirmed in the timing is that they made everybody leave – we have sworn affidavits saying that – and then they – then they began to process ballots. and our estimate is that there were roughly 18,000 ballots. we don't know that. if you know that, we'd like to know the answer.\n\npresident trump: it was 18,000 ballots, but they used each one three times. so it was the –\n\nms. mitchell: well, i don't know about that, but i – what i do know –\n\npresident trump: yeah. well, i do, because we had – we had ours magnified out. so each one magnified out is 18 times three, but –\n\nms. mitchell: i've watched the entire tape.\n\npresident trump: but – you know, but nobody can make a case for that, brad. nobody. i mean, look, that's – you'd have to be a child to think anything other than that. just a child. i mean, you have your never trumper u.s. attorney there.\n\nms. mitchell: how many ballots – how many ballots, mr. secretary, are you saying that ruby was processing?\n\nmr. raffensperger: we had gbi, certainly, investigate that.\n\nmr. germany: we had our – this is ryan germany. we had our law enforcement officers talk to everyone who was – who was there after that event came to light. they gbi was with them, as well as fbi agents.\n\npresident trump: well, there's no way they could – then they're incompetent. they're either dishonest or incompetent, ok? there's only two answers: dishonesty or incompetence. there's just no way. look, there's no way. and on the other thing that i said, too, there's no way – i mean, there's no way that these things could have been – you know, you have all these different people that voted but they don't live in georgia anymore. what was that number, cleta? that was a pretty good number, too.\n\nms. mitchell: well, the number who had registered out of state after they moved from georgia – and so they had a date when they moved from georgia, they registered to vote out of state, and then they – it's like 4,500. i don't have that right in front of me. it's something like that.\n\npresident trump: and then they came back in and they voted.\n\nms. mitchell: and voted, yeah.\n\npresident trump: that was a large number, though. it was in the 20s. and you know, the point is –\n\nmr. germany: we've been going through each of those as well. and those numbers that we got, that ms. mitchell was just saying, they're not accurate. everyone we've been through are people that lived in georgia, moved to a different state, but then moved back to georgia legitimately. and in – and in many cases – (inaudible 38:45) – so far.\n\npresident trump: really? how many people do that? you mean they moved out and then they said, ah, all the hell with it, i'll move back in? you know, it doesn't sound like a very normal – like you mean they moved out, and, what, they missed it so much that they wanted to move back in? you know, it's like – (laughs) – it's crazy.\n\nmr. germany: well, and then this is they moved back in years ago. this was not like something just before the election. so there's something about that data that is just not accurate.\n\npresident trump: well, i don't know. we – i mean, all i know is that it is – it is certified. and they moved out of georgia, and they voted. it didn't say they moved back in, cleta, did it?\n\nms. mitchell: no, but, i mean, we're looking at the voter registry. again, if you have additional records, we've been asking for that, but you haven't shared any of that with us. you just keep saying you've investigated the allegations.\n\npresident trump: but, cleta, a lot of if you don't need to be shared. i mean, to be honest, they should share it. they should share it because you want to get to an honest election. i won this election by hundreds of thousands of votes. there's no way i lost georgia. there's no way. we won by hundreds of thousands of votes. i'm just going by small numbers, when you add them up, they're many times the 11,000. but i won that state by hundreds of thousands of votes.\n\nnow, do you think it's possible that they shredded ballots in fulton county? because that's what the rumor is. and also, that dominion took out machines, that dominion is really moving fast to get rid of their machinery? do you know anything about that? because that's illegal.\n\nmr. germany: this is ryan germany. no, dominion has not moved any machinery out of fulton county. we're having an election on tuesday.\n\npresident trump: well, but – no, but have they moved – have they – have they moved the inner parts of the machines and replaced them with other parts?\n\nmr. germany: no.\n\npresident trump: are you sure, ryan?\n\nmr. germany: i'm sure. i'm sure, mr. president.\n\npresident trump: and what about – what about the – what about the ballots, the shredding of the ballots? have they been shredding ballots?\n\nmr. raffensperger: no.\n\nmr. germany: the only investigation that we have into that, they have not been shredding any ballots. there was an issue in cobb county where they were doing normal, you know, office shredding, getting rid of old stuff, and we investigated that. but this is stuff from, you know, past elections. and that's – and that's what it turned out to be.\n\npresident trump: i don't know about that. it's very – it doesn't pass the smell test, though, because we hear they're shredding thousands and thousands of ballots. and now what they're saying, oh, we're just cleaning up the office. (laughs.) you know, i don't think they're –\n\nmr. raffensperger: well, mr. president, the problem that you have with social media, they can – people can say anything.\n\npresident trump: no, no, this isn't social. this is trump media. it's not social media. it's really not. it's not social media. i don't care about social. i couldn't care less. social media is big tech. big tech is on your side, you know? i don't even know why you have a side, because you should want to have an accurate election. and you're a republican.\n\nmr. raffensperger: we believe that we do have an accurate election.\n\npresident trump: no, i – no, you don't. no. no, you don't. you don't have – you don't have – not even close. you got – you're off by hundreds of thousands of votes. and just on the small numbers, you're off on these numbers.\n\nand these numbers can't be – well, why won't – ok, so you send us into cobb county for signature verification, right? you send us into cobb county, which we didn't want to go into, and you said it would be open to the public and we could have our – so we had our experts there. they weren't allowed into the room. but we didn't want cobb county. we wanted fulton county, and you wouldn't give it to us. now why aren't we doing signature – and why can't it be open to the public? and why can't we have professionals do it instead of rank amateurs that will never find anything and don't want to find anything? they don't want to find – you know they don't want to find anything. someday you'll tell me the reason why, because i don't understand your reasoning. but someday you'll tell me the reason why. but why don't you want to find –\n\nmr. germany: mr. president, we chose cobb county – we chose cobb county –\n\npresident trump: why don't you want to find – what?\n\nmr. germany: sorry, go ahead.\n\npresident trump: yeah, why did – why – ok, so why did you do cobb county? we didn't even – we requested fulton county, not cobb county.\n\nms. mitchell: well, mr. president, we do have – (inaudible) –\n\nmr. germany: we chose cobb county –\n\nms. mitchell: – cobb county.\n\npresident trump: go ahead, please.\n\nmr. germany: we chose cobb county because that was the only county where there's been any evidence submitted that the signature verification was not properly done –\n\npresident trump: no, but i told you, but we're not – we're not saying that. we are the aggrieved –\n\nms. mitchell: no, we did say that. we did say that.\n\npresident trump: – we're the aggrieved party.\n\nfulton county – look, stacey – in my opinion, stacey is as dishonest as they come. she has outplayed you at every – at everything. she got you to sign a totally unconstitutional agreement which is a disastrous agreement. you can't check signatures, you can't do – i can't imagine – you're allowed to do harvesting, i guess, in that – that agreement is a disaster for this country.\n\nbut she got you somehow to sign that thing, and she is a – she has outsmarted you at every step. and i hate to imagine what's going to happen on monday or tuesday, but it's very scary to people, you know – where the ballots flow in out of nowhere. it's very scary to people.\n\nthat consent decree is a disaster. it's a disaster. a very good lawyer who examined it said they'd never seen anything like it. and –\n\nmr. raffensperger: ballot harvesting is still illegal in the state of georgia, and that settlement agreement did not change that one iota.\n\npresident trump: well, it's not a settlement agreement; it's a consent decree. it even says consent decree on it, doesn't it? it uses the term consent decree. it doesn't say settlement agreement; it's a consent decree. it's a disaster.\n\nmr. raffensperger: it's a settlement agreement.\n\npresident trump: what's written on top of it?\n\nmr. raffensperger: ryan?\n\nmr. germany: i don't – i don't have it in front of me, but it was not entered by the court. it's not a court order. it's an order –\n\npresident trump: no, it's called – but ryan, it's called a consent decree. is that right – on the paper? is that right?\n\nmr. germany: i don't – i don't – i don't believe so, but i don't – i don't have it in front of me.\n\npresident trump: ok, ok. whatever, it's a disaster. it's a disaster.\n\nlook, here's the problem. we could go through signature verification, and we'll find hundreds of signatures – if you let us do it – and the only way you can do it, as you know, is to go to the past. but you didn't do that in cobb county. you just looked at one page compared to another. the only way you can do a signature verification is go from the one that signed it on november whatever – recently – and compare it to two years ago, four years ago, six years ago – you know, or even one. and you will find that you have many different signatures.\n\nbut in fulton, where they dumped ballots, you will find that you have many that aren't even signed, and you have many that are forgeries, ok? you know that. you know that. you have no doubt about that.\n\nand you will find – you will be at 11,779 within minutes because fulton county is totally corrupt and so is she totally corrupt. and they're going around playing you and laughing at you behind your back, brad. whether you know it or not, they're laughing at you. and you've taken a state that's a republican state and you've made it almost impossible for a republican to win because of cheating, because they cheated like nobody has ever cheated before.\n\nand i don't care how long it takes me – you know, we're going to have other states coming forward pretty good, but i won't – this has never given – this is – we have some incredible talent who've said they've never seen anything – now the problem is they need more time for the big numbers, but they are very substantial numbers. but…and i think you are going to find that they – by the way, a little information. i think you are going to find that they are shredding ballots because they have to get rid of the ballots because the ballots are unsigned, the ballots are corrupt. and they are brand new, and they don't have seals, and there's a whole thing with the ballots. but the ballots are corrupt. and you are going to find that they are – which is totally illegal. it's more illegal for you than it is for them because you know what they did and you're not reporting it. that's a – you know, that's a criminal – that's a criminal offense. and, you know, you can't let that happen. that's a big risk to you and to ryan – you're lawyers; that a big risk.\n\nbut they are shredding ballots, in my opinion, based on what i've heard, and they are removing machinery, and they're moving it as fast as they can, both of which are criminal fines, and you can't let it happen, and you are letting it happen. you know, i mean, i'm notifying you that you are letting it happen.\n\nso, look –\n\nmr. raffensperger: well, we're –\n\npresident trump: – all i want to do is this. i just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have, because we won the state, and flipping the state is a great testament to our country because, you know, there's just – it's a testament that they can admit to a mistake – or whatever you want to call it – if it was a mistake. i don't know.\n\na lot of people think it wasn't a mistake; it was much more criminal than that. but it's a big problem in georgia, and it's not a problem that's going away. i mean, you know, it's not a problem that's going away. and we've got to –\n\nmr. germany: mr. president, this is ryan. we're looking into every one of those things that you mentioned.\n\npresident trump: ok, then good.\n\nmr. germany: and our investigators, i know them. i know our friends at gbi.\n\npresident trump: but if you find them, you've got to say it, ryan. look, if they – let me ask you – ryan, if they are destroying ballots –\n\nmr. germany: we will. but let me tell you what – let me tell you what we are seeing.\n\npresident trump: go ahead. go ahead.\n\nmr. germany: what we're seeing is not at all what you are describing. and these are investigators from our office. these are investigators from gbi, and they're looking, and they are good. and that's not what they're seeing. and we'll keep – we'll keep looking. we'll keep looking at all of these things. but what we are seeing –\n\npresident trump: well, you'd better check on the ballots because they are shredding ballots, ryan. i'm just telling you, ryan. they are shredding ballots, and you should look at that very carefully because that's still illegal, you know. you may not even believe it because it's so bad, but they're shredding ballots because they think we're going to eventually get there because we'll eventually get into fulton, you know?\n\nin my opinion it's never too late. in my opinion it's never too late. so – oh, a little double – a little double sound there.\n\nso that's the story, fellows. look, we need only 11,000 votes. we have far more than that as it stands now. we'll have more and more, and – do you have provisional ballots at all, brad? provisional ballots?\n\nmr. raffensperger: provisional ballots are allowed, you know, by state law.\n\npresident trump: sure. but do you have them? i mean, are they counted or did you just hold them back because they, you know – in other words, how many provisional ballots do you have in the state?\n\nmr. raffensperger: we'll get you that number.\n\npresident trump: because most of them are made out to the name trump because these are people that were scammed when they came in, and we have thousands of people that have testified or that want to testify. when they came in, they were proudly going to vote on november 3rd, and they were told, i'm sorry, you've already been voted for – you've already voted. the women, men started screaming, no, i proudly voted to november 3rd. they said, i'm sorry, but you've already been voted for, and you have a ballot.\n\nand these people are beside themselves. so they went out and they filled in a provisional ballot, putting the name trump on it.\n\nand what about that batch of military ballots that came in, and even though i won the military by a lot, it was a hundred percent trump – i mean, a hundred percent biden. do you know about that?\n\na large group of ballots came – i think it was to fulton county, and they just happened to be a hundred percent for trump, even though – for biden, even though trump won the military by a lot – you know, a tremendous amount.\n\nbut these ballots were a hundred percent for biden. and do you know about that? a very substantial number came in, all for biden. (pause.) does anybody know about it?\n\nmr. germany: this is ryan germany. i –\n\nms. mitchell: i know about it, but we were never –\n\npresident trump: ok, cleta, wait. i'm not asking you, cleta, honestly. i'm asking – i'm asking brad. do you know about the military ballots that we have confirmed now? do you know about the military ballots that came in that were a hundred percent – i mean, a hundred percent for biden? do you know about that?\n\nmr. germany: i don't know about that. i do know that we have – when military ballots come in, it's not just military. it's also military and overseas citizens. the military part of that does generally go republican. the overseas citizen part of it generally goes very democrat. so – (inaudible) – a mix of them.\n\npresident trump: no, but this was – yeah, that's ok. but i get – i got like 78 percent in the military. these ballots were all for – they were – they didn't tell me, obviously, these could be overseas, too, but i get votes overseas, too, ryan, you know, in all fairness.\n\nno, they came in – a large batch came in and it was, quote, 100 percent for biden. and that is criminal – you know, that's criminal, ok? that's another criminal – that's another of the many criminal events. many criminal events here.\n\ni don't know. look brad, i got to get – i have to find 12,000 votes and i have them times a lot. and therefore, i won the state. that's before we go to the next step which is in the process of right now, you know, and i watched you this morning, and you said, well, there was no criminality. but, i mean, all of this stuff is very dangerous stuff. when you talk about no criminality, i think it's very dangerous for you to say that.\n\ni just – i just don't know why you don't want to have the votes counted as they are – like even you, when you went and did that check. and i was surprised because, you know, i didn't consider the check. and we found a few thousand votes that were against me. i was actually surprised because the way that check was done, all you were doing is, you know, recertifying existing votes and, you know, you were given votes, and you just counted them up, and you still found 3,000 that were bad. that was sort of surprising that came down – three or five, i don't know. it was still a lot of votes.\n\nbut you have to go back to check from past years with respect to signatures. and if you check with fulton county, you'll have hundreds of thousands because they dumped ballots into fulton county and the other county next to it.\n\nso what are we going to do here, folks? i only need 11,000 votes. fellas, i need 11,000 votes; give me a break. you know, we have that in spades already, or we could keep it going, but that's not fair to the voters of georgia because they're going to see what happened and – they're going to see what happened.\n\ni mean, i'll take on anybody you want with regard to ruby freeman and her lovely daughter – a very lovely young lady, i'm sure. but ruby freeman – i will take freeman. i will take on anybody you want.\n\nand the minimum – there were 18,000 ballots but they used them three times. so that's, you know, a lot of votes. and that one event – and they were all to biden, by the way; that's the other thing we didn't say. you know, ruby freeman, one thing i forgot to say which was the most important. do you know that every single ballot she did went to biden? you know that, right? do you know that, by the way, brad? every single ballot that she did through the machines at early – early in the morning went to biden. did you know that, ryan?\n\nmr. germany: that's not accurate, mr. president.\n\npresident trump: huh. what is accurate?\n\nmr. germany: the numbers that we are showing are accurate. we picked – we picked –\n\npresident trump: no. no. about ruby freeman. about early in the morning, ryan, when the woman took – you know, when the whole gang took the stuff out of the – from under the table, right, do you know that – do you know who those ballots – do you know who they were made out to? do you know who they were voting for?\n\nmr. germany: no, not specifically.\n\npresident trump: did you ever check?\n\nmr. germany: we did what i described to you earlier.\n\npresident trump: no, no, no. did you ever check the ballots that were scammed by ruby freeman, known – a known political operative, ballotteer? did you ever check who those votes were for?\n\nmr. germany: we've looked into that situation that you described –\n\npresident trump: no, they were 100 percent for biden. one hundred percent. there wasn't a trump vote in the whole group. why don't you want to find this, ryan? what's wrong with you? i heard – i heard your lawyer is very difficult, actually, but i'm sure you're a good lawyer. you have a nice last name.\n\nbut i'm just curious, why wouldn't – why do you keep fighting this thing? it just doesn't make sense. we're way over the 17,779, right. we're way over that number, and just if you took just ruby freeman we're over that number by five or six times when you multiply it out times three, and every single ballot went to biden. and you didn't know that but now you know it.\n\nso tell me, brad, what are we going to do? we won the election and it's not fair to take it away from us like this, and it's going to be very costly in many ways and i think you have to say that you're going to reexamine it and you can reexamine it, but reexamine it with people that want to find answers, not people that don't want to find answers.\n\nfor instance, i'm hearing ryan and he's probably, i'm sure, a great lawyer and everything but he's making statements about those ballots that he doesn't know. but he's making them with such – he did make them with surety but now i think he's less sure because the answer is they all went to biden and that alone wins us the election by a lot, you know. so –\n\nmr. raffensperger: mr. president, you have people that submit information and we have our people that submit information, and then it comes before the court and the court then has to make a determination. we have to stand by our numbers. we believe our numbers are right.\n\npresident trump: but why do you say that, though? i don't know – i mean, sure, we can play this game with the courts. but why do you say that? first of all, they don't even assign us a judge. they don't even assign us a judge. but why wouldn't you – if – hey, brad, why wouldn't you want to check out ruby freeman and why wouldn't you want to say, hey, if in fact president trump is right about that then he wins the state of georgia? just that one incident alone, without going through hundreds of thousands of dropped ballots. you just say you stick by – i mean, i've been watching you for – you know, you don't care about anything. your numbers are right. but your numbers aren't right. they're really wrong and they're really wrong, brad. and i know this phone call is going nowhere other than – other than, ultimately, you know – look, ultimately, i win, ok, because –\n\nms. mitchell: mr. secretary, mr. president –\n\npresident trump: – you guys are so wrong and you've treated this – you've treated the population of georgia so badly, between you and your governor, who wouldn't – who was down at 21 – he was down 21 points and, like a schmuck, i endorsed him and he got elected. but i will tell you, he's a disaster and he'll never – i can't imagine. the people are so angry in georgia i can't imagine he's ever getting elected again, i'll tell you that much right now. but why wouldn't you want to find the right answer, brad, instead of keep saying that the numbers are right? because those numbers are so wrong and –\n\nmr. raffensperger: mr. president, please –\n\nms. mitchell: mr. secretary, mr. president, i mean, one of the things that we have been – alex can talk about this, we've talked about it, and i don't know whether the information has been conveyed to your office. but i think what the president is saying and what we have been trying to do is to say, look, the court is not acting on our petition. they haven't even assigned a judge. but the people of georgia and the people of america have a right to know the answers. and you have data and records that we don't have access to and you keep telling us and making public statements that you've investigated this and, you know, nothing to see here. but we don't know about that.\n\nall we know is what you tell us. what i don't understand is why wouldn't it be in everyone's best interest to try to get to the bottom, compare the numbers? you know, if you say – because to try to be able to get to truth and that we – because we don't have any way of confirming what you're telling us.\n\nyou tell us that you've had an investigation of the state farm arena. i don't have any report. i've never seen a report of investigation. i don't know what that is. i've been pretty involved in this and i don't know. and that's just one of 25 categories and it doesn't even – and as i – as the president said, we haven't even gotten into the dominion issue. that's not part of our case. it's not part of – we just didn't feel as though we had any way to be able to develop –\n\npresident trump: no, we do have a way but i don't want to get into it –\n\nms. mitchell: exactly.\n\npresident trump: – because we have – we found a way in other states – cleta, excuse me. but we don't need it –\n\nms. mitchell: right.\n\npresident trump: – because we're only down 11,000 votes, so we don't even need it.\n\nms. mitchell: right. but all i'm saying is – (inaudible) – not get a commitment.\n\npresident trump: i, personally, think they're corrupt as hell. but we don't need that because all we have to do, cleta, is find 11,000-plus votes. so we don't need that. i'm not looking to shake up the whole world. we won georgia easily. we won it by hundreds of thousands of votes. but if you go by basic simple numbers we won it easily. easily. so we're not giving dominion a pass, on the record. i will say that.\n\nms. mitchell: no, right. exactly. we don't need it. we don't need it.\n\npresident trump: but we just don't – you know, we don't need dominion because we have so many other votes that we don't need to prove it any more than we already have.\n\nms. mitchell: so my –\n\nkurt hilbert: mr. president and cleta, this is kurt hilbert. if i might interject here for a moment.\n\nryan, i would like to suggest that just four categories that have already been mentioned by the president that have actually hard numbers of 24,149 votes that were counted illegally. that in and of itself is sufficient to change the results or place the outcome in doubt. we would like to sit down with your office, and we can do it through purposes of a compromise and settlement, just like this phone call, just to deal with that limited category of votes. and if you are able to establish that our numbers are not accurate, then fine. however, we believe that they are accurate. we've had now three to four separate experts look at these numbers. these numbers are based upon the usps –\n\npresident trump: and certified accountants looked at them.\n\nmr. hilbert: correct. and this is just based on usps data and your own secretary of state data. so that's what we would entreat and ask you to do, to sit down with us in a compromise and settlement, you know, proceeding and actually go through the registered voter ids and the registrations, and if you can convince us that that 24,149 is inaccurate, then fine. but we tend to believe that that is, you know, obviously, more than 11,779 that's sufficient to change the result entirely in and of itself. so what would you say to that, mr. germany?\n\nmr. germany: kurt, i'm happy to – i'll get with our lawyers and we'll set that up. that number is not accurate and i think we can show you for all the ones we've looked at why it's not. and so if that would be helpful, i'm happy to get with our lawyers and set that up with you guys.\n\nms. mitchell: well, we'd love to, right away.\n\npresident trump: well, let me ask you, kurt – kurt, do you think that is an accurate number? that was based on the information given to you by the secretary of state's department, right?\n\nmr. hilbert: that is correct. that information is the minimum, most conservative data based upon the usps data and the secretary of state's office data that has been made publicly available. we do not have the internal numbers from the secretary of state. yet, we have asked for it six times. i sent a letter over to mr. (inaudible 1:05:10) several times requesting this information and it's been rebuffed every single time. so it stands to reason that if the information is not forthcoming there's something to hide. that's the problem that we have.\n\nmr. germany: well, that's not the case. there are things that you guys are entitled to get and there's things that, under law, we are not allowed to give out to you. that's –\n\npresident trump: well, you have to. well, under law, you're not allowed to give faulty election results, ok? you're not allowed to do that and that's what you've done. this is a faulty election result and, honestly, this should go very fast. you should meet tomorrow because you have a big election coming up and because of what you've done to the president. you know, the people of georgia know that this was a scam and because of what you've done to the president a lot of people aren't going out to vote and a lot of republicans are going to vote negative because they hate what you did to the president, ok. they hate him and they're going to vote, and you would be respected, really respected, if this thing could be straightened out before the election.\n\nyou have a big election coming up on tuesday and, therefore, i think that it really is important that you meet tomorrow and work out on these numbers because i know, brad, that if you think we're right i think you're going to say – and i'm not looking to blame anybody. i'm not – i'm just saying that, you know – you know, under new counts and under new views of the election results we won the election. it's all – you know, it's very simple. we won the election.\n\nas the governor of major states and the surrounding states said, there's no way you lost georgia. as the georgia politicians say, there is no way you lost georgia. nobody – everyone knows i won it by hundreds of thousands of votes. but i'll tell you, it's going to have a big impact on tuesday if you guys don't get this thing straightened out fast.\n\nmr. meadows: well, mr. president, this is mark. let me – let me just – it sounds like we've got two different sides agreeing that we can look at those areas, and i assume that we can do that within the next 24 to 48 hours to go ahead and get that reconciled so that we can look at the two claims and making sure that we get the access to the secretary of state's data to either validate or invalidate the claims that have been made. is that correct?\n\nmr. germany: no, that's not what i said. i'm happy to, you know, sit down with or have our lawyers sit down with kurt and the lawyers on that side and explain to him, hey, here's – based on what we've looked at so far, here's how we know this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong. and we –\n\nmr. meadows: so what you're saying, ryan – hold on. let me – let me make sure. so what you're saying is you really don't want to give access to the data. you just want to make another case on why the lawsuit is wrong?\n\nmr. germany: i don't think we – i don't think we can give access to data that's protected by law. but we can sit down with them and say, hey, we're looking at –\n\npresident trump: but you're allowed to have a phony election? you're allowed to have a phony election, right?\n\nmr. germany: no, sir.\n\npresident trump: when are you – when are you going to do the signature counts on – when are you going to do signature verification on fulton county, which you said you were going to do and now all of a sudden you're not doing it? when are you doing that?\n\nmr. hilbert: mr. president?\n\nmr. germany: we are going to do that. we have announced –\n\nmr. hilbert: to get to this issue of the personal information and privacy issue, is it possible that the secretary of state could deputize the lawyers for the president so that we could access that information, that private information, without you having any kind of violation?\n\npresident trump: well, i don't want to know who it is. you guys can do it very confidentially. you can sign a confidentiality agreement. that's ok. i don't need to know names.\n\nmr. meadows: all right. let me – yeah.\n\npresident trump: we've got – but we got the information. on this stuff that we're talking about, we got all that information from the secretary of state.\n\nmr. meadows: yes. so let me – let me recommend, ryan, if you and kurt will get together – you know, when we get off of this phone call if you could get together and work out a plan to address some of what we've got with your attorneys where we can – we can actually look at the data.\n\nfor example, mr. secretary, i can tell you, you said there was only two dead people that would vote. i can promise you there are more than that, and that may be what your investigation shows but i can promise you there are more than that.\n\nbut at the same time, i think it's important that we go ahead and move expeditiously to try to do this and resolve it as quickly as we possibly can, and if that's the good next step, hopefully, we can – we can finish this phone call and go ahead and agree that the two of you will get together immediately.\n\npresident trump: well, why don't my lawyers show you where you got the information? it'll show the secretary of state and you don't even have to look at any names. we don't want names. we don't care. but we got that information from you. and stacey abrams is laughing about it. you know, she's going around saying, these guys are dumber than a rock. what she's done to this party is unbelievable, i tell you. and i only ran against her once and that was with a guy named brian kemp, and i beat her, and if i didn't run brian wouldn't have had even a shot either in the general or in the primary. he was dead, dead as a doornail. he never thought he had a shot at either one of them. what a schmuck i was. but that's the way it is. that's the way it is.\n\ni would like you to – for the attorneys on my side, i'd like you to perhaps meet with ryan, ideally tomorrow, because i think we should come to a resolution of this before the election. otherwise, you're going to have – you're going to have people just not voting. they don't want to vote. they hate the state, they hate the governor, and they hate the secretary of state. i will tell you that right now. and the only people that like you are people that will never vote for you. you know that, brad, right? they like you. you know, they like you. they can't believe what they've found. they want more people like you.\n\nso, look, could you get together tomorrow? and, brad, we just want the truth. it's simple, and everyone's going to look very good if the truth comes out. it's ok. it'll take a little while. but let the truth come out, and the truth – the real truth is i won by 400,000 votes at least. that's the real truth. but we don't need 400,000 votes. we need less than 2,000 votes. and, you know, are you guys able to meet tomorrow, ryan?\n\nmr. germany: i'll get with chris, the lawyer who's representing us in the case, and see when he can get together with kurt.\n\nmr. meadows: all right.\n\nmr. raffensperger: ryan will be in touch with the other attorney on this call, mr. meadows. thank you, president trump, for your time.\n\npresident trump: ok. thank you, brad. thank you, ryan. thank you. thank you, everybody.\n\nmr. meadows: thank you.\n\nms. mitchell: thank you.\n\npresident trump: thank you very much. bye.\n\nmr. germany: mr. president.\n\n(end of call)\n\nthis report originally appeared on wsj.com.\n\nalso popular on wsj.com:\n\nceo behind kfc, taco bell orders fast-food growth to go\n\nhow the american mortgage machine works.
the federal reserve appears to have succeeded where other central banks have failed — at least in convincing markets that it will be more dovish in the years ahead, said former fed chairman ben bernanke on sunday.\n\nas best we can tell, the fed's forward guidance — both in terms of its change in its framework and in terms of its commitments — have been fairly effective, bernanke said, during a discussion about economic policy during the coronavirus pandemic at the american economics association's annual meeting.\n\ncentral banks often face the challenge of being credible about policy decisions that won't be made for years, but the fed seems to have accomplished this goal, bernanke said.\n\nin august, the fed announced a new policy framework, saying that it will attempt to overshoot its 2% inflation target, after years of undershooting that target.\n\nthe fed also said it would no longer preemptively hike its benchmark interest rate to ward off expected inflation, which had been standard fed policy going back to the 1950s. under the new commitment, the fed won't move until it actually sees rising inflation.\n\nsurveys of primary dealers conducted by the new york fed indicate that market participants broadly believe the fed has moved in a dovish direction and that inflation will be higher and unemployment will be lower when the fed lifts its benchmark rate off zero, bernanke noted.\n\nwhen the economy is slowly recovering from a deep recession, markets often look ahead and bond yields rise. but this spike in long-term bond yields can cause growth to stall out. this dynamic was a constant struggle for bernake in the wake of the financial crisis in 2008.\n\nmarket expectations today are much more dovish than after the 2008 financial crisis, bernanke noted.\n\nfinancial markets don't see rates being increased for something like four years, he said.\n\nbernanke said the fed's monetary policy has had beneficial effects since the pandemic started wreaking havoc on the economy in march.\n\nthe economic recovery has proven to be faster than expected, he noted. in june, the fed expected 2020 gdp growth would be minus-6.5% on a year-over-year basis. now, the fed expects it will be less than minus-2%.\n\nin addition, the sectors that are impacted by low interest rates have led the recovery.\n\nbernanke said the fed was also successful in restoring markets in the wake of the short, sharp financial crisis in early march when the economic impact of the coming pandemic became understood.\n\nbernanke said the fed's main street lending facility was a notable exception and was less successful. the alternative funding for lending approach taken by many foreign central banks seemed more successful. those plans provide very cheap funding to any marginal lending done by banks.\n\nthose programs, particularly in europe, have been extremely successful in getting money out the door, he said.
president trump has said he doesn't read a lot, if at all. but could michael wolff's fire and fury: inside the trump white house, a blistering account of the first year of the trump administration, be enough to get the president — and the rest of america — to turn off their tvs and open a book? it seems like an audacious question until, that is, you read the latest sales figures.\n\nthe book has sold 1 million copy in just 4 days.\n\nto put that in context: no single book sold more than 1 million copies last year. the getaway, which is part of jeff kinney's wimpy kid series, was the bestselling new book, selling over 992,000 copies. fire and fury might be doing what trump, arguably the country's first twitter president, could not do. it could be encouraging america to read again.\n\nthe intense level of interest from the public and media alike pushed publisher harry holt & co. to move up the book's publication date to jan. 5 from jan. 9. the book was reportedly sold out in bookstores across both red and blue states — from washington to austin. it was no. 1 on amazon amzn, -3.44% just hours after its release last friday.\n\ncopies of the book fire and fury: inside the trump white house by author michael wolff at a local book store in washington. reuters\n\nonly a minority of americans read poems or literature\n\namericans could certainly do with reading more. in a study released in 2015, the organization for economic cooperation and development ranked americans just 24 out of 72 countries in student performance in reading. literacy skills are linked to personal and social well-being. in the united states, the odds of being in poor health are four times greater for low-skilled adults than for those with the highest proficiency, the oecd said.\n\nthe number of adults who read at least one novel, play or poem within a 12-month period fell to 43% in 2015 from 50% in 2008 and 57% in 1982, according to a 2016 survey of over 37,000 americans by the national endowment for the arts, a government agency that promotes artistic excellence. fiction reading rose from 2002 to 2008, but has been dropping ever since — and currently hovers around 2002 levels.\n\nliterary reading varied widely from state to state. it was highest in vermont (63%), followed by oregon (59.5%), hawaii (5.93%) and colorado (59%) — all states that voted for hillary clinton in the 2016 presidential election — far above the national average. but literary reading was among the lowest in florida (30.5%), west virginia (34.1%) and mississippi (21.7%), all states that voted for trump. nevada, a blue state, scored 30.2%.\n\ntwitter use has soared in recent years\n\ntrump tweeted that the book was full of lies and, on saturday, tweeted he was a very stable genius. it was likely a huge publicity boost for the book. the president has 46.3 million twitter followers and, even assuming that not everyone who follows the president voted for him, each trump tweet typically gets tens of thousands of likes. the number of u.s. twitter users has risen from just 10 million in 2010 to nearly 70 million in 2018.\n\nin an era of social networking, it's also harder to bond around the water cooler over a novel. thousands of works of fiction are published every year, according to new york-based author christopher sorrentino, but only a few hundred come to the attention of a discerning reading public through reviews or celebrity endorsements. these days, many people get their fictional narratives from cable television, he said.\n\nanother, perhaps not unrelated, explanation for the slump in reading: narcissism. americans may be more fascinated with their own lives than with those featured in great works of literary fiction: some 56% of internet users have searched for themselves online, such as by typing their own name into google, according to the pew research center, a think tank based in washington.\n\ntrump: maybe 'fire and fury' comments weren't tough enough\n\ndoes one book have the power to change reading habits?\n\nwill fire and fury do for adults what harry potter did for children 20 years ago? there are encouraging signs that people are at least buying more books, even if literary reading has declined. npd bookscan, which tracks up to 85% of print sales, last week reported that 687.2 million total units sold last year, up nearly 2% from 674.1 million the year before.\n\nit's unlikely to change american habits or literacy levels, but it shifts the national conversations away from tweets and towards a book, said aram sinnreich, professor of communications at the american university, washington. it's less about what people are doing with their time and more about what do we think (is) the basis for shared reality and an agreed upon fact.\n\n'fire and fury' has captured the public and president's attention\n\namong the numerous salacious allegations in fire and fury, many of which are attributed to former white house chief strategist steve bannon, wolff writes that president trump did not expect or even want to win the presidency in november 2016, and writes that melania trump was in tears. in interviews, wolff also took pot shots at the president's reading habits. donald trump doesn't read anything, he told npr.\n\nfire and fury has all the early signs of becoming a publishing sensation, experts say. although trump has dismissed the book, large chunks of conversations were reportedly taped and michael wolff claims that he conducted 200 interviews with senior staff, including trump himself. wolff extensively quoted bannon, who trump has subsequently labeled sloppy steve on twitter twtr, -4.96%\n\nsinnreich said extensively sourced pieces of journalism are a welcome departure from the concept of alternative facts, a phrase used by trump senior adviser kellyanne conway last year. a book can substantiate its claims, list sources and make nuanced arguments, sinnreich said. the more we talk about books, the more those forms of persuasion get to play a role in the political conversation. as an author and avid reader, i'm all for that.\n\nthat includes, by his own account, the president.
the shape of water, mexican director guillermo del toro's fanciful monster flick love story, snatched 13 oscar nominations on tuesday, dominating the field of recognized films.\n\nthe academy of motion picture arts and sciences announced the nominations in all 24 categories for the 90th oscars on tuesday morning. the awards show will air at 7 p.m. eastern on sunday, march 4 on abc dis, -1.52% , with late-night tv host jimmy kimmel serving as the master of ceremonies.\n\nthe shape of water, released by 21st century fox inc.'s foxa, -0.09% independent film division fox searchlight, fell just shy of tying la la land and titanic for the most oscar nominations ever at 14.\n\ndon't miss:the complete list of oscar nominations\n\nsee also:how 'the shape of water' was made for just $20 million\n\nthe film garnered top nominations for best picture, best actress (sally hawkins), best director (del toro) and best supporting actor (richard jenkins).\n\nwill oscars gaffe trigger changes next year?\n\nthree billboards outside ebbing, missouri, also from fox searchlight, had the second most nominations at nine, and warner bros.'s us:twx dunkirk earned seven nominations. both were nominated for best picture.\n\nthe jordan peele directed thriller get out, distributed by comcast corp.'s cmcsa, -2.83% universal pictures, and a24's lady bird, helmed by greta gerwig, earned somewhat surprising best picture and best director nominations.\n\nboth films, made on shoestring budgets, were breakthroughs at the box office. get out was released in february 2017 and earned $175.7 million in the u.s. on a budget of $4.5 million. lady bird is a24's highest-grossing film to date, pulling in $39.1 million on a $10 million budget. a24 is one of hollywood's leading independent studios. last year's best picture-winner, moonlight, was previously a24's highest-grossing film.\n\ncheck out:moviepass reveals its true ambitions at sundance\n\nget out and lady bird were also critical darlings—lady bird won the golden globe for best comedy—but some thought the films may be too small and their directors too new for both to garner academy nominations.\n\nbut the academy has, in the last couple of years, made an effort to make its membership younger, more female and to include more minorities. in 2016 the los angeles times reported that academy voters were 91% white and 76% male.\n\ngerwig is just the fifth woman to be nominated in the best director category, and peele is the fifth african american to be nominated in the same category—there's never been a black female best director nominee.\n\nif gerwig were to win, she would be the second woman in oscar history to win the best director title, and peele would be the first african american.\n\nread:women in hollywood are fighting to change the culture of sexual harassment\n\nsee also:warner bros. film arm undergoes major executive reorganization\n\ndel toro, who won the golden globe for best director, has been viewed as somewhat of a favorite to win the award. he would be the third mexican-born filmmaker to win best director, joining friends alfonso cuaron and alejandro inarritu.
a new practice in the credit card industry is making signing up for a credit card for the first time a little bit harder.\n\ndiscover dfs, -3.43% is the latest credit card company to stop allowing new credit card applicants to do so with the help of a cosigner. (for those with existing accounts, there will be no change, but as of december 2016, this practice won't be allowed for new applicants, a spokesman for discover said.)\n\nmany other banks and card issuers had already discontinued the practice, making the ability to sign up with a cosigner rare.\n\na cosigner can help someone with a lower credit score be approved for a card; both the cosigner and the applicant become equally responsible for paying the account's bill. failing to pay the bill can also hurt both parties' credit.\n\nchase jpm, +1.65% stopped allowing new applicants to use cosigners in 2013, and citi c, +0.33% hasn't allowed cosigners for more than a decade. american express axp, -1.45% also doesn't allow cosigners.\n\neverybody's chasing tesla for electric cars at ces\n\ndiscover didn't provide much detail on why the company is no longer allowing cosigners (a spokesman said only that there are operational and infrastructure constraints with joint accounts and declined to elaborate).\n\na possible reason: if a credit-card bill isn't paid, having multiple account holders to track down may be harder for banks and card issuers than having just one, said matt schulz, a senior industry analyst for creditcards.com.\n\nthe company still allows authorized users on its accounts, as do chase, citi and american express. unlike a cosigner, an authorized user of an account isn't liable for paying his or her bill; that responsibility falls to the primary account holder.\n\nbank of america bac, +2.61% , wells fargo wfc, +2.43% and u.s. bank usb, +3.27% still allow cosigners.\n\ndiscontinuing the practice of allowing cosigners isn't good news for consumers in many cases, credit card experts have said.\n\nallowing authorized users does provide some of the conveniences that allowing a cosigner does, since it gives another person the ability to spend on the same credit account. however, while opening one's own account alone or with a cosigner helps an individual build credit, an authorized user doesn't build as much, ethan dornhelm, the senior director of scores and analytics at fair isaac corporation (fico) previously told marketwatch.\n\nadding someone won't hurt, he said, it's just not likely to make nearly as substantive a difference.\n\n(plus, not every card issuer reports authorized users' activity to credit bureaus, according to discover's website. and those that do may not report it in exactly the same way.)\n\nditching cosigners may also be detrimental for couples attempting to split all finances equally, since the authorized user relationship (which many couples turn to instead) gives one party more power and responsibility, said sean mcquay, a credit card expert at the personal-finance company nerdwallet.\n\nthe authorized user is more of a parent/child relationship, he said; even if one partner allows the other to be an authorized user, one person is still the primary account holder, which can be detrimental to building confidence and management skills for the other party, mcquay said.\n\nplus, as an authorized user, a partner in theory would be able to run up a credit card bill and then accept no responsibility for paying it since his or her credit score would remain unaffected, schulz said.\n\non the other hand, parents or others who would rather not be cosigners on accounts may view the discontinued practice as a good thing, schulz said; cosigners are taking the risk that the applicant they are cosigning for will pay his or her bill responsibly, as to not damage the co-signer's credit. eliminating the option of cosigners may take away that risk and responsibility.\n\nthere are other ways for those with thin credit histories to build credit, mcquay and schulz said.\n\nthe credit card act, which u.s. president barack obama signed into law in 2009, made it more difficult for consumers under age 21 to get credit cards; they either needed a cosigner or proof of income.\n\nsecured credit cards are a good option instead of cosigned accounts because they work similarly to debit cards, requiring an initial deposit and not allowing the user to go over that limit. but unlike debit cards, use is reported to credit reporting agencies and allows the user to build credit.\n\nthis should be a short-term option, though, schulz said; credit utilization ratio, or the amount of one's available credit that is used, also is a component of credit scoring. because the utilization of secured cards tends to be high, consumers should strive to use them for about nine months to a year and then upgrade to a traditional credit card with more desirable terms, he said.\n\nin addition to bank of america and u.s. bank, there may also be local banks or credit unions that still offer the option of a cosigner, mcquay said, so consumers may benefit from looking there.\n\nmost important, consumers should pay their bills (whether they are for a secured credit card or not) on time and in full.\n\nthe key to credit is to only spend money you have. in essence, treat your credit cards just like cash or a debit card, sandra bernardo, the credit agency experian's manager of consumer education previously told marketwatch.

wearable fitness trackers such as fitbit that use biometric analytics have had their day in the sun.\n\nthe next big thing could be biometric analytics for art and entertainment. that's where founder and chief executive of lightwave, a san francisco-based biometric technology company, is hoping to set her company apart from the rest.\n\nrana june has a passion for the arts and entertainment. her company, lightwave, gathers data on individual physical and emotional reactions to art, entertainment, music and sporting events, and now, film. lightwave struck a partnership deal with 20th century fox foxa, +1.35% fox, +1.46% to do an industry-first biometric analysis of the audience at a pre-screening of oscar-hopeful the revenant.\n\npeople think about data as the most unsexy thing in the world, which i get; it's used to judge us, she said. but i think the next wave of art is based in data. i think we can use it in service of art, not in spite of art.\n\nfilm clip: 'the revenant'\n\ngathering the data is as simple as having the audience agree to wear a wristband tracking their physical reactions while watching a movie. from that, june said, her team is able to discern whether a plotline resonates with the audience, whether a joke lands, or what happens to the audience during an intense bear attack on screen. it's like applied neuroscience, she said, but without the lab and the wires.\n\nlightwave measured heart rates, electrodermal activity (the nervous system) and how audience members moved during the film, and in real time analyzed the intensity of viewers' emotional reactions and overall viewing experience.\n\nif you're a studio, you're always trying to gauge the audience's connection with a film, june said.\n\nthe company explains it this way: there's an alarm that the human body activates when something shocking or unexpected occurs; in lay terms, the response is often called fight or flight. an intense moment in the film will correspond to changes in heart rate readings, coupled with diminished motion readings and increased skin conductance responses from the audience. by combining the indicators, lightwave can present a picture of a viewer's experience for any specific point in time in the film.\n\nentertainment is a linear experience, june said, but what if your physical experience changed the content? imagine you're watching a scary movie in virtual reality, and as your heart beats faster as you get more scared, the intensity of the film changes. the possibility of making that happen, she said, is one of the reasons she gets up in the morning.\n\nit could be happening today, she said. it comes down to who are the studios that can see this change coming. we're creating so much data, it's just people don't really know what to do with it yet.\n\ncheck out:zebra tracking technology may change how nfl fans see the game\n\njune said her intention is that lightwave's abilities would be incorporated into editing software like apple inc.'s aapl, -1.92% final cut pro.\n\nthe revenant earned 12 oscar nominations, including best director for alejandro iñárritu, best actor for leonardo dicaprio and best picture, after winning three golden globes in the same categories.

and just like that, the bulls came charging back.\n\nall it took was one stellar economic data point to change the stock market's mood and punt the indexes higher. but even before the robust jobs numbers exorcised the demons, strategists had started to predict that the market is gearing up for a comeback given the depth of the recent selloff.\n\nwe expect a bear market rally to develop over the coming weeks, and we expect a new bull market to develop over the coming months to quarters, said ari wald, a technical analyst at oppenheimer & co.\n\nwald believes the recent spate of weakness is the cyclical bear market waking up in the midst of a secular bull market and suggested that the selling pressure will soon work itself out.\n\noppenheimer & co.\n\non average, the index drops 20% over an 8-month period and retraces 50% of the prior advance, he said. this is why we believe the s&p 500 has endured the bulk of the magnitude and now requires time to base.\n\nthe strategist forecast the s&p 500 to trade in a range of 2,375 to 2,700 for 2019.\n\nthe stock market closed out the first week of 2019 on a positive note, with the s&p 500 spx, -0.16% rising 1.9%, the dow jones industrial average djia, -0.39% climbing 1.6% and the nasdaq comp, +0.09% rallying 2.3%, thanks to the strong jobs data which assuaged concerns of a slowdown in the u.s. economy and laid to rest fears about a looming recession.\n\ntobias levkovich, chief u.s. equity strategist at citi, who trimmed his 2019 target for the s&p 500 to 2,850 from 3,000, believes this is a good time to jump back into the market, in part given that stocks have the potential to rise 16% over the next 12 months on valuations alone.\n\nsince the s&p 500's record high in september, the large-cap index has tumbled double digits, making stocks much more affordable.\n\nnothing is guaranteed, but the data suggest that we should be buying into current weakness, he said.\n\naside from affordability, there are other encouraging signs, according to strategists at bank of america merrill lynch.\n\nthe bank's bull & bear indicator fell to 1.8, indicating extreme bear, triggering a buy signal for risky assets like stocks for the first time since june 2016 when markets were battered by brexit headlines.\n\nbank of america merrill lynch\n\nhistorically, global stocks rose 6.1% in the three months following each of the buy signals triggered going back to 2000.\n\nthe next two critical signs to watch for are policy panic and a deterioration in profit expectations from the current 7.5% growth.\n\ntommy ricketts, investment strategist at bank of america merrill lynch, characterized policy panic as when central banks, especially the federal reserve, are unnerved enough by the financial markets to abandon their hawkish stance.\n\nmarkets require a dovish pause at the very least, he said.\n\nbank of america merrill lynch\n\nthat is a bold call to make in light of the blowout jobs report which has again raised expectations for the central bank to follow through on its interest-rate-hike agenda even as chairman jerome powell reiterated friday that the fed will remain flexible.\n\nread: jobs report shows the fed is not done raising interest rates as market prices out a cut\n\nmeanwhile, ricketts thinks earnings outlooks still remain too lofty.\n\nwe expect profit expectations to reset to 0-5% for 2019 driven by weak asian exports, yield curve inversion, contracting monetary supply, he said.\n\nfor the fourth quarter, analysts have lowered their s&p 500 earnings estimate by 3.8% to $40.93 a share, significantly above the average cut of 3.1% over the past five years, according to john butters, senior earnings analyst at factset.\n\nfourth-quarter earnings are expected to start trickling in next week with bed, bath & beyond inc. bbby, -4.57% , target corp. tgt, -0.49% , lennar corp. len, -1.49% , and kb home kbh, -0.59% in the spotlight.\n\non the economic front, investors will have a slew of data to digest including the december ism nonmanufacturing index, weekly jobless claims and the consumer price index.\n\n-—chris matthews contributed to this report
the past decade was about the rise of digital health technology and patient empowerment. the next decade will be about artificial intelligence, the use of health sensors and the so-called internet of healthy things and how it could improve millions of lives.\n\nthe cultural transformation of health care we call digital health has been changing the hierarchy in care into an equal-level partnership between patients and physicians as 21st century technologies have started breaking down the ivory tower of medicine. but these milestones are nothing compared with what is about to become reality.\n\nwith advancements in exoskeleton technology, ai's ever-increasing importance in health care, and technologies like 5g and quantum computing soon going mainstream, there's much to be excited about.\n\nhere are the five biggest themes for health and medicine for the next 10 years.\n\nartificial intelligence in medicine\n\ndevelopments in artificial intelligence will dominate the next decade. machine learning is a method for creating artificial narrow intelligence — narrow refers to doing one task extremely well — and a field of computer science that enables computers to learn without being explicitly programmed, building on top of computational statistics and data mining. the field has different types: it could be supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised or reinforcement learning, among others. it has an unprecedented potential to transform health-care processes and medical tasks in the future — and it has already started its invisible revolution.\n\nif we consider how alphago, the ai developed by google's deepmind lab, beat world champion lee sedol at the classic chinese game go by coming up with inventive moves that took experts by surprise, we can get a glimpse at what ai can hold for health care. such moves were made possible by the combination of neural networks and reinforcement learning that this ai uses. this enabled the software to operate without the restrictions of human cognitive limitations, devise its own strategy and output decisions that baffled experts.\n\nwe can expect to see the same surprises in medical settings. imagine new drugs designed by such algorithms; high-level analysis of tens of millions of studies for a diagnosis; or drug combinations nobody has thought of before. when applied to medicine, an algorithm trained via reinforcement learning could discover treatments and cures for conditions when human medical professionals could not. cracking the reasoning behind such unconventional and novel approaches will herald the true era of art in medicine.\n\nin global health, for example, an algorithm can provide a reliable map of future measles outbreak hot spots. it uses statistics on measles vaccination rates and disease outbreaks from the centers for disease control and prevention, as well as non-traditional health data, including social media and a huge range of medical records. that's just one example, but the field is already buzzing with smart algorithms that can facilitate the search for new drug targets; improve the speed of clinical trials or spot tumors on computed tomography (ct) scans.\n\nhowever, while experts believe that ai will not replace medical professionals, it also seems true that medical professionals who use ai will replace those who don't.\n\na myriad of health sensors\n\nmedical technology went through an amazing development in the 2010s, and there's now no single square centimeter of the human body without quantifiable data. for example, alivecor's kardia and apple watch measure electrocardiogram and detect atrial fibrillation with high sensitivity. the eko core digital stethoscope records heart and lung sounds as a digital stethoscope, while blood pressure is monitored with the omron blood pressure smartwatch, the mocacare pocket sensor, and blood pressure cuff, the ihealth clear, the skeeper, a pocket cardiologist, or the withings blood pressure monitor, and of course, dozens of traditional blood pressure cuffs.\n\nthere are dozens of health trackers for respiration, sleep, and, of course, movement. and while researchers can't decipher your dreams yet — they are working on it, alongside figuring out all kinds of brain activity. for example, through eeg. that's a method that records electrical activity in the brain using electrodes attached externally to the scalp. the neurosky biosensor and the muse headband use it to understand the mind better and in the latter case allow for more effective meditation. as you see, there's not much left unmeasured in your body — and it will even intensify in the future. for example, we expect digital tattoos to become commercially available within five years, which will not only measure the majority of the above-mentioned vital signs, but they will do so continuously. these tiny sensors will notify us when something is about to go wrong and we will need medical advice or intervention.\n\nmoreover, with developments in 3-d printing as well as circuit-printing technologies, flexible electronics and materials, applying so-called digital tattoos or electronic tattoos on the skin for some days or even weeks became possible.\n\nmade of flexible, waterproof materials impervious to stretching and twisting coupled with tiny electrodes, digital tattoos are able to record and transmit information about the wearer to smartphones or other connected devices. while these are only in use in research projects, they could allow health-care experts to monitor and diagnose critical health conditions such as heart arrhythmia, heart activities of premature babies, sleep disorders and brain activities noninvasively. moreover, by tracking vital signs 24 hours a day, without the need for a charger, it is especially suited for following patients with high risk of stroke, for example. although we are not there yet, there are certain promising solutions on the market such as mc10's biostamprc sensor.\n\nquantum computing puts medical decision-making on a new level\n\nin 2019, google claimed quantum supremacy and made the cover of nature magazine. one example of how this technology will have a major impact on the health-care sector is quantum computing taking medical decision-making to a whole new level and even augmenting it with special skills. what if such computers could offer perfect decision support for doctors? they could skim through all the studies at once, they could find correlations and causations that the human eye would never find, and they might stumble upon diagnoses or treatment options that doctors could have never figured out by themselves.\n\nat the very endpoint of this development, quantum computers could create an elevated version of pubmed, where information would reside in the system but not in the traditional written form — it would reside in qubits of data as no one except the computer would read the studies anymore.\n\nin addition, the applications of quantum computing to health care are manifold, ranging from much faster drug design to quicker and cheaper dna sequencing and analysis to reinforced security over personal medical data. while the technology does hold such promises, we still have to be patient before practical solutions can be implemented in medicine. however, with continued progress in this area, even though quantum computing has been something from a science fiction novel, this decade will see the first such computer used in the clinical practice too.\n\nchatbots as the first line of care\n\nsymptom checkers that function on the same principle as chatbots are already available, free of charge. however, these rely on the user inputting symptoms and complaints manually. we yearn for one that can make predictions and suggestions based on a user's data, like sleep tracking, heart rate and activity collected via wearables. with such features, those bots can help users make healthier choices without having to drag themselves to their doctor.\n\nthere was a black mirror episode titled rachel, jack, and ashley too that featured an incredibly smart and emotional chatbot that had human-like conversations with the character. think about having a similar personalized chatbot that's accessible via your smart device and with additional health and lifestyle features. this chatty virtual being can wake you up at the appropriate time based on your sleep pattern and advise you to take your antihistamines as the pollen concentration is particularly high during your commute that day, before you even get out of bed. it can even recommend what you should consume for each meal based on your nutrigenomic profile. it could find the best words for you to motivate you to go to the gym. it could find the best jokes that help you get into a good mood. but would you rather bend to the rules of an ai, essentially forgoing your freedom of choice, than experience life based more on your own will?\n\n5g serving the whole ecosystem of digital health\n\n5g networks will enable data to be downloaded at more than 1 gigabit per second, allowing for downloads 10 to 100 times faster than the currently available 4g services. 4g networks can only serve around a thousand devices within a square kilometer, while 5g can serve a million. it will make the era of the internet of things (iot) possible by connecting a huge amount of health trackers with laptops, smartphones and many more digital devices. there will be no connection issues or latency, as the trackers will be able to work in harmony while getting the most out of our data.\n\nsuch a boost will allow for more reliable communication, which is a must in areas like telesurgery, remote consultation and remote monitoring. with bigger bandwidth and faster connection, there might be a boost in wearables as health iot networks become more stable and reliable, and further help with patient engagement in relation to their health.\n\nmajor applications of 5g are expected to be apparent starting in 2021.\n\ndr. bertalan mesko, ph.d., is the medical futurist and director of the medical futurist institute, analyzing how science fiction technologies can become reality in medicine and healthcare. as a geek physician with a ph.d. in genomics, he is a keynote speaker and an

washington — u.s. treasury secretary steven mnuchin, under fire from democratic lawmakers, defended the proposed removal of russian aluminum behemoth united co. rusal from the administration's blacklist as evidence of a successful sanctions strategy.\n\nmnuchin briefed house lawmakers on thursday on the treasury department's plan to delist rusal and two other companies owned by oleg deripaska, an ally of russian president vladimir putin. deripaska and, subsequently, his companies, were sanctioned last april in response to moscow's 2016 election interference and involvement in wars in ukraine and syria.
house republicans dropped plans tuesday to place the independent office of congressional ethics under the oversight of lawmakers, following an outpouring of criticism including from president-elect donald trump. the house of representatives was due to vote on the change later tuesday. earlier tuesday, trump questioned why republicans were making the change their number one act and priority and said tax reform and health care were more important.
new york gov. andrew cuomo's plan to legalize cannabis for adult recreational use in the empire state is a milestone in the push toward full legalization of the substance in the u.s., experts said wednesday.\n\ncuomo said tuesday in his state of the state speech that he's including in his budget for the current fiscal year a plan to make cannabis legal for adults over the age of 21. the governor is aiming to create a legal industry that would include minority- and women-owned businesses and create jobs in some of the more economically deprived parts of the state. ten states have so far legalized cannabis for recreational use, while another 33 have legalized medical cannabis.\n\nlegalize adult-use cannabis, he said. stop the disproportionate impact on communities of color. and let's create an industry that empowers the poor communities that paid the price and not the rich corporations who come in to make a profit.\n\nsmoke wallin, president of california-based cannabis company vertical cos., said the move is a significant step forward in the mainstreaming of the industry.\n\nalthough the fourth most populous state, after california, new york represents the most influential market for consumers and the steady march toward national normalization, he said. we expect the continued state by state liberalization of cannabis use to continue to put pressure on the federal government.\n\nread now:marijuana ipos in 2019: these companies could be the next hot pot stocks\n\nrob dipisa, co-chair of the cannabis law group at law firm cole schotz, agreed, noting new york's influential role in many industries, from fashion to business to entertainment. this will change everything, dipisa said. once new york enters the market, we'll see bright young people come in and challenge the industry.\n\ncuomo is expecting to generate about $300 million in annual tax revenue from the new business, although he will include an option for counties to opt out of legal sales, if they choose. funds raised would be used to finance a state traffic-safety committee, for small-business development, and for substance-abuse services and other programs.\n\nthe governor is proposing to impose a 20% state tax and 2% county tax on transfers of cannabis from wholesalers to retailers, along with a $1-per-gram tax on dry flower for growers and a 25-cents-per-gram tax on trim.\n\nthat may put a steep burden on companies operating at the wholesale level, said dipisa, while cuomo's intention to include unionized labor in the new industry is a worthy goal that may add still further costs.\n\nhaving seen what we have on the west coast, when these markets come on line, there is typically high demand at the start, followed by oversaturation that can result in way more cannabis than is needed — and so the price falls, he said.\n\nin 2015 and 2016, for example, the wholesale price of a pound of cannabis in west coast states that have legalized recreational cannabis was above $2,000. the comparable price fell below $400 last summer in oregon, thanks to oversupply, putting pressure on growers.\n\ndon't miss:a guide to pot stocks: what you need to know to invest in cannabis companies\n\nplus:for complete marketwatch coverage of the cannabis industry, click here\n\nthe other challenges include that cannabis companies need to be well-capitalized but are unable to access capital in the form of capital markets or bank loans. cannabis is still illegal at the federal level, where it is classified as a schedule i drug, putting it in the same class as heroin and cocaine. as long as the federal prohibition is in place, companies can't have bank accounts at federally insured institutions, and they can't sell product across state lines.\n\nsee now:want to be the only 'pot' stock in canada? there's a lottery for that\n\nthat's the achilles' heel in this business; normally, if you have a surplus or price plummets, you just ship it to another state, but here you don't have that option, said dipisa.\n\nvertical's wallin said that cuomo's revenue projection is conservative and that he would expect revenue from a city as densely populated as new york to be closer to $1 billion, upon full rollout.\n\nin case you missed it:the collapse of this cannabis stock offers a valuable lesson to every investor\n\n\n\ngiven that the much smaller state of colorado is generating several hundred million [dollars] annually, it seems reasonable, he said.

carl icahn keeps pushing american international group inc. to break up, with the activist investor issuing another open letter to the insurer tuesday, saying anything less would cause management to lose all credibility.\n\nicahn made his letter to aig's aig, +2.45% board of directors public through a tweet, as he looked to force the company's hand ahead of a strategic update next week.\n\nin the wake of a recent shareholder poll, metlife inc.'s met, +3.81% breakup announcement and direct conversations with shareholders, aig needs to become a pure-play property and casualty insurer by committing to sell, spin off or separate non-core operations to meet the minimum expectations of investors, icahn wrote.\n\na breakup would allow aig to apply to lose government designation as a systemically important financial institution--or too big to fail—which carries with it some burdensome regulatory requirements, said the letter. read more about metlife's de-sifi plan.\n\naig's response: aig maintains an active dialogue with shareholders, including carl icahn. as previously announced, on january 26, aig will provide an update on its strategy and its proactive plan to drive shareholder value.\n\nbut icahn wrote that he suspects the company will disappoint investors by announcing only incremental changes to its strategy, such as small-scale asset sales and cost-cutting.\n\nif this occurs then the little credibility management now has will be lost, icahn wrote. it is my hope that after the events outlined above and in light of management's poor performance over the last several years, particularly in the property & casualty (p&c) segment, the board will take matters into its own hands if management still resists drastic change.\n\nin november, icahn wrote a public letter to aig suggesting the company was too big to succeed, and that it should separate into three public companies to shrink itself below the threshold of an sifi designation. as of oct. 28, icahn said he owned over 42 million shares of aig, making him one of the insurer's largest shareholders.
money is money, whether it's cash in our hands, plastic cards at checkout counters or encrypted bits of data coursing between computers on the internet.\n\nbut our brains don't view all money as equal, thanks to what behavioral economists call cognitive biases:\n\nwe spend cash more carefully than plastic.\n\nwe regard tax refunds as a windfall rather than a return of what we earned.\n\nwe'd rather have money now than more money later.\n\nsometimes our illusions about money can be harnessed for good. the save more tomorrow program, created by economists richard h. thaler and shlomo benartzi, has people commit to increasing their retirement contributions starting one year in the future. in the economists' initial study, workers who agreed to save future dollars nearly quadrupled their savings rate in four years.\n\ntoo often, though, our money illusions work against us. when we treat some forms of money as less real than others, it can really cost us. for example:\n\nfinancing fun\n\ntimeshares and recreational vehicles often are pitched as a way to save on future vacations. anyone who has owned either knows that's not necessarily true. first-time rv buyers, for example, often underestimate the costs of maintaining, repairing and fueling their rigs. timeshare newbies can be gobsmacked by rising annual fees, the hassles of trading their units and the difficulty of shedding unwanted timeshares.\n\nthe math really turns sour when either purchase is financed. developer financing for timeshares typically carries interest rates of 15% or more. rv loan rates can be lower, but loans can stretch 10 to 20 years, inflating the cost of the purchase by 20% to 50%.\n\nyou shouldn't borrow money to finance luxuries, and that includes vacations. if you're determined to buy, pay cash for secondhand versions.\n\na brand-new 2017 fleetwood storm rv costs six figures; we picked up a 1998 model with less than 7,500 miles on it a few years ago for $15,000. similarly, used timeshares sell on the secondary market for as little as a penny, although higher-end locations may cost a few thousand dollars, versus an average of $22,240 for a timeshare bought retail.\n\nforeign currency\n\nwe loosen the purse strings on vacation because we want to relax and not stress over every purchase. as a result, six out of 10 people overspend their summer vacation budgets, according to a survey last year for citi thankyou premier card. add in confusion about exchange rates, and it can feel like the foreign currency in your hand is just play money.\n\nways to keep it real: check exchange rates before you leave, so you have a general idea of what your dollars should be worth, then use a calculator or a currency exchange app to check prices on the fly. be smart about where you exchange currency; some are better deals than others. use a credit card that charges no foreign transaction fees.\n\nhealth care costs\n\nhigh-deductible insurance plans are supposed to make us more careful about our health care spending, because we have to shell out more of our own money before insurance takes over.\n\nit's hard to be careful, though, when it's difficult or impossible to predict what that care will ultimately cost. medical providers charge wildly different amounts for the same treatments, and what they charge may be wildly different from what they'll actually accept. (witness the recent $16,800 bill we got for a colonoscopy that insurance finally settled, in full, for $350.) what high-deductible plans can do is cause people to put off seeing the doctor, which ultimately can result in much bigger bills for treatment.\n\nall kinds of brain fails are to blame for this: status quo bias (we want to keep the money in our pockets), loss aversion (it can be painful to reduce our lifestyle, or spend less on stuff we want, because of health care costs) and hyperbolic discounting — the benefit of keeping our cash seems much greater than the possible future benefit of good health.\n\nthe solution is to use mental accounting, another thinking flaw, to your advantage. if you opt for a high-deductible plan, make sure that you keep enough cash earmarked in savings to cover that deductible and that you use it to stay current on your health care.\n\nwe may not be able to change the ways our brains are wired, but we don't have to let that wiring cause us to make stupid decisions about money.\n\nmore from nerdwallet:
speaker of the house paul ryan is proposing a big change to medicare as part of the broad-ranging better way plan. under the current medicare program, the government provides health insurance for people 65 and over and adults with disabilities. under the better way plan, the government would provide a voucher, and the elderly and disabled would select a plan from a private insurer. speaker ryan argues that this change will help make the medicare program more fiscally stable.\n\nbut as melissa mcinerney, a tufts university professor who studies the medicare program, pointed out to me: medicare spending grows more slowly than private insurance spending (see figure 1).\n\nslower growth for medicare is not a new phenomenon. between 1988 and 2015, private insurers experienced average annual increases in spending per enrollee of 7%, while annual increases in medicare spending per enrollee averaged 5.6% (see figure 2). and medicare's performance has been even better recently. since 2009, the rate of growth for medicare has been less than half of that for private insurers (4.1% per year for private insurers versus 1.8% per year for medicare).\n\nmedicare's lower growth rate is really remarkable for two reasons. first, the numbers include the big increase in medicare spending in 2006 due to the introduction of the prescription drug program (medicare part d). second, the populations that medicare covers — people over 65 and individuals with disabilities — have significant health care needs compared to the population covered by private insurance. yet, spending growth among private insurers has significantly exceeded that in the medicare program.\n\ncan wall street close this gender gap?\n\nif the annual percentage increase in costs for private insurers — who cover a population with fewer health care needs — already outpaces medicare spending growth, their costs are likely to rise significantly faster when they cover a costlier population. under the voucher plan, the government can keep its costs low by limiting the size of the voucher, but that strategy would only lead to an enormous financial burden falling on vulnerable elderly and disabled individuals.\n\nthe only way to win the health insurance game is to get the costs of health care under control, and the numbers say that medicare is a much more effective mechanism than private insurance. people who care about cost control should move cautiously when messing with medicare.

if the s&p 500 drops below 2,100 by the end of next year, one wall street punter will face a costly — and now, high-profile — reckoning.\n\naccording to trade alert data cited by reuters, an anonymous trader made waves in the options market on monday by selling 19,000 put options on the s&p 500 spx, -0.16% , which obligates him or her to buy the market benchmark if it drops 22% by december 18, 2020.
the big story for investors in 2017 was the broad-based rally in stocks. simply by owning equities of any shape or size, you likely made out very nicely.\n\ndomestic large-cap stocks were up about 20% as measured by the s&p 500 spx, -1.48% . other markets did even better, with broad global funds like the vanguard total international etf vxus, -1.17% up about 25% and the popular ishares ftse/xinhua china 25 index etf fxi, -0.89% up about 37%.\n\nand if you didn't like stocks there was always bitcoin btcusd, +0.94% . the cryptocurrency soared a staggering 15-fold over 2017.\n\namid this risk-on rally, many investors likely overlooked gold us:gcg8.\n\nhowever, 2018 is increasingly shaping up to look like a breakout year for the precious metal. here's why:\n\na new floor: from a technical perspective, gold hasn't looked this good in a long time. the precious metal has touched $1,350 an ounce a few times over the past few years and has been pretty stable between $1,200 and $1,250 since the last test of those highs back in september. we've yet to break out to the upside, but a clear pattern of higher lows is an incredibly encouraging sign that we've found a new floor for prices. and with recent moves up through the important round number of $1,300, there's a good chance we keep powering higher.\n\nrisk factors investors should look out for in 2018\n\nshort-term momentum: beyond this base, there's encouraging momentum. gold prices gld, -0.58% are up roughly 6% in the last six months, which underperforms a gain of 11% for the s&p 500 but is still noteworthy. and since rolling back in early december, gold has surged more than 5% in just a few weeks while the s&p has barely budged.\n\nasset rotation: many stock-market investors are still optimistic after a great run in 2017, but it's undeniable that many traders are ready for what's next now that tax reform is priced in and the big run for equities looks long in the tooth. it's natural for the fast money to look for greener pastures when we've had a good run, and the turn of the year is a great excuse to move out of stocks and into something else.\n\nstrong global demand: aside from the charts and asset rotation, there is structural demand that will provide a lift for gold. for starters, look at india, where gold imports surged an amazing 67% in 2017. the nation is the no. 2 consumer gold market in the world behind china, so that's an encouraging sign of retail demand. as for china, demand for gold bars through november was up 40% from a year earlier, according to gold portal kitco. that speaks to strong momentum.\n\nweak production: across 2017, gold mining gdx, -1.72% was incredibly anemic, prompting a report from anz that noted gold output was at its lowest point since the financial crisis, with risks only getting greater. there are a host of factors at play, from cash-strapped companies like freeport mcmoran fcx, -1.91% closing underperforming sites to new regulatory policies for miners in indonesia and south africa. but the collective result is less gold coming out of the ground, which should benefit gold investors in 2018.\n\neverything we thought about millennials' money habits was wrong\n\nsoft dollar: there's an inverse relationship between the strength of commodity prices and u.s. currency, since these raw materials are priced in dollars. however, the trend lately is not for a strong dollar but a weak one. in fact, the u.s. dollar index dxy, -0.08% just hit a three-month low. and this after the benchmark measure for the dollar declined almost 10% during 2017. this currency dynamic creates yet an additional tailwind for gold prices.\n\ncryptocurrencies can't compete: lest you think the crypto craze sapped demand for gold, it's important to remember that the nice appreciation for the precious metal in 2017 came even amid bitcoin's big run. this shows resilience even as other alternative assets gain investor attention. furthermore, even after the cboe launched bitcoin futures in late 2017, goldman sachs reported no discernible outflow of gold as traders and institutional investors were given another fashionable way to play the crypto market. gold is a haven for a reason, and no fashionable asset craze can change that.
the richest people on the planet added fewer members to their exclusive club last year, while some were more fortunate. the reason? they were more likely to invest in stocks in their native countries.\n\nthe world's high net worth (hnw) individuals — a net worth of between $1 million and $30 million in assets — grew by just 1.9% to 22.4 million people in 2018, according to data released last month by global wealth consultancy wealth-x. their combined wealth also grew by 1.8% to $61.3 trillion, below the rate of global economic growth of approximately 3.7% last year.\n\nasia's high net worth population saw its wealth grow by less than 1% in 2018 (0.6% and 0.3%, respectively). while asia's gross domestic product grew by more than 8% in 2018, its stock markets plunged by more than 11% last year, wealth-x said. this competing effect has resulted in almost no change in the hnw population and its wealth in the region, it added.\n\ndon't miss: 10 things billionaires won't tell you\n\nin latin america and the caribbean, africa and the pacific, the number of hnw individuals shrank in 2018 (down by 7.6%, 2.5% and 1.9%, respectively) and their wealth also declined last year by similar rates. while these regions saw gdp expansion in 2018 — except latin america and the caribbean — their stock markets were among the worst performers during the year, wealth-x said.\n\nthere were some exceptions. backed by strong gdp growth and relatively more stable equity markets compared with other regions, europe, the middle east and north america saw positive growth in their high net worth populations in 2018 (4.5%, 3.1% and 2.1%, respectively), the report added. but it described that level of growth as medium to low for that demographic.\n\ndon't miss:this city has the most ultra-rich residents in the world\n\nwealth-x uses a proprietary database of hnw individuals. the database provides insights into their financial assets, career history, known associates and affiliations, family background, education, philanthropic endeavors, hobbies, interests, real estate holdings and business dealings. their assets include both privately and publicly held businesses and investible assets.\n\nasia's rich are expected to grow in the medium term. there are now as many hnws in asia as in europe, and wealth-x expects asia to be the fastest-growing hnw region over the next five years, the report added. building on their existing financial expertise, hong kong and singapore are likely to remain key centers but other markets are developing or importing services to serve hnws locally.\n\ndon't miss:the richest 1% are on track to control two-thirds of the world's wealth by 2030\n\nthe hnw population exhibits a more equitable gender split than the ultra-high net worth (uhnw) population — those with assets worth $30 million or more — but both demographics remains heavily male dominated. the proportion of hnw women hit 16% in 2018, after rising gradually in recent years, while the percentage of ultra-wealthy women was just under 14%.\n\nas millions of americans struggle to make ends meet, however, compensation for executives has surged. pay ratios of fortune 500 company ceos to their employees range from 2 to 1 to nearly 5,000 to 1, according to a 2018 report by the staff of keith ellison when he was the democratic congressman for minnesota; ellison is now the attorney general-elect of minnesota.
square inc. got its start by enabling small businesses to accept credit cards in their stores, but the payment processor is now expanding its presence in e-commerce and mobile transactions.\n\nthe company announced wednesday that it had created a software development kit, or sdk, that will allow businesses to take in-app payments using square's sq, -3.13% technology.\n\nthe move is part of square's efforts to become a player in omnichannel commerce, a hot trend among retailers and payments companies. financial technology firms see growing value in providing all-in-one solutions to businesses, so that users can stick with the same provider for in-store payments as for online and mobile payments.\n\ndon't miss: how automated digital payroll will change the way employees get paid\n\ncarl perry, who leads square's developer platform, said that the mobile-payment technology will allow for a frictionless experience across channels. he argued that businesses will be able to deliver better customer service and acknowledge their loyalty members if they can recognize that the person who made a purchase on their mobile app is the same one who comes into the store.\n\nsquare bought weebly, a website-creation platform, back in may, giving the company a foothold in web commerce. fellow fintech company paypal holdings inc. pypl, -0.27% , which is rooted in online payments, is looking to bolster its omnichannel offerings as well, by moving in the other direction: paypal in september purchased izettle, a company that makes point-of-sale products and card readers. paypal-owned braintree also facilitates mobile payments, as does rival stripe inc.\n\nread: square launches new product for merchants who won't give up on terminals\n\nfor square, the addition of an in-app option helps make the platform more attractive to larger sellers, since these businesses are more likely than mom-and-pop shops to have their own apps. moving upmarket has been a key objective for square in recent quarters, and the company has seen some success: in the third quarter, 52% of square's volume came from sellers doing more than $125,000 in annualized gross payment volume, up from 43% a year earlier.
will the media industry fare better in 2016 than it did in 2015, when worry about cord-cutting created almost panic selling in the summer?\n\nindustry analysts said media companies can succeed, as long as they get to grips with certain realities and try to better position themselves for success.\n\nhere are the issues they identify as key for the industry in 2016:\n\npay tv\n\nthere is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding the fate of the traditional pay-tv bundle.\n\nthere are a few glaring issues facing the tv bundle. first, more and more services are popping up to compete in the over-the-top (ott), or online subscription video-on-demand space. this gives customers more options for ditching cable bundles for more affordable services with the content they want most. to boot, these ott platforms are proving they can produce their own quality content: netflix inc. nflx, -2.16% , amazon.com inc.'s amzn, -1.49% prime instant video and hulu—a joint venture of walt disney co. dis, -0.77% , 21st century fox foxa, +1.40% fox, +1.46% and comcast corp. cmcsa, -1.44% —all received golden globe nominations this year.\n\nwedbush analyst james dix wrote in a recent note that the high cost per hour of usage relative to other platforms is a core challenge moving forward, with high sports rights fees being a major driver, but more on that later. dix also pointed out that the push by providers to lure consumers with tv everywhere services, which allow cable subscribers to watch content via the internet on other devices, isn't yet paying off, and he doesn't expect that to change soon.\n\nif media companies are willing and able to offer a wider variety of packages at varying costs and improve service quality, however, the loss of pay-tv subscribers could slow and even stabilize. pacific crest analyst andy hargreaves said 2016 could be the year pay tv figures it out and strikes back. a more stable pay-tv environment and improved ad market could drive modest multiple expansion for most companies in the space, he wrote. and morningstar analyst peter wahlstrom wrote in a recent note that there is still value in the bundle for media companies.\n\nm&a\n\nsolving the problems plaguing pay tv could take more than re-evaluating service offerings. btig analyst rich greenfield said that media companies will need to hunt for acquisition prospects in 2016 to diversify and reduce exposure to the sinking basic cable ship.\n\ncable networks had been earning handsomely for decades due to the pay-tv bundle and a lack of alternatives. but the landscape has shifted and cable networks' earnings have struggled to keep up with expectations. in an ideal world, media companies would begin to snatch up already successful ott services, but greenfield said netflix is now too large—the company announced a 130-country expansion during the 2016 ces conference—and none of hulu's partners would want to give up their shares. the wall street journal reported in november that hulu was reported to be looking to sell a stake of its business to time warner inc.\n\ngreenfield suggested snapchat and twitter inc. twtr, -1.79% could be targets, though their valuations and culture would be tough barriers to break through. he likes videogame companies such as electronic arts inc. ea, -1.97% and call of duty maker activision blizzard inc. atvi, -1.34% as targets.\n\nthese companies are increasingly focused and succeeding on mobile and appear well-positioned for virtual reality in the future, greenfield wrote.\n\nsports rights\n\nsports are expensive to license and air. media companies make substantial investments to acquire the rights to sports leagues because the content has have been the linchpin for the traditional pay tv business model. players such as disney's espn appear keen to stick with that model, which has been a key driver of profitability, even as subscribers for the cable sports network are fleeing by the millions.\n\nespn and time warner inc.'s us:twx tnt signed a nine-year, $24 billion deal with the national basketball association in 2014, which kicks in at the start of the 2016-17 season.\n\ndisney's sports empire has the highest affiliate fees among cable networks, but 2016 may be the year companies admit the cost of sports rights doesn't match subscriber numbers and revenue.\n\nmedia companies that make large investments in sports rights are [going to be] forced to concede to investors that their long-term projections for matching revenues against these rights costs are too rosy, greenfield wrote.\n\nthe result, he said, will be accelerating sports rights amortization, which would reduce near-to-intermediate-term earnings expectations.\n\ntv advertising\n\nthe consensus is that 2016 will be an outlier for advertising revenue, because of political and olympic ad spending. hargreaves reckons that ad revenue should accelerate, with relatively easy year-over-year comparisons for the first two quarters and an expected 1% increase to total ad revenue from the summer olympics. the year-over-year comparisons get more difficult after the first half of the year, however, and he expects live viewership will continue to decline.\n\nthe u.s. presidential election and olympics aside, analysts expect tv advertising to decline. dix at wedbush said the trend of negative-to-flat ad growth for u.s. tv networks continues. newer technology that would help advertisers target and engage with audiences, potentially offering higher ad growth aren't yet ready for scale, dix wrote.\n\nbtig analyst greenfield expects organic tv ad spending will be down in the low-to-mid single digits.\n\nthe box office\n\nthe slate of blockbuster film releases rivals that of 2015. macquarie analyst tim nollen expects viacom inc.-owned us:via paramount pictures and fox to bounce back from their soft box office performances in 2015. paramount, which saw revenue drop 36% compared with 2014, is set to release star trek beyond and another live-action teenage mutant ninja turtles film. the 2014 catalyst film grossed $191.2 million and was the studio's second highest-grossing film that year. fox's revenue fell 27% in 2015, but the studio is banking on kung fu panda 3, deadpool, x-men: apocalypse and an independence day sequel being box office hits.\n\ncheck out:'star wars,' 'jurassic world' push box office to record-breaking year\n\nnollen said 2015's 7% rise in box office revenue proves big movies still matter. also, disney has another marvel and star wars film slated, and time warner-owned warner bros. will release its batman vs. superman and suicide squad.\n\ngreenfield expects government regulators to make a move with regard to film theatrical release windows (the amount of time between theatrical release and home video release). as it stands the release window is around 90 days and there's little wiggle room, and film exhibition chains try to prevent movie studios from shortening windows. an antitrust and collusion investigation could result if more films show up on netflix and amazon without going through major exhibition chains due to release strategies, according to greenfield.
dear moneyist,\n\nmy husband and i grew up dirt poor — i mean he literally had holes in the floor where you could see the dirt. i was fairly better off, my single mother had been expected to marry and have no need for understanding how things like credit worked (her father was a loan officer; it was a different time). at times, we had a little money and, at other times, we ate at the local churches.\n\n 'our only assets are in a sock drawer.' \n\nas a result, my husband and i suffer the same affliction. we were given occasionally some pocket change to buy treats, candy, chips, sodas, etc. this is the only time money would cross our fingertips, and it would be gone within minutes to an hour. bottom line — we only know how to spend and not how to save. we only live for the moment when it comes to finances.\n\n'this has become a serious problem.'\n\n• we are coming up on our 10th wedding anniversary.\n\n• we have an 11-year-old son.\n\n• between us we have 3 teenage children from previous relationships that do not live with us.\n\n• we live in texas.\n\n• we have no life insurance or savings, and we rent the condo we live in.\n\n• our only assets are in a sock drawer.\n\nalso see:my husband is unemployed — we are shamefaced tipping our doormen a pittance\n\nmy husband doesn't believe in credit (it's all made up numbers). he also doesn't believe that we can afford life insurance — even though we dine out several times a week. my husband doesn't have a bank account and the man owns a sub-contracting company. (literally, he cashes checks in a strip mall for outrageous fees, and who knows where that money goes.)\n\n 'we apparently don't believe in health insurance either.' \n\nabout 2.5 years ago we bought a property in the woods near a lake, set a small cabin on it, and this is where my husband wishes to retire. it's valued at $38,000, we owe $29,000. we live in a vacation destination city and in 5 or 10 years, we won't be able to afford to any more. we have racked up $10,000 in credit-card debt after my husband suffered a fall and broken bones last year.\n\ndon't miss:i earn $15 an hour and will inherit $150,000 — how do i secure my future?\n\nwe apparently don't believe in health insurance either. we are both in poor health, we pay cash for our son's dental and doctor visits, and because i'm a satisfactory degree of native american descent, my son and i can run up to oklahoma for major health needs for free if needs be. i did have to go to the er last year. i pay $30 per month toward that bill, there's no interest on the account so i can take my time paying it off. my husband does not pay his medical debt.\n\n'my situation is a little different'\n\ni was pre-law in college. i've always believed in educating oneself to the fullest extent possible no matter your life's situation — and so i've been reading your letters for years and researching ways to improve my situation for months.\n\n• i do believe in saving a little money even if you don't make very much. (and i have about $400 saved in a money-market account i opened 2 months ago. believe me, this is a big deal.)\n\n• i do believe that the poorest people need life insurance the most. (ever watch a tree grows in brooklyn? that mother paid the life insurance man before she put food on the table!)\n\n• i also believe in investing what little you have, even if it's a small amount of money you were going to spend at the chili's restaurant. i have a betterment account being used as an additional savings vehicle because over the course of many years, certain bonds and funds tend to be a safe place to keep money, and occasionally grow it by a couple of percent, which is a little better than the money market account.\n\nsee:i received $500 from an insurer for damage to my car — can i spend it on me?\n\ni also have a robinhood account where i have deposited a minuscule amount of money for investment testing, which i will only be doing after massive amounts of research on the td ameritrade platforms on the account. i'm not going for day trading or swing trading, just looking for possible safe-ish opportunities with minimal risk patterns and possible small growth.\n\n'here is how i approach our finances'\n\n• i don't believe in giving children money to buy themselves something you would buy them.

facebook, like it or not, has become a big part of our daily lives.\n\ncurrently valued at over $400 billion, this digital giant has forever changed the way we communicate and get information. but now, even people closely associated with the company are worried about the harmful effects of social media.\n\nchamath palihapitiya, former vice president of user growth at facebook inc. fb, -1.90% said the short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works. no civil discourse, no cooperation, misinformation, mistruth.\n\nhis ideas were echoed by another ex-facebook bigwig, sean parker, the site's founding president, who said facebook is exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology, and that god only knows what it's doing to our children's brains.\n\nhere are their comments in detail:\n\nthose comments are worrisome, more so because they surfaced shortly after the fake-news accusations and alleged russian facebook ads targeting u.s. users.\n\nceo mark zuckerberg recently announced big changes coming to his social-media platform: we feel a responsibility to make sure our services aren't just fun to use, but also good for people's well-being.\n\nthe statement could be an indirect confirmation of addictive and potentially damaging characteristics of social media that psychologists and academics have been pointing out for some time now.\n\nkeeping users hooked\n\nas you may have expected, the announced changes don't tackle the real problem of facebook keeping its users hooked. instead they ensure that the dopamine-driven feedback loop is even more effective. in short, facebook aims to make your newsfeed more interesting by reducing the visibility of professionally made content and increasing the visibility for posts made by your friends and family. while this means that brands will have to adjust (which may result in the creation of fake profiles and group spamming) to get their content out, what's more important is that newsfeeds will become more relevant and, thus, more addictive to users.\n\nto explain this, we need to delve a bit deeper into how your brain on facebook works. after posting a comment or a photo, you're exposing yourself to a slew of notifications and reactions that make you feel good. thumbs up, positive comments and emojis all light up special parts of your brain that govern the release of dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin and endorphins (also known as dose chemicals) — a cocktail that, simply put, makes you happy. of those, dopamine is the most interesting, as it is responsible not for happiness, but for the anticipation thereof (which can become addictive) and plays a pivotal role in the reward system.\n\naddiction mechanism\n\non facebook, reward comes in the form of positive feedback from friends, family and people we admire. that motivates users not only to post, but also to outdo themselves each time they create new content. the addiction mechanism forces them to go for an ever-increasing number of positive comments and affirmative emojis, which results in their posts and photos becoming riskier. whether it's showing one's wealth or revealing shots of oneself or filming dangerous stunts, the motivation is always the same: to gain admiration from friends and followers.\n\nthe latest change does nothing to address this problem; indeed, it only worsens the situation. all of a sudden, there are more relevant audiences for social-media addiction, more friends who see the hijinks and react.\n\ninformation control\n\nfinally, there is also the problem of information control and artificial influence. by being able to pay for visibility, individuals and businesses are capable of fabricating the truth and using their reach to further their agenda. this influx of information waters down the ability to differentiate news from misinformation, diluting the truth as well as the influence of those who serve it authentically.\n\ncommunication also suffers. we once expressed ourselves using body language, scent, tone and inflection in our voices, but contemporary social networking limits us to abbreviations, cute pictures and 280 characters per post. this isn't how humans are meant to communicate effectively, and it's no wonder that social-media platforms have become a hotbed for division, conflict and mutual mistrust.\n\nit's not just facebook. the same problem plagues google's goog, -2.62% youtube, facebook's instagram, twitter twtr, -4.96% and others. the real cure for the facebook epidemic isn't the adjustment of the newsfeed — it's changing what made it so popular in the first place and making it less relevant.\n\nthis change will never be put in motion by the company itself; it has to come from users. we need to become social again without relying heavily on social media. social behavior doesn't come from online tools, but from genuine human interaction that starts in our families, continues in schools and flourishes in adulthood. online platforms are useful tools, but they should never be the main way we communicate. if this trend continues, human beings will drift further apart, which in a globally connected world is an irony in itself.\n\nwhat do you think? please let me know in the comment section below.
consumer prices rose about 2.1% in 2017, driven higher by the usual factors: the price of owning or renting a home, the price of filling the gas tank and the price of filling your belly.\n\nof course, the prices of some things fell: wireless phone services were down sharply, and the costs of many manufactured goods, such as clothes, cars, hi-tech gadgets and furniture, dropped as well.\n\nalso read:higher rents and home prices drive increase in consumer prices\n\nthe bureau of labor statistics makes it easy to see which items had the largest impact—positive and negative—on the consumer price index. it publishes table 7 in each month's report, detailing how much the change in price for each item contributed to or subtracted from the cpi.\n\nthe idea here is that things that consumers spend a lot of money on have a bigger weight in the cpi. about one-third of consumer spending goes for owning or renting a home, so it follows that even a relatively modest 3.2% rise in rental prices is going to have a bigger impact on your wallet than, say, a 15% rise in fuel-oil prices (which accounts for about 0.1% of the typical consumer's budget).\n\nthe chart at the top of the page shows the 10 items that had the largest positive impact on the cpi in 2017, led by home ownership prices, which contributed 0.75 percentage points to the 2.1% rise in the cpi. looked at another way, if ownership prices had been unchanged for the year, the cpi would have risen just 1.35% (2.1% minus 0.75%).\n\ngasoline prices jumped 10.7% in 2017. although gas accounts for just 3.6% of aggregate consumer spending, that large price increase boosted the cpi by 0.35 percentage points. the prices of food to be consumed at home rose 1.6%, but because food accounts for a somewhat larger 13.6% of spending, even that modest increase was enough to boost the cpi by 0.07 percentage points.\n\nother notable increases that hit consumers' wallets hard: car insurance prices rose 7.9%, cable tv prices (fueled by netflix's nflx, -3.75% new pricing) rose 4.8%, hospital services prices increased 5.1% and tobacco prices jumped 6.5%, mostly because of a big increase in the cigarette tax in california.\n\nby contrast, items with falling prices had a much smaller impact on the cpi. the biggest drag on the cpi came from wireless phone services, which fell 10.2% as at&t t, -0.46% and verizon vz, +1.00% switched to unlimited data plans in response to competition from smaller rivals sprint us:s and t-mobile tmus, -1.88% . that's going to be a one-off event, part of what federal reserve chairwoman janet yellen has said is the transitory disinflation in a few items that could be masking broader inflation risks.\n\nsimilarly, prices of new and used cars also fell during the year, but have risen over the past few months.\n\nis amazon going to rule the world?\n\nprices of other manufactured goods—apparel, computers, tvs, furniture and toys—have declined for decades and may continue to do so.\n\nlooking ahead, the cpi will be driven higher or lower by a few large categories of spending: shelter, food, energy and medical care combined account for 68% of the cpi. those are the items to keep your eye on.
amazon has narrowed the contenders for its new headquarters down to 20 cities — but the property markets in some cities could do with a boost more than others.\n\nfrom a field of 238 entries, amazon has winnowed the competition to 20 finalists: atlanta; austin; boston; chicago; columbus; dallas; denver; indianapolis; los angeles; miami; montgomery county, md.; nashville; newark, n.j.; new york city; northern virginia; philadelphia; pittsburgh; raleigh, nc; toronto; and washington, d.c.\n\nthe cities generally share a lot in common. most are near international airports. nine of the candidates are among the top 10 metropolitan areas by population in the u.s., with houston being the only one of those major cities not to make the cut. toronto, meanwhile, is canada's largest city.\n\nalso see: what we've learned from amazon's hq2 shortlist\n\n austin and miami have seen home prices rebound markedly over the past five years, while chicago and pittsburgh have had a more muted recovery. \n\nbut for all that these cities share in common, they have had rather divergent trajectories from a real estate perspective since the nadir of the recession. some, such as austin and miami, have seen home prices rebound markedly over the past five years, while places like chicago and pittsburgh have had a more muted recovery.\n\nwhere will amazon amzn, -3.44% have the biggest impact? here are some of the factors to consider:\n\ngot $1 million to retire? here's how long it will last by u.s. state\n\nsmaller cities will see a bigger impact outright\n\namazon has said that the new headquarters will employ 50,000 people — but the full impact on the site selected will be much larger when taking into account other companies that may follow in amazon's footsteps.\n\nfor new york city or los angeles, that would be a drop in the bucket. not so for raleigh, which is the smallest finalist with just 1.2 million residents across its greater metropolitan area, said joe kirchner, senior economist at realtor.com. such an argument would also extend to other finalists such as columbus and indianapolis.\n\ndon't miss:what amazon's hq2 means for homeowners, home buyers and renters in the chosen city\n\nif you're bringing in that many new workers and constructing that many new homes, it's going to have a bigger impact, he said. (realtor.com is operated by news corp subsidiary move inc., and marketwatch is a unit of dow jones, which is also a subsidiary of news corp.)\n\nrenters could feel the pinch in some cities\n\nrenters living in the smaller candidate cities would be particularly hard hit if amazon were to move in. people who rent their homes in raleigh could see rents grow up to an additional 2% because of amazon workers moving in, according to real estate website apartment list. that could add up to an additional $15,356 spent on rent over 10 years. renters in columbus, indianapolis, pittsburgh and nashville could also expect to see rent hikes of more than 1% on top of the average expected rent growth if they became home to amazon's hq2.\n\nrank metro average annual rent growth (2005-2015) additional annual rent growth from amazon hq2 cost to renter households over 10 years 1 raleigh, nc 3.20% 1.5% - 2.0% $11,756 - $15,356 2 columbus, oh 2.80% 1.3% - 1.7% $8,414 - $11,297 3 indianapolis, in 2.40% 1.2% - 1.6% $7,208 - $9,479 4 pittsburgh, pa 3.00% 1.2% - 1.6% $6,970 - $9,533 5 nashville, tn 3.70% 1.2% - 1.5% $8,847 - $11,932 6 denver, co 4.80% 0.8% - 1.1% $7,751 - $11,452 7 austin, tx 4.70% 0.8% - 1.0% $7,441 - $9,706 8 miami, fl 3.60% 0.6% - 0.8% $5,919 - $7,294 9 philadelphia, pa 3.10% 0.6% - 0.8% $5,057 - $6,506 10 boston, ma 2.80% 0.5% - 0.8% $6,608 - $10,539\n\nsome contenders will have more capacity than others\n\nwho has room to grow? new york and boston have comparatively much less space to build new housing to accommodate the influx of residents. those cities, therefore, might expect higher home price and rental appreciation than places where expanding the housing supply is easier.\n\nhowever, an equally important factor here is zoning laws. seattle's housing boom isn't simply a reflection of people's excitement about amazon and the tech sector more broadly — though that certainly contributed. the city's zoning officials were not prepared to handle the onslaught of interest in new construction. as a result, building starts have seriously lagged housing demand, thus fueling more competition and driving prices sky-high.\n\n seattle was not prepared to handle the onslaught of interest in new construction. building seriously lagged housing demand, driving prices sky-high \n\nand from that perspective, amazon could be a bigger burden in some of the finalists located in the northeast than their southern counterparts. some cities are just better suited to expanding housing supply, said tendayi kapfidze, chief economist at lendingtree, pointing to dallas, nashville, raleigh, and austin as candidates with laxer zoning laws.\n\ncapacity isn't just a question of homes for sales, but also units for rent. rents are already extremely unaffordable in some of the 20 cities. in spotsylvania county in northern virginia, for instance, the average worker would need to devote 75.5% of their wages to rent, according to figures from attom data solutions. but renters there won't necessarily be able to buy ahead of amazon's entrance to avoid rent hikes, as rents and home prices alike are rising faster than salaries.\n\nsome cities are already used to rapid change\n\nmany of the cities on amazon's short list have undergone serious change in recent years, and that has made them into more competitive housing markets, said kapfidze.\n\ntake austin: the texas capital was rated as the most-changed city in the u.s. by personal finance website magnifymoney for a host factors including population, income, and, yes, home price growth.\n\nmeanwhile, it ranked no. 17 on lendingtree's list of most competitive housing markets, which took into account the share of buyers who get financing lined up before choosing a home, the size of the down payments and the percentage of borrowers with high credit scores.\n\nalso read:how winning the race to be amazon's second headquarters could turn out to be a curse\n\nmany of the cities on the short list appear high up on both lists, including denver, which is the third-most competitive market nationwide. but having endured substantial, recent change doesn't mean that amazon hq2 will be the straw that breaks the camel's back, kapfidze argued.\n\ncities like columbus, indianapolis and pittsburgh would benefit more from amazon coming into the area, he said. the cities that have changed the most are more nimble and better prepared to absorb and accommodate a huge influx of new residents and a different mix of business.\n\nthe question of toronto...\n\nlike many of the american cities on the short list, toronto has seen real-estate prices climb over the past 5 years. the median price of a home in the toronto metropolitan area in december was 743,500 canadian dollars (equivalent to $597,811 in the u.s.). that's up 7% from a year and 63.6% from 2012, according to data from the toronto real estate board.\n\nand the city's rental market recently earned the dubious distinction of becoming the priciest in all of canada, surpassing vancouver, which had long been more expensive, based on data from real-estate website padmapper.\n\nso it seems like amazon's entrance there would result in very similar drawbacks for local residents. but for americans moving north of the border to work for the e-commerce giant, the favorable exchange rate to canadian currency could offset the otherwise painful blow, canada's national post argued.
davos, switzerland—u.s. business leaders are optimistic that president-elect donald trump will boost economic and job growth, said john chambers, executive chairman of cisco systems inc.\n\nspeaking on the sidelines of the world economic forum, chambers brushed aside anxiety over the anti-globalization movement that helped propel trump to the presidency. that sentiment, he said, was a symptom of anemic u.s. wage growth in recent years that can be fixed by focusing on digital jobs.
white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders sparred with fox news sunday anchor chris wallace on sunday when she defended president donald trump's claims that terrorists are pouring across the southern border.\n\nthe commander-in-chief has said he needs $5.6 billion for the barrier because drugs, human traffickers and terrorists are crossing the mexican border into the us.\n\nat a white house news conference last friday, homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen said customs and border patrol stopped more than 3,000 special interest aliens trying to get into the u.s. via the border.\n\nbut special interest aliens are just people who come from countries that have ever produced a terrorist. they're not terrorists themselves, wallace said to sanders after showing a clip of nielsen's remarks.\n\nand the state department says that there is, quote, their words: no credible evidence of any terrorist coming across the border from mexico, he added.\n\nsanders responded: we know that roughly, nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally, and we know that our most vulnerable point of entry is at our southern border.\n\nwallace said he studied up on the issue because he knew sanders would bring it up.\n\ndo you know where those 4,000 people come — where they're captured?, wallace asked her. airports.\n\nnot always, she said.\n\nat airports, he insisted.\n\nthe state department says there hasn't been any terrorists that they've found coming across the southern border with mexico, wallace continued.\n\nit's by air, it's by land and it's by sea. it's all of the above, she said, then tried to change the topic to overall border security.\n\nbut one thing that you're forgetting is that the most vulnerable point of entry that we have into this country is our southern border, and we have to protect it, she said.\n\nbut wallace wouldn't relent and continued to hammer home his point, refuting the administration's claim that terrorists are entering through the border rather than at airports.\n\ni'm not disagreeing with you that they're coming through airports. i'm saying that they come by air, by land and by sea, sanders said.\n\nand until the border is fully secured, she said, the more that we're going to have an influx, not just of terrorists but of human traffickers, drug inflow and people that are coming here to do american citizens harm.\n\nthis report originally appeared on nypost.com.
cleveland fed president loretta mester said friday that monetary policy is in a good place and this will allow the central bank to take the time to assess the economy before making any more policy moves. mester said the central bank could pause or even stop tightening now depending on inflation. she said that the two rate hikes penciled in by the central bank for 2019 could happen and that would be a good sign that the economy was performing well. mester said she didn't support any slowdown in the pace of the shrinking of the balance sheet but said if the economy weakened markedly that a change was possible. pressed on whether she supported further rate hikes, mester said she didn't have to vote now and would wait for more information.
ups and downs can turn your life around.\n\nfour-time grammy winner michael buble revealed earlier this year that he's leaving music in the wake of his 5-year-old son's cancer battle; the boy was diagnosed with liver cancer when he was two.\n\nmy whole being's changed since my son got cancer, buble told the daily mail's weekend magazine. i never fell out of love with music, i just needed to put it aside. he also told james corden on carpool karaoke that, we got the diagnosis, and that was it, man. my whole life ended.\n\nit's not surprising that a life-changing event will do just that: change someone's life. and with the new year inspiring many people to think about how to transform their own lives, moneyish spoke with four women who turned their careers and lifestyles completely around after something unexpected happened to them.\n\nyou just have to go with your gut.\n\nnicole meyer was a director in a large manhattan real estate company 12 years ago. she was thisclose to getting a private office.\n\nbut then her first child was born eight weeks premature. when you have a baby in general, your life takes a complete 180. when you have a premie, you're even more unprepared, said meyer, 41. she was planted in the nicu morning, noon and night pumping milk for her daughter ella, as well as cuddling her, singing to her and trying to keep her tiny human alive.\n\nyou're living in the hospital, and you're lucky if you remember to brush your teeth, she said. i didn't have time to think about what i was going to next, or when i was coming back to work.\n\nafter nicole meyer's daughter was born premature, she left her career in real estate to start nibbles by nic. (courtesy of nicole meyer)\n\nbut she realized then that she wanted a career that would give her more family time than real estate and its round-the-clock schmoozing. and her focus on her daughter's nutrition inspired her to become a certified nutritionist. this led to founding nibbles by nic, which helps busy women build kitchen confidence through menu planning and organizational techniques. i thought, 'how can i carve out a niche for myself that is somewhat unique?' and meal planning and organizing for busy women came to the forefront, she said.\n\ntoday ella is a healthy and happy 12-year-old, and meyer also has an 8-year-old son. when my water broke, and i didn't know whether my daughter would be ok, i was in a dire situation, she said. but it made me dig deep and find a way to explore what i think i was meant to do, and to be creative. you just have to go with your gut. talk to people, and utilize every connection that you have to figure out how to get your passion project going.\n\nkeep looking around for what's next.\n\nnatalia paruz lived to dance. she was trained in classical and contemporary ballet, jazz and tap, and was a trainee with the martha graham dance company in nyc about 20 years ago when she was hit by a taxi. the resulting upper spinal injury ended her dancing career.\n\ni was devastated, paruz, who gave her age as almost 40, told moneyish. my life revolved around dancing. telling stories through movement made me feel alive.\n\nbut when her parents took her to austria a few months later, they saw a man making music with a carpenter's handsaw. you use a bow, like for a violin, but when you play the saw, the entire instrument moves, and it waves and makes shapes in the air, she explained. it's very visual, just like dance, and i loved the beautiful, angelic, otherworldly sound that it made. i felt this fire all of a sudden. it was the first time that i was excited about something other than dance.\n\nnatalia paruz went from being a dancer to playing the musical saw. (courtesy of natalia paruz)\n\nso she returned to astoria, queens and borrowed her landlady's rusty saw, and taught herself. soon she could play six notes. and before long, her neighbors (who could hear her practicing through the walls) were asking her to play gigs at the salvation army. soon, she was being invited to play in manhattan. and now she's the saw lady who commands $125 to $1,000 a gig, by her union (local 802) rates.\n\ni wasn't in pursuit of this new career; it just came to me, she said. it's like what they say in 'sound of music: 'when god closes a door, somewhere he opens a window.' that's exactly how it felt -- you could call it god, or providence, or luck. i thought i was supposed to be a dancer, but playing the saw is what i was supposed to be doing all along.\n\nshe's played in carnegie hall, lincoln center and madison square garden, and on movie soundtracks such as hbo's the jinx and richard gere's time out of mind.

after an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness on royal caribbean's oasis of the seas sickened hundreds of passengers, the cruise line has offered travelers full refunds for the cost of the cruise fare.\n\nbut cruise passengers generally have very little recourse if they get sick during a vacation. it's difficult to prove the origins of food poisoning and any compensation is typically left to the generosity or goodwill of the cruise line in question.\n\ndon't miss:why you shouldn't order ice on a flight, and other 'dirty little secrets'\n\nthe oasis of the seas returned to port canaveral, fla. on saturday, a day earlier than scheduled, after gastrointestinal illness sickened 277 guests and passengers since the ship departed on jan. 6, royal caribbean told marketwatch. that number reportedly grew to nearly 500 people since then.\n\nin a somewhat unusual move, the cruise line has decided to provide travelers with full refunds of their paid cruise fares. the 7-night western caribbean voyage on the oasis of the seas starts at $626 per person before taxes and fees for an interior stateroom.\n\n 'this is just crazy. we're hunkered down in our room because i'm so scared of getting sick.'  — —cruise critic member raycin\n\nin addition to a full refund of the cruise fares, a letter allegedly delivered to the ship's passengers noted that the company will provide up to $200 per person for re-booked domestic flights, up to $400 per person for international flight change fees or up to $200 per stateroom for one night's stay at a hotel. consumers need to contact royal caribbean to receive those reimbursements.\n\nthe company did not immediately confirm whether the letter was accurate.\n\nthe cruise line also said it will be refunding internet and beverage packages and prepaid gratuities on a prorated basis for the day the cruise won't be sailing.\n\npassengers have noted in message boards on the travel site cruise critic that the ship's crew was taking extra precautions to prevent further spread of the illness, including extra cleaning of public areas and preventing passengers from serving themselves at the buffets.\n\nstill, some passengers have expressed frustration with the experience while the ship was still at sea. this is just crazy. we're hunkered down in our room because i'm so scared of getting sick, cruise critic member raycin posted. this is our first cruise in 15 years and will most likely be our last.\n\na spokesman for royal caribbean said the early return was designed, in part, to give the company more time to clean and sanitize the ship before its next sailing.\n\nwe think the right thing to do is to get everyone home early rather than have guests worry about their health, owen torres, corporate communications manager at royal caribbean, said in an email.\n\n cruise lines are under no obligation to provide a refund.  — —colleen mcdaniel, executive editor at cruise critic\n\nour guests sail with us to have great vacations, and we are sorry this cruise fell short, he added.\n\nin recent years, outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness have become less common. last year, there were only 11 confirmed outbreaks, according to the centers for disease control and prevention, which left only 658 people ill.\n\nof those 11 outbreaks, only five were confirmed to be norovirus, one of viruses that most commonly causes gastroenteritis, which is the lowest figure in years.\n\nconsidering 28 million took a cruise in 2018, the number of those who reported ill was a tiny fraction of those who took a cruise, said ben souza, editor of travel website cruise fever.\n\nhere is what cruise passengers need to know about what they can do if they get sick on a cruise:\n\ndon't expect a refund — even if you get norovirus\n\ncruise lines are under no obligation to provide a refund, said colleen mcdaniel, executive editor at cruise critic. typically, they will provide compensation in the form of cruise credits for future sailings or onboard credit for the remaining duration of the cruise.\n\nthe choice to offer a full refund was somewhat unusual on royal caribbean's part, as a result. cruise lines look at this sort of thing on a case by case basis and how disruptive this was to passengers, mcdaniel said. given that oasis of the seas had to skip two ports of call and return a day early, mcdaniel said it was abundantly clear to royal caribbean that the illness outbreak adversely affected passengers' experience even if they weren't sick.\n\n last year, there were only 11 confirmed outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness, which left only 658 people ill. \n\nthe company would not confirm what it has offered in the case of previous gastrointestinal illness outbreaks. but miami-based cruise-industry lawyer jim walker said that following a large outbreak on the explorer of the seas back in 2014, royal caribbean only offered a 50% refund on the cruise fare and a 50% credit toward a future cruise.\n\nin most cases the cruise line will not offer any compensation, implying that it is the customers' fault for not washing their hands, even though the cdc and the fda state that contaminated food or water are the most common explanations for norovirus, walker said.\n\n in 2014, royal caribbean only offered a 50% refund on the cruise fare and a 50% credit toward a future cruise. \n\narguing for more in compensation can also be something of a fool's errand. walker said his law firm doesn't even take on cases involving these outbreaks. don't call us if you get sick on a cruise, he said. establishing where the virus came from, or that the cruise line was negligent, is virtually impossible to prove.\n\nalso see: running scared this flu season? 7 things you shouldn't touch — including soap\n\nconsumers' best avenue for compensation is through travel insurance\n\nmoreover, those who did fall ill while on board could be on the hook for the cost of any medical treatment they've received.\n\nincidents like this illustrate why it's a good idea to consider buying travel insurance before you go, said christine sarkis, deputy executive editor of the travel site smartertravel.com.\n\nfor example, a travel-insurance policy with trip interruption coverage would help passengers defray the cost of returning home early. other policies may also cover the expenses associated with medical treatment and an emergency evacuation from the ship if they are hospitalized while traveling.\n\nadditionally, refunds like the one royal caribbean offered don't always cover additional travel expenses incurred, such as rebooking airfare.\n\nwhile on the ship, wash your hands\n\npassengers' experience on the oasis of the seas is a strong reminder of the need to exercise good hygiene when traveling.\n\nwash your hands, mcdaniel said. wash them before you eat, and wash them after you use the restroom. that could help prevent the spread of illness, but may not be so helpful, however, if the contamination came from the kitchen.\n\nbuffets can be a hotbed of germs: if you see someone grab food from the buffet with their hands rather than a utensil, they should notify the ship crew to ensure that the potentially-tainted food is disposed.\n\nshares of royal caribbean rcl, -5.32% have dropped around 18.6% year-over-year. comparatively, the dow jones industrial average djia, -0.39% and the s&p 500 spx, -0.16% are both down roughly 8% during that same time period.\n\nthis story was updated on jan. 15, 2019.
dear moneyologist,\n\ni'm planning to divorce my husband of eight years, as he's never worked in this time or contributed to bills. we live in california, a community property state. we live in a house which i bought before the marriage for $700,000, and it's appreciated to $1.2 million. i continue to pay my mortgage on it. i don't have much in savings, just $20,000, and $100,000 in retirement. is there anything i can do to protect my money? should i put extra money towards my car or house payments? should i send money to my parents?\n\nunlucky in california\n\ndear unlucky,\n\nyou could do that, but a judge is likely to notice your sudden generous payments towards your mortgage and car loan, and could even penalize you for them. that's the kind of surreptitious action that has gone against others years after the fact. in 1996, a california woman won $1.3 million in the lottery and filed for divorce 11 days later. she didn't tell her husband or anyone else about her windfall, and two years later her husband found out about it (they always do) and sued her. superior court judge richard denner ruled that she acted out of fraud or malice and awarded her husband all of her winnings. had she been honest, they both would have walked away with half.\n\nlisten to our new podcast:money, markets & more (or subscribe on itunes): walking a mile in dead men's shoes and millennials tap home equity for frivolities.\n\nin most divorce cases, especially in california which is a community property state, couples are instructed to divide their shared assets down the middle (in monetary terms) and, as part of that settlement, they're allowed to keep what they own personally, such as clothing and jewelry. in your state, you take out of the marriage what you brought into it, but this grows more complicated when a home has appreciated during a marriage and/or when marital assets were used to pay the mortgage (even though, in this case, your husband never actually worked). i'm not against your giving a little money to your parents if they need it for a specific reason, but not to hide it before your divorce is over. if you do have to split those savings, $10,000 is a small price to pay for your freedom. (interestingly, i told a similar thing to a fellow earlier this week, who learned a $10,000 lesson.) one more consideration: you may need that $10,000 in savings for legal fees.\n\n you could spend your savings, but a judge is likely to see your sudden generous payments to your mortgage and car, and could even penalize you for them. that's the kind of surreptitious action that is likely to go against you in the long run.  — the moneyologist\n\nwhat's more, the judge is likely to take into account that your husband never worked over this time, or paid the bills, and a good lawyer will make sure that's front and center in your divorce case should your husband's lawyer ask for alimony in lieu of you living in your house (sorry to bring that up). the upside: alimony is tax-deductible for the payer and must be reported as income by the payee. divide it all down the middle, start over and look to the future, says randy kessler, an atlanta-based lawyer who wrote the book, divorce: protect yourself, your kids, and your future. you should feel better that when the case is over, you will still have a job and can replenish so even if it is all divided, you will still be better off than him. it pays to have a good (and honest) divorce lawyer.\n\nthere are so many dirty deals that happen before people file for divorce. i recently heard of a case where a husband took $1 million equity out of the home that he lived in with his wife (his name was on the deed) shortly before they filed for divorce. that's the kind of paper trail that leads all the way back to a disgruntled judge in divorce court. i've had so many letters in recent months from or about people who want to pull a fast one: the wife who wanted to disinherit her stepchildren in the event that her husband of one year dies, and even a psychotherapist who wanted to be in cahoots with his client to cheat the insurance company.\n\nyou've lived honorably up until now and paid your own way and, yes, your husband was a mooch. leave this marriage with your head held high and don't let him change who you are.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyologist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyologist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
boston fed president eric rosengren has been concerned about a potential asset bubble in commercial real estate since late 2015. and he says that the problem of asset prices has gotten worse, not better.\n\nfor a while, real estate looked like the only asset class that was showing signs of having substantial variation from what the average valuation had been, but i think we're starting to see more asset markets have that characteristic, he says.\n\nthis makes life hard for the central bank. for instance, it makes it more difficult for the central bank to engineer a soft landing for the economy, rosengren said. it also means the fed cannot pause in its gradual pace of rate hikes and should even pick up the pace a bit this year. the u.s. central bank might have to raise rates four times in 2018, he said, more than the median forecast of fed officials or the two hikes the market expects.\n\nmarketwatch spoke with rosengren as he was preparing to give his first speech of the year on the economic outlook. in his remarks, he said low inflation has so far allowed the fed to pursue very gradual rate hikes.\n\nhere's the edited interview.\n\nmarketwatch: asset valuations have continued to rise after you last voiced concern last year. what's your latest view?\n\nrosengren: nothing has changed dramatically, prices are still edging up, so valuation concerns are still there. i would say what has changed a little bit is, for a while, real estate looked like the only asset class that was showing signs of having substantial variation from what the average valuation had been, but i think we're starting to see more asset markets have that characteristic.\n\neconomists are not very good at predicting how large deviations will be. and there are some underlying reasons for why you might see valuation differences. one would be that if you really think we're in a low-interest-rate environment. that means valuations, will, on average, be higher. so the question is, do you think that is a permanent phenomenon or a temporary phenomenon? and obviously when you are talking about stocks, but also to some extent commercial real estate, the tax code matters, and we've just had a tax code change. so those kinds of effects can have an impact on valuation. but i would say that real estate, like other asset classes, are now showing to be a bit higher than what they've been historically and that continues to be a little bit of a concern for me.\n\nmarketwatch: the fed's rate hikes to date haven't tightened financial conditions at all.\n\nrosengren: that's accurate. financial conditions have not tightened significantly with the increase in short-term interest rates. part of that is the stock market has gone up quite a bit and exchange rates and some of these other variables are being affected by a stimulative fiscal policy. so even while we're tightening with monetary policy, in some sense we have a more stimulative fiscal policy and over the course of the year people didn't know what, if any, tax change would occur. and now we know a tax change has actually occurred, so we now have a stimulative environment from the fiscal policy side that we didn't necessarily know was going to happen, so short-term interest rates have tightened but the long rate tmubmusd30y, 2.417% is a little less than 2.5% right now. i would expect over time that it will gradually increase as we unwind our balance sheet and as it becomes clear that inflation really is picking up towards our 2% goal and that the tight labor markets are starting to have an impact on wages and prices over time.\n\nmarketwatch: do you think the fed should raise rates at a faster pace than gradual?\n\nrosengren: the [fed forecasts] in december had three tightenings. i actually think we'll probably need a little bit more than that. i'm hopeful that we can continue to do it gradually. doing it gradually probably requires us to continue to be doing it though. so if we were to slow down for some reason, i would be worried that at some point we would have to start moving more quickly. i would be worried about moving quickly at a time when asset prices were already at very high valuations. i think being able to do it more leisurely is one reason why we haven't had as much of a slowdown and probably has reduced the probability of having a recession. in addition, fiscal policy being so stimulative is a period where you wouldn't expect an economic downturn either.\n\nmarketwatch: is the fed, in a sense, going to keep raising rates until it sees a tightening of financial conditions?\n\nrosengren: no, i wouldn't phrase it that way. our dual mandate goal would be that we have to get to 2% inflation and get to what we believe is a sustainable unemployment rate. the unemployment rate right now is at 4.1% so we're already lower than where we think we need to be. my own view is what the sustainable unemployment rate would be more like 4.7%. if you look at the blue chip forecasts, which just came out, they are actually getting it down to 3.7% in 2019. so we are actually moving in the opposite direction. i do think that we have to gradually tighten and i don't want to overshoot on the unemployment rate so much that it becomes very difficult to get back to a sustainable unemployment rate without having a recession.\n\nand i would put financial conditions – that is not a goal of monetary policy – but it makes it harder to start tightening if you have to do a lot of tightening, and if you really have to slow down the economy. if you think that potential gdp is growing around 1.75%, well if you want to get the unemployment rate to gradually go up, you are going to have to be seeing some 1.5% [gdp prints] and some lower numbers than we've been seeing. when we see those numbers it is possible that you get more of a slowdown than you're anticipating, and that can be particularly true, i think, if financial markets are a little bit too ebullient. so i think financial conditions and financial stability issues complement some of the concerns i would have about whether we're getting to an unsustainable level of unemployment rate over time.\n\nmarketwatch: some colleagues want the pace of rate hikes to slow down – and point to the flattening of the yield curve as a signal to go slow.\n\nrosengren: we've intentionally pushed long-term rates down by having a big balance sheet. we've chosen a path which will not disrupt financial markets which means that our balance sheet comes down quite slowly. until we have more normalized the balance sheet, it is not surprising that long rates are lower than they otherwise would be and it is not just what the u.s. is doing, it is what japan and europe are doing. so they are still expanding their balance sheets, even though we've been pulling back, and so that also is pushing down long-term rates as well.\n\nit isn't surprising to me that we're tightening up at the short-end but the fact that monetary policy both here and abroad has been pushing down on the long rate means that this is going to be a little bit different exit strategy than what we've historically seen. we haven't had a bloated balance sheet around the world in previous periods. people who are taking a lot of meaning from the slope of the yield curve, i think, need to consider what it means to be in a different monetary policy framework — which is that europe, japan and the united states have a balance sheet that intentionally was suppressing long rates. so the signal value probably isn't quite the same, but it is a reason to your earlier question about why financial conditions haven't tightened more because the balance sheets are likely to only come down gradually over time. now you could do it differently, and if you want to see the long end of the market go up quickly i can certainly imagine policies of central banks in some part of the world deciding to sell long-term securities would have the impact of pushing up the yield curve. i'm not advocating that. but i think it is an intentional policy. it is not as if this is an unanticipated outcome.\n\nmarketwatch: and you think that inflation will move higher?\n\nrosengren: just having the data from the spring time roll off – we had the wireless prices changes, there were a couple other changes in prices that i think were tied to individual markets that really were not tied to overall inflation and so i think once we get to the spring time we're going to be seeing numbers much closer to 2%. in addition, we have pretty tight labor markets already, and if we continue to grow faster than potential, those labor markets are going to get even tighter. if we start seeing unemployment rates below 4%, that's a pretty tight labor market. you're already hearing lots of stories, i think, in some of the tight markets about the difficulty of getting labor and one way to respond to that is to offer higher wages to try to attract people either in the local market or from outside the local market. these things take time. they don't happen overnight. that's why there are long and variable lags in monetary policy. i do expect that over time it will have that impact. we'll see more wage pressures and we'll see with time more inflation.\n\nmarketwatch: there has been a lot of discussion in recent weeks about a new framework for monetary policy. where do you stand?\n\nrosengren: i think there are some advantages of having a fed-led discussion about how we should think about the framework. my own view is that we would be better off having a little more flexibility than having a specific inflation target. i would much rather have an inflation range – something more like 1.5%-3%. and that during times where interest rates were likely to be low because labor force growth was quite low and productivity was quite low, that would be a time that i would actually like a higher level of inflation so i would like to be higher in the range during that period. and during periods of very high productivity then we could be lower. and the reason for that is – and it is partly a financial stability concern – that the current framework where we have low productivity and low population growth and not much immigration, is an environment where we are going to hit the zero lower bound too frequently. and i do think that has significant consequences – both because monetary policy becomes less effective when we can't move short-term interest rates, and i also think that it changes investor and household behavior when you start having periods of prolonged interest rates that are very low and unchanged. so i would like to avoid those kind of outcomes occurring in future recessions and so i think it is a good time to be discussing what is the right framework to reduce that probability. inflation would still be, i think, in a range that it wouldn't be affecting decision-making by households or firms but would give you a little more flexibility to reduce the probability that you hit zero during recessions. so if we were to have a recession right now, most recessions we move interest rates by much more than 300 basis points. if you look at where the [fed forecasts] in december had the fed funds in the long run, [2.8%] it is low enough that more than likely in most recessions we'd hit zero. that is a concern.
no matter what the market does this year, investors are ready to be more active in it.\n\nthe question is whether that will help them get better results.\n\naccording to a survey released last week by the amg funds, more than 90% of affluent mutual fund investors plan to maintain or increase their allocations to active funds in 2016, in spite of — or perhaps because of — the sustained to increasing volatility they see over the next 12 months.\n\nwhile the popular story in the media during the market's rally from the financial crisis is that active management doesn't work — and fund flows have shown investors loading up on index funds — the market's volatility and concerns about a possible downturn make 2016 the kind of time when active management typically does what investors hope for when they take the chance.\n\nwhen investors get active, it can mean a lot of things. while all of those actions are done with good intentions, the results aren't always a plus.\n\n investors faced with the choice of an investment mirroring the market — staying passive — or going with something 'designed to reduce volatility and limit downside risk,' 55% of respondents took the active option. \n\nif the market's early-january action has you contemplating moves to make this year, consider whether increasing your activity is really doing the right thing by your long-term investment strategy.\n\nactive investing typically involves hiring a manager to make the investment decisions based on their insights, methodology and investment styles. passive investing uses index funds, and forgoes trying to beat the market in favor of achieving the market's results over time.\n\nthe problem with passive investing, for many investors, is that index funds ride the market rollercoaster, which can get nauseating when declines are fast and steep. a fund manager, typically, is expected to inject some downside protection, so that while their fund may not beat the market in good times, it avoids some of the pain in bad times.\n\nread:the u.s. stock market's fate hangs on this critical number\n\nwith the market historically rising two-thirds of the time — and with active managers saddled with a higher expense ratio than the typical index funds — a majority of active fund managers lag behind their index benchmark over time, which has led to the generalization that passive management is superior.\n\nthe problem is that many index investors are active, just not at the fund level.\n\nusing a money manager, financial adviser or their own instincts, they actively manage their passive investments, tilting the portfolio toward, say, large-cap growth stocks when the market is rising but perhaps moving away from stocks in times when the market gets scary.\n\nchina's growth is slowest in 25 years\n\nmaking moves in the name of tactical asset allocation — changing index allocations or swapping one index fund for another — is active investing, and can have the same performance-reducing effects as investing in active funds to begin with.\n\nthis kind of actively passive investing is countered by people who buy and hold active funds, where they don't chase performance and let managers do their work, so that they passively manage their active funds.\n\nalso read:here's how share buybacks can come back to bite shareholders\n\nultimately, investors come up with a lot of ways to explain their moves without ever having to fess up to market timing or giving into their fear or greed. they buy on dips or protect their profits against downturns, and thus become tactical; in the face of the market's recent moves, they're considering adding to the parts of the market that have gone on sale — like china or oil companies — or they're steering clear of more pain.\n\nthe amg study results showed that investors faced with the choice of an investment mirroring the market — staying passive — or going with something designed to reduce volatility and limit downside risk, 55% of respondents took the active option.\n\nsadly, there is no guarantee that the active moves an investor makes will actually reduce volatility or limit downside risk; only time will tell if they get what they want.\n\nthe worry i have when i look at the results is if you are nervous about the market — and 95% expect moderate to high volatility this year and they say that high volatility makes them very uncomfortable — what happens by investor behavior is that people tend to withdraw with no sense of when to come back, said bill finnegan, chief marketing officer for the amg funds. you need a strategy as to how you will manage this, whether it is buy-and-hold or some investment policy … active or passive, because otherwise all you are doing is mixing strategies and making moves that feel right in the moment but that work against the long-term tactics that you know you should be following.\n\nbefore getting active in 2016, look first at whether your portfolio needs to be changed.\n\ncould it benefit from rebalancing — where the weight of each holding is put back onto your original plans — or from a new plan?\n\nwhatever you decide, experts suggest making any moves with a plan, rather than simply reacting to the market's news and volatility.\n\nyou have to avoid chasing the dot; don't do something for the sake of making a change, said jeffrey demaso, director of research at adviser investments. you need to be more concerned with reaching your goals than with beating the market all the time. sticking with what has worked for you is usually better than changing strategies just because the market's getting scary.
achieving early retirement is a pretty awesome feat. my husband and i are on the verge of it later this year, at the ages of 41 and 38, respectively. and we're beyond excited. but that doesn't mean early retirement is for everyone.\n\nit's easy to see early retirement as the natural solution to job dissatisfaction, especially given how much pressure so many of us are under at work these days. but the truth is that not everyone needs to or should want to retire early. it's a very different path from the one most people follow for a reason, and it's not one that any of us should go down without being fully aware of the risks and pitfalls.\n\nthis path isn't well-trod — it's windy and uneven, and unmarked in places. it's more like a windy hedge maze at times than a large thoroughfare with well-marked exits. early retirement won't magically fix everything we wish was different about us or our lives, and it comes with its own set of stresses. to some of us, those new stresses are worth it, but we can only know that if we do some real introspection and planning. and not just financial planning, but also planning around personal fulfillment, health and self-worth.\n\nto help guide some of this introspection, we've put together a list of the questions you should be able to answer before you retire early.\n\nno matter what stage you're at in thinking about or planning for early retirement (or, heck, for regular retirement!), take some time to think through these questions and their answers. if you struggle to answer any of them, then early retirement may not be right for you, or may not be right for you right now, and that's okay! not everyone has to share this vision for their future. particularly if you don't have a clear vision of what you want to retire to, there's nothing wrong with working a little longer, or even a lot longer.\n\nnot liking your job — being clear on what you're retiring from — is not enough of a reason to retire early. the answer may be much, much simpler: find a different job, or a different career path. if you're committed to retiring early, but don't have good answers for all of these questions, then let them kickstart some additional thinking and planning that will pay off once you pull that ripcord and wave arrivederci to your career.\n\n1. how will you support yourself or your family without a job? (and will that change over time?)\n\nthe answer could be any number of things — earning dividends from stocks you own, selling shares of index funds, collecting rent on an investment property or 10, doing part-time work, or some combination of the above. the answer can also change over time, focusing primarily on one strategy until you reach age 59 1/2, for example, and then shifting to live off your 401(k) or ira after you reach the eligible age.\n\nthis is our retirement vision.\n\nother pieces to consider: will you follow the 4% rule? have you put together a realistic budget that will account for all potential expenses and things you want to do in retirement? have you done multiple projections to ensure that you're saving enough before retiring to provide enough income for the full period that you'll need it, even if the markets don't provide good returns every year? if you have kids, will you plan to pay for their college?\n\n2. what is your backup plan for dealing with financial emergencies or hardship?\n\nhow will you make sure that your whole plan doesn't get sunk, especially after you've given up a well-paying job, by a natural or financial disaster? will you budget for homeowners or renters insurance? will you maintain an emergency fund, separate from your other investments? will you carry life insurance? umbrella insurance? will you build in any other contingencies like the ability to downsize a home or move somewhere cheaper? how will you ride out bad periods for the stock markets, including possibly extended recessions? how much of a cash cushion will you maintain? could you trim back your early retirement budget if you had less to spend some years? we have built a number of contingencies into our early retirement plans, ensuring we'll still be able to sleep at night when we no longer get a paycheck.\n\n3. how will you get health care?\n\nit's no secret that health-care costs bankrupt people all the time. how will you ensure that this never happens to you? will you buy health insurance through federal or state exchanges until you reach age 65 and qualify for medicare? have you done the calculations for the income you plan to have, and ensured that your retirement budget can cover the full cost of premiums and copays (as well as the possibility of needing to go up to the out-of-pocket maximum)? will you plan to live abroad and avoid buying insurance in the u.s.? (or are you a lucky canadian or european, who doesn't have to worry about such things?)\n\nread: here's a big road block to your dream of early retirement\n\n4. how will you keep your body and mind healthy?\n\nwhat is your plan for eating healthily, exercising and stimulating your mind in early retirement? does that plan look a lot like what you already do now, or does it involve some drastic changes? early retired you is still you, so ask yourself if drastic changes are realistic, or if you need to start making incremental changes now to make sure staying healthy is doable once you're retired. on the mental front, will you embrace new technology and other societal changes as you age? will you befriend younger people? will you engage in activities or hobbies that expand your thinking, and force you to form new neural pathways?\n\nhow self-driving cars will take over more than just the driving\n\n5. what are you retiring to?\n\nthis question is perhaps the most important of all. nothing is worse than saving for years to retire early, burning bridges in your career, and then discovering that you're bored. consider well before that happens what you will do with your new-found time in early retirement. what will excite you about getting out of bed every day? how often will you check things off of your bucket list? what do you want your contribution to the world to be?\n\n6. what will your living situation be?\n\ndo you plan to stay put where you are for retirement? do you plan to move into a smaller home that's easier to maintain and which frees up some capital? do you plan to relocate? do you plan to go nomadic and live the rv lifestyle? for aspiring full-time rvers, do you have a plan for if or when you decide you ultimately want to put down roots, and then need to pay rent or buy a home? for those planning to live in a home, will you pay off the mortgage before you retire, or keep paying it off in your retirement years? have you budgeted adequately for miscellaneous housing expenses like property tax, rent increases and utilities, all of which will go up over time?\n\n7. what do you want a day in retirement to look like?\n\nwhat will an average day in your new retired life look like? what activities will you do every day? how will you spend most of your time? will you spend a lot of your time surfing the web and watching tv? when you look at your vision for each day, does it sound both realistic and fulfilling to you?\n\n8. what will your social circles and interactions be like?\n\nwho will be your primary friends once you retire? will you be able to see them more often, or will their work schedules prevent them from spending time with you during your new free time? how will you make new friends? if you have a partner, do the two of you plan to spend most of your time together, or apart? will you have your own hobbies, or share most of your hobbies with your partner?\n\n9. how will you and your partner, if you have one, stay on the same page about money and life goals?\n\nare you both equally committed to retiring early, and do you share the same vision of what's worth sacrificing to reach your goals? have you mapped out your big goals for your lives together? do you both feel comfortable with your retirement budget and projections, or does one of you feel they are too aggressive or risky? are you both committed to the discipline and frugality needed to ensure you don't outlive your retirement savings? do you regularly check in with each other to make sure you're still on the same page about money and life goals? if you're currently single, does your vision allow for flexibility if you one day get in a serious relationship?\n\n10. how will you define yourself and derive self-worth post-career?\n\nonce the title is gone, how will you see yourself? what will you do to ensure that you see yourself as a worthy person making contributions in the world? how will you find fulfillment without a job? how will you give back? what will you want to have accomplished, looking back on your life at age 80 or 90?\n\nthis column was published with the permission of and updated by our next life —the ten questions to answer before you retire early.\n\nms. onl is the blogger behind our next life, chronicling the journey she and her husband are on to retire early at the ages of 38 and 41 in late 2017. their approach to early retirement planning focuses on putting life goals first, and then building money goals around them. money is just a tool after all, and life is what really matters. follow them ontwitter.
germany has jumped closer to the real end of the angela merkel era. the german chancellor's heir-designate, annegret kramp-karrenbauer, said on monday she would resign as leader of the ruling christian democratic union party, and wouldn't run for chancellor in 2021 (the term of the current parliament will end in the second half of the year).\n\nthis opens a new round of political uncertainty. but look closer, and it is clear that the german economy could benefit from this surprise announcement, if it signals the end of the years of indecisiveness at the top.\n\ngermany is undergoing an economic and political crisis calling for new leadership both in style and substance. the latest manufacturing data have confirmed that the country's problems are not just due to slowing world trade, but that they partly stem from ingrained problems that have caught both businesses and the government by surprise. industrial production fell 3.5% in december compared with the previous month, and nearly 7% over the past year. the car industry's struggles to deal with the challenges of climate change and the dearth of investment in recent years are taking their toll at last.\n\nmeanwhile the coalition government of merkel's conservatives and the social democratic party of germany seems paralyzed by its differences, and challenged by the rise of the green party and the success of the far-right movement alternative for germany in local and regional elections. merkel has never been known for quick decisiveness. germany's current woes are throwing an even cruder light on the problem.\n\nthe cdu will have to choose a leader with a clear view of what they want to do and whom they want to govern with. the top two contenders seem to be friedrich merz, the former blackrock executive who was the runner-up in the leadership contest two years ago, and jens spahn, the 39-year old health minister.\n\nthe green party is now the country's second largest, polling at 22% behind the cdu's 28%. the spd, like most european center-left parties, is down to historic lows, polling at 14%. the question of a green-conservative alliance will be one of the most discussed in the coming months.\n\nthe future government will have to tackle the issues the current one hasn't. it will have to at least form a view of the role germany should play in europe and the world. on the economic front, it will have to decide what to do about the state of the economy. there is the matter of a short-term fiscal stimulus, advocated by economists both german and foreign. but there is also the question of what type of long-term public investments the country needs to overcome the structural flaws of its economic model.\n\nand once the debates are over and the election is done, what germany needs most is a leader who makes decisions.
u.s. stock-market indexes closed at all-time highs on thursday, while the dow topped the 25,000 milestone for the first time.\n\nwhat are stock indexes doing?\n\nthe dow jones industrial average djia, -0.46% rose 152.45 points, or 0.6%, to finish at 25,075.13. while 25,000 is seen as a psychologically significant level, it otherwise holds no fundamental or technical importance.\n\nthe s&p 500 spx,

according to the wall street journal market data group. the nasdaq did the same, for the first time since 1999.\n\nnine of the 11 primary s&p 500 sectors rose on the day, though most of the moves were

alphabet inc. googl, -2.92% amazon amzn, -3.44% , and netflix nflx, -3.75%\n\nwhat's driving the market?\n\nu.s. stock markets have risen on every single day of the new year so far, as the global trading mood from 2017 stayed strongly positive. analysts said the upbeat sentiment is buoyed by a protracted rise in commodity prices, solid economic data, and bond yields remaining at historic lows. the recently passed tax-reform legislation has also been cited as a contributing factor.\n\nin asia on thursday, japan's nikkei 225 index nik, -1.41% ended at a 26-year high, while in europe, stocks rose almost across the board.\n\nenergy companies contributed to the global gains, tracking a rise in oil prices. crude futures were trading around three-year highs as antigovernment protests continued in iran. the riots, which have left more than 20 people dead, have prompted fears of a disruption to crude output from opec's third-largest producer, which would limit global oil supply and support prices.\n\nwhat are strategists saying?\n\nmomentum was the single-biggest factor driving prices in 2017, and that remains the case so far this year. valuations are stretched, no question, based on historical standards, but they're ok relative to bond yields and inflation, which means we're not overly concerned about them at this juncture, said michael mullaney, director of global market research at boston partners.\n\nread:fed minutes show a divide over its own forecast of 3 rate hikes this year\n\nwhat's the latest economic data?\n\nprivate-sector hiring was stronger than

however.\n\nseparately, weekly jobless claims rose by 3,000 to 250,000 in the latest week.\n\nboth reports are seen as a precursor to the closely watched nonfarm payrolls report on friday, although the two data sets sometimes vary widely.\n\nif you breach 300,000 on claims, then you're skating on thin ice. we're nowhere near that, said mullaney. data like this continues to demonstrate the

coca-cola co. said wednesday that it's launching new branding and new flavors for diet coke in january to appeal to millennials, but marketing experts say that's only step one towards capturing younger consumers.\n\nthe beverage giant said diet coke isn't being reformulated, but is re-energizing for a different consumer demographic.\n\nwe're modernizing what has made diet coke so special for a new generation, said rafael acevedo, coca-cola north america's group director for diet coke, in a statement.\n\nthe four new flavors are: ginger lime, fiesty cherry, zesty blood orange and twisted mango. there will also be a marketing campaign launching this month. and, while the old packaging will still be available, diet coke will also have a new look available that the company calls sleek.\n\ncan boxed water compete against bottled water?\n\nsee:mcdonald's super-sized growth potential spells trouble for competing fast-food chains\n\nwe set out to demonstrate progressive change and innovation with a look that would appeal to a consumer seeking bolder flavors, but without alienating the loyal diet coke fan base, said james sommerville, vice president of coca-cola ko, -1.31% global design, in a statement.\n\nsoda consumption has declined as health and wellness concerns have grown and consumers seek beverages with less sugar and others increasingly avoid sugar substitutes. more than half of u.s. adults and teens are trying to get less sugar in their diet, according to an npd group report from september 2017. shoppers are separating sugary foods into healthy and indulgent categories.\n\nconsumers are more likely to cut back on cola drinks than fruit juices because they feel that juice has more nutritional benefits and the sugar is naturally occurring, npd wrote.\n\nread:'raw water' competes with bottled water and soda — why you should avoid all three\n\nmillennials are also highly informed consumers, with access to data at their fingertips through mobile devices and other technology. keenan beasley, co-founder of marketing agency blkbox, thinks this diet coke rebranding is a step in the right direction, but simply a first step.\n\nsugary, carbonated or artificially flavored beverages are struggling with this group, beasley said. so while new packaging will make shoppers stop and take a second look, it's what's inside the can that will give millennials pause.\n\nthey've prioritized 'coke' on their packaging, which is where there's still some negative connotation, with consumers moving away from sodas, he said. yes, you maintain your brand equity, but that might be what's hurting you a bit.\n\ncoca-cola has focused on the sugar content in their products, looking at ways to change their formulas to lower the amount of sugar included.\n\nwe're also making our low- and no-sugar drinks more visible and easier to find, while adding vitamins, minerals, electrolytes and more sophisticated flavors to many of our most popular drinks, the company wrote in a february 2017 post on its website.\n\ndon't miss:make these 5 easy changes to your diet if you want to live longer\n\nbeasley thinks that addressing the sugar issue is a good path for the company. it's also something that packaging alone doesn't solve. still, making an impression on the grocer's shelf is important.\n\nwhen we look at these consumer products, what they're trying to always do is make sure they have attention on their product at the point of sale, beasley said.
if you're on retirement's door step, say five to 10 years away from the day you want to call it quits, now may not be the time to do nothing.\n\ninstead, now — with the market down, call it 11% since last july, and volatility increasing greatly here in the first part of 2016 — would be a good time to double check everything and anything having to do with your retirement plan.\n\nhow financially ready are you for retirement?\n\nlet's start with the big picture. have you identified your how financially ready you are for retirement?\n\nfidelity investments suggests that you need 10 times your final salary in your next egg by age 67 to fund your retirement lifestyle. if you're not on track, consider one or more of the following tactics: increase your savings rate, retire later than planned, change your asset allocation, and reduce your current and/or future standard of living.\n\npowerball losers celebrate for a community win\n\nreview your investment policy statement\n\nif you're on track, and even if you're not, now is a good time to revisit your asset allocation, how much you're supposed to have invested in stocks, bonds, and cash, and determine whether your current asset allocation is out of whack with your investment policy statement or ips.\n\nthe ips is document you should have created when you first started investing and the one you should have revised and updated at the end of 2015 or start of 2016. among other things, your ips tells you when to rebalance your portfolio, when to adjust your allocation back to its target asset allocation.\n\nread: don't panic, don't sell — plan\n\nwhen thinking about your target allocation, consider not just your time horizon, risk tolerance and investment goal, but also how others are investing funds aimed at pre-retirees. for instance, fidelity's freedom 2025 fund fftwx, +0.13% , a fund designed for someone who plans to retire in about nine years, has 68% of its assets invested in stocks, 24% in bonds, and 7%. by contrast, the target asset allocation for a 60-year-old might be 40% stocks, 60% bonds if you use the rule of thumb that has you subtracting your age from 100 to determine what percent to invest in stocks and bonds.\n\nnow would be a good time to create an ips if you don't have one, or double check whether there's any need to tweak your portfolio. this document and this document alone should dictate what you do with your investments — whether you sell or buy or do nothing — not your emotions.\n\ndouble check your psyche\n\nnow's a good time to review whether your psyche, not just your portfolio, can handle all this volatility. as those who study behavioral economics know full well, investors dislike losses more than we enjoy gains, but a two to one margin. losses make investors anxious and question everything. given that, don't let the declines in the market psyche you out unless the losses trigger action required by your ips.\n\ndouble check your risk capacity\n\nrevisit too, something we'll call your capacity for risk, how much money you can lose before it starts to adversely affect your proposed retirement lifestyle. yes, it's good to know what percent declines your portfolio can suffer (down say 5% or 10%) without it adversely affecting your proposed standard of living in retirement. but it's also good to know the absolute dollar amount you can lose without it putting a damper on your future lifestyle.\n\nand to know that you need to know this: what's the bare minimum portfolio you need that will produce sufficient income to fund your retirement? if you have a $1 million portfolio and can withstand a loss of $100,000 before it adversely affects your lifestyle than that's the point at which you would rejigger your portfolio. again, it's your plan — not your emotions — that dictate when and what you'll do.\n\ndouble check or create a plan b\n\nto be fair, there's always plenty of slip between cup and lip. our best-laid plans — for whatever reason — sometimes go awry. so the final thing you should create or double check, is your plan b, especially if your assets aren't sufficient to fund your future lifestyle.\n\nbesides the usual bromides (retiring later, increasing savings, adjusting one's asset allocation, and reducing expenses now and in the future), look for other ways to make sure you have enough money to fund, if nothing else, your essential living expenses in retirement.\n\nfor instance, having a reverse mortgage with a line of credit might come in handy during times like these, especially if you want to avoid withdrawing money from retirement accounts when markets are falling. read how to use a reverse mortgage to protect your retirement income. consider too borrowing against the cash value in a whole life policy.\n\nthere are plenty other ways to create income in retirement. and times like this might require a visit to a qualified and competent adviser who can not only hold your hand when markets tank, but identify ways for you to generate cash flow in retirement.\n\nrobert powell is editor of retirement weekly, published by marketwatch. follow his tweets at rjpiii. got questions about retirement?

prime minister theresa may on tuesday said the u.k. will seek a bold new trade deal with the european union and leave the bloc's single market, as she delivered a much-anticipated speech that confirmed a so-called hard brexit is in the works.\n\nthe british pound gbpusd, is trading more than 2% higher after her remarks. one analyst said sterling's surge comes as concerns about an uncontrolled brexit diminish, while another saw a textbook short squeeze.\n\nread more:brexit means leaving the eu's single market, says u.k. leader may\n\nand see:ftse 100 slips as may signals britain will leave eu's single market\n\nbelow are some of the initial reactions from analysts:\n\n• the tone of the speech, conciliatory in nature towards her eu counterparts, was also quite savvy, in that in coming across as measured and reasonable she has occupied the moral high ground to some degree. ... currency markets certainly liked the sound of the speech, with the pound rallying hard in the aftermath, reversing all its declines from sunday night as concerns about an uncontrolled brexit diminish.\n\nin reality, the seeds of today's sterling rally were sown late last night, when the outline of the speech made its way into the mainstream.\n\n— michael hewson, chief market analyst at cmc markets\n\n• we're seeing a textbook short squeeze in the pound today following theresa may's press conference ... . the one revelation that stood out though was the intention to put any deal before parliament, which in theory should tip the balance slightly further away from a 'hard brexit,' even if may acknowledged that we will not be seeking access to the single market. this triggered a rally in the pound which in turn was the catalyst for the short squeeze that followed.\n\n— craig erlam, senior market analyst at oanda\n\ntheresa may says u.k. will exit eu single market\n\n• theresa may's speech began with caution and a heavy dose of sympathy for euroskeptics, but a desire to use this 'moment of change' to reach beyond europe's borders and recall a british culture that is 'profoundly internationalist' gave the rhetoric a grandeur and a sense of optimism. at times it was just rhetoric, with talk of 'certainty at every stage' somewhat hollow in light of no graspable plans, yet the commitment to a vote on may's final strategy in both houses of parliament will provide no end of hope to the 'remain' camp.\n\ntwo percent gains for sterling confirm a directional change that could mark a shift in brexit sentiment.\n\n— richard de meo, managing director at foenix partners\n\n• the speech meticulously outlined the 12 objectives to a brexit, with theresa acknowledging that a transitional deal would be probable in a bid to avoid a brexit 'cliff edge' for business. although theresa also proposed to remove the u.k. from the eu's customs union in the pursuit of a clean brexit, this will be replaced with a new customs agreement with the eu.\n\na key talking point and comment that played a critical role in the sterling's resurgence was how theresa promised a parliamentary vote on britain's deal to leave the eu.\n\n— lukman otunuga, research analyst at fxtm\n\nthis story was first published on jan. 17, 2017.
last year was tumultuous, to say the least. but the good news is that trying times like these test your investment approach.\n\nhere are three key lessons i learned from my struggles, market calls and victories in 2020.\n\nbefore you hate me, yes, i made mistakes too. in a second 2020 review, i will review my blunders and lessons learned from them. but first, here are the key lessons from my wins last year.\n\nlesson #1: company insiders point us to stocks that outperform\n\nfor my investment column here and in my stock letter brush up on stocks (see the link in bio below), i closely follow insiders every day to get a handle on what stocks look the best. insiders also give us a read on sector and market trends.\n\nthe catch here is that not every large insider purchase is bullish. you need a system that weeds out the best signals. i've developed one in two decades of studying insiders. i can't reveal my entire system. but one example: look for groups of insiders buying in concert known as cluster buys.\n\n\n\nyou also have to do the hard work of company analysis. this is too complex to explain in a few sentences. at a high level, i look for plausible story lines that point to success — rendered more believable by the insider buying. (all management teams are bullish, so that alone means nothing.) i also look for qualities like financial strength and clean accounting, and i try to get a handle on the quality of the product or service.\n\nseveral stock calls from 2020 using my insider-based system confirmed that it worked well. here are four examples.\n\nexample #1: six stocks suggested in the midst of the maelstrom in a march 16 column using this approach advanced 106% by year-end. that was more than twice the 51% return for the dow jones industrial average djia, +0.58% over the same time. it was almost twice the 57% gain in the s&p 500 spx, +0.29% , and better than the 87% gain for nasdaq comp, +0.40% .\n\nexample #2: my approach helped me beat a well-known expert in biotech in an informal faceoff. in a march 24 column, i asked biotech analyst michael yee at jefferies for his favorite names. i also suggested two of my own. by the end of the year, his three were up 1%. mine were up 123%. mine also did better than the 48% gain for the ishares nasdaq biotechnology etf ibb, +0.70% and the 90% gain for the spdr s&p biotech etf xbi, +1.12% ).\n\nthe names? his three were amgen amgn, +1.64% , gilead sciences gild, +0.64% and vertex pharmaceuticals vrtx, -0.87% . mine were kodiak sciences kod, +4.13% and acadia pharmaceuticals acad, +0.77% . i consider both of these holds now, not buys or sells.\n\nexample #3: in a may 20 column i used my system to narrow down a goldman sachs list of high-quality dividend stocks in technology to find the best ones. the concept was that investing in established tech companies that pay yield would offer income and capital appreciation as the global economy recovered.\n\nmy five stocks advanced 40% by the end of the year, compared with an average of 25% for what are considered to be among the best dividend etfs. my five stocks were: intel intc, +1.54% , texas instruments txn, +1.25% , qualcomm qcom, +0.20% , cognizant technology solutions ctsh, -0.04% and analog devices adi, +0.71% . the five dividend etfs i competed against were: vanguard high dividend yield vym, +0.24% , vanguard dividend appreciation index fund vig, -0.02% , wisdomtree global ex-us quality dividend growth dnl, +0.11% , spdr s&p dividend sdy, -0.26% and ishares select dividend dvy, +0.50% .\n\nexample #4: contrarian bets based on my system even worked against well-known investing experts like warren buffett and his team at berkshire hathaway brk.b, +0.20% . they cleared out of airlines in the first quarter, presumably on covid-19 fears. but my system favored the group. seven airline stocks taken from my stock letter for this may 26 marketwatch column advanced 43.6% by the year end vs. 25.6% for the s&p 500. my airlines portfolio in this column included the ones buffett sold.\n\nlesson #2: it pays to be contrarian\n\nto do better than other investors, you have to be different, especially when they have bunched up in a crowd. this is called contrarianism.\n\nbut you can't just spot a crowd and say they are wrong. that is too simple. you also have to have a solid thesis based on fundamentals. because not all crowds are wrong. for example, the crowd loved tesla tsla, +3.68% at $600 in early december. then it went above $720 by the first day of trading this year. anyone who was short got creamed. likewise, the crowd loved technology in 1996. it went on to post phenomenal gains over the next four years.\n\nbeing contrarian isn't easy, because the crowd is always telling you that you are wrong. but it is very rewarding, as you can see examples below. the best thing is that contrarianism will continue to work because it takes advantage of part human nature which is unlikely to change soon. people love to join crowds — and then let groupthink cloud hijack their rationality.\n\nhere are five examples of how contrarianism paid off in 2020.\n\nexample #1: i took a decidedly contrarian stance near the lows for the year in a march 25 column favoring all the hardest-hit sectors that the crowd hated the most. at the time, it didn't make sense to me that covid-19 would wipe out growth for years, as stock prices suggested. i figured the federal reserve, washington, d.c., and biopharma companies would step in to fix things with stimulus, vaccines and therapies.\n\nso, i used my system of insider analysis and company analysis to single out my favorites in the worst hit sectors. my 20 stocks were up 64% by the end of the year, a lot better than the 51.7% gain for the s&p 500, and the dow jones industrial average gain of 44.4%. my group of stocks lagged behind the 75% gain for nasdaq, because it contained no tech.\n\nthe march 25 column mirrored a theme i was suggesting in my stock letter. eight public-gathering-space stocks in my letter on march 17 were up 108% by the end of the year, more than twice the 49% gain for the s&p 500 over the same time. my contrarian names were in airlines, banking, housing energy and what i called public gathering space stocks. my stock letter portfolio included names like cedar fair fun, -0.19% , royal caribbean cruises rcl, +2.16% , carnival ccl, +2.41% , planet fitness plnt, +1.31% and churchill downs chdn, +1.18% .\n\nexample #2: a group of five contrarian great outdoors names i picked with help from money manager eric marshall at hodges capital management in dallas in a may 14 column were up 112.7% by the end of the year. that was more than three times the 31.7% gain in the s&p 500, and almost double the 59.6% gain in the russell 2000, an apt comparison since our five names are mid-cap stocks.\n\nexample #3: in july, the consensus call was that insurance companies would get slammed by claims from businesses shuttered by covid-19. the fear was they'd get hit by business-interruption claims, meddling politicians who want to socialize virus-related losses, and a prolonged slowdown that could cripple demand. but these worries seemed overblown. there were bullish capacity and pricing trends in the sector, and there still are.\n\nplus, i thought the economy would recover sooner than the crowd expected. as people came around to my view, the group of six insurers in a july 8 column beat the market by advancing 19.6% by year-end, compared with 18.5% for the s&p 500. i think this play still has legs. a group of 10 insurers i put in my stock letter on july 6 was up 29% by the end of the year, compared with 19.4% for the s&p 500.\n\nexample #4: this wasn't a matter of simply always being bullish. i also made a contrarian call suggesting caution in an aug. 27 column, because investors were too bullish and insiders were cautious. by sept. 22, the s&p 500 had fallen 7%.\n\nexample #5: here's a bonus lesson in contrarianism: it pays to go with safer power brands. in an april 14 column, i went with five of them. one criteria was they had to be in the public space group i liked the most at the time. by the end of the year, these five names were up 55%, compared with 32% for the s&p 500. the five were: walt disney dis, +0.51% , mcdonald's mcd, +1.93% , nike nke, +0.12% , starbucks sbux, -0.79% and chipotle mexican grill cmg, -0.28% .\n\nlesson #3: insiders aren't the only smart money worth following — and neither is warren buffett\n\nwhen tracking insiders, i usually ignore money managers who have to report as insiders because they own large positions. the reason is most money managers lag behind the market.\n\nhowever, some of them are very good. it is worth knowing who they are, and considering their favorite names. a good medium-term record over three to five years is key to avoid the flash in the pan. (i use morningstar data.)\n\nonce a month in this column i feature outperforming mutual fund managers so we can all learn investing lessons from them. a key angle is their favorite stocks. it's best when they actually dig through their holdings for favored names, rather than go with the obvious. veteran tech money manager kevin landis of the firsthand technology opportunities fund tefqx, +1.91% did us that favor in a march 6 column.\n\nhe looked beyond popular tech companies like alphabet goog, -0.07% googl, -0.08% , netflix nflx, +0.08% and amazon.com amzn, +1.42% . instead, he cited three that did much better by tripling or more by year-end — roku roku, +4.28% , twilio twlo, +3.50% and enphase energy enph, -1.50% . he also suggested chegg chgg, +2.14% , cree cree, +2.06% and solaredge technologies sedg, +2.04% , which more than doubled, and nvidia nvda, +0.38% , which almost doubled.\n\nthe key takeaway here: the media love buffett, but he isn't the only investing guru to follow closely.\n\nmichael brush is a columnist for marketwatch. at the time of publication, he owned kod, acad, ccl and chdn. brush has suggested amgn, gild, kod, acad, intc, txn, qcom, ctsh, adi, brkb, tsla, fun, rcl, ccl, plnt, chdn, dis, mcd, nke, sbux, cmg, googl, nflx, amzn, cree and nvda in his stock newsletter, brush up on stocks. follow him on twitter @mbrushstocks.
valeant pharmaceuticals international, the beleaguered specialty pharmaceutical and medical device company, has a lot to do to reassure investors and the regulators before its executives sign its 2015 annual report.\n\nthe company's auditor, pricewaterhousecoopers, will have to do more, too, to check and double-check their numbers and the disclosures, before signing an opinion on those financial statements at the end of february.\n\nso much has happened at valeant us:vrx in the last year. as a result, pwc will almost definitely consider the company a high risk client, says j. edward ketz, an associate professor of accounting at penn state university. ketz says that means pwc's audit scope, level of effort and cost should be considerably higher this year. in 2014 the company paid pwc $12.6 million for its audit and an additional $3.5 million for tax services.\n\nvaleant has seen its relationship with mail-order specialty pharmacy philidor, one it didn't disclose for nearly a year, change dramatically from late 2014, when it purchased an option to buy the company, to the end of 2015, when it had completely severed all ties and shut down philidor after the relationship was exposed.\n\nvaleant would have been required to revise its revenue recognition and inventory accounting approaches regarding philidor activity three times in the last 18 months. initially, valeant said it recognized revenue immediately when shipping to philidor. then after purchasing the option, it said it changed its approach and began to consolidate philidor inventory on its balance sheet and delayed recognition of revenue until sales were made to final customers. finally, valeant would have reversed course again after announcing october 30 that the relationship with philidor was finished.\n\nketz says there has been no independent proof that valeant ever actually accounted for philidor revenue and inventory correctly, before or after it purchased the option to buy philidor.\n\nvaleant may have never implemented the correct approach before they ended the relationship. if i were pwc, i'd want to look very closely at this situation, he said.\n\nunder section 10a of the securities and exchange act of 1934, pwc is also required to independently investigate all of the allegations made by short sellers and others against valeant regarding philidor. the auditor must make its own determination whether anything illegal occurred and what the possible effect might be on the financial statements. pwc also must review the status of any internal investigation of the allegations against valeant, and determine whether the audit committee and the rest of the board of directors have been adequately informed of any illegal acts.\n\na spokeswoman for valeant told marketwatch that its ad hoc committee investigation into philidor is ongoing.\n\non dec. 30, valeant announced that j. michael pearson, its chairman and ceo, had taken a leave of absence due to illness. the company on wednesday announced that howard schiller, a board member and former chief financial officer, will be interim ceo — meaning that he will have to sign off on the annual report and confirm the company's internal controls, and represent that the financial statements do not contain any material untrue statements or material omissions or any information that could be considered misleading.\n\nahead of wednesday morning's announcement, ketz said that the executive who agrees to sign as ceo will either have a lot of faith in ceo pearson or will potentially ask to do his own due diligence before signing. any additional work could delay valeant's filing.\n\nvaleant has previously been reluctant to disclose activities that it deemed immaterial. its relationship with philidor was left out of its disclosures for that reason, according to the company's defense against short seller allegations. however, investors certainly believed the relationship to be material when they sent the stock down 25% after citron research published a report highlighting the relationship and making other accounting fraud allegations.\n\nketz says pwc will need its own independent legal team to make sure disclosures cover all required points and that none are misleading.\n\nwith regard to disclosures of legal contingencies and booking of reserves for possible litigation costs, there may be no situation that yet meets the required standards for disclosure or an expense, but that time may come during 2016, says ketz.\n\ntom selling, author of the blog accounting onion, says pwc will have to take into account everything that's happened to valeant this year when it makes its annual going-concern assessment.\n\nin mid-december, the company said results would be sharply lower than previously expected, largely because of the end of its relationship with philidor. after congressional pressure, valeant said it is changing its business strategy to become less dependent on drug price increases. there's quite a bit of uncertainty over future revenues and high debt, says selling.\n\nyear long-term debt due that year as of september 30, 2015 (in millions) 2016 $ 276.4 2018 3466.5 2019 1919.5 2020 8384.3 2021 3147.9 2022 4604.0 2023 5860.4 2025 3212.3\n\nvaleant also faces much higher expenses for litigation and additional regulatory compliance efforts.\n\na pwc spokeswoman declined to comment on its audit of valeant.
as the broader digital-currency market garners wider attention, the most popular of the cohort, bitcoin, is facing its fiercest challenge for cryptocurrency supremacy in its brief history.\n\nthe no. 1 cyber asset was trading at around $15,000, but down from its mid-december peak near $20,000. bitcoin futures for january us:xbtf8 on cboe global markets inc. cboe, -1.34% settled at $15,055, up 3.5%, while futures us:btcf8 traded on cme group inc. cme, -0.39% for the same month finished with a 2.7% gain at $14,855.\n\nhowever, bitcoin btcusd, +0.94% , despite a late-session jump following a report on tuesday that peter thiel's hedge fund has built a large stake in bitcoin, has been under pressure from a cadre of coins that threaten to supplant it as the most used virtual asset. it is a challenge that the cryptographically produced currency hasn't faced since its debut in 2009.\n\nrecent surges in ethereum's ether coins and ripple labs's respective assets are threatening to knock bitcoin off its pedestal atop the digital currency pecking order.\n\naccording to coinmarketcap.com, bitcoin's share of the cyber-unit market slipped to about 36% at its nadir, representing it lowest share ever even as the total value of all digital currencies hit a record peak at about $650 billion (see chart below):\n\ndigital currency market value rises to records.\n\nit has been anticipated by some bitcoin bears that the asset would eventually be surpassed by ethereum, which has been the second-most valued crypto, but a run-up for ether coins and, recently, ripple could see either overtake bitcoin in a switch referred to in digital-currency circles as the flippening.\n\nmarket participants say there should be little surprise that after the dazzling year bitcoin had in 2017, up 1,300%, takes a back seat to some if its slightly lesser-known rivals. moreover, critics argue that bitcoin has a number of shortcomings that make its rivals better suited to assume the digital mantle in coming months and years.\n\nhere are three contenders that could usurp the bitcoin king and realize the flippening (a term that has been used to describe ethereum's overtaking bitcoin):\n\n1). bitcoin cash ($46 billion)\n\nthe biggest knocks on bitcoin are the slow speed of transaction processing and the costs incurred by digital miners in supporting the blockchain, the decentralized, record-keeping technology that underlies all cryptocurrencies.\n\nbitcoin cash supporters intended on fixing those problems via a so-called hard fork in august that created the bitcoin rival that today boasts a market value of $46 billion, compared with bitcoin core's $260 billion value. in other words, bitcoin cash is about one-sixth the value its larger cousin.\n\nknown as bitcoin jesus, roger ver has been a big backer of bitcoin cash, saying that it is a better tool for transacting business than the original.\n\n2). ethererum ($87 billion)\n\nethereum, sometimes synonymously referred to as ether, has been on a tear. ether coins boast a total value of $82 billion. the ethereum blockchain is noted for the ease with which software developer's can write smart contracts atop the ethereum protocol. those include contracts that can help facilitate the documentation and sale of properties without a broker.\n\nread:this $1 million house is the first to be sold on the blockchain in the u.s.\n\nethereum transactions can be confirmed in seconds by the community of miners who underpin the currency, versus minutes for bitcoin core. the allure of bespoke contracts on ethereum also has helped to give rise to so-called initial coin offerings, or icos, which are often atop the ethereum blockchain. icos have been a popular way of using virtual currencies to fund crypto-related ventures.\n\n3). ripple coins ($94 billion, or $245 billion including units owned by ripple labs)\n\nsan francisco-based ripple launched in 2012 and is unlike most of its peers. it is a centralized ledger of transactions intended to serve as a conduit for bank-to-bank payments. ripple transactions also are measured in seconds versus minutes for bitcoin. bitcoin purists's biggest criticism of this rival is that it is centralized, meaning that someone still acts a third party between transactions and that the company caters to financial establishment.\n\nhere are how some other industry participants told marketwatch they are thinking about bitcoin's dominance in 2018:\n\nripple's recent meteoric surge is a particularly good example of this. also the recent surge in litecoin, which prompted the founder of litecoin to sell all of his coins, is a good example of hyper speculation in less known, yet still highly liquid, cryptocurrencies. people are chasing momentum and short term gains. it's really that simple,—christopher grey, co-founder and coo of enterprise software firm caplinked\n\nsome market commentators think this signifies a structural change, akin to a flippening in that the project isn't keeping pace with more nimble competitors. it's too early to tell whether this is more than short-term market noise, but one thing is for sure: bitcoin is the most resilient project in the world and has a long history of confounding its naysayers!—rob viglione, co-founder of zencash
henrik fisker, a designer of luxury cars, has filed a $100-million civil extortion lawsuit against his former employer, aston martin, which he claims is trying to prevent him from showing his new car at the detroit auto show next week, the wall street journal has learned.\n\nthey are really desperate to stomp out henrik fisker as any type of a competitive force, said his lawyer jonathan michaels, of mlg automotive law aplc. fisker is trying to make a comeback as a well-regarded auto designer after his fisker automotive plug-in hybrid-vehicle venture fell on hard times.
facebook has promised more transparency about ads on its platform, but the majority of users are still in the dark about the kind of information that's been collected on them.\n\nthat's according to a study released wednesday by the pew research center, a washington, d.c.-based think tank. the vast majority of users surveyed (74%) said they were not aware that facebook fb, +2.02% lists their interests for advertisers and that these interests can be found in the ad preferences page on user profiles. those preferences run the gamut from pop culture, consumer purchases and likes to multicultural affinity and political labels.\n\nmore than half (51%) of users said they were not comfortable with facebook making such a list.\n\n more than half of users said they were not comfortable with facebook making such a list about their preferences, the pew survey concluded. \n\none in five facebook users (21%) report they are listed as having multicultural affinity, the pew research survey found. of those, 43% were assigned an affinity to african american culture and 43% assigned hispanic culture, and 10% were assigned an affinity with asian american culture.\n\nfacebook's detailed targeting tool for ads does not offer affinity classifications for any other cultures in the u.s., including caucasian or white culture, pew researchers said in the report.\n\nroughly half (51%) of those in this survey are given a political label. some 73% of those assigned a label on their political views say the listing very accurately or somewhat accurately describes their views, pew said.\n\nthese findings relate to some of the biggest issues about technology's role in society, said lee rainie, director of internet and technology research at pew research center. they are central to the major discussions about consumer privacy, the role of micro-targeting of advertisements in commerce and political activity, and the role of algorithms in shaping news and information systems.\n\nalso see:woman begs facebook to stop showing her parenting ads after baby's death — here's how to avoid upsetting ads\n\nafter a scandal surrounding how facebook data was used by firm cambridge analytica to influence the 2016 elections, facebook has promised to better educate users about how their data is collected and shared. facebook is under federal investigation for privacy violations resulting from the cambridge analytica involvement.\n\ndespite these scandals, facebook actually does provide lots of options for users to control their ad preferences, said abhishek iyer, technical marketing manager, at cupertino, calif. security firm demisto. but it apparently has not communicated these tools well enough to users, he added, if only 1 in 4 users is aware of the ad preferences page.\n\nif we accept the premise that no ad is really 'good' and businesses driven by ad revenue will always be incentivized in anti-user ways, facebook at least tries to give users more preferences through these features, he said. but there seems to be a difference between intent and effect here.\n\n facebook said it often receives complaints from users that ads are not relevant, so it tries to promote useful ads, while not violating user privacy. \n\nfacebook spokesman joe osborne told marketwatch the company encourages discussions about ad transparency and controls. the interests list is generated by user actions on facebook, like clicking on certain posts on pages like your favorite sports teams or clicking on other ads, he added.\n\nosborne said facebook often receives complaints from users that ads are not relevant, so the company tries to balance making ads useful while not violating user privacy.\n\nwe want people to understand how our ad settings and controls work, he said. that means better ads for people. while we and the rest of the online ad industry need to do more to educate people on how interest-based advertising works and how we protect people's information, we welcome conversations about transparency and control.\n\nhow to change your preferences:\n\n• the list of interests facebook thinks you have can be found under settings>ads>your ad preferences. here, you can eliminate interests that are not relevant to you or delete all interests to preserve your privacy. facebook allows users to modify these preferences by clicking the x button in the upper right-hand corner of the topic itself.\n\n• facebook has a special section for controlling advertisements about sensitive topics, including parenting, alcohol, and pets. to access and change these, you can edit them at settings>ads>your ad preferences>hide ad topics.\n\n• under ad settings, users can reject certain invasive practices from facebook, refusing to allow it to show ads based on data from partners, ads based on your activity on other facebook products (like instagram, for example), and ads based on your social actions, such as liking a page.\n\n facebook still has a 'multicultural affinities' listing on its ad preference page — meant to designate people who likely have an interest in a racial or ethnic culture, but none for white users.  — —pew research center report\n\nin addition to the data sharing scandal sparked by the cambridge analytica revelations, facebook has been accused of violating the fair housing act in a complaint filed by the u.s. department of housing and urban development (hud).\n\nthe department accused facebook of helping landlords sell housing to specific demographics based on data it collects. the issue is still under investigation. at the time, facebook said in a statement there is no place for discrimination on facebook.\n\nover the past year we've strengthened our systems to further protect against misuse, the company said. we're aware of the statement of interest filed and will respond in court; we'll continue working directly with hud to address their concerns.\n\nfacebook still has a multicultural affinities listing on its ad preference page — meant to designate people who likely have an interest in a racial or ethnic culture, according to pew. you can check your own and see what race facebook advertisers think you are by using the steps above.\n\nthese classifications were often accurate: of those assigned a multicultural affinity, 60% said they had a very or somewhat strong affinity for the group they were assigned, compared with 37% who said they did not have a strong affinity or interest, and 57% of those assigned a group said they considered themselves to be a member of that group.\n\nwhile facebook has been the target of many investigations for such practices as of late, it is far from the only company that engages in these practices, said david ginsburg, vice president of marketing at security firm cavirin.\n\nit really goes beyond facebook and privacy, he said. this is no different from privacy agreements that average 2,500 words or more. the real threat is a society that becomes increasingly fragmented, as traditional networks and media fall by the wayside. subscribers are fed only those ads — and news for that matter — that reinforce their previously-held beliefs.
blockchain technology isn't just for little-known companies trying to make a name for themselves, or struggling former blue-chip companies trying to rebrand themselves as innovative. it is the real deal, as a number of household names have been boarding the blockchain bandwagon.\n\nblockchain acts as a decentralized ledger that can be used to record and verify transactions, without the participation of a middleman. even some wall street analysts who may be bearish on cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin btcusd, +0.94% us:xbtg8, are bullish on blockchain.\n\ndon't miss: here's why ubs is so bullish on blockchain, but not bitcoin.\n\nshares of eastman kodak co. kodk, -5.19% , which hit a record low on jan. 4, tripled last week after the 129-year-old camera and film company announced a major blockchain initiative. kodak, which emerged from bankruptcy in september 2013, was a member of the dow jones industrial average from july 1930 to april 2004.\n\nkodak's stock doubles after camera and film pioneer boards blockchain bandwagon\n\nin light of the kodak's announcement, marketwatch asked all 30 current dow industrials djia, -0.46% members what steps they have taken, or plan to take, to use blockchain technologies for their businesses. here's what they said:\n\nblockchain is the real deal\n\n• international business machines corp. ibm, +0.80% has flung itself full-bore into blockchain. in 2017, the company created a division wholly devoted to researching use cases for blockchain technology. ibm has 1,500 employees who focus on blockchain and over 400 different client engagements and solutions, said marie wieck, general manager of blockchain at ibm. this is probably the most interest i've seen in an individual technology since the early days of the internet and e-business, wieck said. test pilots the company has explored include a collaboration with stellar.org and klickex group to make it possible to perform cross-border payments on the blockchain and a partnership with maersk to digitize the paper trail associated with global shipping.\n\nthe company also operates ibm blockchain, a public cloud service platform based on the open source hyperledger from the linux foundation. with this software, customers can create their own blockchains and explore applications of the technology.\n\nibm has gone a step further and even incorporated blockchain technology into its own internal operations, said bridget van kralingen, ibm's senior vice president of industry platforms. the company's global financing division uses the technology to expedite dispute resolution and reconciliation, while another division that performs maintenance of atms and small-business computer environments has implemented the blockchain to keep track of its supply chain of parts. this is going to change business models. it's a technology, van kralingen said. last year was proving out many pilots and scaling out initial networks, now we're saying this is a different business model.\n\n•unitedhealth group inc. unh, +2.80% said it has been evaluating and experimenting with the use of blockchain technologies in a health-care setting for about 18 months.\n\nit's among several emerging technologies that we're investing in, said mike jacobs, who is officially the senior distinguished engineer and blockchain evangelist at optum, which is unitedhealth's data technology analytics arm. we believe it is going to be a long-term benefit.\n\njacobs gave a presentation at the consumer electronics show in las vegas about potential applications. to get a sense of the interest ces, he said, i've been so busy at our booth talking about blockchain, that he hasn't had time to get a sense of what other companies may be doing in the space.\n\n• general electric co. ge, -2.65% is exploring the possible applications of blockchain technology at its forge lab in upstate new york. the lab also serves as an educational resource for teams throughout the company to learn more about blockchain, said ben beckmann, senior scientist and blockchain mission leader at ge global research. the company hasn't moved any of its applications of the technology beyond the experimental stage, but beckmann expected that to come down the pike soon. we're using the underlying technology to help secure our industrial assets, he said.\n\n•microsoft corp. msft, -2.67% has a website describing, why blockchain on azure?, which is the software giant's cloud offering.\n\nour mission is to help companies thrive in this new era of secure multiparty collaboration by delivering platforms and services that any company—including ledger startups, retailers, health providers, and global banks—can use to improved shared business processes.\n\nback in september 2016, microsoft announced a collaboration with bank of america merrill lynch on blockchain technology to fuel the transformation of trade finance transacting.\n\nin addition, microsoft is working on open source solutions to improve the speed, governance and security of existing blockchain protocols like ethereum, hyperledger, quorum and r3's corda, a microsoft spokesperson said. the solution is called the coco framework and it enables existing ledgers to process transactions at close to standard enterprise database speeds.\n\n•wal-mart stores inc. wmt, -1.31% said it had a blockchain test pilot with mangoes in the u.s. and pork in china, back in october 2016.\n\nsince our successful pilot text, walmart has continued to expand our progress in testing blockchain technology for food traceability and transparency. in august 2017, we joined nine other global food retailers in a blockchain consortium in the u.s. three weeks ago, we announced with our partners jd and tsinghua university in china to launch a blockchain alliance in china.\n\n•jpmorgan chase & co. jpm, +1.65% chief executive jamie dimon has been a critic of the hype surrounding bitcoin, but the bank has bought into blockchain. it directed marketwatch to a website that outlines the mandate for its blockchain center of excellence (bcoe) to lead efforts for the applications of

the u.s. dollar carved out a three-month low, deepening its losses during wednesday's trading session after the federal reserve's december meeting minutes showed a dovish tilt in the central bank.\n\nwhile multiple comments from officials, as well as a lowered expectations of rate increases in 2019 from three to two already pointed to a change of sentiment at the fed, the minutes hammered that point home on wednesday. some central bank officials had been in favor of pausing the rate increases in december already, and many agreed that the fed could be patient with their hikes going forward.

the answer is not very, you'll want to read the seven ideas below that can help you follow through in the new year.\n\nthe start of a new year naturally creates incentive for making changes. days that seem like transition points motivate people to take advantage of the fresh-start effect, research shows. birthdays, the beginning of a semester, and the start of a new week all fall under this new transition time. researchers at the wharton school came to this conclusion after they discovered that visits to the university fitness center spiked during these turning points.\n\nanother study published in psychological science further backs this up. participants found motivation from imagining a fresh start in the form of moving in to a new apartment. they were asked to imagine their new digs and also ranked their level of motivation to pursue their goals. those who imagined that the move was their first one in nine years (versus an annual event) were more motivated to make progress on their goals.\n\nthis feeling of a new beginning appears to empower and make it easier to leave our past self and failures behind and embrace our new potential for success moving forward, researchers surmised. a new year represents a new chance to start over and try again.\n\nhowever, most people don't keep their resolutions because they are more committed to making the resolution than following through, says gina gomez, a certified life and business coach in lake forest, calif. in fact, only 8% of people who make resolutions actually achieve their goal. you must make the commitment and take action.\n\ngomez and other experts offer the following tips for making this year the year you finally reach yours.\n\n1. get clear\n\nyou can't get to your destination if you don't know where you're going, says gomez. if you want to lose weight, take that dream vacation, fall in love or watch more episodes of the good wife, get clear about what specifically you want and why you want it and identify at least three steps on how you're going to get there.\n\n2. take the first step\n\nonce you have a clear vision of what you want to accomplish, begin turning that into reality. if you're stuck, take the first step to finding the resources to help you achieve that goal, says gomez. this may include hiring a coach, reading travel books or signing up on a dating site.\n\nsee: millions of americans are in 'survival mode' — beware, decisions made in this frame of mind can make or break you\n\n3. follow through\n\nit's not enough just to plan and take the first step. once you have your game plan, follow it. think of your new year's resolution the way you would a business plan, says gomez. it does no good to have one if you don't use it. set manageable goals, include some rewards, find an accountability partner and keep track of your progress. this enables you to stay motivated and get consistent results, she adds.\n\n4. reign yourself in\n\nultimately, the ability to follow through on a new year's resolution involves the ability to regulate our impulses, says timothy j. bono, assistant dean for assessment and analytics at washington university in st. louis. our impulse might be to eat a lot of junk food or waste time on social media instead of using it more productively. to override those impulses, we need willpower, or what psychologists call self-regulatory strength.\n\nalso see: how retirement planning needs to change in the new year\n\nbono likens strengthening willpower to becoming stronger physically. if we can get ourselves to exercise willpower in small, everyday behaviors — maybe we resist the temptation to get the candy bar when we're in the checkout line at the grocery store — those are the opportunities that allow our self-regulatory strength to grow. the more you practice, the easier it becomes.\n\n5. expand your reach\n\nin midlife, it's tempting to have all your new year's resolutions focused on dealing with home life and empty nest syndrome if your kids have left, says kristen carpenter, director of women's behavior health at the ohio state university wexner medical center. a better approach is one that enhances multiple areas of your life. for example, resolving to live in the moment helps achieve both personal and career goals.\n\n6. prioritize\n\na long list of resolutions makes it less likely you'll be able to do all of them, so order them. if you already feel as if you're being spread too thin, you likely will not be able to keep multiple new year's resolutions, says carpenter. to edit your list, first rank your resolutions in order of importance and then keep only the top few. this gives you a better chance of meeting your goals.\n\nread: we're 56, have $400,000 in debt, can save $50,000 a year and just want to retire — what should we do?\n\n7. align yourself\n\nask yourself if your resolutions align with your values, says carpenter. if you're crafting resolutions that are not in line with your values [e.g., training for a triathlon that takes you away from your family for weeks at a time], re-evaluate your list and replace the resolutions with ones that are more cohesive to your overall goals. otherwise you're setting yourself up to fail.\n\nfollow these expert tips to create your best year ever.\n\nlinda melone is a california-based freelance writer and certified personal trainer

specifically, japan is poised to deliver, says doubleline capital's bond king jeffrey gundlach, who recently shared his views with barron's regarding the upcoming year.\n\nthe bank of japan is engaged in quantitative easing, and the government is encouraging the purchase of stock, gundlach said. he explained that there have been three sources of pretty much automatic buying of the japanese stock market that totaled an annualized $163 billion in last year's third quarter: pension funds, the bank of japan buying etfs, and corporate buybacks.\n\nadd those buyers to a japanese public that is

movie composer daniel pemberton was driven to scoring music presumably for art rather than commerce. but his last few movies have been all about money.\n\npemberton is a 40-year-old londoner who composed the music for all the money in the world, ridley scott's new movie about j. paul getty's reluctance to bail out his kidnapped grandson, and aaron sorkin's molly's game, starring jessica chastain as poker queen molly bloom.\n\na busy 2017 also saw pemberton score watergate movie mark felt and guy ritchie's king arthur: the legend of the sword as well as u.s.s. callister, the star trek-like episode of netflix's nflx, -3.75% acclaimed sci-fi drama series, black mirror.\n\nafter a career that began with releasing an ambient music album, bedroom, while he was still at school and writing tech articles for computer magazines, pemberton become an acclaimed tv composer. his hollywood breakthrough came when ridley scott hired him to score his 2013 movie, the counselor.\n\nwith his 1980s electro music for danny boyle's steve jobs biopic and a jazzy score for the man from u.n.c.l.e., pemberton has become one of the most innovative composers in a musical era when composers have to find creative ways to engage audiences.\n\nmarketwatch spoke with pemberton in new york, where he is scoring oceans twelve, the all-women heist reboot.\n\nmarketwatch: for all the money in the world, how did you set about scoring a movie about j. paul getty?\n\ndaniel pemberton: what separates getty apart from everyone else is his wealth and power. musically the way of establishing that is by giving him a very grand musical backing. we ended up with a 70-piece orchestra as well as large scale choir. giving one man a 70-piece orchestra and a 20-piece choir is a way of signifying power and wealth behind that person. i wanted his world to feel operatic and theatrical. i'm not saying the music feels like it could have been written by beethoven or verdi but i wanted it to feel in that lineage. getty believed he was reincarnated from hadrian so we played on medieval scriptures too. when we go to the kidnappers, the music became a lot more rural and visceral. i ended up going to a remote part of italy and recording folk singers in sardinia.\n\nmolly's game is a completely different musical score, even though it is also centered around high-stakes finance.\n\naaron [sorkin] very much wanted a strong theme for molly that would pay off at the end. but at the same time i wanted to capture something very contemporary and which felt like the world they're all playing in, the music you would hear at a poker match — rock-influenced, hip-hop influenced, very modern. the guys who playing with molly are very rich but their wealth is very modern as opposed to getty's wealth, which is almost old money.\n\nall the money in the world is reflecting old money, whereas molly's game is reflecting new money. the dot-com billionaires, rappers, movie stars and their world of wealth is different to someone who got rich from doing oil deals half a century ago. so, both movies might be about money but the characters who have that wealth are very different.\n\ndaniel pemberton attends the 'molly's game' uk premiere jeff spicer/ getty images\n\nyou worked with aaron sorkin when he wrote the steve jobs script. but how did you get to score his directorial debut molly's game?\n\ni had a great meeting with aaron sorkin at the four seasons in toronto. if you meet aaron sorkin, you always meet at the four seasons. it's like being in an aaron sorkin movie. he used to be a bartender so we talked about the dynamics of the cocktail market and bartending. aaron sorkin tips very well as he understands what it's like to be a bartender.\n\ni've often worked with first-time directors and they're often very unsure and that results in bad decisions because they're scared of things. but aaron was good at trusting my opinion.\n\nwhat are the biggest misconceptions people have about composers?\n\none of them is this idea that good film music is that which goes unnoticed. that's total nonsense. film music is a character in a film. sometimes you don't want to notice it — it's a supporting actor which steps back and doesn't draw attention to itself. other times it wants to be like tom cruise, a big part of the film. with an aaron sorkin film, his dialogue is so key, you can't interfere with that and you've got to help the momentum of that and not get in the way. whereas ridley scott's films are a bit more visually cinematic.\n\nall you're doing as a composer is trying to capture the essence of the character, story and environment. in these films the aesthetic taste of the characters really influences it [the score]. so with getty, i wanted the music to feel like the world he creates. getty lived in a tudor estate so ridley wanted something to reference that so we put a harpsichord in with the score in one scene to hark back to tudor elements. if getty was a pop art collector, the musical sound of the film would have been very different.\n\nhow is it being a movie composers in an era where not so many people buy soundtracks in record stores?\n\ni think film composing is creatively one of the greatest jobs and it's where some of the most innovative music is being made. there's a resource there for ambitious work which exists nowhere else in the music business because the industry has been gutted. but there's little critical analysis and understanding of it.\n\nsometimes it's disappointing, but in the big scheme of things it's great because you get hired because other people respect your work. they don't hire you because you're flavor of the month. well, they do a bit but not compared to other elements of the movie business. being a film composer is like being a chef who comes up with different ideas the whole time as opposed to being a brand equivalent to mcdonalds mcd, -0.54% that can't change their menu every week. i like to make every job quite different. i love the freedom to experiment and not be pigeonholed. so the lack of scrutiny sometimes from a cultural and critical point is beneficial to film music and it means your work gets to be louder than you.\n\nit's ironic that your public school outside london [hampton school] turned you down to do music a-level [uk equivalent of the high school diploma].\n\nmaybe i wasn't good enough! i came to this from a very unorthodox route and one of the reasons i get on with ridley is he came into film directing from an unorthodox route, advertising. i worked in television for 20 years and he said, you've done your 10,000 hours in the garage. you always get exceptions like mark zuckerberg but generally people who run the biggest businesses didn't take conventional routes and worked out how to do different things themselves.\n\nwhat do composers think when songs not written by them are featured in movies that they score?\n\nit depends. some movies you're like, thank god i don't have to score that scene now. other films, you think, you've given the best scene in the movie to a crappy song! i wanted that.\n\nsometimes it's annoying because you do the hard work and others get the glory. they're like the guys you pass to in soccer who score the goal.
as last year creaked and stumbled and groaned its way to a messy close, lots of investors were understandably spooked.\n\nafter one of the longest bull markets ever, 2018 was a rude and startling wake-up call. and at the very end of the year, the market had a pretty severe case of not knowing what it thought of the future.\n\na friend who's an adviser at fidelity investments called me recently to say he has been hearing from many investors who fear a repeat of what happened to them in 2007 through 2009.\n\nhe asked for advice on how he can help restore some peace of mind to nervous investors.\n\ni suggested he ask them a series of questions so they can get things off their chests and wrestle a bit with some of the issues. that's likely to be more effective than a lecture that might or might not be relevant to them.\n\nsince i retired as an investment adviser half a dozen years ago, i've continued to ask investors questions and help them find good answers.\n\nif i could sit down with you individually, here are some of things i'd ask you.\n\n1. what are the facts? (when you go to the doctor, the first thing that usually happens is getting blood pressure, etc.)\n\nspecifically, what investment returns have you actually been achieving? also, what returns have you achieved over the past five to 10 years?\n\nmy friend told me that typical accounts are down less than 5% this year.\n\nthe s&p 500 index spx, -0.16% appreciated 8.3% a year for the past five calendar years and 13% for the past 10. the average large-cap blend fund appreciated 6.7% and 12% for the five-year and 10-year periods. (returns are through dec. 31, 2018.)\n\nif your own returns are radically different from these, we could try to figure out why.\n\nread: is your retirement on hold because of the stock market? what to do now\n\n2. here's one that is certain to spark a good discussion: who's in control, your brain or your emotions? i suggested my adviser friend get a copy of jason zweig's excellent little book your money and your brain.\n\nzweig shows how our emotions can take over, pushing rational decision-making aside. this may work fine when you're facing an angry mama bear, but it's a terrible way to navigate the sophisticated world of modern finance.\n\neven the best investment, in the hands of an emotional and irrational investor, can't do its job.\n\n3. when you think about your past investment decisions, which ones worked out well, and which ones didn't? why do think some worked and others didn't?\n\nthis lets me get a handle on whether your successes and failures have come from the luck of the draw, from emotional reactions to the market, or from specific, conscious decisions.\n\n4. is your overall goal to beat the market? if your answer is yes, i'd ask you why. if that were really your objective, after a year in which stocks lost 30%, would you want to brag to your spouse or your friends that you lost only 20% of your portfolio?\n\nif your answer is no, that's good. detailed studies of investment results consistently indicate that the vast majority of investors who try to beat the market wind up doing the opposite.\n\n5. is your overall goal to achieve the highest return while staying within your tolerance for risk? if yes, that's a good thing…but only if you know what your risk tolerance really is.\n\nwhen markets are rising or your money is safely in cash, it's easy to believe you can comfortably tolerate losses in the bad times. but when your portfolio actually drops in value, it feels very different.\n\ndetermining your risk tolerance isn't as simple as you think, and it's one of the most important benefits you can get from having a good financial adviser.\n\nfor diy investors, the best tool i know of is an article i wrote earlier this year for marketwatch.\n\n6. is your overall goal to get an investment return that will meet your financial needs at the lowest possible risk? that's also a very good objective, provided you know what your needs actually are.\n\nyou can get a fine start on those calculations from an article called twelve numbers you need to know for retirement. if we were talking in person, going through this exercise could be very helpful. doing it with a good adviser could make a huge impact on your financial future.\n\n7. when do you expect to need to withdraw some or part of your portfolio? this will help determine how much risk you should take and how your portfolio should be invested.\n\nif you expect to need the money within five years, you should not have most or all of it exposed to the risks of the stock market.\n\nin general terms, the closer you are to needing the money, the less of your portfolio that should be in stock funds.\n\n8. have you thought seriously about how you will withdraw money when you retire, and how much? this discussion can lead you to answers to questions you didn't even know you should be asking.\n\nyou can start thinking about this topic by checking out this article and the accompanying tables.\n\n9. if you were not invested in the stock market and were waiting for it to settle down, i would ask what are you waiting for? and how will you know it's time to get in?\n\ni've yet to find any investor who can give me a convincing answer to that question.\n\nthe short-term and medium-term fluctuations of the market are unpredictable, and my timing advice is simple: buy when you have the money available to invest, ideally using dollar-cost averaging, and sell when you need the money.\n\n10. if you were a young investor, say in your 20s or 30s, i'd ask: is it better to invest when prices have been going up, or when they have been going down?\n\nwhatever your answer, this would let me introduce you to dollar-cost averaging (dca). this is a practice that assures you will buy more shares when prices are lower and fewer shares when they're higher.\n\n11. would you like to become a better investor? if your answer is yes, there are lots of good ways to educate yourself. here are three:\n\n•my e-book 101 investment decisions guaranteed to change your financial future.\n\n•my book financial fitness forever.\n\n•what i regard as the best investment podcast of 2018, featuring mark hulbert: lessons learned from four decades of independently tracking investment advisory performance.\n\nrichard buck contributed to this article.
in the later stages of a bull market, the financial media and wall street analysts seek out rationalizations to support their views. a common refrain: there are trillions of dollars in cash sitting on the sidelines just waiting to come into the market.\n\nfor example, barron's recently published the following:\n\nthere is record amounts of cash sitting in checking accounts of american households — and for optimistic investors, it's just one more reason the stock market should keep pushing higher.\n\nyahoo! finance also jumped on the claim:\n\nit should also come as no surprise that there's never been so much cash sitting on the sidelines — nearly $5 trillion, as a matter of fact. this is significantly above the record $3.8 trillion in cash set back in january 2009 during the financial crisis!\n\nmckinsey & co. published the following graphic:\n\nsee: there is tons of cash on the sidelines waiting to be poured into the s&p 500 spx, +0.29% , dow jones industrial average djia, +0.58% and nasdaq comp, +0.40% .\n\nexcept … there isn't.\n\nthe reality is that, if investors haven't drained their bank accounts after four rounds of quantitative easing (qe) led by the u.s. federal reserve, a 400% advance in the markets and ongoing global qe, precisely what is it going to take?\n\nbut here is the other problem.\n\na buyer requires a seller\n\nfor every buyer, there must be someone willing to sell. as noted by clifford asness:\n\nthere are no sidelines. those saying this seem to envision a seller of stocks moving money to cash and awaiting a chance to return. but they always ignore that this seller sold to somebody, who presumably moved a precisely equal amount of cash off the sidelines.\n\nevery transaction in the market requires both a buyer and a seller, with the only differentiating factor being at what price the transaction occurs. since this is necessary for there to be equilibrium in the markets, there can be no sidelines.\n\nthink of this dynamic as you would a football game. each team must field 11 players despite having over 50 players on the team. if a player comes off the sidelines to replace a player on the field, the substituted player will join the other sidelined players' ranks. notably, at all times, there will only be 11 players per team on the field. such holds equally true if teams expand to 100 or even 1,000 players.\n\nfurthermore, despite this salient point, a look at the stock-to-cash ratios (cash as a percentage of investment portfolios) also suggests there is little available buying power for investors. as we noted recently with charts from sentiment trader:\n\na lack of cash sitting around\n\nas asset prices have escalated, so has the appetite to chase risk. the herding into equities suggests that investors have thrown caution to the wind. such also means they have deployed most of their investible cash.\n\nonce you run out of cash to invest, the next step is to borrow cash to increase equity allocations. with professional investors leveraging their bets, there isn't much excess cash sitting around.\n\nmutual fund managers are also holding record low levels of cash.\n\nwith net exposure to equity risk by individuals at historically high levels, it suggests two things:\n\nthere is little buying left from individuals to push markets marginally higher. the stock-to-cash ratio, shown below, is at levels ordinarily coincident with market peaks.\n\nthe reality is that investors are holding very little cash as they have gone all in to chase the market higher.\n\nso where is all this cash?\n\nmoney market cash levels have indeed been climbing. a chart from the office of financial research shows this:\n\nthere are a few things we need to consider concerning money market funds.\n\njust because i have money in a money market account doesn't mean i am saving it for investing purposes. it could be an emergency savings account, a down payment for a house, or a vacation fund on which i want to earn a higher rate of interest. corporations use money markets to store cash for payroll, capital expenditures, operations and other uses not related to investing in the stock market. foreign entities store cash in the u.s. for transactions processed in the united states, which they may not want to repatriate into their country of origin.\n\nthe list goes on, but you get the idea.\n\nif you look at the chart above, you will notice that the bulk of the money is in government money market funds. those particular types of money market funds generally have much higher account minimums (from $100,000 to $1 million), suggesting the funds are not retail investors. (those would be the smaller balances of prime retail funds.)\n\nas noted, much of the cash on the sidelines is held by corporations. as we said in a major support for assets has reversed, that isn't a surprise:\n\nceos make decisions on how they use their cash. if concerns of a recession persist, companies will become more conservative on the use of their cash, rather than continuing to repurchase shares. — september 2019\n\nas we also said in that article:\n\nwhen stock prices do eventually fall, companies that performed un-economic buybacks would find themselves with financial losses on their hands, more debt on their balance sheets, and fewer opportunities to grow in the future. equally disturbing, the many ceos who sanctioned buybacks are much wealthier and unaccountable for their actions.\n\nas we saw, the companies that spent billions on share buybacks over the past decade were first in line for a government bailout last year. now companies are hoarding cash to ensure their survival against a weaker economic environment in 2021.\n\ndebt-driven cash hoard\n\nthe other problem is that record debt issuance by corporations was the main driver of record cash levels. as per the wsj:\n\ncash hoards swelled … after companies issued record-breaking amounts of debt to bolster their balance sheets against the covid-19 pandemic's disruptions. as of nov. 30, u.s. companies had sold more than $2 trillion of investment-grade and high-yield bonds — the most on record in data going back to 2006. … at the same time, many cut share repurchases, dividends or capital expenditures.\n\nof course, the problem with debt is that it is not free money even at low interest rates. the interest on the debt diverts capital from productive investments.\n\ncompanies must use their cash to make productive investments that will generate a return higher than the debt cost or pay down debt. given that economic growth, along with revenue growth, will likely remain weak, the former will be difficult. if inflationary pressures and interest rates rise, as many expect, cash will get used to pay off debt rather than invest.\n\nwhile bullish investors are certainly hoping the cash hoard will flow into u.s. equities, the reality may be quite different.\n\nwhat changes the game?\n\nas noted above, the stock market is always a function of buyers and sellers, each negotiating to make a transaction. while there is a buyer for every seller, the question is always: at what price?\n\nin the current bull market, few people are willing to sell, so buyers must keep bidding up prices to attract a seller to make a transaction. as long as this remains the case, and exuberance exceeds logic, buyers will continue to pay higher prices to get into the positions they want to own.\n\nsuch is the very definition of the greater fool theory.\n\nhowever, at some point, for whatever reason, this dynamic changes. buyers will become more scarce as they refuse to pay a higher price. when sellers realize the change, there will be a rush to sell to a diminishing pool of buyers. eventually, sellers begin to panic sell as buyers evaporate and prices plunge.\n\nsellers live higher. buyers live lower. what causes that change? no one knows.\n\nbut that is how bear markets begin — slowly at first, then all of a sudden.\n\nlance roberts is chief portfolio strategist and economist for ria advisors. he blogs at real investment daily. follow him on twitter.
aerohive networks inc. hive, -6.40% warned tuesday that fourth-quarter revenue will be lower than the company's previous guidance. aerohive said that it expects revenue of about $37 million for the final quarter of 2017, after previously stating expectations of $40 million to $42 million. the company said it expects to report a net loss of $3 million to $4 million, but a non-gaap operating profit after subtracting stock-based compensation and other effects. following the change in our sales leadership at the end of our third quarter, we uncovered underlying sales execution issues which became fully apparent in the last month of the fourth quarter, chief executive david flynn said in tuesday's announcement. we have taken actions to replace underperforming sales team members, and we believe that the new people we have been putting in place, combined with other actions, will enable us to capitalize on our improved product offering and exciting roadmap in 2018. the company expects to fully report fourth-quarter earnings on feb. 8. aerohive shares plunged more than 18% in light after-hours trading following the announcement.

amazon selected 20 cities as finalists for the company's hq2, the company's new headquarters. it could mean a lot for those cities — and the colleges and students located there.\n\na new study suggests that a company's decision to open a new office could push the company to recruit from schools in the area.\n\ncompanies are nearly twice as likely to recruit at universities within 100 miles of a new office in the four years after opening the new office compared to the year before it opened, according to an iza — institute of labor economics discussion paper. and if the new office is in a location where there's a dearth of companies in its industry — say somewhere other than the coasts? the firm is six times more likely to recruit from local universities in the years following the opening of the new location.\n\nwherever they open this office, the local colleges and universities may benefit, said russell weinstein, the author of the paper and a professor in the school of labor and employment relations at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign.\n\nread more: amazon's hq2 would have the biggest impact on real estate in these u.s. cities\n\npaying student loans for the first time? here's what you need to know\n\nit's hard to say for sure whether amazon amzn, -3.44% will follow the pattern of other firms weinstein observed in the study. the analysis focuses on the recruiting patterns of banks and consulting firms at the top 376 colleges as defined by the princeton review. still, some colleges and universities appear to be betting that an amazon headquarters in their region will boost the schools; they're helping their cities bid for the company's business.\n\nweinstein speculates that there are two main factors driving companies' decision to start recruiting locally when they open a new office. for one, it may be costly for the company to conduct a truly national recruiting drive. in addition, they may believe that students already attending college in a certain region may be more likely than others to accept a job there. prestigious firms whose recruiting pipeline is typically associated with elite, coastal universities are willing to hire from elsewhere.\n\ndon't miss: what amazon's hq2 means for homeowners, home buyers and renters in the chosen city\n\nwhen firms open up offices in new cities, not only are they wiling to change where they recruit, it looks like they're willing to recruit at less-selective universities, weinstein said. the analysis is limited to schools at a certain level of prestige, so it's unclear whether schools at all levels of the selectivity spectrum benefit from a company's new office.\n\nprospective students may want to consider these recruiting patterns as they mull where to attend college, weinstein said. for students already in college and hoping to work at a firm that doesn't have an office near their school, weinstein said the results suggest it's important that they can credibly signal to those firms that they're willing to move to a city where the firm is located.

how do you want to improve your life?\n\nsome 37% of americans want to eat healthier, exercise more and save more money, according to data analytics firm statista. the gym membership probably won't work out, based on the number of people who take out new memberships and stop going. and americans still struggle to save partly due to stagnant wages, despite an improving jobs market. but there are some simple dietary changes that could be a life saver.\n\nslow eating could mean fewer calories. people who eat slowly are less likely to become obese or develop metabolic syndrome, a cluster of heart disease, diabetes and stroke risk factors, according to preliminary research presented at the american heart association's scientific sessions 2017, a global event held in november that shares the latest developments in cardiovascular science.\n\n 'when people eat fast they tend not to feel full and are more likely to over-eat. it causes bigger glucose fluctuation, which can lead to insulin resistance.'  — takayuki yamaji, a cardiologist at hiroshima university in japan\n\neating more slowly may be a crucial lifestyle change to help prevent metabolic syndrome, said takayuki yamaji, a cardiologist at hiroshima university in japan and the study's author. when people eat fast they tend not to feel full and are more likely to over-eat. eating fast causes bigger glucose fluctuation, which can lead to insulin resistance. he says the results apply globally.\n\ndon't miss: food for thought: 40% of groceries are thrown out every year\n\nbe vigilant about calories, especially when you're relaxing. americans log nearly 6% more calories on saturdays than any other day of the week, and 3% more on fridays, according to an analysis of millions of calorie counters from weight-loss app lose it! weekends when people are kicking back are also a time for a spike in calories over other mornings (by between 6.5% and 7%).\n\nhere are 5 bad habits to avoid:\n\ncut out the snacks\n\npeople love to eat sweet treats between meals. the packaged snacks industry is worth $33 billion, with households spending $133 every year on snacks, according to recent data released by nielsen, a market research firm. nearly a quarter of people (24%) snack between meals , up from 21% five years ago, port washington, n.y.-based research firm npd group, found in a separate study.\n\non the plus side, health snacks have seen the biggest increase. snacking products that are not genetically modified soared more than 18% in dollar sales for each of the past five years, followed by snacking products that are free from artificial colors and flavors (16%) and no/reduced sugar claims (11%). comparatively, the average snack only had an increase of just over 1%.\n\nalso see:lonely, single people are being blamed for america's snacking frenzy\n\n people have less control over what goes into their meals when they order in. americans get 71% of their daily sodium from processed and restaurant food. \n\nresist takeout food\n\nwhat's more, the number of phone and internet orders for restaurants surged 18% in 2016 to 1.9 billion, npd found. dinner is the meal most often ordered online, and families are the heaviest users of digital ordering, it said. people younger than 35 and those with higher household incomes are among above-average users of digital ordering with apps like seamless and grubhub.\n\npeople have less control over what goes into their meals when they order in, which can take a toll on their health. americans get most of their daily sodium — more than 75% — from processed food and restaurant food, according to the centers for disease control and prevention. people eat an average of 200 calories more per meal when they eat food from restaurants, a 2015 study found.\n\ndon't miss:is this the worst tipper in america?\n\nsprinkle less salt\n\nexcess sodium can increase your blood pressure and your risk for a heart disease and stroke, the centers for disease control and prevention says. together, heart disease and stroke kill more americans each year than any other cause. americans get 71% of their daily sodium from processed and restaurant food. cooking for yourself is the safest and healthiest option.\n\nnearly 9 in 10 us children eat more sodium than recommended, and about 1 in 9 children has raised blood pressure, the cdc says. people should consume less than 2,300 milligrams of sodium each day, the cdc recommends, and those aged 51 and over and african-americans should limit that to 1,500mg. however, most americans are consuming 3,400 milligrams of salt per day.\n\nrelated reading: americans rekindle their deadly love affair with salt\n\nhow changing consumer tastes are shaking up the food industry\n\n artificially sweetened beverages may be linked to an increased risk of stroke and dementia, according to the american heart association's journal stroke. \n\nstop drinking soda\n\na new york times story published last year said president trump consumes a dozen diet cokes every day. but researchers are divided over whether diet soda actually helps people lose weight, according to a 2017 review of studies published in the canadian medical association journal. one theory: diet soda may condition the body to expect calories.\n\nartificially sweetened beverages may be linked to an increased risk of stroke and dementia, according to the american heart association's peer-reviewed journal stroke. another 2015 study found that older women who consume two or more diet sodas per day are 30% more likely to suffer a cardiovascular event. add that to more research suggesting regular soda is linked to obesity.\n\nalso read:bottled water has finally overtaken soda — why you should avoid both\n\nbe careful of booze\n\none in eight americans battled alcohol addiction, according to a september 2017 study published in jama psychiatry, a peer-reviewed journal. the united states is facing a crisis with alcohol use, one that is currently costly and about to get worse, it said. treating hangovers is now a multi-billion industry, experts say, and costs the u.s. $223 billion in medical costs.\n\neven light alcohol use is linked with increasing the risk of several leading cancers, including those of the breast, colon, esophagus, and head and neck, according to recent research reviewed by the american society of clinical oncology. the society cites between 5% and 6% of new cancers and cancer deaths globally as directly linked to alcohol.
halliburton co. hal, -5.05% shares rose 1.2% in premarket trade monday after the company reported higher-than-expected fourth-quarter profit and revenue. the company reported a loss of $825 million, or a loss of 94 cents per share, after a loss of $153 million, or a loss of 17 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. the latest results include charges relating to tax reform in the u.s. and venezuela receivables, the company said. adjusted earnings-per-share were 53 cents, compared with the factset consensus of 46 cents. revenue rose to $5.9 billion from $4.0 billion, above the factset consensus of $5.6 billion. halliburton said it recorded an aggregate $882 million in non-cash discrete tax charges in the fourth-quarter as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017, which is a provisional amount that is subject to change. the company also said it continues to have delays in collecting payments on receivables from its primary customer in venezuela. halliburton shares have risen 22% over the last three months, compared with a 9% rise in the s&p 500 spx, -1.48% and a 11.8% rise in the dow jones industrial average djia, -0.46% .
elaborating on a speech she delivered on monday, kansas city fed president esther george said the central bank's shrinking portfolio of bonds may be a fair explanation for what's driving stock-market spx, -0.16% volatility. this idea that it was like paint drying, i didn't really embrace that, she told the wall street journal in an interview. you have to continually watch it. that said, george told the newspaper the fed hasn't reached the conclusion it was necessary to change the pace of the bond roll-off. george reiterated to the newspaper that she now advocates for some patience before the fed raises interest rates further.
some of the most remarkable moves in the u.s. stock market over the past few months have been in companies announcing an initiative related to blockchain, the decentralized-ledger technology best known as the foundation behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nthe stock spikes demonstrate the level of excitement that exists behind a technology some say could prove to be as world-changing as the internet. but two men, each of whom just launched a blockchain-related exchange-traded fund—the first two to hit the market, both of which debuted on wednesday—aren't enjoying this wave of enthusiasm. instead, they're issuing a warning.\n\nthese companies seem like gimmicks, and in some cases it seems like there's misrepresentation with what they're doing. investors shouldn't just be reacting to news that's been coming out but ensuring that what they're investing in has a business plan and a business model. otherwise there's so much risk.\n\nthose comments are from christian magoon, the chief executive officer of amplify etfs, which sponsors the amplify transformational data sharing etf blok, -3.58% . while magoon said he is optimistic about the technology's potential and his fund's ability to navigate the volatile space, he urged investors to resist speculating in stocks he saw as using blockchain to prop up their value.\n\nthe gimmicks magoon was referring to is the rash of companies that have seen their shares spike after announcing investments in blockchain, as recently happened with eastman kodak kodk, -5.19% . other stocks have jumped after the company adds blockchain to their name or—in the somewhat notorious case of long blockchain us:lbcc, which was previously long island iced tea corp., a beverage company—completely overhauling their business to enter the space.\n\neric ervin, the chief executive officer of reality shares, which sponsors the reality shares nasdaq nextgen economy etf blcn, -1.80% , was even blunter about this trend: these announcements seem like last-ditch efforts for people to buy their stocks. they're terrible companies with no business plan and no technology, he warned. something like kodak seems like it could be an interesting and novel use for the technology, but it remains to be seen whether they can even write a line of code.\n\nmagoon and ervin aren't the only one with skepticism about such gimmicks. the securities and exchange commission—which has indicated it wouldn't approve a bitcoin etf—last week encouraged amplify and reality shares to change the name of their funds by removing the word blockchain, due to the speculative mania around the term. the name change was first reported by bloomberg.\n\nthe sec is concerned about the blockchain-naming effect that's occurring, how companies don't seem to be actively engaged in the technology, but are using it to prop up their value, magoon said. he added that they had been contacted by the sec on this matter six hours before our final filing and that they had submitted several [alternative] names which didn't get great feedback.\n\nthe final name—transformational data sharing—reflects what we see as the benefit and future of blockchain, magoon said.\n\nervin said the sec's request was disappointing but not unreasonable, and suggested that as the mania around blockchain goes away there was a reasonable chance the name could be changed back. the company has previously named the fund the reality shares nasdaq blockchain economy etf, while amplify's was to have been called the amplify blockchain leaders etf.\n\nblockchain essentially functions as a decentralized ledger used to record and verify transactions. it is what allows digital currencies to function as a way to exchange value without the participation of a central bank or government. instead, so-called miners on the blockchain solve complex computational problems to validate transactions on the network, and are rewarded with bitcoin or other such coins. due to the way such networks are constructed, it is nearly impossible for such transactions to be forged.\n\nin october, ubs wrote that blockchain was akin to investing in the internet in the mid-nineties, and estimated it could add as much as $300 to $400 billion of annual economic value globally by 2027.\n\njust as internet has transformed our lives with email, e-commerce, or smartphone apps, we believe blockchain as an infrastructure technology can power future disruptive technologies through distributive ledgers, smart contracts, tokens or identity management, the investment bank wrote, although it didn't provide specific investment recommendations.\n\nseparately, hsbc global research called blockchain one of the biggest trends it sees for 2018, writing that the technology could create a money system outside of government, liberalize centralized ledgers like the land registry, create smart contracts, be used within markets and speed up settlements, change the way industry traces supply chains, tracks provenance and more.\n\nboth etfs look to take advantage of this growth area by investing in companies that either derive some portion of revenue from blockchain-related activity, or which invests in blockchain research and development. the amplify fund is actively managed and charges an expense ratio of 0.7%.\n\nhow blockchain can revolutionize government\n\nthe reality shares etf, which charges 0.68%, passively tracks an index that scores companies on a variety of metrics, including how many blockchain patents they hold and what stage of the production cycle their blockchain products are in, among other factors.\n\nthe top holdings of the amplify fund are: taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co. tsm, -3.59% , digital garage inc. 4819, -2.83% , sbi holdings inc. 8473, , overstock.com inc. ostk, -0.56% , and international business machines corp. ibm, +0.80% . for reality shares, the top five holdings are: intel corp. intc, -3.12% , overstock, ibm, cisco systems inc. csco, -1.25% , and hitachi ltd. 6501, +0.67% .\n\nthe amplify fund rose 1.1% on thursday, with nearly 600,000 shares exchanging hands in the first half hour of the day. that level of volume is on the high end for a new etf, and it indicates pent-up demand for such a product. the reality shares product was unchanged on thursday.\n\nmuch of the interest around blockchain has been related to the big price gains seen in bitcoin and other digital currencies. bitcoin btcusd, +0.94% was trading below $1,000 at the start of 2017; it is currently hovering below $12,000, and it nearly breached $20,000 in december.\n\nread:5 key reasons bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies have lost a stunning $370 billion in 10 days\n\nalso:why a

the u.s. economy will likely experience a significant slowdown early in 2021, philadelphia federal reserve president patrick harker said on thursday.\n\non the national level, i'm expecting fourth quarter growth to show modest improvement before a significant slowdown in the first quarter of this year, possibly even negative growth in the first quarter, harker said, in a speech on the economic outlook to a conference sponsored by the philadelphia business journal.\n\nthe government' won't release its first estimate fourth-quarter gdp growth until the end of january. the economy's performance in the first three months won't be reported until the end of april.\n\nharker said the weakness in the should stay relatively short though as the the economy will start to rebound once more americans receive the covid-19 vaccination\n\nharker said the rollout of the vaccine in the u.s. has been incredibly disappointing so far.\n\nthe recently passed $900 billion economic relief package from congress should also help, he added.\n\ni am optimistic that in the second half of this year, the economy, and, frankly, life, should begin to move back to something resembling normal. gdp growth should be strong in the second half of the year and through 2022, before a light tapering in 2023, harker said.\n\nhowever, the recovery will be widely uneven across sectors, harker said. automation is a challenge to the economy. many of the jobs eliminated by the pandemic will never return.\n\nfor example, he noted the pennsylvania turnpike has switched permanently to automatic tolling.\n\nthe federal reserve is buying $80 billion of u.s. treasurys and $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities to help the economy and financial markets.\n\nharker said he personally wouldn't want to change the pace of these purchases this year. the fewer things we change, the better, he said.\n\nif the fed tapers the purchases too soon, it could cause market disruption, he added. i could see potentially that occurring at the very end of 2021 or early 2022 but it is all going to depend on the course if the economy, which will depend on the course of the virus, he said
a majority of americans are renting on the cheap — at least, compared to what they'd be paying if they bought a home.\n\nin more than half (59%) of housing markets nationwide — 442 of 755 u.s. counties — renting a three-bedroom property is now more affordable than buying a median-priced home, according to a new report from real-estate data firm attom data solutions. among the 40 counties across the country with more than 1 million residents, only three had housing markets where it was still cheaper to buy a home than rent one: wayne county (detroit), mich.; philadelphia county, pa.; and cuyahoga county, ohio.\n\nmoreover, home prices are rising faster than wages in 80% of housing markets nationwide, including everywhere from chicago to houston to phoenix.\n\n 'the buy-versus-rent calculus is shifting toward renting being more affordable.'  — daren blomquist, vice president at attom data solutions\n\nthe buy-versus-rent calculus is shifting toward renting being more affordable, said daren blomquist, senior vice president at attom data solutions. with a strong jobs market, americans want to stay mobile and often can't afford to buy near urban centers where they're more likely to get a job at higher wages, he said.\n\ndon't miss: why $1 million can't buy you a luxury home anymore\n\nrenting may be better than owning to build wealth — if you're disciplined enough to invest the money you save by not owning a property, a 2017 study suggested. when considering buying and building wealth through equity appreciation versus renting, and reinvesting in a portfolio of stocks and bonds, property appreciation does not change the results, co-author ken johnson, real estate economist at florida atlantic university's college of business, said.\n\nwhat's contributing to this shift toward renting?\n\ninterest rates rose last year and are expected to keep increasing in 2019, making buying a home with a mortgage less affordable for many — even younger americans who aim to pay off their home in 20 or 30 years and reap the appreciation of a rise in home values. and despite a slight drop in demand in some housing markets, tight housing inventory across the country is still fueling competition for homes and consequently making them more expensive.\n\n large swaths of the new jersey and new york commuting belt have seen double-digit house price increases. \n\nplus, blomquist said, the drive until you afford mentality has made many once-affordable suburbs and exurbs vastly more expensive. large swaths of the new jersey and new york commuting belt have seen double-digit house price increases in recent years, for instance.\n\nthe new tax law has further complicated the math in deciding whether to rent or buy, according to the urban institute. under the 2017 tax code, a family of three with an annual income of $150,000 would be better off buying if their rent exceeded $1,507 per month. but with the new tax code, they'd have to pay more than $1,885 per month to make buying worthwhile. do we expect people not to buy because of these changes? at the margin, yes, researchers at the urban institute wrote.\n\n the new tax law limits your deduction for state and local income and property taxes to a combined total of $10,000. \n\nas marketwatch's tax guy bill bischoff wrote, the new law limits your deduction for state and local income and property taxes to a combined total of $10,000 ($5,000 if you use married filing separate status). foreign real property taxes can no longer be deducted. so no more property tax write-offs for your place in cabo. however, you can still choose to deduct state and local sales taxes instead of state and local income taxes.\n\nrents are rising faster than wages in most markets\n\n more renters may also find themselves priced out of the housing market, because home prices are appreciating more quickly than rents in 59% of markets. \n\nwhat's more, in 52% of markets, including chicago and los angeles, rents are rising faster than wages. and more renters may also find themselves priced out of the housing market, because home prices are appreciating more quickly than rents in 70% of markets. as a result, the old guideline of not spending more than 30% of your income on rent (or a mortgage) has become increasingly difficult to follow in cities like san francisco and new york.\n\ntake huntsville, ala., which had the most affordable rental market in the country back in january 2018, according to attom data solutions. last year, the average renter there only had to devote 22.3% of their wages to rent. but home prices in that area rose nearly 11% between 2016 and 2017, as investors flocked and bought up properties to rent out. and the prevailing wages in places like huntsville aren't as high as in cities like new york or seattle.\n\nso for those who are no longer happy renting, they may not have much choice. it's great in theory to buy in those markets and have a lot of disposable income, but the problem is going to be finding a job, period, or a job that will pay as well, blomquist said.
a new year is upon us, which means many of us are setting new resolutions and starting new habits to better ourselves — and a perennial favorite is the #nospend challenge.\n\nno spend or no buy weeks, months, or years involve cutting out spending on all purchases that are not absolutely necessary. recurring expenses like food, shelter, and utility bills are allowed, but impulse buys like clothing and gadgets are not. the important thing, said andrea karwandy, a 30-year-old office administrator in saskatchewan, canada who did the challenge in 2018, is to customize your challenge to your needs.\n\nyou make your own rules, she said. what may be important to one person (a gym membership, for example) may not be important to the next person. figure out what your priorities are and plan from there.\n\nthe goal of doing no discretionary spending at all for a year may sound insurmountable, but many claim it reset their views of money for a long time to come. so whether you plan to do a no spend day, week, month, or entire year, here are some tips to help you get started.\n\nstart small\n\nit may be tempting to set a resolution to not spend for a whole year, but experts suggest taking a baby step first — maybe by starting with a no spend day once a week or no spend week once a month.\n\ntaking on a month or even a full year is a little like signing up for a gym membership when you haven't even done a sit up, greg mcbride, chief financial analyst at financial site bankrate.com, said.\n\nresearch suggests it takes 21 days to make a habit that won't likely be broken in the future. perhaps start with a no spend month and then incorporate a no spend day, or no spend week, into each month for the rest of the year.\n\nchange your mindset before you start\n\nmariel francis, a financial manager in new york city, first did the challenge in 2013 following a separation from her husband that forced her to reevaluate spending habits. she paid off almost $20,000 in debt that year and saved an additional $3,120.\n\ni hated living paycheck-to-paycheck so i had to make changes in my lifestyle, she said. my life has never been the same, i am forever grateful.\n\nit was tough to do, but she learned so much that she frequently does mini no spend challenges for a week or a month at a time, francis told marketwatch. it is important to be clear with yourself on why you are doing the challenge because it helps fight temptations, she said. the experience also allowed her to examine consumerism at large. she realized that the need to buy is like an addiction.\n\nthe more we have the more we want, she said. i missed buying stuff and then i learned i could do without. it was very eye-opening to understand and differentiate a want from a need. it humbles you.\n\nplan, plan, plan\n\nbefore starting a no spend month or year, take a month or a week at least to document your regular spending, said aimee young, chief marketing officer at financial management tool quicken. this will allow you to see recurring subscriptions, healthcare costs, and other expenses you may not immediately be aware of. identify the categories you cannot cut — those are what you can still spend on.\n\ntaking on a restricted spending plan should always start with a clear picture of where you are today, she said. once you know what you absolutely have to spend to survive you can more easily identify the areas where you can cut or reduce spending.\n\ncreate simple rules\n\npatrick curreri, who did a no spend year in 2011, had one simple rule for his resolution: can't eat it, don't need it. he and his husband, who jointly run a real estate appraisal business in new jersey, saved $22,000 in one year spending only on food and other necessities, he told marketwatch. he credits the challenge with a new outlook on life and plans to do it again in 2019.\n\nby cutting out the physical and financial clutter, it makes the future feel brighter, he said. stuff doesn't matter. our kids matter.\n\ndecide what you are willing to cut out of your life and what needs to stay — and be honest with yourself. in a story about her own no spend year for the new york times, novelist ann patchett said she set a rule that she could buy anything at the grocery stores, including the occasional frivolous purchase like flowers, but couldn't give in to her desire to shop at other stores. this gave her some flexibility, she wrote. i wanted a plan that was serious but not so draconian that i would bail out in february, she said.\n\nfind support\n\nscience shows that making goals public or sharing them with others makes it easier to accomplish them, according to psychology today. post on your social media accounts that you are planning to go a set amount of time without spending and find some buddies to join you.\n\na number of facebook groups and reddit communities participate in no buy challenges and share their advice and experience.\n\nthe website nobuynovember shares support and tips for specific problems you may face in your no buying time, like what to do when kids want to make purchases and how to handle the holidays.\n\nkeep unexpected effects in mind\n\nironically, spending no money at all may not necessarily be good for your finances. make sure you don't fall off the map and confuse creditors or your bank, young said.\n\nas a rule of thumb, you should use your credit card every one to three months to keep your card active, she said. as long as you pay off your balance each month you won't pay any interest or negatively impact your credit.\n\nlearn to barter\n\nthere are loopholes in the no spend lifestyle: as patchett wrote, she regifted books for various holidays. in lieu of buying presents, some give the gift of a certificate promising to watch someone's kids or clean their house. you can also buy used goods and locally made products in some versions of the no spend challenge. spending money on experiences can be more rewarding than buying things — and will leave you with less junk to deal with.

when people do estate planning, they often don't think about supporting the causes that have been important to them. yet, it turns out that most people do want to use their estates to help change the world. when asked about giving during the estate planning process, people give up to six times more if they're reminded to think about it.\n\nwe know this because we co-founded freewill — an online tool that helps people with estate planning and encourages them to think about making a bequest (a gift in will or trust).\n\nhere are four reasons why it's a good idea to think about leaving some assets to causes that are meaningful to you:\n\n1. it makes estate planning easier to think about (and sometimes even enjoyable). only 54% of u.s. adults over 55 have a will that directs where their money will go once they pass away. and fewer than 30 percent of all americans have an up-to-date will. one big reason so many of us die without making our wishes known to our loved ones and others is that dying is an event we may not want to contemplate. framing a discussion in a more positive light — about the impact you would like to make, from saving the redwoods to supporting your local church or synagogue — triggers happy memories. that transforms a potentially miserable process into a source of joy.\n\n2. it's likely to be the most important donation you'll ever make. an internal revenue service study found that a typical bequest is almost three times as large as the total amount that person has donated in his or her lifetime (on freewill, it averages at $69,000). choosing causes on which you're going to have an enormous impact is immensely satisfying. but with so much money at stake, it's worth thinking carefully about where you want to have impact and why.\n\n3. charities are ready to celebrate you. a new bequest can mean a dramatic increase in a nonprofit's ability to have impact. many organizations have legacy societies to honor people who have put a gift in their future plans. people within the legacy society are invited to special events, given gifts and warmly thanked. the cleveland museum of art, for example, has yearly receptions and tours for members of its legacy society. save the redwoods league does something similar. these events give you the opportunity to meet like-minded people and receive recognition for your generosity.\n\n4. thinking about giving at death can change your life today. a will is actually one of the most profound manifestations of your own values. in making the decision about where their money goes, people often end up with a deeper understanding of themselves, what matters most to them, and why.\n\ndon't miss: has the new tax law stopped people from giving to charity?\n\nsome people know which causes they would like to assist; they've been working on issues close to their heart for years. others prefer to explore and understand the impact they may have.\n\nif you're part of the latter group, we recommend checking out these resources to help:\n\ncharity navigator for a summary of financial metrics, mission and similar charities with more than $1 million in annual revenue.\n\nguidestar for detailed financial data on charities based on federal tax filings.\n\ngivewell for in-depth research on international economic development nonprofits.\n\nanimal charity evaluators to understand the impact of those types of nonprofits.\n\nhow to make a bequest in your will\n\nfor many people, making a bequest in a will is straightforward. you simply specify the share of your assets or absolute value you would like to go to a good cause. when doing this, it's worth writing a note explaining why the issue matters to you and any specific element of the nonprofit's work you prefer to assist.\n\na number of sites online (including ours) offer the opportunity to make a will with a bequest. for more complex, or large, bequests, it's best to talk to an attorney.
will the return of a high-profile stock picker from the investing wilderness herald a sea change in the battle between passive and active investing? the aforementioned stock picker, jeffrey vinik, argues as much, making a splash as he announced the relaunch of his tampa, fla.-based hedge fund on thursday.\n\n 'i think this is an opportunity for old-fashioned stock picking. we've had decades, maybe 10 or 20 years, of active managers underperforming passive managers.' \n\nthat was vinik in a cnbc interview, in which he also laid out a bullish long-term market call but cautioned that the coming months could be bumpy.\n\nillustrating where he sees opportunity for active managers, vinik said a strong consumer — buoyed by reduced debt loads, lower oil prices, and rising wages — is good news for the retail sector, but argued that disruption from the likes of amazon.com inc. amzn, +0.33% and others means that it's really tricky where to invest…because it is good for consumer spending, but there's so much disruption that individual stocks, you've got to have a professional picking the right ones.\n\nsince at least the financial crisis, investors have overwhelmingly favored passive strategies that use funds that track indexes, such as the s&p 500 spx, -0.16% , in contrast to actively managed funds, where the holdings are selected at the discretion of a portfolio manager.\n\npassively managed products charge much lower fees, while active managers have struggled to beat their benchmarks across a variety of time frames. active managers have argued that more volatile market conditions will allow them to regain ground by putting a premium on stock selection and analysis.\n\nvinik told cnbc that he expected the industry switch to create excellent opportunities for fundamental stock pickers.\n\ni am confident that the style i have employed for more than three decades — fundamental, bottom-up company analysis…guided by a top-down blueprint of the economy and markets — can achieve strong long-term returns, he said.\n\nvinik became a big name running fidelity investment's magellan fund in the 1990s but left in 1996 after a bad bond bet, the wall street journal said. he returned later that year to launch his own fund but returned investor money in 2000, then took in significant money in 2005, with his firm, vinik asset management, winning kudos for outperforming the market with a loss of 4% during the 2008 market slump when hedge funds, on average, fell 19%. he closed that fund in 2013, telling investors in a letter that it had bagged annualized returns of 17% since 1996.\n\nsince 2013, vinik, who owns the tampa bay lightning hockey team, has been investing his own money through his family office, wsj said.
new year's resolutions, plans, goals, declarations and intentions — i've tried them all.\n\nwhat they have in common is that they work, right up to the point when they don't. which is why i long ago gave up on resolutions, feeling that a single misstep saps courage and wipes out willpower.\n\ninstead, i began goal-setting — making annual targets that were achievable over the course of 12 months, even if i faltered and my path was not straight and consistent.\n\nin 2015, however, i made things infinitely more simple, especially when it came to my financial resolve for the year ahead. it was a good time for a change, as i was going through a divorce; life changes make steady progress difficult and frustrating. the system i adopted then worked so well that i did it in 2016, and will again in 2017. you might want to try it for yourself.\n\nunlike years past when i would make long lists of targets or try to fulfill lots of little dreams, my new approach is streamlined. yes, we all have many things to accomplish, but for the purposes of setting new resolve at the start of the year, a short list is fine.\n\ncan robo advisers manage your money and emotions?\n\nhere's how i come up with three different financial targets/goals as my mission for the year ahead: one is numbers-driven and specific; another is vague but relatively easy to accomplish, and a third is all about answering the question what if?\n\nthe idea is to start the year with one goal you want to focus on most. then add something you'd benefit from doing even if the numbers aren't ideal or perfect. finally, pursue a goal where a successful outcome is a bonus but failure wouldn't be a big disappointment.\n\nmany goals could fit one or more of these descriptions. for example, a specific net-worth or retirement-savings balance could be the concrete goal, as could saving a certain amount of cash to pay for a big-ticket item without relying on credit. broad, generic goals could run from simply increasing savings to decreasing debt.\n\nthe project could be a novel approach to an existing situation, or an attempt to do something entirely new. my own specific goals have involved debt reduction (2015) and heightened retirement savings (2016).\n\ni use debt as a tool, but hate owing money; in 2015, as i completed the divorce process, i looked at outstanding debts and came up with an aggressive plan and a target number. having the specific plan — and i was committed to reducing debt while not cutting or liquidating other savings — allowed me to feel good about my progress.\n\nthis past year, the focus was on rebuilding retirement savings after the divorce, and i put a plan in place in january involving regular deposits and increased set-asides which ultimately led to meeting the savings goal without feeling financial pain.\n\njust as the specific goal flipped from debt to retirement savings, the vague goal went in the opposite direction. in 2015, the idea was simply to add two new mutual funds to my retirement portfolio, with those funds getting regular monthly set-asides. there was no specific target or dollar amount, just the aim to have taken those steps in the right direction before year-end.\n\nin 2016, the focus was on reducing the remaining debt. being vague about exactly how to do that allowed me to set my priorities straight. my primary goal was to hit the retirement-savings target in 2016; once that was secure, remaining monies would reduce the debt without adding the pressure of a specific bullseye. thankfully, i achieved beyond both expectations this year.\n\nthat brings me to the project. in 2015, i tried to save a dollar every time i spent one, so that every time i paid for something with cash, i pocketed the change and set aside a dollar bill and put both in a jar.\n\nthe what-if proposition: what if i saved a dollar from every purchase? how long would it take before i could take a fabulous trip with my daughters?\n\nthis was my personal version of various keep the change savings apps and programs that round up purchase amounts. it was not a spend to save idea, because i was not trying to spend money in order to put a buck in the jar. that kind of fake savings effort gets people in trouble.\n\ni finished 2015 having saved roughly a dollar per day, on average. but i never felt like i was running through cash too fast, so it was easy savings. not quite as mindless as having a program round up a purchase amount and set it into an investment account, but close.\n\nso in 2016, i wondered what if i throw all singles i get in change into savings? under the system of 2015, if i spent $1.47 someplace and paid with a $10 bill, i would put $1.53 in the jar (the 53 cents in change, plus a dollar), with $7 left in my wallet. in 2016, all of the singles in my change went to the jar, so there would have been a fiver in my billfold and $3.53 in savings.\n\nwith a few days left in the year, this had generated about $500 in savings. more importantly, it never made me feel like i was burning through cash. that vacation fund is starting to look healthy too.\n\nto make something more than just a wish or a hope, you have to work towards it; that's true whether you are making resolutions, goals or plans. give it a try. set your targets and decide how you want to try to hit them. having those targets should keep you motivated. and when it comes to your finances, remember that all progress is good. even if you fall short of your goals and resolutions, you're better off financially just for the attempt.
dear moneyist,\n\nfor many years now i am reading your stories about fellow human beings in trouble. never would i have thought that i would need your help too.\n\ni am an 81-year old disabled senior who worked very hard all my life, never took vacations or spent money on myself. after my divorce in 1964 i raised my son alone and always took priority in caring for him and saving money, just in case that something happened to me and he would be alone.\n\nhe became an artist, always hungry. thus, it was without question that i supported him financially whenever need would arise. i am not talking about $1,000 or $5,000, but $10,000 and $20,000. i was confident that i had raised a very good human being and son. luckily due to my hard work and long hours i was able to financially secure myself.\n\n 'i am absolutely disheartened, as my son refuses to transfer my life savings back into my name.' \n\nnow that i arrived at age 81 years i planned to move into a continuing care retirement community (ccrc). having read scary stories about how these facilities can take over your money, i discussed this with my son and when he suggested that i put my savings in his name to protect my assets, it sounded right to me.\n\nand so a few months ago, i transferred most of my savings into his name. he promised to be a good steward of these assets.\n\ndon't miss: my husband grew up dirt poor and doesn't believe in insurance or banks, yet he racked up $7,000 on my credit card\n\nunfortunately, my plan to move into this ccrc did not materialize and, instead, i moved into a very modest rental community. fourteen years ago i had developed an autoimmune condition, which makes me vulnerable to infections caused by impurities. i realized that i indeed would have to move to a better environment.\n\nnow, i am absolutely disheartened, as my son refuses to transfer my life savings back into my name, so that i would qualify to move into a better environment, where they do require evidence of a certain amount of assets.\n\n 'i tried to reason with my son, requesting only part of the assets back, which i need to move into another senior community.' \n\ni tried to reason with my 56-year-old son, requesting only part of the assets back, which i need to move into another senior community, but to no avail. i feel abused as an elderly person and do not know where to turn to get some help or legal advice about what to do when a child takes advantage of an old parent.\n\nof course, in hindsight i recall having always read that one should not give their children one's savings. but i thought that my son, whom i always put before me and financially supported, would not be such a heartless and greedy person.\n\nplease help me with some way out of this dilemma; i am so hurt, have pains caused by all this stress and fear that i am slipping into a depression. i will be very grateful for any advice you might be able to give me.\n\nbrokenhearted father\n\ndear brokenhearted,\n\nwhen you reached the point in your letter where you said your had signed over your savings account, my heart sank. i knew how this would end. not that i'm clairvoyant, but because (a) people do bad things, (b) that was a riskier position than, say, giving him health-care power of attorney or trust and (c) you were writing a letter to the moneyist and, the nature of the beast, is that they often end badly.\n\n there is a legal precedent of 'unjust enrichment.' that means it wasn't merely a gift, but there were strings attached. \n\nthe good news is this only happened a few months ago. of course, it's far more difficult to retrieve money that has been spent, squandered or hidden away. but you have time on your side, and you should immediately hire an elder-care lawyer who specializes in such cases and contact your bank. you are an elderly man at a vulnerable time in your life. the law is (should be) on your side.\n\nspeaking of which, geoffrey kunkler, an estate attorney with the law firm carlile, patchen & murphy in columbus, ohio, says if you had worked with a lawyer in advance, he could have created a trust naming your son as trustee and beneficiary, while retaining the ability to change the trustee and also to change the beneficiaries. this ensures that you would retain certain controls to be able to recoup the funds.\n\nalso see:i earn $15 an hour and will inherit $150,000 — how do i secure my financial future?\n\nnow for the bad news: it might be too late to undo the gift without the cooperation of the son — he may not be able to force the son to unring this bell, kunkler added. this would be the case if this really was a true gift, meaning there were no conditions to the gift — no strings attached. if that is the case there would not be much he could do legally. also, if you were intending to hide assets, be clear with your lawyer, as that could come back to bite you later.\n\n you could have a family intervention. but your son would dilly-dally, putz and futz, and drag this out interminably. \n\nbut. you knew that was coming. or, at least, you hoped it was coming. kunkler points out that there is a legal precedent known as unjust enrichment. that means it wasn't merely a gift, but there were strings attached. from what you say in your letter, this was all for a greater purpose, to ensure you — not your son — were taken care of later in life.\n\nthere must be a paper trail of emails and, under oath, you could swear to the conditions and context under which this money was transferred. oral agreements are tricky to prove, but i urge you to throw down the gauntlet and use the full force of the law. as with so many such cases, perpetrators of financial fraud believe lifelong familial relationships will help deter the victim from taking legal action.\n\nrecommended:i earn $15 an hour and will inherit $150,000 — how do i secure my financial future?\n\nyou could argue that you held up you end of the deal in transferring the funds, but you son has breached the agreement by not safeguarding the funds for your benefit, kunkler says. this could require sending a demand letter to the son or even the filing of a formal complaint to initiate a lawsuit. such cases, he adds, often take persuasion. you owe it to yourself to pursue this.\n\n adult protective services will investigate and assess referrals of abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation. \n\nalternatively, family counseling and mediation are the only options left open to you. a family intervention as a kind of emotional or moral leverage might move your son in the right direction. from what you say, however, my hunch is your son would dilly-dally, putz and futz, obfuscate and drag this out interminably until your time on this earth is over and he keeps your life savings.\n\naside from contacting a lawyer and your bank, marc lowlicht, a certified financial planner and chief executive of opes private wealth management, suggests you go to adult protective services. it's provided by local social services districts. it will investigate and assess referrals of abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation or impaired or vulnerable adults.\n\nyou be an example for your son. if someone tries to cheat you, advocate for yourself and come out fighting. it can be your final and most valuable lesson of all. whether he decides to learn from it, of course, is entirely up to him.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
gold mining stocks lagged behind gains for the precious metal last year, but they could overtake the gold rally in 2018.\n\ngold miners have been underperforming gold for the last several years, which is not unusual during a bear market or falling price, said peter spina, president and chief executive officer of goldseek.com. but over the prior few years as gold has moved hundreds of dollars off the low, miners have not led the gold price higher and instead mostly kept up pace with the gold price.\n\nthat could soon change as analysts forecast a further rise in gold, and gold mining stocks start the year on a strong note.\n\nthe nyse arca gold bugs index hui, -1.75% , which includes some of largest unhedged gold mining stocks, has already gained roughly 2.7% for the year so far. it only rose about 5.5% last year. the philadelphia gold and silver index xau, -2.03% has added about 3.6% year to date, after a rise of 8.1% last year.\n\nthe gains for mining stocks come as gold futures touched their highest levels in more than four months, with the february contract us:gcg8 settling at $1,339.20 an ounce on wednesday, after posting a gain of nearly 14% in 2017. the yellow metal has climbed roughly 1.9% this year.\n\nwe see a breakout at $1,400 in gold, which could mean new multiyear highs, said jeb handwerger, editor of goldstocktrades.com, which offers a newsletter focusing on mining exploration companies. gold futures haven't topped $1,400 since 2013.\n\na decline in the value of the u.s. dollar has recently helped boost dollar-denominated prices of gold, but handwerger pointed out that many investors have been diverted away from mining into much more speculative areas like blockchain and cannabis.\n\nread:are investors selling gold to buy bitcoin?\n\neven investment conferences and newsletter writers who were once gold bugs are now cryptocurrency gurus, and this is very similar to 1999 when gold bulls became dot-com gurus, he said. eventually, we will have another gold rush possibly even bigger than the late 70s but possibly more like the 30s.\n\ngiven all that, he expects a lot of institutional capital to return and significant short covering that could cause the price to gap to $1,750. gold futures haven't settled above that level since 2012.\n\nand the miners boom after gold makes a sustainable move, said handwerger.\n\neven at a $1,400 gold prices, he expects junior gold miners, which are exploration companies in search of new gold deposits, to soar. that could set off a huge [merger and acquisition] push by the major [gold mining companies] to replace their reserves, which have been in decline, handwerger said.\n\nyear to date, the exchange-traded vaneck vectors junior gold miners fund gdxj, -1.97% has climbed 1.3%.\n\nhandwerger believes investors should avoid the royalty companies in this part of the cycle—those that help fund exploration and production projects—and instead look at some of lowest-cost producers, especially in nevada, like barrick gold corp. us:abx, kinross gold corp. kgc, -3.12% and newmont mining corp. nem, -1.13%\n\nhe said he doesn't personally own shares in the large producers, but does invest in the developers and explorers with proven management teams and world class assets backed by top sponsors, preferably below the $50 million market cap, that may eventually get bought out by the majors.\n\ngoldseek.com's spina also had an upbeat view on gold mining and exploration companies. he said he has been taking money out of cryptocurrencies and investing into the miners and juniors.\n\nthere is so much upside [and] risk-reward is very appealing, and i expect them to significantly outperform gold and silver prices in this next leg higher, he said.\n\namong his picks, spina favors golden star resources ltd. gss, -4.00% which has done a lot of work to focus on making profits rather than mining as many ounces, and being smart with their investments into underground operations, he said.\n\nthey have outperformed on the past legs higher versus other gold miners, and expect this to continue this year as well, said spina.

at least donald trump's smoking gun tape is simpler than richard nixon's.\n\nschoolchildren can easily grasp trump's high crime, in contrast to the complex, machiavellian plot immortalized on the tape that led to nixon's downfall. it will be harder to explain to them why congressional republicans decided to hold nixon accountable, but not trump.\n\nit certainly wasn't for lack of evidence. the tape is clear. children can identify the principle at stake. they understand cheating. they know that the loser of a race should not declare himself the winner. they know it's wrong for the loser to try to change the results of the race by threatening those who keep the score and enforce the rules.\n\npresidential coercion\n\nthat is what trump, the loser of the 2020 election, tried to do to the top election official in georgia, secretary of state brad raffensperger, in a phone call on saturday.\n\ni just want to find 11,780 votes, trump said.\n\ntrump lost georgia by 11,779 votes. to pressure this state official to do his bidding, trump brandished the threat of criminal prosecution. he claimed – falsely, baselessly and ridiculously – that georgia's ballots were corrupt even as he was trying to corrupt them himself:\n\nyou are going to find that they are – which is totally illegal – it is more illegal for you than it is for them because, you know, what they did and you're not reporting it. that's a criminal, that's a criminal offense. and you can't let that happen. that's a big risk to you and to ryan [germany], your lawyer.\n\nthe nature of this threat (nice place you got here, hate to see anything happen to it … or to you) won't be lost on anyone familiar with mobster movies. trump's take on the tough-guy cliché wasn't particularly coherent, but it met the trope's two basic requirements. it was both clear enough to be unmistakable, and vague enough to minimize his own exposure to criminal prosecution.\n\ncongress then — and now\n\nin contrast, nixon's smoking gun tape defies simple summary, as i was reminded last year while trying to summarize it during an interview with french public television on le scandale du watergate. i get asked such questions as the author of chasing shadows: the nixon tapes, the chennault affair, and the origins of watergate.\n\nthe nixon tape captured just one small part of the watergate cover-up. but its release led congressional republicans to call on nixon to resign or face removal.\n\nnow, faced with taped evidence that the president is abusing the power of his office to launch a direct assault on majority rule and the integrity of the vote, the foundations of american democracy, most congressional republicans either do nothing or actively support trump.\n\nwhat changed? less than meets the eye.\n\nthe impact of nixon's smoking gun tape had less to do with its contents – and the content of the character of congressional republicans – than with the timing.\n\nas historian mark nevin notes, nixon's smoking gun tape went public at the right time to make a difference. it came out in august 1974, when congressional republicans had their primaries behind them and were looking ahead to the november congressional elections.\n\nuntil they won their primaries, their main worry had been losing their base, which was strongly pro-nixon, no matter how much evidence came out that the president had broken the law, abused the power of his office and tried to cover it up.\n\ngoing into the general election, however, congressional republicans had to worry about losing the middle, the moderates, the swing voters who were disgusted by the daily revelations of white house wrongdoing.\n\nbefore congressional republicans won their primaries, it was politically convenient for them to stick with the president, so they did. after their primaries, and before the general election, it was politically convenient for them to distance themselves from the president, so they did.\n\nrichard nixon as he bids farewell to the white house staff following his resignations. with him are, from left, son-in law david eisenhower, daughter julie nixon eisenhower, first lady pat nixon, daughter tricia nixon cox and son-in-law edward cox. afp via getty images\n\nhow 2020 is and isn't different from 1974\n\nwith the 2020 presidential election behind us, we're now in the 2022 congressional primary season and 2024 republican presidential primary season.\n\nthis means that for most republican officeholders and office seekers, the path of least political resistance is to stick with trump, even if that path leads away from democracy and equality under law and toward authoritarianism and a hollowed-out republic-in-name-only.\n\nby putting constitutional principle over lockstep partisanship, georgia secretary of state raffensperger and countless state and local republican election officials, along with a small number of congressional republicans, have demonstrated their commitment to honest elections. the strength and political courage they have shown, however impressive and essential in the present crisis, are not enough to stop the nation's slide from democracy.\n\nmany congressional republicans, as big fish in red states or hatchery fish in the protective habitat of gerrymandered districts, have little incentive to serve the majority of american voters. until they have to either represent the majority or lose their positions of power, they likely will do neither.\n\nken hughes is a researcher with the presidential recordings program of the university of virginia's miller center. this was first published by the conversation — trump's 'smoking gun' tape is worse than nixon's, but congressional republicans have less incentive to do anything about it.
when donald trump took office as the 45th president of the united states last friday, he got the keys to a nearly $400 million home.\n\nthe value of the white house, located at 1600 pennsylvania ave. nw in washington, d.c., has grown 15% since 2009, when president barack obama first took office, according to real estate website zillow. z, -8.41% the company estimates home values based on physical property, neighborhood and the market. comparatively, home values across the country have climbed 9% in the last eight years.
wonder woman 2 will be the first film to use new anti-sexual harassment guidelines set forth by the producers guild of america.\n\nin this new code, pga, a nonprofit trade group for film, television and new media producers, highlighted a defining clarification on sexual harassment: it does not matter if a person has sexual feelings toward the recipient, only that the behavior is of a sexual nature and that it was unwelcome and/or offensive. the guidelines also suggest all producers comply with federal and state laws regarding harassment, have an in-person staff training to understand the nuances of sexual harassment and offer multiple points of contact to discuss alleged harassment.
london (project syndicate) — one of the most extraordinary things about the current protests in iran — the largest since the green movement in 2009 — is that the very people that they are directed against may well have been the people who started them. iran's ultra-conservative theocrats appear to have thought that by stoking anger over the economy in their political heartlands, they would undermine the moderate president hassan rouhani.\n\nbut, if that is the case, they failed to anticipate the depth of the dissatisfaction of the iranian people with the status quo — especially their own role in it.\n\nto be clear, despite the massive scale of the protests, they are very unlikely to bring down the regime. iran's security forces are too strong and have too much at stake in the current system, which gives them control of vast swaths of the iranian economy.\n\n iran's leadership will be extremely reluctant to withdraw from the forward positions the country has gained across the middle east. amid the current protests, however, the west has a golden opportunity to push iran to suspend its regional ambitions and focus on domestic economic conditions. \n\nmoreover, the protesters are essentially leaderless and lack clear objectives. no matter how much encouragement western powers give them, the protests seem all but certain to end with islamist hardliners retaining their power bases and the islamic revolutionary guard corps retaining control of most of the state's assets and security activities.\n\nbut that doesn't mean that nothing will change. nor does it mean that the west has no leverage to exercise.\n\nit is possible, for example, that rouhani will end up stepping down, whether by force or choice.\n\nbut this would hardly count as success for the protesters. after all, rouhani is the supposedly moderate administrator of a state whose constitution is not, in the eyes of the clerical elite, derived from this earthly realm. if protecting their government's religious purity — and their own ill-gotten gains — required brutally repressing their own people and returning iran to the dark ages, the extremists who would be left in charge would eagerly do it.\n\nprince mohammed bin salman's ambitious plans for saudi arabia\n\nwhether rouhani steps down or not, it is now apparent that the status quo cannot continue indefinitely — indeed, perhaps not for very much longer. iranians were told that the nuclear deal concluded in 2015 would lift them out of economic hardship. but, thanks partly to persistent corruption — iran ranks in the lowest quartile globally in this area — annual inflation exceeds 10%, and youth unemployment stands at 25%. according to gallup, only citizens of iraq and south sudan are more pessimistic about their future.\n\nso far, rouhani has been unwilling or unable to use the power of the presidency to reform iran. but, amid the protests, he is more motivated than ever to improve domestic economic conditions. should he fail, iran may face a larger wave of protests, with stronger leadership and clearer objectives.\n\nany effort to reform iran's economy must recognize the costly absurdity of the country's expansionist foreign policies. funding a proxy war in yemen, propping up a political party and terrorist group in lebanon, and seeking to dominate syria and iraq cost billions of dollars annually.\n\nit should not have come as a surprise when protesters shouted, let go of syria; think about us.\n\niranian citizens are not alone in taking issue with their country's foreign policy. most western and middle eastern governments are also highly concerned about iran's behavior, which reflects a rejection of international norms such as respect for national sovereignty. iran's public threats to destroy america and the gulf states certainly don't help matters.\n\niran's problematic foreign policy is the result not of mismanagement, but of toxic ideology. indeed, two fixed notions underpin it.\n\nfirst, iran's leaders are convinced that global geopolitics is a zero-sum game — a belief shared with russian president vladimir putin. (that commonality perhaps explains the close alliance that has formed between russia and iran.) second — and more dangerous — iran's leaders believe that they have a god-given right to unite shia muslims under a single caliphate. the result is a hostile regime that views its neighbors' success as a threat — and is willing to wage war over it.\n\niran's leadership will be extremely reluctant to withdraw from the forward positions the country has gained across the middle east over the past decade, beachheads that regime hardliners regard as crucial national-security and foreign-policy assets.\n\namid the current protests, however, the west has an opportunity to push iran to suspend its regional ambitions and focus on its desperate domestic situation. if an agreement is reached, existing sanctions can be reduced; if iran's leaders refuse to budge, new sanctions could be introduced.\n\nto be sure, if religious extremists take control of all levels of iran's government, appeals based on iranians' economic prospects will fall on deaf ears. but if rouhani retains the presidency — or another moderate takes his place — there is a chance that such pressure would provide sufficient cover to scale back iran's foreign adventurism and reform the domestic economy. this would minimize the risk of severe violence in iran, while galvanizing opposition to religious extremists.\n\niran is at a turning point. the world must now send its regime a clear message: stop destabilizing the region and help your own people to prosper.\n\nthis article was published with permission of project syndicate — the best hope for the iranian people
the stock market experienced a huge dislocation in the summer of 2007 that was something of a precursor to the financial crisis.\n\nmany of the largest, well-known quantitative (quant) hedge funds all started blowing up at the same time. everything they were buying was going down, while everything they were short selling (betting on a decline) was going up, causing massive losses for some of the biggest funds in the business.\n\nthose strategies had performed brilliantly for years, but all of a sudden they stopped working. the assumption was that a large fund made some bad bets and received margin calls because they used leverage to amplify their returns, requiring them to sell anything they could. and since many of the funds used similar approaches, many fund managers capitulated after large losses, which led to even more selling.\n\n there are 325,000 bloomberg terminals worldwide, 120,000 cfa charterholders (and another 250,000 candidates), as well as countless mbas, phds, economists, quants and wanna-be warren buffett's out there using brainpower looking to outperform the markets. \n\na few months later, aqr's cliff asness, himself a quant fund manager, wrote a post-mortem for institutional investor to try to get to the bottom of what happened and come to the defense of his style of investing. one line he wrote has stuck with me ever since:\n\nupon seeing a friend in good health — or even on death's doorstep — would you really approach the person and say, 'great to see you — are you still alive?' if you have to ask, you probably already think quant investing is dead.\n\nlately, i've been hearing a lot of people ask a similar question because of the rise in the popularity of index funds: is active management dead? if you have to ask …\n\nit seems like we can't go a single day without seeing another article talking about how indexing or passive investing is taking over the fund industry. and looking at charts like this, one would assume that it is (from the latest mauboussin piece):\n\nthe tide has definitely turned and flows tell us what's been happening lately, but they don't tell the whole story. actively managed funds still dominate u.s. stock market mutual fund assets:\n\nthe availability heuristic is a mental shortcut that causes people to rely on recent examples that come to mind when evaluating certain concepts. i think there's some of that going on in this instance because of the constant drumbeat of stories on the popularity of index funds and etfs. people don't realize that active management is still the dominant force in the markets.\n\naccording to vanguard ceo bill mcnabb, although indexing represents over 30% of the mutual fund world, it's only 15% of the entire u.s. stock market and less than 5% of the global market.\n\nin his book the institutional etf toolbox, eric balchunas estimates that there is a combined $75 trillion or so of institutional capital (pensions, insurance companies, endowments, foundations, sovereign wealth funds, etc.). these funds have just around 1% of that $75 trillion in etfs. institutions have trillions of dollars in separately managed accounts and other fund structures such as limited partnerships.\n\nmy point here is that while everyone has been busy writing the obituary for actively managed funds, we're not even close to seeing the grim reaper.\n\nthe average fund fees for actively managed funds still dwarf those of index funds and etfs by about 400%, give or take. that means these fund firms are still raking in way more money in fees than their low-cost counterparts. you're going to have to pry that revenue from their cold, dead hands in most cases. my guess is we'll see a lot of captains in the fund world go down with their ship as many firms will die off or get bought out. but they'll still be earning a decent living in the meantime.\n\nat our ebi conference a few months ago, charley ellis brought up the fact that there are 325,000 bloomberg terminals worldwide (the premium data source for investment professionals), 120,000 cfa charterholders (plus another 250,000 candidates looking to obtain their cfa). add to that the countless mbas, phds, economists, quants and wanna-be warren buffett's and stanley druckenmiller's, and there is still a ton of brainpower looking to outperform the markets.\n\nhere's ellis in his book, the index revolution, discussing why he doesn't feel active management is going away anytime soon:\n\nfirst, while index funds and exchange traded funds now approach 30% of stock market assets, their turnover is so small compared to that of active investors that they account for less than 5% of trading, and trading is what sets prices. (it is worth pointing out that some etfs can see enormous turnover so the trading is shifting from individual names to etfs themselves.)\n\nsecond, the only way to reduce the competitive striving of active investment managers would be to make their work so unrewarding that they would decide to quit. given how highly compensated active managers are these days, it would take an awfully large drop in compensation to cause many active managers to leave the market.\n\nthe trend toward low-cost investment products is one of the best things to ever happen to investors. and i believe this trend is a secular change. there's no going back now. many of these highly priced mutual funds and hedge funds will continue to charge high fees but, eventually, this trend is going to overwhelm this business model and they'll lose assets, have to lower their fees, get bought out by another firm or go out of business.\n\nbut these things never happen overnight. it will take some time to see changes.\n\nwe'll see some consolidation in the fund world in the years to come. and this tidal wave from active to passive products probably won't slow for some time. but don't get it twisted: active management is not dead. it still dominates the markets, even if indexing is gaining ground in huge chunks.\n\nfurther reading: the passive investing revolution that's not so passive\n\nben carlson is the author of the blog a wealth of common sense, where this was first published. it is reprinted with permission.
dear moneyist,\n\ni have two daughters. growing up in an agricultural family during the farm crisis was tough. my dad was extremely abusive, both physically and mentally. when i was 12 years old, he would pinch my ears with pliers. he told me once that he loved me, but he treated me like i was a farm worker, and always punished me if i didn't do things just as he had asked.\n\nhe paid $10,000 apiece for my sisters' weddings, and about the same for their divorces. i got nothing. he said: pay for girls. not boys. i am 52. until three years ago, when my mother divorced him due to his drinking, he would still ask me to come out to help on the farm. i did. through counseling, i realized i was looking for my father's approval. i still am.\n\nthe moneyist:'more help is on the way': the long wait is over for second stimulus check, but will $600 be enough?\n\nso i did everything he asked. i just got berated all over again, and he told false stories to my family and community about me. he blamed me for his divorce from my mother. he wouldn't talk to my sisters for a couple years either because of the divorce. my sisters told me that they had not spoken to him, but they had. they were always favored.\n\none sister now probably faces a big inheritance: the farm and equipment. i was told by several people that dad has me written out of his will. everything will go to at least one sister, if not both. i am in iowa. this is really hard to hear since i did most of the farm work growing up, and i was the only one to help as an adult. the girls are seeing him all the time now.\n\nshould i contest the will when my father dies, assuming i am written out of it?\n\nneglected son\n\ndear son,\n\ni advise against contesting the will. it will prolong the drama and trauma of your childhood. thank your father for showing you how not to treat people. it is time to move on.\n\nwhatever you are searching for, you will not find it in your father's last wishes. any pain you have from your childhood will not be eradicated by a grand gesture or by contesting this will, even if you won, which would be an expensive, unlikely and emotionally draining prospect. the time has come for you to stop looking for that validation from your father.\n\nthe solution to your question has nothing to with your father's farm or your sisters' marriages and divorces. every time your father favors your sisters, you appear to re-experience the rejection you experienced as a child. he is your father, but he is also just another human being who mistreated you, may or may not have been mistreated himself, and was not the father you deserved.\n\nbreak free. in her book, toxic parents: overcoming their hurtful legacy and reclaiming your life, susan forward writes: unhealthy families discourage individual expression. everyone must conform to the thoughts and actions of the toxic parents. they promote fusion, a blurring of personal boundaries, a welding together of family members.\n\n―want to read more?follow quentin fottrell on twitterand read more of his columns here.\n\nmany toxic parents compare one sibling unfavorably with another to make the target child feel that he's not doing enough to gain parental affection, she adds. this motivates the child to do whatever the parents want in order to regain their favor. this divide-and-conquer technique is often unleashed against children who become a little too independent, threatening the balance of the family system.\n\nyou can unsubscribe from this toxic dynamic. your father, unfortunately, had a financial, physical and emotional hold over you. he is a damaged person who seems to have serious problems with anger management, alcohol and a host of other unresolved traumas or resentments. but you can't fix him, and you can't fix your relationship with him. that's not your job. you can only fix yourself.\n\na parent should instill self-belief in a child, tell them that they are no better or worse than anyone else, and set them on a path to making healthy, positive choices. having the self-belief to pursue a career you love and choose a partner who nourishes you are among the most precious qualities a parent can instill in a child. it can change the course of their life. your father did not do that.\n\nbut now you can choose to take that power back, with therapy and by creating financial and life goals that have absolutely nothing to do with your family. you are more than your sisters' brother and your father's son. you are your own man now with children of your own, and it's time to break free from this dysfunctional family system. be the father your father never was.\n\nyou can be generous with your time and your love and support, and not use inheritance as a cudgel or proxy for love. your father has given you a gift: a template of how not to raise children, and a reminder that you have the power to build your own life free of the brutality and conditions your father set down for his affection. walking away from this farm is a gift you can give your childhood self.\n\nthe moneyist: my friend's father buried $50k in the backyard for his grandchildren. my

extreme weather events pose the biggest risk to the world today and the danger that global leaders will fail to tackle the issue before it's too late is a mounting and frightening concern, according to a report published wednesday.\n\nthe global risks report 2019, published by the world economic forum and based on a survey or more than 1,000 experts and decision makers around the world, found climate change risks at their highest-ever level, accounting for more than half of the top 10 risks. experts are increasingly concerned that efforts to mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions will fail, given the lack of commitment to the investment needed and lack of support from some important players.\n\nto effectively respond to climate change requires a significant increase in infrastructure to adapt to this new environment and transition to a low-carbon economy, alison martin, group chief risk officer at zurich insurance group, said in the report. by 2040, the investment gap in global infrastructure is forecast to reach $18 trillion against a projected requirement of $97 trillion. against this backdrop, we strongly recommend that businesses develop a climate resilience adaptation strategy and act on it now.\n\n of all risks, it is in relation to the environment that the world is most clearly sleepwalking into catastrophe.  — the global risks report 2019\n\nthe five key environmental risks the report tracks— biodiversity loss, extreme weather events, failure of climate-change mitigation and adaptation, man-made disasters and natural disasters—are once again listed in the high-impact, high-likelihood category, which means experts are worried that they are increasing and will have a huge effect.\n\nof all risks, it is in relation to the environment that the world is most clearly sleepwalking into catastrophe, said the report.\n\nread also: absence of clear-cut climate-disclosure policies puts companies in peril: report\n\nrelated:new report expected to boost push to make company climate-risk disclosures mandatory\n\nmindy lubber, chief executive of the sustainability-oriented nonprofit ceres, said the report's findings on climate change are more compelling, more concerning and more extreme than in previous years.\n\nit shows that the problem is bigger, deeper and more comprehensive and what's at stake is our global future, she said. that's the message that has to come out when people talk about, think about and act in small ways to address climate change. this reminds us that the devastation that is waiting to hit us is getting closer and somehow we are wishing it away like a three-year old would.\n\nthe united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) report published in october estimated that the world has at most 12 years to make the drastic changes needed to stop temperatures from rising beyond the paris agreement's 1.5 degrees celsius target. that report was followed in november by the fourth national climate assessment conducted by the u.s. government, which warned that average global temperatures could rise as much as 5 degrees celsius by the end of the century. such a rise would make parts of earth uninhabitable and would make the entire world uninsurable, creating billions of dollars in economic losses.\n\nread now:this is one way donald trump has been good for the environment\n\nalso:new york state sues exxon mobil for deceiving investors on climate-regulation risk\n\nthat report was released by president donald trump's administration on the friday after thanksgiving and trump immediately declared that he did not believe it, exacerbating concerns about inaction. trump and his cabinet's climate-change skepticism and aggressive scaling back of environmental protections introduced by his predecessor have dismayed activists, already disappointed by his decision to withdraw the u.s. from the paris climate pact.\n\nranking top 5 risks by likelihood 1. extreme weather events 2. failure of climate-change mitigation and adaptation 3. major natural disasters (e.g. earthquake, tsunami, volcanic eruption, geomagnetic storms) 4. massive incident of data fraud/theft 5. large-scale cyberattacks\n\nthat move, combined with protectionist trade moves against china and europe, has added to international tensions that make cooperation between major powers more challenging, at a time when the world needs to work together.\n\nwe need to build infrastructure differently starting today, and we need to be consistent, said lubber from ceres. financial institutions have to stop financing coal, we need a price on carbon and to put a price on the damage caused by climate change. people need to understand the urgency of right now.\n\nceres, and other parties who are pushing for mandatory climate-risk disclosures for companies have acknowledged that the lack of leadership from the u.s. on climate has stymied that effort and few expect much from the securities and exchange commission during this administration.\n\noutside of climate change, the report found data fraud and cyberattacks were another area of concern, highlighting other technological vulnerabilities, such as identity theft, fake news and the loss of privacy to companies and governments.\n\nsee: california wildfire frequency could surge 50% by 2050,

the impact of geopolitical-driven surges in crude oil prices was less harmful than a decade ago, dallas federal reserve president robert kaplan said in a cnbc interview on friday.\n\nhis remarks were in response to the u.s.-ordered drone strike against iran top general qassem soleimani late thursday, with his death expected to incite an increase in tensions in the middle east and to potentially result in a sharp retaliatory response.\n\nexpectations for a u.s.-iran conflict have lifted crude oil futures for global benchmark brent uk:brnh20 and u.s. benchmark west texas us:clg20 by more than 2% on friday.\n\nwe would've gotten a different reaction 10 years ago, kaplan said. the effect is going to be more muted than we've seen historically, he added, noting that the u.s.'s newfound status as an oil exporter would help offset the pain inflicted on consumers through higher energy prices.\n\nhe noted that if the price of crude rose between $5 to $10 per barrel, the impact would be relatively balanced in part because the u.s. economy was more energy-efficient than before.\n\nsee also: here's how the killing of a top iranian military leader will reverberate in the middle east and beyond\n\nkaplan and the dallas fed's staff oversee the eleventh fed district which encompasses texas, northern louisiana and southern new mexico, regions that are heavily reliant on oil and gas production.\n\nhe is now a voting member of the federal open market committee for 2020 as part of the annual rotation that sees regional presidents of the u.s. central bank gain and lose their decision making power over the path of u.s. interest rates.\n\nkaplan indicated he would support efforts to allow for inflation to temporarily float above 2% but that this would have to be balanced by other forward-looking considerations.\n\nultimately, he said the central bank shouldn't shift the fed funds rate at the moment, and that he was unsure about the direction of the next change in interest rates.\n\nit's too soon for me to say [where interest rates are headed]. at the moment, i'd stay agnostic, kaplan said.\n\non the balance sheet, the dallas fed chief said now that the crucial year-end hurdle was cleared and worries over the possibility of another surge in overnight funding rates have subsided, he hoped for a slower expansion in the size of the central bank's portfolio of securities.\n\nother senior fed officials also spoke on friday. richmond fed president thomas barkin said the economy looked quite healthy, echoing remarks from other members of the fomc.\n\nsee also: why oil could hit $80 even without a 'full-blown' u.s.-iran war
2018 started off with a bang for chip vendors like intel intc, -3.12% and amd amd, -5.46% , as a new and potentially industry-shifting security vulnerability at the silicon level was announced. along with it came concerns about consumer privacy, financial security, and even potential performance impacts on computers and servers that were patched to alleviate the vulnerability.\n\nnow that the initial wave of overly excited stories has come and gone, and level-headed experts have discussed the security and performance implications, the picture is clearer on how this issue will affect the major chip and processing players.\n\nintel is the biggest fish\n\nintel has a target on its back and is of the most concern when it comes to both spectre and meltdown security attacks.\n\nthough the company has been very clear to call this a security vulnerability rather than a bug in order to avoid culpability in the already-mounting legal disputes, and ceo brian krzanich was under fire for selling some shares prior to the public announcement of spectre and meltdown, many of the initial concerns appear to be calmed.\n\nthere should be no need for a product recall nor for a widespread product replacement program. not only was this not a feasible step due to the size and scale of intel's market share, the performance implications at this point appear minimal enough to consumers to make it unnecessary. the software patches and updates from microsoft msft, -2.67% , google goog, -2.62% , apple aapl, -3.39% , and others have secured the vulnerability to a large degree.\n\nresearchers launched websites wednesday to spread information about two vulnerabilities, meltdown and spectre. meltdownattack.com\n\nbut intel is still the biggest fish in the pond and will receive the most attention going forward. customers in the enterprise space, where intel holds a 95%+ share, are going to be more concerned about lowered performance. workloads that are heavy on network and storage interaction are seeing the most reduction in performance due to the patches. database and web services that are simply handlers for networking and storage requests could see drops in the area of 20%.\n\nit seems likely that players like amazon amzn, -3.44% , google, microsoft, and even hp hpe, -2.81% , dell us:dvmt , and more might come calling for intel to offer rebates or discounts on future purchases. if 10% to 20% of amazon aws computing capability across its many data centers is suddenly missing, it will need to ramp up new system deployment to avoid harming its customers. this additional cost may be where intel is most vulnerable to culpability.\n\namd still not out of the woods\n\nwhile the first day of worry around the security vulnerability improved amd's stock and dropped intel's, amd has not avoided the pitfall surrounding it. amd continues to push its lowered exposure to this problem, particularly being immune to meltdown due to different architecture design.\n\nfor the second variant of spectre, amd claimed near-zero risk to its customers. for many in the industry, putting that claim forward was seen as risky, as a challenge to security professionals to find a provable exploit like the ones that exist for intel processors.\n\nlast week amd announced that it was releasing microcode updates for its platforms, a way to update the internal programming of a processor to address the spectre class security vulnerabilities. (intel had already started this process previously.) these updates allow software vendors like microsoft and the linux community to manually address the problem and take the near-zero risk claim down an effective zero risk.\n\nthe company took a hit in the media for this apparent regression in its stance on amd processors' susceptibility to the security vulnerabilities. amd is steadfast that it has not adjusted its original claims and instead was giving partners the ability to provide the highest possible levels of assurance to customers worried about the security risks at play.\n\nit's the right move for amd to make, though it resulted in potential fallout from the change in messaging.\n\nkeeping things at arm's reach\n\narm holdings 9984, -2.46% has arguably the largest number of affected chips in the market, though it has the benefit of being more obscure in the eyes of the public. as the leading provider of processor architectures and chips to phones, tablets, and many other devices, it is the licensing partners that will bear most of the financial and public perception burden.\n\narm has been the most transparent of all the major processor designers since the release of the spectre and meltdown information, posting publicly on its website with details of which processor segments and specific models are affected, and which are not.\n\nthere is available information for application and operating system developers to integrate patches and fixes. this gives partners and highly technical consumers higher confidence in the strategy that arm is rolling out to address security.\n\nbecause arm's chip designs are at the heart of products from companies like qualcomm qcom, -3.11% and apple, this is an incredibly important effort to make. arm is unlikely to feel any effect in terms of sales or financials, as there are no reasonable alternatives to the product or services that it offers to those major customers.\n\narm processors are at the heart of most smart devices as well, including watches, networking hardware, thermostats, and more. but these chip designs are fundamentally different (in-order versus out-of-order for those interested) and are not vulnerable to spectre or meltdown.\n\napple skates on by\n\nthough apple is at risk both on the notebook and desktop markets by using intel processors, and on its iphone and ipad products via processors that use arm architectures, it has been proactive in pushing out software updates to patch for security.\n\nbecause apple controls the entirety of the software and hardware stack, and it has the highest percentage of consumers that update operating systems regularly, confidence is high in apple's product line.\n\ni see no areas of risk where apple would take a financial or public perception hit due to spectre and meltdown.\n\nother players of note\n\nthere are many other companies that need to be watched as we progress through 2018.\n\ngoogle has the responsibility of the android operating system, the most widely used in the smartphone market. most of the weight will fall to android partners to disseminate the patches in system updates. samsung 005930, -1.21% , htc 2498, +1.93% , lg 066570, -1.61% , huawei , and others will need to show customers that they value security and get updates to devices faster that we are used to seeing occur in the android ecosystem.\n\nthe winner here could see an increase in trust with buyers and gain long-term value because of it.\n\ngoogle, amazon, and microsoft all need worry about their cloud-based virtualized service markets and the potential for performance degradation that the patches for spectre and meltdown may cause. all could find that a sudden drop in available computing horsepower will force them to purchase new machines to make up the difference, requiring additional investment to maintain the same service reliability.

in a recent interview, erick ormsby, the founder of alcosta capital management, looked ahead by a year and based several stock picks on companies expected to post double-digit earnings growth in 2018. the companies were also trading at relatively low price-to-forward earnings valuations.\n\nso we decided to follow up by applying similar criteria to the entire s&p 500 index us:spx.\n\nit may seem strange to look ahead to 2018 so early in 2017, but it makes sense for long-term investors because some themes can take a long time to play out. banks, for example, are expected to become much more profitable as interest rates rise, because rates on their loan portfolios will increase faster than their funding costs. so long-term investors — those making commitments of at least three years — really do need to take a longer-range look at earnings expectations.\n\ndon't miss:twitter must change course, and this tech executive has some tips\n\nthe method\n\nbeginning with the s&p 500, we isolated companies with forward price-to-earnings ratios for 2018 that were lower than the aggregate p/e ratio for their sector or for the entire index, which ever was lower. the p/e ratios were rounded to the nearest tenth. a positive p/e ratio assumes that a company will be profitable in 2018.\n\nhere are the forward p/e ratios for the index and all of its sectors, except the new real estate sector, which s&p dow jones indices carved out of the financial sector in september, and for which an aggregate price-to-earnings ratio isn't yet available:\n\ns&p 500 sector price/consensus 2018 eps estimate -

u.s. bank and financial stocks, which had been in a funk since interest rates fell close to zero, have a good shot at beating the broader equity market in 2017. so the questions for investors are: which banks should i buy? which banks that have already soared should i buy? and how should i diversify?\n\nthe chart\n\nbefore discussing bank earnings released friday and investment opportunities in these stocks, let us build the necessary background so that you can better understand my recommendations. i am answering the question of what to buy, and when to buy, with the illustration of an annotated chart of bank of america bac, +2.61% . please click here to see the annotated chart of bac.\n\nplease observe the following from the chart.\n\nbank of america shares have outperformed since the election.\n\nrsi, which is a momentum indicator, shows that the stock is overbought but is likely to be in demand on a pullback.\n\nvolume has not been strong, indicating further demand on a decline.\n\nthe chart shows the arora report target zone of $28 to $32.\n\nthe chart shows the arora buy zone of $17 to $21.31. keep in mind that the arora report is still holding the original position, bought at $7.72. the stock is trading at a little over $23 as of this writing, for a gain of about 201%. (readers who aren't subscribers to the arora report can easily verify a subsequent call to buy bank of america, j.p. morgan jpm, +1.65% and citigroup (ticker:c) on marketwatch.) the new buy zone shown on the chart is for those who don't own the stock. arora buy zones are designed for a 70% probability of a fill within 120 days.\n\nin plain english, bank of america is a buy if the stock should fall.\n\ncounterpoint: 'bearish divergence' warns it isn't safe to buy bank stocks\n\nearnings\n\nthere have been a flood of earnings from banks and asset managers. those reporting include bank of america, j.p. morgan chase, wells fargo & co. wfc, +2.43% , blackrock blk, -0.62% , first horizon national corp. fhn, -0.11% , first republic bank frc, +0.42% and pnc financial services group pnc, +0.80% .\n\non balance, companies' earnings and projections have been in line with analysts' consensus, but less than the so-called whisper numbers — what the pros on wall street were expecting. the following items are of special note for investors:\n\ni have been listening to the conference calls, and the tone is positive. banks are painting an optimistic picture about rising interest rates, less regulation, improved asset quality and better capital markets.\n\nthe market often sends investors a message. investors simply need to read the message correctly. expectations in trading circles was that bank stocks would fall if earnings weren't much better than the whisper numbers. there is an old adage: buy the rumor, sell the news. investors heavily bought bank stocks in anticipation of good earnings after the election. now the earnings news is not as good as the whisper numbers.\n\ncontrary to the expectations of a decline, bank stocks have been strong today, though they have slipped from earlier highs. the arora report algorithms have been detecting significant institutional buying.\n\nthe message of the market is that there is a strong underlying demand for bank stocks.\n\ndiversification\n\ninvestors should consider diversifying among large money-center banks, big regional banks, small banks, asset managers and foreign financial firms. the arora report portfolios are diversified among about a dozen financial stocks and etfs.\n\nthe financial select sector spdr fund xlf, +0.52% is very popular, but is not the best way to gain the maximum bang for the buck. more specialized etfs are better.\n\nthe arora report came into the election heavily overweighted in financials, with about a dozen stocks and etfs in our portfolios. since the election, these have been top performers, giving our portfolios a big boost. stocks in the portfolio include bank of america, j.p. morgan, citigroup and hsbc holdings hsbc, +1.88% . to see how and why we purchased hsbc, a london-based large bank with a heavy presence in fast-growing asia, please see why hsbc is outperforming banks in both europe and the u.s. and post-brexit opportunities in three british stocks.\n\nthe articles linked above also describe an evergreen strategy to produce attractive returns.\n\nnew opportunities\n\nabout a dozen financial stocks and etfs in our portfolio are mostly large-caps. you can find more information about that on my website.\n\ngoing forward, we see exceptional opportunities in small-bank stocks that may be acquired by larger banks, handing lucrative profits to investors. about 20 such stocks are on our radar, and we are patiently waiting for them to dip into arora buy zones. three examples of small-bank stocks are yadkin financial us:ydkn, fidelity southern us:lion and xenith bankshares us:xbks.\n\ndisclosure: subscribers to the arora report may have positions in the securities mentioned in this article or may take positions at any time. all recommended positions are reviewed daily at the arora report.\n\nnigam arora is an investor, engineer and nuclear physicist by background, has founded two inc. 500 fastest-growing companies, is the developer of the adaptive zyx global multi asset allocation model and the zyx change method to profit from change in trading and investing. he is the founder of the arora report, which publishes four newsletters. nigam can be reached at nigam@thearorareport.com.
two years ago on the main stage at ces, nvidia corp. chief executive jensen huang proudly proclaimed that his company's technology would lead to level 4 autonomy — basically full self-driving — on the market by 2020.\n\nas 2019 dawned, huang's big news at ces was a level 2+ system — a designation that doesn't actually exist — that nvidia nvda, +0.76% called autopilot, the same name tesla inc. tsla, -4.39% uses for its autonomous system. it was one of many announcements that focused on new systems that aim much lower on the accepted scale for autonomy than what was being discussed in previous years at the giant las vegas trade show.\n\ndespite efforts to pitch them as more, these approaches are advanced driver assistance systems, or adas: a smarter collection of offerings that auto makers have offered in recent years such as adaptive cruise control, automatic braking and lane assist, but which requires an always alert driver. this middle ground offers benefits on both sides: cars can be made safer thanks to the technology that has already been developed as engineers aim for fully autonomous cars, while tech companies could finally start to realize a substantial financial return from their years of research and development.\n\nfirst, solve the problems that you can solve today that can be digested by the consumer particularly in the car, and have longer range plans in autonomy, qualcomm inc. qcom, +1.53% automotive executive patrick little said in summing up the current state of autonomous development during an interview with marketwatch. i think several of our competitors have shown up to the party about three or four years early and they're all dressed up in their tuxedo waiting with their technology, but the industry isn't ready for that.\n\nit's like ok, the party's over here by the way and we're all wearing jeans, he added later to complete the analogy.\n\nthe disconnect between the approach to autonomous cars at ces in previous years and the systems that many tech companies and auto makers announced this year was a bit strange, but reflected reality, according to edmunds analyst jessica caldwell.\n\na lot of the goals a few years ago were by 2020, and i feel like we should have seen some very tangible products [this year], but we're not there yet, said caldwell, the executive director of industry analysis at edmunds.\n\ni feel like ces was kind of pie in the sky for a few years, but now they're showing the reality of the situation in the here and now.\n\nthe change appears to be a result of years of communication between tech companies and auto makers. tech companies that were previously talking about future possibilities now know what auto makers actually want in the near-term, and see a chance to save lives well before fully driverless cars are on the road in large numbers.\n\na big profound change in the last three years is all the auto makers are talking directly with the lead technology providers — all of them, every single one on the planet — because time is becoming very short and the need to really innovate meaningfully, really meaningfully, is there, little said.\n\nan obvious problem, though, is that consumers have been hearing about fully autonomous systems for many years, and now are going to be buying cars with systems that sound like they are more than just a smarter adas system. even some of the players involved fight the terminology: when marketwatch questioned huang on the use of the name autopilot for an adas system at ces, he forcefully denied that nvidia's version of autopilot should be classified as adas instead of true autonomy.\n\nthat's falsely letting people think it is something that it's not — if you call something autopilot, what do you think it does? take care of everything, caldwell said.\n\nthe edmunds analyst also noted the other end of that spectrum: car companies that give overly generic names to their systems or just list off features with which consumers may not be familiar. that is especially important as nvidia sells its autopilot system into car companies, which can then rebrand it. she pointed to toyota inc.'s tm, -0.52% guardian technology, which was announced on monday at ces, as an honest name and approach.\n\nwe all have a moral obligation to apply automated vehicle technology to save as many lives as possible as soon as possible, toyota research institute chief executive gill pratt said while introducing guardian. (for more on the different levels of autonomy, watch an earlier ces appearance from pratt).\n\nthe issue for nvidia technology being branded as adas is that rivals have long owned that space. mobileye is especially well-known for developing and selling adas technology, and was acquired by intel corp. intc, +1.55% in 2017.\n\nwe can basically make a human-driven vehicle just as safe as a driverless vehicle by having that same technology kinda trickle down, said jack weast, vice president of autonomous vehicle standards for mobileye and a senior principal engineer at intel, later adding that it doesn't hurt the bottom line either.\n\nfrom a revenue and financial standpoint, that's a very healthy business.\n\nfor investors who have bought into tech companies in the hopes of an autonomous driving boom, the wait is not over, though the companies should still recognize some revenue earlier than they would have by waiting for fully autonomous cars to go into production.\n\nthings that are more tangible to go into production sooner, you will see the financial results quicker, caldwell said.\n\nfor example, little noted that deals he signs now won't go into production until 2021. but he also disclosed that a pipeline of automotive business that was $3 billion at the beginning of 2018 grew to $5.5 billion by the end of the year.\n\ninvestors will still be waiting, but at least could see the light at the end of the tunnel soon, with a lot of road on the other side for the companies that do make it there.\n\nin automotive, once you get on the top of the hill, you go for a long time, said little, qualcomm's senior vice president and general manager for the automotive business. the time constants are painful up front, but very gracious in the back end.
chinese stocks rose and the yuan strengthened friday, a respite from the early-year meltdown that wiped as much as $1.1 trillion from mainland markets, after authorities overnight removed a mechanism blamed for triggering more volatility.\n\nthe shanghai composite index shcomp, +0.51% finished up 2% at 3,186.41, recovering from a 7% plunge thursday. it finished down 10% for the week, its worst performance since the week ending aug. 21.\n\nelsewhere, the hang seng index hsi, +1.28% closed up 0.6%, and south korea's kospi 180721, +0.61% rose 0.7%. but the nikkei stock average nik, +1.01% and the s&p/asx 200 xjo, -0.73% both fell 0.4%.\n\nthe narrower gains and losses signal that markets are starting to stabilize after a global selloff yesterday. futures for the s&p 500 were up 0.9%.\n\non thursday, fears about china pushed the dow jones industrial average down nearly 400 points. commodities also tumbled, including u.s.-traded oil and base metals like copper and nickel. the stoxx europe 600 sxxp, +0.51% fell 2.2% after declining as much as 3.6%.\n\nread: what investors should (and shouldn't) do in this market\n\nanalysts and traders attributed the gains in asia friday to building optimism about a steadying chinese yuan and measures from chinese authorities to quell volatility, including a suspension of a circuit breaker system that exacerbated selling earlier in the week and suspended trading on monday and thursday.\n\nanalysts also attribute some of the gains to government buying.\n\nit's not unfair to think the 'national team' is in there to some extent, said bill bowler, hong kong-based broker at forsyth barr asia, referring to china's state-owned funds tasked with buying shares.\n\ncircuit breakers\n\nchinese markets were suspended from trading on monday and thursday, after a benchmark of blue chips fell by the 7% limit that triggers a new circuit breaker system, which went into effect on jan. 1.\n\none problem with the circuit breaker is that the thresholds were set too low, analysts say. in the 60 trading days between june 8 and september 9 during china's summer stock market rout, chinese stock markets fluctuated up or down by 5% a dozen times, or every five trading days, according to research by noah holdings, a chinese wealth manager.\n\nread: after china circuit-breaker move, now what?\n\nfriday morning started out choppy, with shanghai falling by more than 2% at one point. but the afternoon gains were broad, with the sse 50, a benchmark of blue-chips, up 2.6% and startup stocks trading up 1.5% on china's nasdaq-like board.\n\nchinese stocks make a u-turn\n\nchina's central bank guided the yuan stronger on friday, helping to calm the markets. the chinese currency had reached its lowest level in five years on thursday.\n\nthe yuan cnyusd, -0.03 was last at 6.6823 to the u.s. dollar in the offshore market where it trades freely, strengthening from a five-year low of 6.7511 thursday. its last trade yesterday was at 6.68.\n\nonshore, where the yuan can trade within 2% either side of the authorities' guidance, the currency was last at 6.5883. that's also stronger that the five-year low reached on thursday of 6.5956.\n\nread: here's how china's yuan drives the global selloff\n\ndespite concerns about the chinese regulator's rapid flip-flop on the circuit breaker — suspending it just four days after it was launched — some applauded the move. the decision to remove it was sensible, said andrew xia, hong kong research director at noah.\n\nothers said the suspension of the circuit breaker may slow down losses but wouldn't reverse the decline in chinese equities in the coming months.\n\nin japan, shares traded near a three-month low, even as the japanese yen weakened, typically a boon for stocks.\n\nthe yen usdjpy, +0.10% was last down 0.4% against the u.s. dollar, but it has risen 2% this week as investors seek havens. the currency's strength weighs on japanese exporters that repatriate earnings from overseas and pay costs at home.\n\nin corporate news, shares noble group ltd. sg:n21 plunged 7.3% after the commodities trader was hit with a second credit-rating downgrade. standard & poor's ratings services late thursday cut the embattled firm's rating to junk status, presenting the latest blow for the first which has been battling to refute accusation of accounting irregularities for nearly a year amid a sharp commodities-market downturn. shares are down 20% in the first four trading days this year alone.
as its 21st season begins, the tv show the bachelor has harnessed the magical formula of drama, tears and the everlasting hope of finding a soul mate, and turned it into one of the longest running reality franchises on u.s. television.\n\neach season, a bachelor or bachelorette looks to find a fiancée among a group of 30 contestants. though the featured bachelor or bachelorette each season receives some sort of compensation — usually over $100,000 a season according to reality television blogs — contestants say they are not paid for their time on the show.\n\nthe show features well-groomed men and women discussing their fear of intimacy in a glamorous los angeles mansion and various tropical locales, however, the televised journey for love can take just as big a hit on their finances as it does on their self-confidence. (abc dis, -1.52% declined to comment on this article.)\n\ncontestants do receive gift bags with sponsored items like bathing suits and yoga mats, and some have been able to parlay their appearance on the show into a media career. however, preparing for the show and living with reality television fame can be no bed of roses (excuse the pun) when it comes to keeping your savings account intact.\n\nhere's how the show works: each week the bachelor or bachelorette sends home a number of hopefuls until one is left standing. the season typically ends in a proposal, though only one couple from the bachelor and three couples from the bachelorette are currently married. (another bachelor, jason mesnick, did marry a contestant, though not the one he originally chose.) the show's host, chris harrison, has become a household name and the spokesman for romance, as contestants experience their 15 minutes of fame, often followed by appearances in spinoffs like bachelor in paradise and a spike in their instagram followers.\n\npacking for the 'journey'\n\non one episode this season, two of the contestants claim another contestant, olivia caridi, a local news anchor, spent $40,000 on her wardrobe for the show. caridi didn't respond to a request for comment, but the figure isn't out of the realm of possibility. former contestants say that they were required to provide most of their own wardrobe and makeup, and when you need to regularly impress a bachelor or bachelorette at fancy cocktail parties, that bill can add up.\n\ni had remortgaged my house and i spent something like $8,000 on clothing, wrote jillian harris, who was the second runner-up on the 13th season of bachelor and was later the star of the fifth season of bachelorette, on her blog. other contestants have been more thrifty, signing sponsorship deals with clothing labels or borrowing from friends.\n\ni have really great friends, and they have even better closets, says lesley murphy, a former political consultant and contestant on season 17 of bachelor, in an interview with marketwatch. other people said they spent a ton, a lot of people came with four or five bags, she says, adding that some contestants who came with large wardrobes were still sent home on the first night.\n\nafter completing various interviews, questionnaires and background checks, contestants typically find out that they have been accepted to the show about two to three weeks before filming begins. in that time, they have to inform their employer — if they have a job — that they will be gone for anywhere from a week to a month and a half, assemble a tv-ready wardrobe and settle their finances for the next six weeks, since they are not allowed to have access to their phone, the internet or television during filming.\n\ni only had about two and a half weeks from when i officially got the word, says jj lane, a former investment banker and a contestant on the 11th season of the bachelorette, in an interview with marketwatch. i had to set up auto bill pay and give my parents my deposit slips and access to email passwords. as far as wardrobe, lane says he only bought one new suit for the show, but other contestants showed up with gobs and gobs of new clothes.\n\nlife inside the mansion\n\nonce filming begins, contestants stay in the bachelor mansion — an 8,000 square-foot house near los angeles complete with six bedrooms, nine bathrooms, a four-car garage and a pool. the house is currently worth about $7.7 million, according to real estate information company zillow. as the cast is whittled down after weekly rose ceremonies (if you don't get a rose, you go home), the group typically travels to other u.s. cities and, later, foreign destinations.\n\nduring each episode, contestants accompany the bachelor or bachelorette on various group dates or one-on-one dates, flying in helicopters, relaxing in hot tubs or engaging in performance or athletic competitions led by celebrities like comedian amy schumer and laila ali, a retired professional boxer and daughter of muhammad ali.\n\nwhen they're not on dates or filming interviews with producers, contestants are left to pass the time in the mansion or hotel without many distractions. filming was mentally and physically exhausting, murphy says. i had to take time out every day to be alone with myself.\n\nthe show provides food for contestants, but when staying in the mansion, any cooking, laundry and other chores are up to them. some activities have to be improvised — murphy says a beaten path in the backyard served as a running track for contestants who wanted to exercise in between filming sessions. though contestants may access a phone in cases of emergency or to talk to their children, most other media, including books, aren't allowed. you never really go offline like you do on the show, murphy says.\n\nfor some, that isolation can be relaxing. my favorite part was being disconnected, lane says. cast members can lounge by the pool, and drink and eat without being bothered by work emails or phone calls.\n\nafter the rose ceremony\n\nwhen the season ends, it is back to reality for the temporary television stars. in some cases, like murphy's, contestants have been able to return to their former jobs and resume a relatively normal life. (murphy ended up leaving her job after a few months to pursue a marketing career in argentina and now runs her own travel blog.)\n\nothers, especially those who are portrayed negatively on the show, have had more trouble. on the show, contestants have claimed to have quit their job to prove their commitment to the process. lane, who was unemployed when he went on the show after working in corporate finance at j.p. morgan jpm, +1.65% and other firms, says he has had trouble re-entering the industry. i didn't understand the magnitude of the show and how hard it is to get a real job right after, lane says. everyone knows who you are and employers see it as a distraction. lane first appeared on the franchise nearly a year ago, and is still undergoing his job search.\n\nit is possible to financially benefit from that fame, but the returns are minimal for most people. lane estimates that former contestants can make about $2,000 to $3,000 for appearances at bars or other venues, and promoting products on personal social media accounts usually doesn't add up to a livable salary unless you've gained more than a million followers. it's not a way to make a living, it is more of a supplemental way to get something out of being on the show.\n\ndespite the downsides to reality tv fame, both lane and murphy say they don't regret the experience because of the transition it brought to their lives — for better or worse. it came at a great time in my life. i came away with a lot of great friends, murphy says.\n\neveryone has different reasons they do it, lane adds. i did it because i needed a change in my life coming out of a divorce. it was completely opposite from everything in my life up until then.\n\nthis report was originally published on march 11, 2016.
many american colleges will have to look different decades from now if they're going to survive.\n\nthat's one of the many arguments in demographics and the demand for higher education, a book by nathan grawe, an economics professor at carleton college, published late last year. grawe explores how demographic trends — like the shift from majority white to majority-minority, from northeastern population centers to the southwest, and declining birth rates — will affect american colleges.\n\nschools that don't think creatively about how to adapt to these changes could be forced to merge or shutdown, he concludes. those same outcomes are predicted by moody's investors service and others. schools likely won't face these challenges acutely until at least 2026 and beyond, but grawe suggests they use the time they still have to prepare.\n\nwe're very lucky in some sense because many industries face market swings with no forewarning, he said.\n\nmarketwatch spoke with grawe to learn more about the book. the conversation has been edited and condensed.\n\nwonder how we got to over $1 trillion in student debt? watch this.\n\nmarketwatch: how are the demographics of higher education changing?\n\nnathan grawe: we've had some longstanding trends — migration and differences in fertility have driven the population away from new england and the northeast to the hispanic southwest.\n\nwith the financial crisis, the fertility rate fell pretty dramatically. there are fewer kids overall and where those kids are doesn't match up with our traditional recruiting markets.\n\nmw: how do those recruiting markets function now?\n\n 'if you were a two-year school, or a regional four-year school in the new england area where we see a dramatic drop in population, your recruitment pool is shrinking and it's very unlikely that you're going to, say, go to texas and find other students.' \n\ngrawe: two-year colleges and regional four-year colleges recruit from a very, very local market.\n\nif you were a two-year school, or a regional four-year school in the new england area where we see a dramatic drop in population, your recruitment pool is shrinking and it's very unlikely that you're going to, say, go to texas and find other students.\n\nnational schools have a little bit more ability to draw from across the country, but at the same time we have recruiting networks. when students are thinking about which school they're going to attend, word of mouth is a strong part of the picture.\n\nwhen we think about shifting population toward the southwest and an increasing share of the population that is hispanic — we know hispanics have had a lower uptake of higher education in the past — we're talking about a growth in markets that we just don't have a lot of ins into.\n\nnathan grawe (right) and the cover of his book. johns hopkins university press\n\nmw: one of the big innovations of this book is the so-called higher education demand index (hedi). what is it and how does it differ from other methods of predicting changes in higher education?\n\ngrawe: in thinking about those demographic trends, the existing forecasts are very crude.\n\nit seems pretty obvious that not all students are equally likely to attend college period and equally likely to attend a school of a particular type. [with the hedi] we can adjust the population data for the probability of attendance of a college of a particular type. we can distinguish between expected trends from top ranked schools from a regional four-year school or a two-year college.\n\n national schools have a little bit more ability to draw from across the country, but at the same time we have recruiting networks. when students are thinking about which school they're going to attend, word of mouth is a strong part of the picture \n\nmw: what are some of the most salient things the index is telling us about the future of higher education?\n\ngrawe: if we look at two-year colleges and regional four-year colleges a lot of the standard narratives hold. we should expect to see fewer students especially starting in the 2020s.\n\nif we look at elite schools, we actually expect growth in the number of students with demographic markers for elite college attendance.\n\n[editor's note: specifically, grawe is referring to growth in the number of asian-american students and students from families where the parents attended college.]\n\nthe number of kids who come from first generation backgrounds is likely to fall. a lot of that is just following from the population. in recent decades we've had an increase in college attendance. that pushes against some of the current dominant narratives\n\nmw: which colleges are the winners and losers in this future?\n\ngrawe: the winners are going to be people who are agile and the losers are people who are unwilling to consider change.\n\nfor instance, the total number of elite-like students in the country will grow, their geographical distribution is going to shift. if you simply go back to the pools you've always gone to, you'll probably fill your class, but you won't fill your class with the best students.\n\nat the second tier schools, that market is shrinking a bit, but the growth at the top of the industry suggests that there may be some spillover. the agile school will be the one that figures out where that spill over is\n\nat the regional level and the two-year level, it is a falling market. they'll need to figure out how they can cope with a smaller student body.\n\nmw: what do these changes mean for students?\n\ngrawe: there are going to be some opportunities as the number of students decrease in the 2020s, there's going to be greater competition for more students, so that would be one positive.\n\nwe've seen since the financial crisis that state funding for higher education has been pretty dramatically cut in every state. [editor's note: grawe explained that cuts to state funding combined with the declining number of students could put schools' finances at risk.]\n\nwhen we see state institutions under financial pressure, families may feel is that financial pressure is rolled downhill to them as well. there might be some negative consequences as well to families.\n\n(this interview was edited for style and space.)
markets and industry are edging toward a unified carbon pricing system away from fragmented regional or national approaches, pushed there as climate-change alarm grows. this growing demand from so-far voluntary participants has prompted the world's first daily carbon credit price assessments from s&p global platts, the firm says.\n\nplatts will use a leading airline emissions measure as the baseline as the sector implements pollution offsets beginning this year. ultimately, shipping, power, manufacturing, agriculture and other segments of the economy are intended targets for such credits.\n\nattaching a price to emissions and allowing emitters to offset their pollution with a credit-swapping system is considered one tool in the fight to slow man-made global warming. the next united nations conference of the parties (cop), to be hosted by the u.k. in glasgow in november, is expected to formalize international trade in carbon credits under the paris agreement.\n\ndon't miss: the real math behind 'net zero' emissions as 100s of countries and companies make their pledge\n\nwhile 2020 brought co2 emissions declines totaling 6.4% driven by an unprecedented worldwide economic lockdown from covid, s&p global platts analytics currently projects that global co2 energy combustion emissions will grow 4.4% in 2021 vs. 2020 levels and not be aligned with the long-term downward trajectory needed to hit emissions targets, said roman kramarchuk, head of future energy analytics with s&p global platts.\n\nthat creates an ongoing strong potential role for financing and investments into reductions and removals of emissions, he said.\n\noffsets, for instance, might be linked to forest restoration in brazil or promoting renewable energy use in fast developing india.\n\nemission credits are a debated approach among environmental advocates. critics worry the system doesn't encourage a quick enough shift from fossil-fuel burning ng00, -0.59% toward renewables icln, -2.75% , while proponents welcome market-based approaches for balancing the globe's energy needs against science-backed warming concerns. taxing pollution is a penalty-based approach that is also gaining traction in some countries.\n\nread: here are analysts' 10 favorite clean-energy stocks to buy now\n\nwe're now seeing a significant volume in trade in voluntary carbon credits, which are set to grow exponentially, said jonty rushforth, senior director of s&p global platts price group.\n\nfor now, both a voluntary emissions offset program, such as that tracked and priced by s&p global platts, and the existing compliance-mandated cap-and-trade programs will have a shared role, said kramarchuk. cap-and-trade is decades old but never achieved broad adoption, in part because of fragmentation and shallow volume. california, for instance, still engages in a regional cap-and-trade program. and south korea has taken a lead in expanding its own emissions trading.\n\nthe platts product tracks the international civil aviation organization's corsia program, which has created the mechanism to allow airlines to offset their emissions. worldwide, flights produced 915 million metric tons of co2 in 2019, according to data the industry promotes. globally, humans produced over 43 billion metric tons of co2 that year.\n\nthe first day for the product revealed prices at 80 cents/mtco2e on jan. 4. that is strategically at the low end of a historic pricing range for airlines, rushforth told marketwatch. the price reflects continuing uncertainty for fuel demand in the face of the ongoing pandemic, as international airline emissions remain largely below target.\n\nairlines that are part of the international civil aviation organization had already pledged to reduce their carbon footprint through a voluntary period from 2021-2023 and follow up with a mandatory reduction period from 2024 onwards.\n\nbeyond the airlines baseline, the assessments, which platts will add to, will reflect credits from projects certified by the gold standard, climate action reserve (car), verified carbon standard (vcs), architecture for redd+ transactions and the american carbon registry.\n\nrelated: 'hold the champagne' on china's updated climate-change target — guide markers still don't guarantee net zero emissions by 2060
new year's resolutions are often about becoming healthier by shedding a few pounds or eating sensibly, but in some cases those new habits can have far bigger consequences.\n\nsome of the healthy behaviors people vow to follow every january include quitting smoking, working out more, eating less fast food and unhealthy food, or reducing the amount of alcohol they drink. these also happen to be behaviors that are, according to years of scientific research, linked to cancer.\n\ntogether, those behaviors not only stave off the risk of cancer by a third, but possibly cause even a greater reduction in the likelihood of dying from cancer, according to new research led by peter elwood, a professor at cardiff university in wales, and published in ecancermedicalscience, the journal from the european institute of oncology and the organisation of european cancer institutes.\n\nthe researchers looked at all cancers, including colon, breast and prostate, and studied data on lifestyle behaviors of more than 343,000 people, a little more than 14,000 of whom were diagnosed with cancer over a period of five years. each additional healthy behavior was linked to a 8% reduction in cancer. the take-home message is that healthy behaviors can have a truly tangible benefit, elwood said.\n\ncan boxed water compete against bottled water?\n\ndon't miss: 4 lifestyle changes to reduce your cancer risk\n\nlifestyle is one major factor in getting cancer, research shows. the odds of getting upwards of 40% of all cancers could be reduced with a change in daily habits, according to a 2015 report published in the journal of the american medical association oncology. that means maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking, lowering the amount of alcohol consumption and working out two and a half hours a week.\n\nanother study, substantial contribution of extrinsic risk factors to cancer development, published in the january 2016 edition of the journal nature added that environmental and external factors lead to cancer, including being in the sun too much and exposure to toxic chemicals. we conclude that cancer risk is heavily influenced by extrinsic factors. these results are important for strategizing cancer prevention, research and public health, the researchers wrote.\n\nalso see:why you should avoid diet soda, takeout and these other bad habits in 2018\n\nmore studies are showing a direct link between alcohol and cancers: even a light intake of alcohol raises the risk of various leading cancers, such as breast and esophagus, according to research reviewed by the american society of clinical oncology and published this month. between 5% and 6% of new cancers and cancer deaths in the world are linked to alcohol.\n\nbooze has also been found to damage dna, according to new research partly funded by cancer research u.k. and published in nature this week. when researchers at the medical research council laboratory of molecular biology in cambridge, england gave diluted alcohol to mice, they found it broke or damaged dna within blood stem cells and altered the cells, potentially paving the way to an increase in cancer.\n\nsome cancers develop due to dna damage in stem cells, ketan patel, lead author of the study, said. while some damage occurs by chance, our findings suggest that drinking alcohol can increase the risk of this damage.\n\nalso see: why you should have an alcohol-free 'dry january' (that has nothing to do with hangovers)\n\neven with the best of intentions, resolutions aren't often kept. before february, more than a third of people who set these goals have ditched them, according to a six-month long study published in the journal of clinical psychology.\n\nhow to keep them? find the joy in the goal, and focus on short-term rewards instead of long-term rewards. for example, if your resolution is to go to the gym, instead of planning to lose 10 pounds, aim to do a certain number of exercises during each workout. if you want to stop drinking so much alcohol, instead of thinking of it as a ban in your life, make a goal to opt for water or juice next time you hit the bar.
the story has been updated with a more recent statement from pwc.\n\na federal judge has given the federal deposit insurance corp. a big win against pricewaterhousecoopers, a decision that could cost the auditor more than $1 billion in damages and finally put auditors on the hook for detecting fraud.\n\nit's a new responsibility that these firms have traditionally argued is not the point of an audit.\n\non dec. 28, u.s. district judge barbara jacobs rothstein gave the fdic a victory on one of three claims it brought against pricewaterhousecoopers, the auditor of colonial bank group, a financial crisis-era bank that failed after a massive fraud was discovered between the bank and the mortgage originator taylor bean & whitaker.\n\nbut the claim — for professional negligence — was the fdic's most serious against pwc related to audits of colonial for 2002 through 2005 and again in 2008.\n\nthe case against pwc, and colonial's internal audit co-source vendor crowe horwath, for professional malpractice and breach of contract, was the first fdic suit against an auditor for financial crisis-era bank frauds or failures.\n\nasked for more details, a spokeswoman for the fdic said the regulator does not comment on pending litigation.\n\nthe colonial bank failure cost the fdic's deposit insurance fund $2.3 billion, according to the fdic's court filing. judge rothstein's decision reduced the potential damages to an estimated $1.4 billion, after determining that a related breach by bank of america bac, +2.61% of its custodial obligations to colonial bank was not foreseeable by the auditor. a hearing on the damages has not yet been scheduled.\n\nbut even the lower award could stretch pwc's finances since it has already agreed to two additional confidential settlements in the last 18 months, one for a related case brought against the firm by the bankruptcy trustee for tbw and another for the crisis-era failure of brokerage firm mf global, another pwc audit client.\n\npwc stopped the tbw trial, and another one in 2017 for claims resulting from the failure of its client mf global, by agreeing to confidential settlements that were likely more palatable than the combined $6.5 billion originally sought by the trustees for the two bankrupt firms.\n\njim peterson, a former in-house attorney for arthur andersen and the author of the book, count down: the past, present and uncertain future of the big four accounting firms, told marketwatch that he believes pwc u.s. could withstand about $3 billion in payouts over a short period of time.\n\nthe colonial award will be public and could be more than $1 billion. combined with the confidential settlements for mf global and tbw in the last 18 months, the firm is likely already feeling a strain, he said.\n\nmoney-losing investors, and receivers like bankruptcy trustees and the fdic, bring the largest global audit firms — pwc, deloitte, kpmg and ernst & young — to court quite often. however, the big 4 rarely go to trial because one catastrophic guilty verdict could put them out of business. in the summer of 2016 alone, pricewaterhousecoopers llp, its u.s. arm, faced as many as three significant trials for allegedly negligent audits.\n\nread:pwc faces 3 major trials that threaten its business\n\nthe first pwc case to go to trial came after the tbw bankruptcy trustee went after pwc for not catching the joint tbw-colonial fraud as auditor of colonial bank. the tbw trustee alleged that if pwc, colonial's auditor, had caught the fraud there, the losses to tbw shareholders and creditors would have been much smaller.\n\ntbw's auditor, deloitte, settled several years ago with the trustee, before a trial started, when it faced a multi-billion-dollar claim from the bankruptcy trustee for its alleged audit negligence. at least eight people at colonial and tbw, including taylor bean chairman lee farkas were convicted or pleaded guilty to participating in the scheme. taylor bean filed for bankruptcy in august 2009 and colonial failed soon after.\n\npwc didn't settle the case brought by the tbw trustee until after the trial had started, but not before a few weeks of testimony and evidence of the alleged negligence of pwc auditors to catch the joint tbw-colonial fraud as the auditor at colonial was in the public record.\n\nread: mf global, pricewaterhousecoopers settle malpractice lawsuit\n\nread:corzine ordered to pay $5 million fine over unlawful use of customer funds\n\npwc may still face a separate jury trial in alabama over claims from the fdic for two more years of audits of colonial, if the firm does not now settle as a result of this decision. the allegations about pwc's audits for 2006 and 2007 were split off from the rest of the case because the contract for those years did not ask colonial to waive a jury trial in the event of a dispute.\n\ntrials can remind the public how often auditors fail to detect frauds and, in the colonial bank case, how pwc failed to comply with auditing standards that require them to look for fraud, according to judge rothstein.\n\na pwc spokesman provided the following statement:\n\npricewaterhousecoopers is pleased that the court properly rejected all of the claims asserted by colonial bancgroup as well as several of the key claims asserted by the fdic. the court's ruling recognizes that in addition to those cbg employees who perpetrated the fraud, numerous other employees at colonial bancgroup actively and substantially interfered with pricewaterhousecoopers' audit. the fdic was only able to prevail on the claim that it did based on an earlier novel ruling by the court that immunized the fdic from imputation-based defenses. pricewaterhousecoopers intends to appeal that novel ruling at the earliest possible opportunity. pricewaterhousecoopers is also pleased with the court's finding that it did not cause a substantial portion of the damages the fdic is seeking. pricewaterhousecoopers looks forward to the damages phase where the fdic will bear the burden of proof on what remains of their inflated damages claim.\n\nimpact on future auditor cases\n\nmarketwatch asked james langdon, an attorney who frequently defends class actions with law firm dorsey & whitney, if he would advise his clients to go to trial given the potential for huge damages to be awarded in this case.\n\nevery case is different but, yes, if you believe you're right, as i think pwc does, then you are willing to take a stand and go to trial, he said.\n\neach of the recent cases pwc defended at trial were brought by bankruptcy trustees or, in the colonial case, the fdic, a receiver of a failed bank. in a bankruptcy case, plaintiffs have significant advantages when suing the auditor that they do not have in a typical case. those can include detailed reports from a bankruptcy examiner who investigates what happened, often with the full cooperation of the auditor.\n\nbankruptcy is special, langdon said, for those reasons, [and because there's a] general effort of everyone but the defendant, including sometimes judges, to maximize the amount available to the bankruptcy estate to pay creditors. this is a thumb on the scale for anyone suing auditors of bankrupt companies.\n\nthis case, however, will absolutely also affect non-bankruptcy cases. there are plenty of fdic cases against auditors right now that are not bankruptcies. it's going to make those cases more difficult to settle and more likely to try, in particular while this appeal is pending, he said.\n\nwill auditors change their approach after the colonial decision?\n\nany [penalty] with a 'b' in it is going to be an extraordinary burden to any firm, langdon said. whether it is enough to tip a firm into non-existence is one thing, but it certainly would be enough to change the cost of the audits going forward.\n\ntrials mean embarrassing public testimony\n\nwhen audit firms settle cases before the trial, the public never hears testimony related to client relationships or audit details. judges typically acquiesce to the auditors' requests to put pretrial testimony by firm employees and experts under confidential court seal forever.\n\nfor instance, when deloitte settled crisis-era cases with bear stearns and washington mutual investors, or kpmg settled with mortgage originators related to the new century and countrywide cases, or ey settled with lehman brothers investors and the new york attorney general after years of filings and motions but no trials, partner comments were sealed.\n\nin her decision, judge rothstein wrote that pwc admitted that it had failed to design its audits to detect fraud, violating auditing standards, but had agreed during the colonial trial that it was required to do so.\n\nless than two years ago, gary westbrook, one of the pwc audit partners, testified in the tbw case that audits are not designed to detect fraud. however, he changed his tune at the colonial trial, testifying that the firm did have a duty to design audit procedures to detect fraud. he also testified that if pwc failed to design its audit procedures to detect fraud, it would be a violation of auditing standards.\n\nsource: court records\n\nmany of the same pwc engagement partners, audit managers and audit staff who were involved in the colonial case gave deposition testimony under oath in the tbw trustee's case. during the tbw case they had all repeatedly admitted that pwc did not design its audits to detect fraud.\n\nsource: court records\n\nrothstein concluded that pwc did not design its audits to detect fraud and pwc's failure to do so constitutes a violation of the auditing standards.\n\nrothstein did deny allegations against pwc brought by the bank's holding company, saying it was barred by the in pari delicto doctrine, because it shared blame with its criminal executives. and pwc's work, rothstein wrote, was interfered with by executives at colonial, two of whom have pleaded guilty in connection with the fraud.\n\nthe sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 provides a way for the company or its executives to be prosecuted for audit interference, under section 303(a), but the securities and exchange commission has never brought any charges against any of the tbw or colonial executives.\n\nthe sec and the public company accounting oversight board, the audit regulator created by sox, has never brought any disciplinary actions against tbw auditor deloitte or colonial's auditor pwc or any of their partners or employees for the audits of the two firms felled by fraud.\n\nalthough the judge denied the fdic's and the holding company's breach of contract damages against pwc under the in pari delicto defense, because the criminal colonial employees were acting as agents of the bank and its holding company, the fdic, on the other hand, was not precluded from pursuing damages from pwc's negligence.\n\nthe judge's unwillingness to impute the colonial bank employees' bad behavior to the fdic is a huge advantage for the regulator, according to langdon. it is also the basis for pwc's appeal of the decision.\n\nwas it possible for pwc to detect this fraud?\n\nthe fraud between taylor bean & whitaker and colonial bank centered on the colonial's mortgage warehouse lending division, where the bank provided short-term funding to tbw so that it could originate mortgage loans. the mwld provided funding to tbw through various funding facilities, including one called the colb facility.\n\nin late 2003, fraudsters began running the tbw fraud using the colb accounts by having tbw sell colonial 99% participation interests in mortgages that had already been sold to other investors. that helped conceal tbw's overdraft by making it appear on colonial's financial statements as if colonial owned an interest in legitimate colb mortgages. colonial's 99% participation interest would have been represented by a participation certificate held as collateral for colonial in its vault until colonial was paid for its 99% participation interest in the underlying mortgages.\n\njudge rothstein wrote in her decision that pwc could have uncovered the fraud simply by inspecting some of the underlying documents for the mortgages at issue, but it didn't. pwc never inspected nor requested to inspect a single tbw colb loan document, despite being in the same building as the secured file room. during the tbw trial, steven thomas, the attorney for the trustee, quipped, all you had to do was press 'b' in the elevator for basement, because testimony during the trial based on the trustee's investigation revealed there were no participation certificates for these loans and, therefore, no mortgage collateral.\n\nthe judge wrote that, instead of looking at the actual documents, pwc relied on tbw ceo lee farkas, to confirm the key information about the collateral underlying the colonial credit facility for tbw. using ceo farkas confirm the existence of tbw's collateral was quintessentially the same as asking the fox to report on the condition of the hen house, rothstein wrote.\n\npwc defends its accounting advice to colonial\n\nin april 2008, according to the original complaint filed in the tbw case in february 2016, the office of the comptroller of the currency challenged a pwc accounting opinion from 2002 saying that the colb transactions at colonial could be accounted for as sales, and therefore receive off-balance-sheet treatment. the occ's challenge to pwc's sales accounting conclusions caused major alarm within pwc, according to the filing.\n\nwestbrook said he forwarded the occ's questions to several partners in pwc's national office, including a specialist named frank gaetano, who flew down to alabama to solve the problem in person with colonial executives. the original complaint filed by the tbw trustee in february 2016 unsuccessfully attempted to redact several names of pwc executives.\n\npwc's review of gaetano's work and related emails were introduced by the plaintiffs at the tbw trial. the documents show that gaetano and his pwc national office colleagues designed the complex justification for colb sales accounting and colonial's management deferred to them. the performance review read, with respect to colonial, given the difficult technical issues, lack of understanding exhibited by executive management and the short timeline, frank did not hesitate in taking charge.\n\ngaetano's actions were endorsed at the highest levels of the firm.\n\nformer pwc chairman samuel dipiazza, now a vice chairman at citibank c, +0.33% and an at&t t, -0.46% board member, sent his congratulations for a job well done on april 20, 2008. to all of you guys—thanks a great deal for going far beyond to make this happen on friday. an incredible professional performance. i doubt the client will ever understand what you guys did to make this happen, wrote dipiazza.\n\njust a year later, the fbi raided tbw and colonial and both firms were bankrupt.
in roman mythology, janus is depicted as a two-faced god, meant to symbolize his control over transitional moments when one's fate could go in either direction. never has that symbolism seemed more apt for the fund company that bears his name.\n\njanus capital group us:jns, once an emblematic superstar money manager of the 1990s, never fully recovered from the subsequent dot-com crash. assets have dropped from their 2000 peak of $324 billion to $199 billion as of sept. 30—a 39% decline. the firm has been particularly hard-hit from the more recent industry-wide exodus out of actively managed funds into index products; it lost $1.8 billion to outflows for the 12 months ending sept. 30. flows are concentrated in some very large fund companies with etfs, says patrick davitt, a partner at autonomous research who covers janus. janus hasn't had a strong position there.\n\nto shore itself up, janus recently agreed to merge with british fund shop henderson group uk:hgg in the second quarter of 2017. the merger will be a major cultural shift, giving the company a more global footprint and more than $320 billion in assets.\n\nanother significant change has been flying under the radar: janus, the poster child for active management, has been making forays into exchange-traded funds. in the last 10 months, it has launched eight etfs, bringing its total to 10 after it acquired two velocityshares etfs in 2014. davitt says such etf launches are inexpensive for janus, but he doubts they will have much of an impact on the company's bottom line. trying to play the passive game in etfs is very difficult now, he says. the winners have been decided.\n\n janus brings something unique to the table—a bit of that 1990s star-manager flair. \n\nbut janus doesn't want to play that game. if our business strategy was to say we think s&p 500 etfs are the wave of the future, it would probably be too late to do that, says nick cherney, janus' head of exchange-traded products. that isn't what we're doing. we're trying to offer high-quality products that appeal to janus clients that they can't get elsewhere. we don't have any etfs that have direct competition.\n\nthat isn't exactly true. if one looks at, for instance, janus small cap growth alpha jsml, -2.60% , which opened last february, there are 13 other competing small-cap growth funds, each with their own strategy for picking growth stocks. the $5.5 billion vanguard small-cap growth vbk, -3.31% has the lowest expense ratio in the group, 0.08%, a fraction of the janus etf's 0.5%.\n\nyet janus brings something unique to the table—a bit of that 1990s star-manager flair. the small-cap etf and its sibling janus small/mid cap growth alpha jsmd, -2.67% are strategic-beta etfs, which means the firm essentially codified its active stock-picking decisions into an index. both were designed in-house by the same analytical team that runs janus triton jattx, +0.28% and janus venture javtx, +0.39% , two similar funds that have bronze ratings from morningstar and are closed to new investors.\n\nthey launched these etfs when they did because they closed the actively managed funds that cover those areas, says morningstar analyst greg carlson. they're trying to run these etfs with generally the same philosophy as janus venture and janus triton.\n\ncherney says the etfs won't hurt its existing mutual fund business. i wouldn't call this cannibalization, he says. the etfs are complementary. if investors were going to leave venture or triton for etfs, they would do that anyway. they now have a better etf option. the etfs are distinct from one another as well as their fund counterparts. while triton and venture both own 19 of the same companies in their top 25 holdings, the etfs have just two companies that overlap with one another, and three between them that are found in the funds.\n\nperhaps janus' most promising new etf is janus short duration income vnla, -0.04% , which launched in november. not only is the fund actively managed and thus in the firm's wheelhouse, but its management team at kapstream capital, which janus acquired in 2015, has an excellent long-term record. kapstream is run by portfolio managers that bill gross originally hired at pimco, who left to start their own firm in australia in 2006, cherney says. that strategy—the $4.7 billion kapstream absolute return income, which the new etf will resemble—has produced a 5.3% annualized return since its inception in may 2007, beating its australian short-term bond benchmark by 1.4 percentage points a year.\n\ncan wall street close this gender gap?\n\nthough actively managed stock etfs have yet to take off, active fixed-income etfs from pimco and doubleline capital have done well in terms of both performance and asset-gathering. actively managed fixed income is the only active story in the etf space that has attracted significant assets in the last couple of years, says dave nadig, ceo of etf.com. janus is taking a different angle here by offering a truly global fund. it isn't just buying the same short-term bonds everybody else is buying in the u.s. it falls into a similar category to the pimco enhanced short maturity active mint, +0.01% —an enhanced cash-replacement fund.\n\nthe janus fund has a 0.35% expense ratio, the same as pimco's etf, which nadig says isn't cheap, especially in a low-interest-rate environment, though it could seem more acceptable as rates begin to rise and the etfs deliver more income.\n\nnot all of janus' new offerings are as noteworthy. its thematic index etfs for the health care sector—janus health & fitness us:fits, janus obesity us:slim, janus us:org and janus long-term care old, -1.47% —seem gimmicky and dangerous, based more on generating cutesy tickers to market than on meeting legitimate investing goals. each is focused on a sliver of an industry and is concentrated in just a handful of stocks. in the long-term care etf, for instance, just two stocks, welltower us:hcn and ventas vtr, -3.68% , account for 40% of its portfolio, while nike nke, -1.14% and adidas group ads, +0.18% addyy, -0.92% account for 37% of the health & fitness etf. highly concentrated portfolios are something janus is known for historically, so i don't think that's particularly shocking, cherney says.\n\nit may not be shocking, but it's hardly something to brag about. janus' supposed expertise with regard to its concentrated portfolios was on the active-management side—and even then that expertise has led to some volatile performance and outright disasters after the dot-com bust. indexing wins because of low costs and broad diversification. the thematic health etfs offer neither—their 0.5% fees are high, and their holdings are extremely concentrated without any manager discretion. if anything cries out for the old-school active management janus was once famous for, it's strategies like these.\n\nthis

president biden proposed to eliminate the windfall elimination provision (wep) and the government pension offet (gpo). these provisions reduce social security benefits for workers with significant government pensions from jobs not covered by social security and for their spouses and survivors.\n\neliminating these provisions would be a mistake. they are well-intentioned attempts to solve an equity issue that arises because about 25% to 30% of state and local workers are not covered by social security.\n\nexclusion from social security creates two types of problems.\n\nfirst, employees lacking coverage are exposed to a variety of gaps in basic protection — most notably in the areas of survivor and disability insurance. second, uncovered state and local workers can gain minimum coverage under social security and — until the introduction of the wep in 1983 — could profit from the progressive benefit structure, which was designed to help low-wage workers.\n\nto see how that happens, look at the social security benefit formula. it applies three factors to the individual's average indexed monthly earnings (aime). thus, in 2020, a person's benefit would be the sum of 90% of the first $960 of aime, 32% of aime between $960 and $5,785, and 15% of aime over $5,785 (see table 1).\n\nsince a worker's monthly earnings are averaged over a typical working lifetime (35 years), a high-wage earner with a short period of time in covered employment looks exactly like a low-wage earner. both would have 90% of their earnings replaced by social security.\n\nsimilarly, a spouse who had a full career in uncovered employment — and worked in covered employment for only a short time or not at all — would be eligible for the spousal and survivor benefits.\n\nthe wep reduces the first factor in the benefit formula from 90% to 40%; the 32% and 15% factors remain unchanged. it is not a perfect solution. the benefit cut is proportionately larger for workers with low aimes, regardless of whether they were a high- or low-earner in their uncovered employment. albeit, the wep does guarantee that the reduction in benefits cannot exceed half of the worker's public pension, which protects those with low pensions from uncovered work.\n\nseveral years ago, rep. kevin brady (r-texas) introduced a bill with a new wep formula. it involved two steps. first, the regular social security factors would be applied to all earnings — both covered and uncovered — to calculate a benefit. the resulting benefit then would be multiplied by the share of the aime that came from covered earnings. such a change would produce smaller reductions for the lower paid and larger reductions for the higher paid. that is a better approach.\n\nthus, the wep would benefit from a little reform. but neither the wep nor gpo should be eliminated. these provisions address a real inequity associated with having some state and local workers not covered by social security.\n\nthe bigger question, however, is whether it is worth the trouble of creating a whole new procedure when the real answer is to extend social security coverage to all state and local workers. universal coverage would both offer better protection for workers and eliminate the equity problem.
do people who write to the moneyologist reveal the worst — or the best — in human nature? that question concerned readers throughout the year.\n\nlike a doctor or lawyer, people usually come to the moneyologist when there's something wrong, so we're not catching people at their best when they're fighting over estates or plotting against their stepchildren. there were many instances of people who did want to do the right thing, like this lady who wants to know how to disperse $150,000 she received from her ex-husband's pension. or this mother who didn't want to receive anything from her abusive ex-husband's estate.\n\nwith that said, here are the 10 most popular moneyologist dilemmas of 2016. brace yourselves, however, they don't all paint a pretty picture of american families this holiday season:\n\n1. can i leave my stepchildren nothing if my husband dies?\n\nreaders of the moneyologist advice column couldn't seem to get enough of letters from stepmothers, who often appeared to be looking out for their own interests. (stepchildren didn't always come off so well either, it should be said.) this man's divorce stated that he shall maintain a $300,000 life insurance for his kids as beneficiary until they reach the age of 23, but the stepmother in question wondered if she could annex a life insurance policy meant for his children.\n\n2. my father left his home to his kids — my stepmother sold it for $1 million\n\nsometimes, readers engage with a story and it sparks dozens of other letters along similar themes. when it came to the moneyologist dilemmas, stolen inheritance was a familiar subject. this man's stepmother sold the family house for $1 million after his father died. she bought a new house for $500,000 and kept the difference. unfortunately, lawyers say this kind of case is pretty common. it carries a universal warning: always be specific when writing your last will and testament.\n\n3. my wife is divorcing me after 21 years — and wants everything in our savings\n\nthis man wrote to the moneyologist when his wife told him that she wants to divorce. they jointly own a home, their savings account contains a large sum of readily available cash that we use for emergency funds, college tuition and living expenses for their son. but he earns less than his wife and wants to stay in the family home. he feared for his financial future as a divorced father. many of the comments were less forgiving than this writer's advice.\n\n4. my cheating husband just inherited $3 million from his father\n\nthere's an appetite for personal dilemmas that have that intoxicating blend of romance and finance. each one has its own set of drama and, in many cases, dysfunction. this woman's husband had an affair and, just as she is preparing to divorce him, his father dies and he inherits $3 million we have five children together and i went through a lot with him for many years and i want to punish him for going behind my back and having an affair, she wrote. should she still go ahead with her plans?\n\n5.my wife doesn't work, splurged $10,000 — and wants her name on my home\n\nthis fellow has been married three years and he was surprised (and not in a good way) by his wife's lack of savings and her unwillingness to work. this is not matched by an unwillingness to borrow money. she does not help me with the mortgage or property tax. i pay for everything and she only pays her own expenses and there are occasions when she cannot pay her own expenses, and asks me for help, he wrote. the moneyologist had tough words for both parties.\n\n6.i'm terminally ill — my husband says he will disinherit my son\n\nsometimes, the letters are heartbreaking. this woman is running out of time to secure a viable financial future for her son when her husband is only concerned about leaving money to his own children. i do feel that assets earned during the time of our marriage until my death — with exception of that additional inheritance — should be divided equally. do i have legal and moral grounds to request such a request? she wrote. but, as this writer advised, she is not entirely powerless.\n\n7.my dad didn't love me! he only left me $10,000\n\none man's windfall is another man's slap in the face. this son in south carolina wrote to say he feels his dad, who passed away from lung cancer, didn't love him as he only left him $10,000. he compared all of the belongings (truck, small boat, his family home) that were left to others. his 12-year-old nephew was left the house. did his brother pressure his father into doing that? alas, undue influence and a request to be remembered in a will are hard to prove.\n\n8.a father's letter to his adult children at thanksgiving: you're on your own\n\nsometimes, we strike up a relationship of sorts with our letter-writers and sean in san antonio is one such person. he wrote in originally to complain that he gave his son $7,500 every year and his daughter-in-law in turn gave it to her church. so he then he wrote a letter to his family at thanksgiving to tell them that the annual gravy train. his relationships with his children, he said later, had become too transactional and ending the cash gifts brought the family closer together.\n\n9. my roommate is the most entitled millennial in america\n\nthis kitchen sink drama between these san francisco housemates turned into a bigger question of whether millennials are entitled as they are sometimes accused of being: the answer, according to the letter writer, is no, but her roommate suggests otherwise. she pilfers her snapple, guilt-trips people into buying her food and then goes off on merry jaunts to hawaii. nice work, if you can get it. in moneyologist revisited the letter-writer said she gave up and the friendship faded away.\n\n10. my son won't let me see his kids unless i change my $10 million will\n\na case of emotional blackmail where a son threatens to withhold access to his children unless his own mother changes her $10 million will: he says we are disrespecting him, she wrote. he makes well into six figures. we paid for his schooling and gave him and his siblings money. there may be a middle ground: a sum up front for everyone and a smaller annual income for all the children. but with access to grandchildren at stake, this is a decision only the grandparents can make.
an earlier version of this report had an error in the price being offered per share. it has been corrected.\n\nunitedhealth group inc. unh, -0.68% unit optum has agreed to acquire health care technology company change healthcare chng, +0.74% for $25.75 a share in cash, the companies said in a joint statement wednesday. change healthcare has 317.3 million shares outstanding, according to factset, giving the deal a value of about $8 billion. change healthcare will join with optuminsight to provide software and data analytics, technology-enabled services and research, advisory and revenue cycle management offerings to help make health care work better for everyone,: said the statement. the deal is expected to close in the second half and to boost unitedhealth's net eps by 20 cents in 2022 and adjusted eps by 50 cents. change healthcare shares soared 37% premarket on the news.
looks like we picked a good year to start a beer column.\n\nour first full year of beer goggles here at marketwatch caught both the craft beer industry and beer in general in a state of upheaval largely unseen since the brewery consolidation of the late '70s and early '80s. sure, anheuser-busch (and, later, anheuser-busch inbev bud, -0.34% ) had purchased non-controlling stakes in redhook, widmer brothers and kona before and had already bought the goose island and blue point breweries. but acquiring four u.s. craft breweries (elysian, golden road, breckenridge and 4 peaks) and a cider house (virtue) in a calendar year?\n\nyes, we saw miller pick up leinenkugel, shipyard (which went independent again) and the now-defunct celis before entering its millercoors joint venture with molsoncoors, but we never thought we'd see it pick up a brewery like saint archer, only to have the now-sabmiller uk:sab portion of that venture sell to a-b. mahou san miguel buying 30% of founders? heineken buying 50% of lagunitas? constellation brands stz, +1.53% buying all of ballast point? boston beer co. sam, -1.83% founder jim koch telling a senate committee that he may be the last u.s. owner of the samuel adams brand?\n\nthat's a whole lot to take in during a year when the number of breweries in the u.s. skyrocketed past 4,100 to pre-prohibition heights (if non pre-prohibition breweries per capita). even after spending more than a year with our eyes and ears on the industry and our feet planted in breweries, brewpubs, storage coolers and brewers' conferences, we took away one big lesson: there's still a whole lot to learn about the beer industry in the united states. however, here are some of the other takeaways that we think are going to serve us, brewers, distributors and beer drinkers well in 2016.\n\nanheuser-busch inbev will do what it wants until someone says no: when anheuser-busch was told it couldn't own distributors in kentucky, it just bought more in colorado — where it's already the biggest distributor — and bought a craft brewery there just for kicks. when it appeared it wouldn't be allowed to buy sabmiller without ditching miller brands in the u.s., it sold them to molson coors at a discount. when the justice department told it that it couldn't sell corona, pacifico and other brands here after buying modelo for $20.1 billion in 2013, it gladly ceded u.s. rights to constellation brands in favor of larger global market share.\n\nthe justice department is now looking into charges that anheuser-busch inbev is monopolizing distribution in california, while continuing to weigh the antitrust implications of its purchase of sabmiller. however, after buying 10 barrel, elysian, golden road, breckenridge and 4 peaks in the past year and a half, anheuser-busch inbev now finds itself in the brewer's, distributor's and retailer's tiers of the u.s. three-tier distribution system implemented after prohibition — a system designed to prevent exactly this type of thing from happening. in fairness to anheuser-busch, they've been forthcoming about their plans to corner 100% share of mind and, in the case of their high-end craft division, have been open about their plans to use their own distributors to bring their craft brands to a wider audience. this turned a senate judiciary committee hearing on the sabmiller purchase into a de facto debate on the merits of an ever-expanding anheuser-busch, but it's clear that a company that spent $20 billion on one brewer won't be shy about buying up craft brewers for $50 million to $100 million apiece.\n\nhowever, the justice department and state attorneys general are going to have a lot of say in just how much leverage a-b can use to get its brands to market and elbow out competitors. expect those next beer wars to take place not in super bowl ads, but in courts and halls of government with the help of legal teams and lobbyists.\n\neverybody has a price: look at some of the names among the breweries that sold either a stake or their whole brewery this year: founders, firestone walker, ballast point, lagunitas, elysian, breckenridge. these are longstanding pillars of the craft beer community that, according to the brewers association's definition of a craft brewer, aren't craft anymore.\n\nthey're also indicative of just how costly craft beer's massive growth can be. when you have to increase capacity, take on new employees, pay more for ingredients and materials and open new facilities, that all costs millions of dollars that you, as a relatively small brewer, often don't have. we are seeing brewers that have been at it for 20 years or more sell part or all of themselves just to keep afloat, and we're seeing breweries like saint archer and golden road, which aren't even five years old, sell to maintain their massive growth and exit an increasingly crowded market. as anheuser-busch inbev's purchases in late december reminded us, brewery acquisitions aren't done by a long stretch. brewery ownership doesn't matter to most drinkers yet, but a rapidly shifting beer landscape may change that in years to come. we expect to be quite busy tallying up the mergers and acquisitions and writing the post-mortems in 2016.\n\nprivate equity will play a bigger role: the utah brewer's cooperative (wasatch and squatters), uinta, southern tier, long trail, otter creek, magic hat, pyramid, portland brewing and sweetwater were all at least partially owned by private-equity firms before this column launched. just this year, oskar blues, full sail and dogfish head were among the brewers that sold either stakes or their entire breweries to private-equity concerns.\n\nin the minds of the brewers making these deals — and the brewers association — private-equity money enables brewers to expand and experiment without giving up their independence. in the eyes of brewers who've refused private-equity deals, that's just a good way to get new labels slapped on your beer, your distribution and production increased, your portfolio streamlined and your brewery sold again within five years. it's certainly an alternative to selling to another brewer but, as even brewers with employee shareholders like full sail have discovered, it's no guarantee. it'll be interesting to see not only how the latest round of pe-owned brewers fares, but who takes pe money next.\n\ndistribution, distribution, distribution: we're going to bang on this issue like questlove for the next year for one big reason: the way u.s. drinkers get their beer goes a long way in determining which beers they drink. as we mentioned earlier this year, 11 breweries make 90% of the beer consumed in the u.s. it isn't surprising that they hold a lot of sway with distributors and command a lot of shelf space and tap handles as a result.\n\nit's a battle for small brewers to elbow into that pack, but it's a battle they can win if they choose to make it a priority. state beer guilds wield more power than they realize and, by taking the distribution fight to the statehouse — as was the case in kentucky — they can level the playing field and get the three-tier system working as it should. the justice department might help shape future beer distribution with its ruling on the sabmiller sale, but the big battles lie ahead in the states themselves.\n\ninnovation is more important than ever: from brewers that sell only kegs to those who invest big in their communities and employees, the most brilliant and successful new breweries find ways to branch out and separate themselves from the pack. if you're canning organic beer, growing your own ingredients for locally branded beers, using one way kegs or using your facilities as a hub for small brewers seeking a hand up, you're finding an angle and moving u.s. beer forward. the big brewers are doing the same, and have been for decades, but if you can use their size and limitations against them and make beer that stands the test of time, even years of struggle can eventually pay off. the innovators are creating some of the best stories in the beer industry right now, and we're hoping to tell more of them.\n\njason notte is a freelance writer based in portland, ore. his writing has appeared in the new york times, the huffington post and esquire. notte received a bachelor's

the wilhelmina modeling agency has represented some of the most iconic faces in the entertainment industry, including whitney houston, demi lovato, nick jonas, nicki minaj and henrik lundqvist. the firm was founded in 1967 by dutch supermodel wilhelmina in new york city. today, it's worth a reported $30 million and has locations in cities like london, los angeles and miami. the agency became one of the first firms to create a curve division for fuller figured models.\n\nbill wackermann has been its ceo since 2016. before that, he served as executive vice president and publishing director at condé nast, he recently talked with marketwatch about his spending habits — and his biggest money mistake.\n\nsee also: to find models, agents no longer scour shopping malls — they check instagram\n\nwhat's the best financial advice you've ever been given?\n\ntwo things: if you can't afford it — if you know the money's not in the bank — don't buy it. when i graduated college i got into credit card debt like everybody else and it took me two or three years to get out of it. i maybe had $5,000 [in debt], but the first job i had out of college was teaching english making $21,000 a year. it would have taken me 30 years to pay that off at that salary. i cut up my credit cards, maybe three years out of college, and i've only used a debit card ever since. so if it's not in my bank account, i don't buy it.\n\nwhat' the last great thing you purchased?\n\nthey say you always want the car you could never afford when you were in high school, so last year, i bought a 1987 mercedes-benz 560sl. i drive it twice a year, but i wanted it. i felt like i would have liked to have had it when i was in high school at some point. so i have it.\n\nwhat do you not mind spending a lot of money on?\n\ni love spending money on travel; good sheets; fashion; clothes; shoes; cashmere sweaters; and family.\n\nmodel cindy bruna and wilhelmina ceo bill wackermann. mireya acierto/getty images\n\nwhat are you a cheapskate about?\n\nfood — and that sounds strange coming from the ceo of a modeling agency. i was just in norway and i wound up at tgi fridays and i sat with a friend of mine at the bar and had a pint of beer and mozzarella sticks. it was one of the best days i've had in a long time. to me it's about the place and the people — i won't spend a lot of money on food.\n\nbiggest money mistake?\n\nselling too early. when you're younger and you start making more money you start investing more. i flip houses and i bought this one house [in east hampton] right before the market crashed in 2008 and it was sort of a multimillion-dollar purchase. instead of holding it — which i probably could have — i got really nervous and i sold it. i said, 'i have to sell it; everything is falling apart.' now it's double its value of what i paid for it because it was such a great location and it was the right spot. i kind of knew it in the back of my head, but i haven't forgotten that lesson: sometimes if you don't know what to do, do nothing. sit the market out a little. unless you really need it to pay your mortgage, it will come back. it may not come back in the exact same time you want, but the market will come back, especially real estate. it was a dumb decision. [i lost] probably $200,000. it's an expensive lesson.\n\nhow do you know when it's time to make a new career move?\n\nif we really are in tune with ourselves we know when to leave that job — we're just afraid. i always say, 'what you fear controls you.' if fear is your motivating factor you're not in a good place for your career or your life. so know it, it's getting in tune with yourself to say, 'i'm going to get out there, and i'm going to make a change.' the change may be scary, but i've never heard anyone say after that 'i want to go back.'\n\ndo you ever plan to retire?\n\ni don't know my kids always say 'dad we can never see you retiring?' i think work hours and work flexibility is changing so much today that i like to think i'm doing something i'm passionate about whether that's making a garden, teaching a class or working a 9 to 5 job; i don't want to stop.
congressional democrats have signaled they may use a fast-track budget process to push through the next round of u.s. pandemic economic aid, which senate democratic leader chuck schumer said would boost the size of stimulus checks paid to lower income americans.\n\nthe optional process, called a budget reconciliation, would allow a bill containing the payments to pass the senate with only a simple majority, instead of the 60 votes usually required to end debate on legislation. schumer has said the payments should rise to $2,000 per family member instead of the current $600 under current legislation passed last week,\n\nthe downside of using the reconciliation procedure is it could take longer than democrats want and its use would require the bill to be more narrow in scope than they would prefer.\n\nwith democrats newly in the majority in the senate and the inauguration of the new biden-harris administration just two weeks away, all options are on the table as we consider the best way to address the crises at hand and lead our nation forward, said house budget chairman john yarmuth, a kentucky democrat, in a statement.\n\nthat includes potentially using reconciliation to advance critical priorities for american families, he said.\n\na house democratic aide, on condition of anonymity, said no when asked if reconciliation would be take too long to be useful for passing another round of stimulus.\n\nthe reconciliation procedure has been used for major bills in the past, like part of the affordable care act and the 2017 tax cut bill, but usually the process has taken months. democrats have said they would like to see a new round of fiscal stimulus soon after joe biden is sworn in on jan. 20.\n\nschumer reiterated that idea wednesday in a brief news conference on capitol hill. with the democratic wins of raphael warnock and jon ossoff in the georgia senate runoff elections on tuesday, schumer would become the new senate majority leader once kamala harris is seated as vice president to break senate tie votes.\n\none of the first things that i want to do when our new senators are seated is to deliver the $2,000 checks to american families, schumer said.\n\nreconciliation has mostly been used for partisan bills where the minority party is not expected to support the proposal. its name comes from a time when congress used to pass two budget resolutions a year laying out spending, revenue and debt targets. the bills spun out from one of those resolutions were meant to reconcile changes from the first budget.\n\nwhile now congress is doing well to pass even one budget blueprint annually, and hasn't since 2017 when the house and senate were under unified gop control, the reconciliation tag has stuck.\n\nunder it, the two chambers of congress must pass a budget resolution with specific instructions to committees on how much in spending cuts or increases to target or how much in tax increases or cuts to target. other legislation can be written to raise the federal debt limit.\n\nthe committees then write legislation to meet those targets and that language is bundled together, usually into one bill. legislation that is spun out of the budget resolution is protected from filibuster in the senate, meaning it can pass with only 51 votes instead of the 60 ,\n\nbut there are limitations to the procedure. the reconciliation bills cannot increase the budget deficit beyond the years covered by the budget resolution, which is why president bush's tax cuts were originally temporary. the bills cannot deal with social security. and the changes proposed must have a budget effect by changing spending or revenues in a non-incidental way. violations of those rules can result in the offending provisions being stripped out or the bill losing its filibuster protection.\n\ngoing through the reconciliation process usually takes at least several weeks and involves adopting budget resolutions that are usually very tight party-line votes, followed by committee action, and then the passage of the reconciliation bills themselves. bill hoagland, a long-time ex-capitol hill budget staffer for republicans, said he doubted democrats would turn to reconciliation so soon.\n\ni think the time it would take to pass a budget resolution and reconciliation bill would not address the immediate issue of covid and so they would direct their attention on an emergency supplemental rather than a reconciliation bill, he said.\n\ndemocrats will have the ability to take two bites at the reconciliation apple this year, if they choose to, so they could use one of those for extra fiscal stimulus and keep one in reserve. they could pass two budget resolutions – one for the current fiscal year ending in october and the traditional one for the upcoming budget year, as republicans did in 2017.\n\nthat is an option at our disposal, said the house democratic aide.\n\nusing reconciliation would also help democrats avoid a potentially bruising intraparty battle over whether to do away with the filibuster in the senate. enough democratic senators have expressed reluctance to do so that scrapping the filibuster appears unlikely, but that could change if republicans are seen as unyielding.\n\nsubstituting two rounds of reconciliation legislation for scrapping the filibuster would be a mistake, according to fix our senate, a group that wants to overhaul senate rules, like the filibuster, that it says have been abused by republicans to stop popular legislation.\n\nreconciliation can be a useful tool to allow a simple majority to pass some critical policies, but it can't do everything and it's not a substitute for eliminating the filibuster and delivering on the promises made, said eli zupnick, spokesman for the the group.
general electric co. shares extended their losses wednesday, a day after the company announced a fourth quarter after-tax charge of $6.2 billion and a $3 billion cash capital contribution to its insurance subsidiary that will grow to $15 billion by 2024.\n\non a call with analysts, ge chief executive john l. flannery said he was deeply disappointed at the magnitude of the charge in the company's legacy reinsurance portfolio.\n\nread:ge's stock sinks after unveiling $6.2 billion charge in q4\n\nge's north america life & health is the reinsurance portfolio that the company retained after mostly exiting the business between 2004 and 2006. a reinsurer buys the right to receive premiums from the primary insurers that deal directly with consumers in exchange for eventually shouldering any potential losses. those primary insurers underwrite and administer the policies and process claims when they come in.\n\nthe decision to retain the current insurance-related business, 60% of which is related to long-term care insurance, was based on the view that a gradual runoff of existing claims would be more profitable than selling the business, flannery told analysts. ge has not taken on any new claims in the area since 2006, according to ge capital chief risk officer, ryan zanin, who was also on the call.\n\nflannery's understated conclusion: in hindsight, ge underappreciated the risk in this book.\n\nge stock ge, -2.65% was down 4% in midday trade wednesday, and is down more than 20% over the past three months as a restructuring to return the company to profitability disappointed investors. the stock has lost more than 40% over the past 12 months, while the dow jones industrial average djia djia, -0.46% has climbed 29.8% and the s&p 500 spx, -1.48% has added 23%.\n\nread:ge's stock plunges again as another analyst abandons bullish view\n\nsee also:how to avoid the next ge — and find industrial winners of the future\n\nmore:ge's stock falls toward fibonacci support level as charts suggest worst may be over\n\nge says there are approximately 7 million long-term care policies in force across the industry but its market share is only about 4%. the entire industry, said zanin, is experiencing more claims than originally estimated— more people are making claims and for a longer time than expected. large numbers of policyholders who purchased long-term care insurance years ago are now reaching age 80 and over, the prime claim-paying period.\n\nin 2017, economic and industry trends in the long-term care insurance business— how long people pay required premiums, how long people will live and how well they will live—prompted ge to initiate a review of its reserves, including whether it had enough regulatory capital for the business. ge hired two independent actuarial firms and its auditor of more than 100 years, kpmg, also reviewed the numbers as part of its annual audit process.\n\njp morgan analyst stephen tusa asked ge chief financial officer jamie miller if the company was happy with its auditor. if these guys reviewed this stuff every year for the last several years and this is kind of a result of that, doesn't that kind of raise questions?\n\ntrump official: medicaid not designed for able-bodied people\n\nmiller responded that the board assesses kpmg every year. there's no change planned at this time, but obviously that's something we look at every year.\n\nhowever, analyst jeffrey todd sprague of vertical research partners llc followed up with his own questioning of the rigor of the effort. it is hard to imagine a $15 billion problem materialized in the course of a year.\n\nflannery said he shared the surprise and deep disappointment of really this charge coming out of the legacy business.\n\nge said that it had totally reconstructed its long-term care claims cost projections. higher cost estimates combined with claims costs that now extend out over 40 years based on current life expectancies drove the multibillion-dollar after-tax gaap reserve charge.\n\nsee:ge is reviewing its structure and may break up\n\nin addition, since ge's north american life and health business is legally based in kansas, it was that state's insurance regulator that had the last word on whether the business had enough capital to pay future claims. capital reserves are calculated assuming moderately adverse conditions, rather than a more optimistic set of assumptions that can be used for financial statements prepared according to gaap accounting standards.\n\nthe result is that ge capital was required to fund an additional capital contribution of $3 billion in the first quarter of 2018 and approximately $2 billion annually from 2019 to 2024 for a total of about $15 billion.\n\nge capital did not pay a dividend to the ge parent company in the second half of 2017 and no dividend is planned for 2018. flannery said he did not expect to see any dividends from ge capital for the foreseeable future. ge capital had approximately $31 billion in cash on its balance sheet at the end of 2017.
the u.s. stock market faces a crucial test tuesday after the long weekend.\n\nafter the worst 10-day start of a calendar year ever, the major stock market averages are on the cusp of the first real bear market since the financial crisis.\n\nbullish and bearish technicians agree on one make-or-break number as the threshold that will determine whether this latest correction will become a bear market, generally defined as a 20% decline from a previous peak.\n\nwhat's the number? the s&p 500 index's aug. 25 correction closing low of 1867.61. that, technicians agree, is the support level the market must hold for the bull to continue. it's the market's answer to powerball, though this time it's winner take all.\n\nthe support break will occur if and when the index falls below its august low of 1,867, to the nearest penny, wrote the bearish michael kahn in his getting technical column in barrons.com.\n\n 'for me, almost everything is in place for the third cyclical bear market of the 21st century.'  — michael kahn in his 'getting technical' column\n\nthe s&p below 1,875-1,925 spells 'bear market' and above 2,135 … spells 'continuation of the bull market,'  wrote the bullish ron meisels in his phases & cycles newsletter.\n\nthat support level is about 13% below the s&p 500's all-time closing high of 2130.82 on may 21. since then, the s&p 500, the dow jones industrial average and the nasdaq composite index have had a couple of sell-offs and rallies but have been unable to match their previous highs.\n\nthat may turn out to be a critical failure for the bulls.\n\n… the bull needs to re-assert itself soon in a visible up trend, wrote meisels. the s&p 500 recovered well from its august/september lows, but … the inability of bullish forces to put together a concerted rally and break out above this recovery high [of 2,116 in november] remains a big concern.\n\nin fact, the major averages have been in technical down trends for months.\n\nthe percent of [new york stock exchange] stocks trading above their 200-day moving averages has been less than 50% since june … and the nyse composite index itself has been in decline since may, telling us that the average stock already is in a bear market, wrote kahn. for me, almost everything is in place for the third cyclical bear market of the 21st century.\n\nmeisels, however, cited the high percentage of stocks below their 10- and 30-week moving averages as contrarian indicators; they're at levels nearly identical to where they were at the august lows, which were followed by the big september-october rally that meisels called correctly when we spoke last fall.\n\nas of last week, meisels was expecting the final leg of the bull market to take the s&p 500 above its previous highs.\n\na move above 2,116 would change the pattern of gently declining highs that has been in force since last may and would place the s&p 500 firmly above its 200-day moving average, he wrote.\n\nbut that could happen only if the s&p 500 holds current support levels and keeps from falling, and staying, below 1,867.\n\nwhat if it doesn't? according to some technicians, the next major support level would be the previous s&p 500 all-time high of 1,575, which it first surpassed in march 2013. that would mark a 26% decline from its june 2015 all-time high.\n\nas i wrote last week, the combination of a struggling global economy, weak earnings, a strong dollar and higher interest rates should be enough to push the markets into the next bear.\n\ni think that 26% drop is about what we'll get in a classic cyclical bear market, which i don't expect to be accompanied by a financial crisis like the last one was.\n\nso watch that magic number of 1,867 in the coming days; it may tell you all you need to know about where the market is going in 2016.\n\nhoward r. gold is a marketwatch columnist and founder and editor of goldenegg investing, which offers exclusive market commentary and low-cost, low-risk retirement investing plans. follow him on twitter @howardrgold.
the federal reserve should take no further action on interest rates for now, in order to gauge the health of the economy and get a better sense of any message being sent by weaker financial markets, said dallas fed president robert kaplan, on thursday.\n\nwe shouldn't be taking further action until some of these uncertainties resolve themselves, and i think that could take several months, kaplan said in an interview on bloomberg television.\n\nthe fed can afford to be patient because inflation is not running away from us, he said.\n\nkaplan is not a voting member of the fed's interest-rate committee this year, but he is influential as a member of the central bank's subcommittee on communications with markets.\n\nthe fed has penciled in two rate hikes in 2019. with the recent sell-off in stocks spx, -0.16% investors now think the next fed move will be to cut interest rates.\n\nread: why wall street might be right about the next fed move\n\nasked if the markets know something the fed hasn't seen, kaplan replied that it was critical in the job i'm in, that you pay very close attention to what the markets are saying.\n\nsome market forces can spill over and cause economic growth to slow, he said. this may already be happening, he added.\n\nthe dallas fed president said the weakness in financial markets is likely reflecting three big issues: a deceleration in global growth, weakness in interest-sensitive sectors and tightness in financial markets in the form of widening credit spreads.\n\nit is going to take some time to see the depth and breadth of those three issues. we should not take any further actions until these issues are resolved for better or worse, he said.\n\nthe fed should also be very open to possibly slowing down the pace of its balance sheet runoff, he said.\n\ni'm not at that point [of advocating any change in balance sheet runoff] but i am watching it very, very carefully, he said.\n\nthe fed is now allowing as much as $50 billion in maturing securities to roll off its balance sheet every month. some traders are concerned this program, known as quantitative tightening, is drying up liquidity.\n\nthe dallas fed projects gross domestic product will slow to a little below a 2% annual rate this year.\n\nkaplan said the fed projected some slowing as the economy entered 2019 but the actual slowdown seen has been a little greater than we expected.\n\nthe u.s. economy will not be immune from weaker growth in china, he said.\n\nit is critical we take the right action at the fed during this period. this is a very critical time. we need to be very vigilant and i think patience is a critical tool we should be using during this period, he said.
dear moneyist,\n\ni live in georgia and was adopted at an early age (7) along with my biological brother who was only 2.the family had a biological son (5 years older than me) who has always been very jealous. i have lived in the small town taking care of mom and dad all my life. my older brother has lived in chicago all his life. he's addicted to several hardcore drugs he purchased from an ex-stepdaughter. he has been arrested for dui and the last time it included drug charges that a high-priced lawyer was able to have removed.\n\n 'her biological son has access to her accounts. he put her in an assisted living facility and had her change her will to remove both of us totally. he has made her believe his life was ruined because she adopted us.'  — karen\n\nmom offered to give me a small amount of money for a down payment for a house with a basement and, if she could live in the basement and take care of her until she dies. of course, i would. her biological son has access to her accounts and, when she told him the money had gone to me and she was going to move in with me, he put a stop to it. he put her in an assisted-living facility and had her change her will to remove both of us totally.\n\nalso read:what happens to my husband's credit score if his adult children default on their student loans — or die?\n\nhe made her believe his life was ruined because she adopted us. she claims she gave me my share of her estate in the form of a the down payment and said my brother's share was his schooling, which she paid for. that's a lie, but there's nothing else she has helped him with that she could use as a reason for cutting him out of her will too. my mother isn't rich, but she has done well. when her son gets his hands on the money it will be spent on drugs.\n\nis there anything both of us can do either now or after she passes? thank you for your time.\n\nkaren\n\ndear karen,\n\nit sounds like your mother has fallen under the influence of her son, or has decided to make you and your younger brother the source of her fears and anxieties. or both. if she is of sound body and mind, she has every right to renege on her promise to give you the money for a down payment. even if your mother died and left her house to your older brother in her will, undue influence is notoriously difficult to prove in court. there's so much psychology and so much that is unknown about these kinds of cases.\n\n how often does this brother visit your mother? what has the staff observed? she may feel dependent on your brother emotionally. and what about her finances? how long will they last? has your brother been using her accounts? \n\nvisit your mother and talk to her. talk to the people at her assisted living facility. how often does this brother visit her? what have they observed? she may be well taken care for physically, but she may feel dependent on your brother emotionally and feel scared to challenge him. and what about her finances? how long will they last? has your brother been using her accounts? her bank statements, investments and credit card statements should provide clues.\n\ndon't miss:can i sell my husband's $850,000 house after he dies? it's in his name only...\n\nthe fact that you were willing to take care of her is admirable. many children don't have that willingness. some would even like to charge their parents for taking them on regular trips to the doctor's office or grocery store. but — as hard as it may be to see your n'e'r-do-well brother take control of your mother's emotional and financial life — it doesn't mean you are entitled to that money. is your mother of sound mind? is she in decline?\n\nwho says seniors can't be tech savvy?\n\n you didn't say whether your brother has been appointed as your mother's durable power of attorney. if you saw evidence of financial misdeeds, you could ask a civil court to provide an accounting of how your mother's money is being spent. \n\nyou didn't say whether your brother has been appointed as your mother's durable power of attorney. if you saw evidence of financial misdeeds, you could ask a civil court to provide an accounting of how your mother's money is being spent, according to the american bar association. you could also take a case in civil court to force him to repay any money withdrawn from your mother's accounts without her knowledge and revoke his durable power of attorney.\n\nyou could ask your mother to set up an irrevocable or revocable living trust with strict instructions on how her money should be spent. but you should approach this with the aim of helping her — not revisiting the subject of the down payment. if your mother dies without a will, you and your brother are legal heirs. if she dies with a will and doesn't explicitly disinherit you, then you have an excellent case that she simply neglected to mention you.\n\nbut your mother's financial situation and health are the most important. you have a lot of investigation to do. one word of warning: it may be that your mother has chosen this path for herself.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?

washington--jennifer powell chartered a bus in richmond, virginia, filled it with 40 teachers and rode nearly two hours to washington -- quite an effort to learn more about the u.s. economy.\n\nbut when you're learning from federal reserve chairwoman janet yellen, it's a ride worth taking, the armstrong high school personal finance and economics teacher believes.\n\nwe're dealing with lower socioeconomic students, and it's hard for them to understand all of the big words about economics, powell said. i don't want them to fall back on not having the money and knowledge they need to succeed.\n\nin a short speech, yellen schooled teachers on the history and primary functions of the federal reserve, and said that economic growth starts with education. she did not mention interest rates or the economic outlook for 2017.\n\nit's important for people to understand when we adjust interest rates we're not trying to advance one group of savers or borrowers or another, yellen said. what we're trying to do is keep the economy strong.\n\nteacher michelle emond nona tepper/medill news service\n\nafter her speech, the audience of about 60 educators at the federal reserve headquarters and remotely asked yellen questions on topics ranging from president-elect donald trump's promise to repeal the dodd-frank act to the underrepresentation of women in economics.\n\na lot of people were critical of dodd-frank. community bankers feel the burden of regulation is very great. i really feel strongly that we should be looking for ways to mitigate the regulatory burden, particularly for smaller institutions, yellen responded.\n\nbut, she said, i certainly wouldn't want to see [congress] roll it back.\n\nyellen also said she'd like more women to become economists.\n\nnationwide, about 30% of economics majors in college are women, she said, suggesting a lack of role models as well as an implicit bias as reasons for women's apparent disinterest in the field. she said research shows women economists receive less credit than men for co-authoring academic papers, especially when the co-author is a man.\n\nit's something that i do hope will change over time, and may even make a difference in how public policy is conducted, she said.\n\nyellen is the first woman to head the nation's central financial institution, and attendee michelle emond views the fed chair as a celebrity and positive role model for women.\n\nthe 29-year-old teacher rode the metro a hour from queen anne's county high school in maryland to hear yellen talk about how federal reserve decisions affect individuals.\n\nwhenever there's an opportunity to be the student, i try to take advantage, emond said.

treasury yields surged on friday, trimming their weeklong decline, after the jobs report showed the labor market remained healthy despite the growing pessimism over the economy's fortunes.\n\nat the same time, fed chairman jerome powell suggested the central bank would follow a more patient approach to raising rates in acknowledgment of wall street's concerns over the fed's tightening.\n\nthe 10-year treasury note yield tmubmusd10y, 1.619% rose 10.4 basis points to 2.661%, marking its biggest daily rise since nov. 2016. the benchmark maturity recorded a weeklong decline of 7.9 basis points, however. the 30-year bond yield tmubmusd30y, 2.372% advanced 7.1 basis points to 2.974%, trimming its weeklong decline to 7.4 basis points. both long-dated maturities came off their january lows. yields move in the opposite direction of bond prices.\n\nthe 2-year note yield tmubmusd02y, 0.153% climbed 9.7 basis points to 2.488%, marking its biggest one-day rise since feb. 2015. the short-dated maturity trimmed its weeklong fall to 4.6 basis points.\n\nthe bureau of labor statistics said the u.s. economy had added 312,000 jobs in december. economists polled by marketwatch had forecast a reading of 182,000. the unemployment rate rose to 3.9% from 3.7%, while average hourly earnings rose by 0.4%\n\nsee: u.s. gains 312,000 jobs in 10-month high that shattered wall street forecasts\n\nread: jobs report shows the fed is not done raising interest rates as market prices out a cut\n\nthe stronger-than-expected jobs number could alleviate fears the u.s. economy is at risk of slipping into a recession over the next two years. investors say continued employment gains could elicit further rate increases from the fed in 2019. the dow jones industrial average djia, -0.39% and s&p 500 spx, -0.16% jumped sharply, easing appetite for haven assets like government paper.\n\nthe fed is very much zeroed into the dual mandate. the current employment rate is below their long-run estimates. that fuels the fed's conviction inflation is coming, and they should be raising rates. investors are spooked by that formula, said michael arone, chief investment strategist for state street global advisors.\n\npowell alleviated such concerns, however, by acknowledging the economy's strength while saying the fed would be flexible in raising interest rates. he also said the central bank's balance sheet reduction could be altered if it sparked problems in financial markets.\n\nthis was a chance for powell to show leadership at the fed and push for a change in attitude after the fed was criticized for being tone-deaf, said john vail, chief global strategist at nikko asset management.\n\nyields started the session higher after bloomberg news reported that a u.s. delegation would visit beijing for a new round of trade talks on monday and tuesday. it would mark the first face-to-face negotiations since president donald trump's meeting with china's leader xi jinping in early december.
the former tv heart-throb, who played a california highway cop in the series chips in the late 1970s and early 1980s, has put up for sale his 1980 rolls-royce silver wraith ii. it's on the docket at the annual barrett-jackson classic car auction in scottsdale, ariz. — alongside a vast range of other cars dating from the 1930s all the way to the present.\n\n gross returns from classic and vintage cars overall worked out at 5.6% a year from 1998 to 2015, or 3.4% a year after inflation. \n\nif you want to score a 1940 plymouth deluxe sedan, a 1950s porsche, or a 1960s corvette or mustang, this is the place to go. organizers say they're expecting a busy week, with an estimated 300,000 people turning up.\n\nthe scottsdale car show from jan. 12 to jan. 20 is one of the biggest classic car shows of the year. estrada's rolls has no published reserve price. the tv star could not immediately be reached for comment. (one of the three 1978 pontiac firebird formulas used in the 1970s tv show the rockford files, which starred james garner is also on the block. it too has no reserve price.)\n\neverybody loves classic cars. they can be gorgeous to look at, own, and — in some cases, at least — to drive. but if you're thinking of them as an investment, think again. two researchers went through the auction data of 29,000 car sales going back to the late 1990s. their conclusion? most of these cars have been mediocre investments — at best.\n\nsee also: nobel prize winner richard thaler may have added $29.6 billion to retirement accounts\n\noh, and famous american marques have been among the worst.\n\ngross returns from classic and vintage cars overall worked out at around 5.6% a year over the period 1998 through 2015, or 3.4% a year after inflation, found economists luc renneboog and dries laurs at tilburg university in the netherlands.\n\n buyers want classic or vintage cars that have been retrofitted with modern engines, power steering, and even air conditioning. \n\nbut that was before deducting all the costs involved in buying, owning and eventually selling the cars. transaction, storage, transportation, insurance, maintenance and restoration costs can be substantial for classic cars, and vastly surpass the costs of (financial) asset classes, they admit. they calculate that the commissions on buying, and later selling ,a car can add up to 25% of the total value. even car auctioneers concede these are unlikely to be below 20%.\n\nthere is no figure for the net returns.\n\nthe gross returns figures looked better than most stocks and bonds over the same period, the authors note. but it was a poor period for stocks, as it started near the peak of the 1990s bubble and encompassed two big bear markets, financial experts note.\n\nover the long term, stocks have tended to earn on average somewhere north of 4% a year above inflation, note experts. and stocks, unlike classic cars, cost next to nothing to ship, store, restore, insure or maintain.\n\n 'the ferrari boom was incredible. it was the hype. there's only so many people that can play in that level of the market.'  — —nickolas cardinale, executive vice-president at barrett-jackson\n\nwhat's really hot now is the 'restomods,' says nickolas cardinale, executive vice-president at barrett-jackson. that means classic or vintage cars that have been retrofitted with modern engines, power steering, and even features like air conditioning. old cars don't drive well, says cardinale. they don't have air conditioning… people want their cars to look old on the outside, but they want them new on the inside.\n\nif this continues, the real economic opportunity may simply lie in buying vintage chassis on the cheap and then either retromodding them yourself — or pimping your ride, to quote an old mtv us:viab slogan — or selling them to those who know how.\n\nthe return figures for classic cars were also flattered by a mania for ferraris that peaked several years ago. there was a crazy ferrari boom, cardinale adds. the ferrari boom was incredible. it was the hype. there's only so many people that can play in that level of the market. ferrari could not be reached for comment.\n\nduring the same period, the average real returns on classic u.s. cars were 2.3% a year — before all those costs. as a general rule, classic u.s. cars did worse than british, german or italian equivalents.\n\ngeneral motors gm, -1.42% , manufacturer of the corvette, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ford f, -5.38% , manufacturer of the mustang, said prices for some high-end models from the 1960s have risen by 7% a year or more above inflation for the past 10 years.\n\nclassic cars don't change. but tastes do. the vintage cars that used to command the highest prices were those that were effectively unchanged. no longer.
much of the thesis surrounding a strong euro and a strengthening japanese yen in 2018 is built around central banks and expectations for monetary-policy normalization across the globe. this week will put this idea to the test, as both the european central bank and the bank of japan hold their first meetings of the year.\n\nanalysts expect the ecb to pull back on its easy-money policies this year to play catch-up with the federal reserve, which has already increased interest rates five times since 2015. a hawkish ecb might provide a further fillip to the euro eurusd, +0.04% in 2018.\n\nthe bank of japan, meanwhile, is thought of as having the most accommodative monetary policy among its peers. still, a decision to reduce its purchases of government bonds, also known as jgbs, earlier this month and comments about the negative effects of prolonged quantitative easing late last year, have analysts wondering when the boj will take action and push the yen usdjpy, -0.06% higher.\n\nboth the boj on tuesday and the ecb on thursday are likely to hold their monetary policies unchanged, but the yen and the euro could move sharply nonetheless in the event of verbal intervention from either central bank, said fawad razaqzada, market analyst at forex.com.\n\nthe boj's policy decision is due jan. 23, followed by the ecb on jan. 25.\n\nthe boj'statement will also be accompanied by the central bank's outlook report, which is the last one for gov. haruhiko kuroda's current term, said analysts from bnp paribas, including michael sneyd. kuroda could be reappointed for a second term.\n\na weaker yen would make sense given government bond yields of other developed nations are rising, the analysts added. still, we would highlight that the yen remains very cheap from a long-term valuation perspective and [currency] markets continue to price in boj policy remaining very dovish for the foreseeable future. in that respect, there is risk that, if mr. kuroda's comments are seen as signaling a less dovish trajectory ahead, the yen could strengthen.\n\nearlier this month, the boj opted to reduce the amount of government paper it buys through its quantitative-easing program, which made both the yen and yields on jgbs jump.\n\nread: relax, the bank of japan isn't tapering—yet!\n\nit jolted the markets earlier this month, particularly since the general consensus had been that the boj was in [easy-money mode] for the long haul, wrote michael hewson, chief market analyst at cmc markets u.k. this month's actions have shown that can't be taken for granted, so markets will be paying close attention to not only what kuroda does, but also how [he] guides future expectations of policy moves later on into 2018.\n\nback in europe, expectations for the ecb to change its tone to a becoming more hawkish have mounted recently since the central bank released the minutes of its december meeting.\n\nas per the minutes, policy makers think they could revisit their policy stances early this year—which could already mean this week—despite their continued concerns about low inflation, and occasional discomfort over a strengthening euro.\n\nthe ecb began to scale back the size of its monthly bond purchases to €30 billion ($36.7 billion) a month starting this month from the current pace of €60 billion, to be continued until at least september.\n\nafter the euphoria that followed the ecb's december minutes, propelling the euro higher, traders could be disappointed should the central bank's boss mario draghi adopt a more dovish stance than anticipated this week, thereby leading to a euro slump.\n\nwe expect the ecb to wait until march before shifting policy, but draghi's euro remarks will be scrutinized heavily, wrote bmo's european head of fx strategy stephen gallo.\n\nwe believe that market participants solely positioned for a tighter rate differential between the federal reserve and the ecb could become disillusioned with the euro in 2018, said wells fargo analysts including investment strategist peter donisanu.\n\nif expectations have moved too much too fast, the euro could drop to $1.21, according to the bnp analysts. one euro last bought $1.2245 on monday.
new year, new you — but only if you keep at it.\n\nabout four in 10 americans make new year's resolutions each year, with things like eating healthier, getting more exercise and saving more money topping the list. despite that, most of us fail at our resolutions, with some data suggesting that only about one in 10 achieve the results they'd hoped for.\n\none reason may be that we don't keep at it for long enough to make it stick. indeed, you've probably heard that it takes 21 days to make something a habit — a notion that some say came from a self-help book published decades ago. but the reality is likely much longer.\n\nindeed, a study published in the european journal of social psychology found that, on average, it takes 66 days to make something a habit. the study followed 96 people over 12 weeks as they tried to make a health or lifestyle change, such as drinking an extra few glasses of water a day or running before dinner. the authors defined a habit as something that felt almost automatic when you did it. and, all told, participants said it took between 18 and 254 days before something became a habit, with the average being 66.\n\nof course, you want to be one of those people who takes far less than 254 days — and there are things that you can do to make your resolution turn into a habit faster. here are a few:\n\npractice temptation bundling. let's say your resolution is to go to the gym, but you don't love doing that; meanwhile, you do love listening to podcasts. if you only allow yourself to listen to podcasts while at the gym, you're more likely to keep up your resolution to go to the gym, research in the journal management science shows. that's called temptation bundling, and in the study, it significantly boosted participants' compliance with their resolutions to hit the gym.\n\nmake yourself cheat. one study found that when people aimed to do something for seven days a week — but allowed themselves a couple of days off if they couldn't do it — they were more successful than even those who just planned to do it for just five days.\n\nmake sure your resolutions look like this. create doable, specific resolutions. 'i will give up all sugar forever' is probably not going to happen. so how about, 'i will only have dessert on weekends' or 'i will replace my soda with sparkling water,' says psychologist elizabeth lombardo, author of better than perfect: 7 strategies to crush your inner critic and create a life you love.\n\nfocus on why you're doing it. stop focusing on what you don't want ('i hate the treadmill') and, instead, focus on the benefits, says lombardo — like visualizing a better bod and a life with lower stress. that can help you remember why the goal is so important — and thus, stick with it.\n\nbe accountable. track your resolutions — for example, if you're trying to lose weight, you might want to write down everything you eat — to stay the course, experts say. another helpful hint: get a friend, spouse or someone else to do the resolution with you.\n\nremind yourself: you can do this. no one goes 3 weeks without brushing their teeth (hopefully!). that is a habit that you have created and made stick. as such, you can make [almost] anything a habit, lombardo says.\n\nthis story was originally published in january 2019.
the dow jones industrial average broke above 25,000 for the first time in history shortly after the opening bell on thursday, a move that comes just 23 trading days after it first closed above 24,000. that marks the fastest move ever to the next 1,000-point milestone, according wsj market data group.\n\nthe advance this time was led by boeing co., which contributed almost 150 points to the price-weighted average's rally. a $1 move of any of the dow's djia, -0.46% 30 components equates to a roughly 6.8-point swing in the equity gauge. some of the other big contributors are caterpillar inc., chevron corp., and home depot.
advanced micro devices inc. chief executive lisa su used the biggest stage her company has enjoyed in more than a decade to confidently declare wednesday that it expects to challenge — and perhaps beat — larger and more well-known rivals.\n\nin a main ces keynote that in previous years hosted intel corp. intc, +1.55% and nvidia corp. nvda, +0.76% ceos, su detailed amd's 2019 plans for computers, servers and videogames. with new, high-end graphics cards and a second-generation server chip, su particularly went after nvidia and intel, showing performance of early versions of its 7-nanometer hardware against those rivals' offerings.\n\namd amd, +0.30% has long been plan b for semiconductors and graphics chips, behind intel and nvidia, but it has made major strides under su, including getting back into the server business last year and producing higher-quality processors and graphics chips. it paid off, with the biggest gains for any stock in the s&p 500 index in 2018, and su sees more return coming this year.\n\na couple of years ago, we saw some fundamental bottlenecks to increasing computer performance, and we made some big bets, su said early in her speech, we made some big bets about where we thought the industry was going to go, and 2019 is a key year where we see some of those big bets really pay off.\n\nread: interview with amd's su on change in foundry, its roadmap and new head of client-compute business\n\nthose bets were focused on servers, gaming, high-performance laptops and pcs, and cloud servers. in her speech, she laid out the roadmap for amd's efforts in those sectors, with a new high-end gaming card called radeon 7, new generations of ryzen chips for laptops and pcs, and zen processors for servers.\n\nthe radeon vii was the biggest surprise, according to former amd executive patrick moorhead, now principal analyst for moor insights and strategies. he noted that amd had not targeted the high end of the gaming market for at least five years, but that is exactly where amd is looking with the $699 graphics card.\n\nrelated:micron's stock boosts chip rally after upgrade, analysts' comments at ces\n\nnvidia has owned the premium gaming card market, and launched its own new gaming cards last year, with a cheaper version announced sunday night at ces. amd claimed that radeon vii — launching feb.7 — had higher frame rates than the new top-of-the-line nvidia cards, with a lower price tag.\n\nnvidia chief executive jensen huang was not impressed, though, calling the amd announcement underwhelming.\n\nthe performance is lousy and it's nothing new, huang said in a question-and-answer session with select journalists immediately after amd's keynote in the same las vegas casino complex. he noted that the new nvidia cards have artificial-intelligence capabilities and real-time ray tracing, unlike amd's new cards.\n\nweird launch, maybe they thought of it this morning, he said, before laughing and suggesting he may have gone too far with his last comment.\n\nmost current games do not take advantage of nvidia's addition of ray tracing and ai to its cards, however. moorhead noted that nvidia has a better play for the future, but amd — with the lower price tag than the comparable nvidia geforce rtx 2080 cards — could offer a better value for the present gaming era.\n\nnvidia supports acceleration of ray tracing and they have added some special features that use artificial intelligence to make the image more realistic, the analyst told marketwatch. it will take a while for it to achieve mass acceptance, but many of the bigger titles and publishers have said they will do this in the future.\n\nfor the future, amd also announced that it has been working with alphabet inc.'s googl, +1.43% goog, +1.26% google on its project stream approach to cloud gaming — also a way to battle nvidia, which has its own attempt to create the netflix of videogames. amd's server chips are powering the cloud-gaming demo that launched in october, su said.\n\nsee: why there may never be a netflix of videogames\n\nthose server chips may be the biggest financial opportunity for amd, which began its path back to the server business last year, with epyc chips arriving in servers. many analysts expect that 2019 will be the year that proves if the company can establish significant market share in that sector, and su showed off an early version of its second-generation epyc chip wednesday that is expected to launch in the middle of the year.\n\nintel is the dominant force in selling cpus for servers, but on stage su demonstrated an early version of a second-generation epyc chip beating two intel chips.\n\nwe believe it is the best server processor the world has ever seen, su stated confidently.\n\nintel declined to comment, noting that it could not verify the results as amd's server processor is not shipping yet; intel announced on monday at ces that its new cascade lake data-center chip is shipping, but amd used older xeon processors for the stage test.\n\nto live up to its higher valuation, amd doesn't have to actually beat intel, though, it just needs to compete well enough to grow market share from virtually zero and increase revenue. su noted that amd has already won server business from major cloud-computing companies including amazon.com inc. amzn, +0.33% , microsoft corp. msft, +1.24% , baidu bidu, +0.47% and tencent 700, +0.24% , which shows that it is on its way to doing just that.\n\nread: why amd believes it can challenge intel in servers\n\namd also demonstrated third-generation ryzen pc chips against intel's new i9 chips, with its demo showing stronger performance yet again. intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nno tech company is going to willingly run a public demo where it doesn't win, but amd's willingness to throw a gauntlet down in aiming for the chip thrones held by intel and nvidia shows that it is confident that it will not fall apart as it has in previous attempts. su has managed to push amd back into competition with larger rivals, and wednesday's appearance on the biggest stage tech has to offer shows that she is confident amd can do much more.\n\namd stock fell 4.2% in afternoon trading thursday, enough to pace the phlx semiconductor index's decliners. the stock began selling off in wednesday's after-hours session after su began to speak. nvidia gained 0.3% while intel slipped 0.3%.
gold futures pulled back on thursday from the nearly two-week high they settled at a day earlier, as the psychologically important $1,300 line remained elusive for another session.\n\nthe dovish u.s. federal reserve has been supporting the market, with some officials at the central bank suggesting a cautious approach to future interest-rate hikes, analysts at icici bank wrote in a daily note. this has kept a lid on the u.s. dollar while supporting dollar-denominated gold.\n\nhowever, increasing demand for higher risk assets has kept a cap on gold prices, they said. global and u.s. benchmark stock indexes have traded broadly higher so far in the new year.\n\ngold for february delivery us:gcg9 edged down by $1.50, or 0.1%, to settle at $1,292.30 an ounce. it settled wednesday at an almost two-week high of $1,293.80, on the back of political turmoil in the u.k. and u.s.\n\nmarch silver us:sih9 also fell 10.2 cents, or 0.7%, to $15.536 an ounce on thursday.\n\nu.s. stocks traded modestly higher as gold futures settled, while the ice u.s. dollar index dxy, +0.03% , a measure of the currency against a basket of six major rivals, was little changed at 96.088.\n\npolitical uncertainty continues to underpin gold, however. investors were increasingly worried that a u.s. partial government shutdown entering its 27th day would deliver a more lasting impact to economic growth in the first quarter. financial markets also awaited next steps for britain after theresa may's government narrowly survived a no-confidence vote wednesday as she attempts to forge a path for the u.k.'s exit from the european union.\n\nread:after historic brexit defeat — what's next?\n\nmeanwhile, the fed's beige book, a snapshot of domestic economic activity released after gold futures settled wednesday, revealed that contacts in many districts have become less optimistic in light of market volatility and political uncertainty. that could prompt fed members to trim their expectations for higher interest rates in 2019, a potentially dollar-supportive, gold-negative development.\n\non the one hand, the outlook for gold and other metals look bullish in 2019. the fed's likely inaction this year [according to some analysis, though others disagree] should help to devalue the dollar against her major rivals, said fawad razaqzada, market analyst with forex.com. the dollar and gold, primarily priced in dollars, usually have an inverse relationship.\n\nbut on the other hand, the fact that all the other major central banks are meanwhile in no rush to raise interest rates means there is no real alternative currency that yield-seeking investors will be piling into yet, he said in recent commentary. so, the dollar could remain supported for a while yet.\n\nthat could change, however, once — sorry, if — there is real progress made on brexit to allow the bank of england and, to a lesser degree, the european central bank, to tighten their policies, razaqzada said. only then could the dollar index start to break down more aggressively, boosting the metal as a result.\n\namong other metals traded on comex, march copper us:hgh9 added 0.2% to $2.68 a pound. april platinum us:plj9 rose 0.5% to $812.30 an ounce.\n\npalladium futures notched yet another record settlement—its ninth in 10 sessions. march palladium us:pah9 settled at $1,348.20 an ounce, up 2.3%.\n\ncertainly the palladium market remains in deficit and the ability to increase production is extremely difficult but we question the magnitude of the market's reaction, analysts at zaner precious metals wrote in a daily note thursday.\n\npalladium prices at times this morning have reached $57 an ounce above that of gold and it wouldn't be surprising for palladium to become an investment 'fad', they said. in other words, it is possible that palladium's own momentum will result in even more gains directly ahead.
at a time when medical care is at the forefront for so many people, the new year is providing them with a new data point: the prices that hospitals charge for their services.\n\nbeginning jan. 1, a federal rule says hospitals have to list the costs of at least some of their services in accessible, consumer-friendly language. equipped with this information, potential patients can shop around and make a better-informed decision before setting foot in a hospital, the feds say.\n\npresident donald trump touted the new rule on friday, writing on twitter twtr, +1.37% , hospitals are now required, effective immediately, to publish their real prices, which will create competition and drive down costs massively.\n\nwe believe consumers should be able to know, long before they open a medical bill, roughly how much a hospital will charge for items and services it provides, said the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms).\n\nthe price transparency rules are a welcome change, for sure, health care experts told marketwatch. but the numbers only reveal so much — and they still don't cut to the core of massive medical costs that can bankrupt a person.\n\nour issue with transparency is it is only a tool, it is not the savior, caitlin donovan, senior director at the national patient advocate foundation. it's an open question what disclosed prices will do for insurance rates in the future, she and others told marketwatch.\n\nthe rule is trying to manage patient price expectations just like a new law that bars surprise out-of-network medical bills. that law was part of a $900 billion covid-19 rescue package trump signed last week.\n\nthat law takes effect in 2022 and donovan said it is going to be much more impactful for patients.\n\nhere's a look at what's changing now.\n\nwhat do hospitals have to show the public?\n\nhospitals must list the price they charge for at least 300 shoppable services, and explain them in understandable language, according to the cms website.\n\na core 70 services are mandated for disclosure and the hospital picks another 230, a cms spokesperson added. the price factors in the usual side costs associated with a procedure. this includes things such as x-rays, outpatient visits, imaging and laboratory tests or bundled services such as a colonoscopy, the website said.\n\nthe list will show the discounted cash price for people paying on their own without insurance coverage. it will also show the negotiated price a hospital has reached with payers, like an insurance company — but keep in mind that's not the ultimate, out-of-pocket cost, which matter to consumers who still have co-pays and deductibles to reach.\n\nhospitals will also show their highest and lowest negotiated rate for service.\n\nbefore the new rule, a certain set of rates were already potentially available upon request but generally consumers would have found them probably baffling and not very useful, said dr. david blumenthal, president of the commonwealth fund, a philanthropy focused on public health.\n\neven with hospital services in plain language, it will still be tough for cost-conscious patients to first game out all the treatments they'll need once admitted and then calculate the extent of insurance costs, blumenthal said.\n\nbut it's possible people will be able to do that within several years, he added. insurers and tech companies may apply predictive analytics to the disclosed numbers so they can estimate all the permutations of care and figure out what a patient's final bill will be ahead of time.\n\nthe figures on discounted cash prices may be useful now for people who are uninsured and facing a big bill they can't afford, donovan said. by researching a range of prices, they may be able to bring a lower counter offer in the negotiation process.\n\nwhere can patients find the hospital's price list?\n\nit should either be on the hospital's website itself, or on another website that the hospital provides a clear link to. if people can't find the hospital's list, they should first contact the hospital, a cms spokesman said. if they are still hitting a roadblock getting the list, they can file a complaint, the cms spokesman noted. the link is here.\n\nthe american hospital association, comprised of more than 5,000 hospitals, health care systems and network, fought the rule in a court battle ahead of implementation. last week, the district of columbia circuit court of appeals upheld a lower court decision siding with the federal government.\n\nin a statement, melinda hatton, the association's general counsel, said the organization supports price transparency and anything that will help patients plan their out-of-pocket costs. but the organization continues to believe that the disclosure of privately negotiated rates does nothing to help patients understand what they will actually pay for treatment and will create widespread confusion for them, she said.\n\nthe organization is still determining how to proceed in the case, but the lack of a pause in the rule's enforcement ignores the overwhelming burden of the pandemic on hospitals, she said.\n\nwhat is missing from the hospital price lists?\n\nquality of care, according to patricia kelmar, health care campaigns director at u.s. pirg, a consumer advocacy organization.\n\nprice isn't everything and what would be more helpfulf would be value-based price, she said. if someone knows they'll avoid infections, complications and have shorter recoveries and one hospital instead of another, that will weigh heavily in the decision-making process, she said. those things matter just as much to a patient, she said.\n\nlike others, kelmar likes the fact that consumers are about to get more information. but so much of our healthcare system really isn't 'shoppable,' she said. someone might live in an area with just one nearby hospital , or they might have a health care plan with scant in-network options.\n\nthe transparency in those situations might be helpful for budgets, but it isn't necessarily, in reality, 'shoppable,' she said.\n\ndonovan echoed the point that a person's medical decisions aren't purely about money. instead of designing a system for patients, we keep trying to change patients to fit our system, she said.\n\nwhat's next on healthcare price transparency?\n\nthe newly-enacted law blocking surprise bills for out-of-network care is a big deal, kelmar and donovan both said. this is a significant improvement for patients because it is protecting them from prices they had no control over avoiding, kelmar said.\n\nthe law applies to regular care in a hospital and also emergency care, kelmar noted. it covers ambulances transporting patients by air, like helicopters, but it doesn't cover ground ambulances.\n\nthirty-two states already have their own laws against surprise billing, kelmar noted. the federal law will cover the remainder and, importantly, apply to healthcare plans answering to federal laws that states cannot regulate.\n\none-in-five patients undergoing elective surgery were blindsided by out-of-network bills, according to a february study reviewing treatment for 350,000 people. people with surprise bills ended up owing $2,011 more on average, the researchers found.\n\nthe law's core features are slated to take effect on jan. 1, 2022, according to the associated press.
some key tax deadlines and dates have changed, and the changes take effect soon. here is what you need to know.\n\napril 18 deadline for filing 2016 form 1040 individual returns\n\nas you know, the usual deadline for filing your annual personal federal income tax return is april 15 of the following year. however, that date is always adjusted for weekends and holidays. so the deadline for your 2016 form 1040 is april 18, 2017. that date reflects the fact that april 15 and 16 fall on a weekend and april 17 is the emancipation day holiday in the district of columbia. if you can't file by april 18, you can obtain an automatic six-month extension to oct. 16 by filing form 4868 by no later than april 18.\n\nhowever, you should pay any additional tax that you owe for 2016 with form 4868 to avoid an interest charge penalty.\n\ndelayed refunds for personal returns claiming certain credits\n\ndue to recent legislation, the irs cannot issue refunds before feb. 15, 2017 for personal returns that claim the earned income tax credit or the additional child tax credit. the earned income credit can potentially be claimed by workers with modest incomes. the additional child credit is a refundable credit of up to $1,000 per qualifying child that can potentially be claimed if the regular child credit exceeds your federal income tax liability.\n\nthe refund delay for a return that claims either of the aforementioned credits affects the entire refund shown on the return — not just the portion of the refund caused by claiming one or both of the credits. although the irs will begin releasing refunds for returns claiming the credits on february 15, it is unlikely that the refund will arrive in your bank account or be available on your debit card before the week of feb. 27, due the time it takes for bank account deposits and debit card credits to roll through the financial system. note that the feb. 27 date assumes that your return has no processing issues and you that you choose the direct deposit option or debit card option to receive your refund.\n\nfitbit seeks software success like apple\n\nsmall business tax filing alerts\n\nchanges to several tax filing deadlines will affect many small businesses early this year. here's the scoop.\n\nearlier deadlines for form 1065 partnership and llc returns\n\nfor many years, form 1065 partnership returns have been due three and a half months after the end of the partnership tax year. ditto for returns of llcs that are treated as partnerships for tax purposes. so for a calendar-year partnership or llc, the filing deadline was april 15 of the following year (adjusted for weekends and holidays). however, recent legislation changed the deal. for partnership and llc tax years beginning in 2016 and beyond, the form 1065 due date is moved up by one month, to two and a half months after the close of the tax year. so the deadline for 2016 returns of calendar-year partnerships and llcs is march 15, 2017. six-month extensions to september 15, 2017 can be obtained by filing form 7004 (application for automatic extension of time to file certain business income tax, information, and other returns) by the un-extended due date (march 15 for a calendar-year partnership or llc).\n\nlater deadlines for form 1120 corporate returns\n\nfor many years, form 1120 c corporation returns have been due two and a half months after the end of the corporation's tax year. so for a calendar-year corporation, the deadline was march 15 of the following year (adjusted for weekends and holidays). however, recent legislation established new deadlines for corporate returns. for tax years beginning in 2016 and beyond, the form 1120 due date is generally moved back by a month, to three and a half months after the close of the corporation's tax year, which translates to april 15 (adjusted for weekends and holidays) for a calendar-year corporation. so the filing deadline for 2016 returns of calendar-year corporations is april 18, 2017. five-month extensions to september 15, 2017 can be obtained by filing form 7004 by the un-extended due date (april 18 for a calendar-year corporation).\n\nno change for form 1120s s corporation returns\n\nthe due date for form 1120s returns of s corporations is unchanged. it is still two and a half months after the close of the tax year. so the deadline for 2016 returns of calendar-year s corporations is march 15, 2017. six-month extensions to sept. 15, 2017 can be obtained by filing form 7004 by the un-extended due date (march 15 for a calendar-year s corporation).\n\njan. 31 deadline for reporting compensation paid to workers last year\n\nif your business pays nonemployee compensation aggregating to $600 or more to a single payee (payment recipient) in a calendar year, the business must file a form 1099-misc to report the payments. similarly, employers must report wages paid to employees on form w-2. previously, these forms were required to be filed with the irs and social security administration (ssa) by the last day of february or by march 31 if filed electronically. copies were required to be supplied to payees and employees by january 31 of the following year. recent legislation moved up the deadline for filing with the irs and ssa to jan. 31 of the following year. so the irs/ssa filing deadline for forms 1099-misc and w-2 that show payments made last year is jan. 31, 2017. this rapidly approaching due date applies whether you submit the forms on paper or electronically.
here is the text of sen. bernie sanders' speech on wall street and the economy, as prepared for delivery on tuesday in new york:\n\nthe american people are catching on. they understand that something is profoundly wrong when, in our country today, the top one-tenth of 1 percent own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent and when the 20 richest people own more wealth than the bottom 150 million americans – half of our population. they know that the system is rigged when the average person is working longer hours for lower wages, while 58 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent.\n\nthey also know that a handful of people on wall street have extraordinary power over the economic and political life of our country. as most people know, in the 1990s and later, the financial interests spent billions of dollars in lobbying and campaign contributions to force through congress the deregulation of wall street, the repeal of the glass-steagall act and the weakening of consumer protection laws in states.\n\nthey spent this money in order to get the government off their backs and to show the american people what they could do with that new-won freedom. well, they sure showed the american people. in 2008, the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on wall street nearly destroyed the u.s. and global economy.\n\nmillions of americans lost their jobs, their homes and their life savings.\n\nwhile wall street received the largest taxpayer bailout in the history of the world with no strings attached, the american middle class continues to disappear, poverty is increasing and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider and wider. and wall street executives still receive huge compensation packages as if the financial crisis they created never happened.\n\ngreed, fraud, dishonesty and arrogance, these are the words that best describe the reality of wall street today.\n\nso, to those on wall street who may be listening today, let me be very clear. greed is not good. in fact, the greed of wall street and corporate america is destroying the fabric of our nation. and, here is a new year's resolution that i will keep if elected president. if you do not end your greed, we will end it for you.\n\nwe will no longer tolerate an economy and a political system that has been rigged by wall street to benefit the wealthiest americans in this country at the expense of everyone else.\n\nwhile president obama deserves credit for improving this economy after the wall street crash, the reality is that a lot of unfinished business remains to be done.\n\nour goal must be to create a financial system and an economy that works for all americans, not just a handful of billionaires\n\nthat means we have got to end, once and for all, the scheme that is nothing more than a free insurance policy for wall street, the policy of too big to fail.\n\nwe need a banking system that is part of the productive economy – making loans at affordable rates to small- and medium-sized businesses so that we create decent-paying jobs. wall street cannot continue to be an island unto itself, gambling trillions in risky financial instruments, making huge profits and assured that, if their schemes fail, the taxpayers will be there to bail them out.\n\nin 2008, the taxpayers of this country bailed out wall street because we were told they were too big to fail. yet, today, 3 out of the 4 largest financial institutions (jp morgan chase, bank of america and wells fargo) are nearly 80 percent bigger than before we bailed them out. incredibly, the six largest banks in this country issue more than two-thirds of all credit cards and more than 35 percent of all mortgages. they control more than 95 percent of all financial derivatives and hold more than 40 percent of all bank deposits. their assets are equivalent to nearly 60 percent of our gdp. enough is enough.\n\nif a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist. when it comes to wall street reform that must be our bottom line. this is true not just from a risk perspective and the fear of another bailout. it is also true from the reality that a handful of huge financial institutions simply have too much economic and political power over this country.\n\nif teddy roosevelt, the republican trust-buster, were alive today, he would say break 'em up. and he would be right.\n\nand, here's how i will accomplish that.\n\nwithin the first 100 days of my administration, i will require the secretary of the treasury department to establish a too-big-to fail list of commercial banks, shadow banks and insurance companies whose failure would pose a catastrophic risk to the united states economy without a taxpayer bailout.\n\nwithin one year, my administration will break these institutions up so that they no longer pose a grave threat to the economy as authorized under section 121 of the dodd-frank act.\n\nand, i will fight to reinstate a 21st century glass-steagall act to clearly separate commercial banking, investment banking and insurance services. let's be clear: this legislation, introduced by my colleague senator elizabeth warren, aims at the heart of the shadow banking system.\n\nin my view, senator warren, is right. dodd-frank should have broken up citigroup and other too- big-to-fail banks into pieces. and that's exactly what we need to do. and that's what i commit to do as president.\n\nnow, my opponent, secretary clinton says that glass-steagall would not have prevented the financial crisis because shadow banks like aig and lehman brothers, not big commercial banks, were the real culprits.\n\nsecretary clinton is wrong.\n\nshadow banks did gamble recklessly, but where did that money come from? it came from the federally-insured bank deposits of big commercial banks – something that would have been banned under the glass-steagall act.\n\nlet's not forget: president franklin roosevelt signed this bill into law precisely to prevent wall street speculators from causing another great depression. and, it worked for more than five decades until wall street watered it down under president reagan and killed it under president clinton.\n\nand, let's not kid ourselves. the federal reserve and the treasury department didn't just bail out shadow banks. as a result of an amendment that i offered to audit the emergency lending activities of the federal reserve during the financial crisis, we learned that the fed provided more than $16 trillion in short-term, low-interest loans to every major financial institution in the country including citigroup, jp morgan chase, bank of america, wells fargo, not to mention large corporations, foreign banks, and foreign central banks throughout the world.\n\nsecretary clinton says we just need to impose a few more fees and regulations on the financial industry. i disagree.\n\nas former secretary of labor robert reich has said and i quote: giant wall street banks continue to threaten the wellbeing of millions of americans, but what to do? bernie sanders says break them up and resurrect the glass-steagall act that once separated investment from commercial banking. hillary clinton says charge them a bit more and oversee them more carefully … hillary clinton's proposals would only invite more dilution and finagle. the only way to contain the street's excesses is with reforms so big, bold, and public they can't be watered down – busting up the biggest banks and resurrecting glass-steagall.\n\nsecretary reich is right. real wall street reform means breaking up the big banks and re-establishing firewalls that separates risk taking from traditional banking.\n\nmy opponent says that, as a senator, she told bankers to cut it out and end their destructive behavior. but, in my view, establishment politicians are the ones who need to cut it out. the reality is that congress doesn't regulate wall street. wall street, its lobbyists and their billions of dollars regulate congress. we must change that reality, and as president i will.\n\nit is no secret that millions of americans have become disillusioned with our political process. they don't vote. they don't believe much of what comes out of washington. they don't think anyone is there representing their interests. in my view, one of the reasons for that deep disillusionment is the widespread understanding that our criminal justice system is broken and grossly unfair – and that we do not have equal justice under the law. the average american sees kids being arrested and sometimes even jailed for possessing marijuana or other minor crimes. but when it comes to wall street executives, some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in this country, whose illegal behavior caused pain and suffering for millions – somehow nothing happens to them. no police record. no jail time. no justice.\n\nwe live in a country today that has an economy that is rigged, a campaign finance system which is corrupt and a criminal justice system which, too often, does not dispense justice.\n\nnot one major wall street executive has been prosecuted for causing the near collapse of our entire economy.\n\nthat will change under my administration. equal justice under law will not just be words engraved on the entrance of the supreme court. it will be the standard that applies to wall street and all americans.\n\nit seems like almost every few weeks we read about one giant financial institution after another being fined or reaching settlements for their reckless, unfair and deceptive activities.\n\nsome people believe that this is an aberration: that we have an honest financial system in which, every now and then, major financial institutions do something wrong and get caught. in my view, the evidence suggests that would be an incorrect analysis.\n\nthe reality is that fraud is the business model on wall street. it is not the exception to the rule. it is the rule. and in a weak regulatory climate the likelihood is that wall street gets away with a lot more illegal behavior than we know of.\n\nhow many times have we heard the myth that what wall street did may have been wrong but it wasn't illegal?\n\nlet me help shatter that myth today.\n\nsince 2009, major financial institutions in this country have been fined $204 billion. $204 billion. and that takes place in a weak regulatory climate.\n\nhere are just a few examples of when major banks were caught doing illegal activity.\n\nin august 2014, bank of america settled a case with the department of justice for more than $16 billion on charges that the bank misled investors about the riskiness of mortgage-backed securities it sold in the run-up to the crisis.\n\nin november of 2013, jp morgan settled a case for $13 billion with the department of justice and the federal housing finance agency over charges the bank knowingly sold securities made up of low-quality mortgages to fannie mae and freddie mac.\n\nin june of 2014, bnp paribas was sentenced to five years' probation and was ordered to pay $8.9 billion in penalties by a u.s. district judge in manhattan after this bank pled guilty to charges of violating sanctions by conducting business in sudan, iran and cuba.\n\nlet me read you a few headlines and you tell me how it makes sense that not one executive was prosecuted for fraud.\n\ncnn headline, may 20, 2015: 5 big banks pay $5.4 billion for rigging currencies. those banks include jpmorgan chase and citigroup.\n\nheadline from the international business times (february 24, 2015): big banks under investigation for allegedly fixing precious metals prices. the banks under investigation included goldman sachs and jpmorgan chase.\n\nheadline from the real news network (november 26, 2013): documents in jpmorgan settlement reveal how every large bank in the u.s. has committed mortgage fraud.\n\nheadline from the washington post (march 14, 2014): in lawsuit, fdic accuses 16 big banks of fraud, conspiracy, which included bank of america, citigroup and jp morgan chase.\n\nheadline from the guardian (april 2, 2011): how a big u.s. bank laundered billions from mexico's murderous drug gangs. this article talks about how wachovia (which was acquired by wells fargo) aided mexican drug cartels in transferring billions of dollars in illegal drug money. here is what the federal prosecutor (jeffrey sloman) said about this: wachovia's blatant disregard for our banking laws gave international cocaine cartels a virtual carte blanche to finance their operations.\n\nyet, the total fine for this offense was less than 2% of the bank's $12.3 billion profit for 2009 and no one went to jail. no one went to jail.\n\nand, if that's not bad enough, here's another one.\n\nheadline: the wall street journal, february 9, 2011: j.p. morgan apologizes for military foreclosures. here is a case where jp morgan chase, the largest bank in america, wrecked the finances of 4,000 military families in violation of the civil service members relief act, yet no one went to jail.\n\nand, when i say that the business model of wall street is fraud that is not just bernie sanders talking. that is what financial executives told the university of notre dame in a study on the ethics of the financial services industry last year.\n\naccording to this study, 51 percent of wall street executives making more than $500,000 a year found it likely that their competitors have engaged in unethical or illegal activity in order to gain an edge in the market.\n\nmore than one-third of financial executives have either witnessed or have firsthand knowledge of wrongdoing in the workplace.\n\nnearly one in five financial service professionals believe they must engage in illegal or unethical activity to be successful.\n\ntwenty-five percent of financial executives have signed or been asked to sign a confidentiality agreement that would prohibit reporting illegal or unethical activities to the authorities.\n\nhere's what one banker from barclays said in 2010, when he was caught trying to price-fix the $5 trillion-per-day currency market: if you ain't cheating, you ain't trying.\n\nhere's what an analyst from standard & poors said in 2008, let's hope we are all wealthy and retired by the time this house of cards falters.\n\nthis country can no longer afford to tolerate the culture of fraud and corruption on wall street.\n\nunder my administration, wall street ceos will no longer receive a get-out-of jail free card. big banks will not be too big to fail. big bankers will not be too big to jail.\n\nas president, i will nominate and appoint people with a track record of standing up to power, rather than those who have made millions defending wall street ceos. goldman sachs and other wall street banks will not be represented in my administration.\n\nand, if we are serious about reforming our financial system, we have got to establish a tax on wall street speculators. we have got to discourage reckless gambling on wall street and encourage productive investments in the job-creating economy.\n\nwe will use the revenue from this tax to make public colleges and universities tuition free. during the financial crisis, the middle class of this country bailed out wall street. now, it's wall street's turn to help the middle class.\n\nwe cannot have a safe and sound financial system if we cannot trust the credit agencies to accurately rate financial products. and, the only way we can restore that trust is to make sure credit rating agencies cannot make a profit from wall street.\n\ninvestors would not have bought the risky mortgage backed derivatives that led to the great recession if credit agencies did not give these worthless financial products triple-a ratings – ratings that they knew were bogus.\n\nand, the reason these risky financial schemes were given such favorable ratings is simple. wall street paid for them.\n\nunder my administration, we will turn for-profit credit rating agencies into non-profit institutions, independent from wall street. no longer will wall street be able to pick and choose which credit agency will rate their products.\n\nif we are going to create a financial system that works for all americans, we have got to stop financial institutions from ripping off the american people by charging sky-high interest rates and outrageous fees.\n\nin my view, it is unacceptable that americans are paying a $4 or $5 fee each time they go to the atm.\n\nit is unacceptable that millions of americans are paying credit card interest rates of 20 or 30 percent.\n\nthe bible has a term for this practice. it's called usury. and in the divine comedy, dante reserved a special place in the seventh circle of hell for those who charged people usurious interest rates.\n\ntoday, we don't need the hellfire and the pitch forks, we don't need the rivers of boiling blood, but we do need a national usury law.\n\ntoday, we need to cap interest rates on credit cards and consumer loans at 15 percent.\n\nin 1980, congress passed legislation to require credit unions to cap interest rates on their loans at no more than 15 percent. and, that law has worked well. unlike big banks, credit unions did not receive a huge bailout from the taxpayers of this country. it is time to extend this cap to every lender in america.\n\nwe must also cap atm fees at $2.00. people should not have to pay a 10 percent fee for withdrawing $40 of their own money out of an atm.\n\nbig banks need to stop acting like loan sharks and start acting like responsible lenders.\n\nwe also need to give americans affordable banking options.\n\nthe reality is that, unbelievably, millions of low-income americans live in communities where there are no normal banking services. today, if you live in a low-income community and you need to cash a check or get a loan to pay for a car repair or a medical emergency, where do you go?\n\nyou go to a payday lender who could charge an interest rate of over 300 percent and trap you into a vicious cycle of debt. that is unacceptable.\n\nwe need to stop payday lenders from ripping off millions of americans. post offices exist in almost every community in our country. one important way to provide decent banking opportunities for low income communities is to allow the u.s. postal service to engage in basic banking services, and that's what i will fight for.\n\nfurther, we need to structurally reform the federal reserve to make it a more democratic institution responsive to the needs of ordinary americans, not just the billionaires on wall street.\n\nwhen wall street was on the verge of collapse, the federal reserve acted with a fierce sense of urgency to save the financial system. we need the fed to act with the same boldness to combat unemployment and low wages.\n\nfurther, we need to structurally reform the federal reserve to make it a more democratic institution responsive to the needs of ordinary americans, not just the billionaires on wall street.\n\nin my view, it is unacceptable that the federal reserve has been hijacked by the very bankers it is in charge of regulating. i think the american people would be shocked to learn that jamie dimon, the ceo of jp morgan chase, served on the board of the new york fed at the same time that his bank received a $391 billion bailout from the federal reserve. that is a clear conflict of interest that i would ban as president. when i am elected, the foxes will no longer be guarding the henhouse at the fed. under my administration, banking industry executives will no longer be allowed to serve on the fed's boards and handpick its members and staff.\n\nfurther, the fed should stop paying financial institutions interest to keep money out of the economy and parked at the fed. incredibly, the excess reserves of financial institutions that are sitting in the federal reserve has grown from less than $2 billion in 2008 to $2.4 trillion today. that is absurd.\n\ninstead of paying banks interest on these reserves, the fed should charge them a fee that could be used to provide affordable loans to small businesses to create hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n\nfinally, let me tell you what no other candidate will tell you. no president, not bernie sanders or anyone else, can effectively address the economic crises facing the working families of this country alone. the truth is that wall street, corporate america, the corporate media and wealthy campaign donors are just too powerful.\n\nwhat this campaign is about is building a political movement which revitalizes american democracy, which brings millions of people together – black and white, latino, asian-american, native american – young and old, men and women, gay and straight, native born and immigrant, people of all religions.\n\nyes. wall street has enormous economic and political power. yes. wall street makes huge campaign contributions, they have thousands of lobbyists and they provide very generous speaking fees to those who go before them.\n\nyes. they have an endless supply of money. but we have something they don't have. and that is that when millions of working families stand together, demanding fundamental changes in our financial system, we have the power to bring about that change.\n\nyes, we can make our economy work for all americans, not just a handful of wealthy speculators. and, now more than ever, that is exactly what we must do.\n\nand so my message to you today is straightforward: if elected president, i will rein in wall street so they can't crash our economy again.\n\nwill they like me? no. will they begin to play by the rules if i'm president? you better believe it.\n\nthank you and i look forward to working with the most powerful force in our great nation, not the barons of wall street but the people our government was created to serve.
the minutes of the federal reserve' december meeting showed a willingness to delay further interest rate hikes given the volatility in financial markets and concern about global growth, according to minutes of that meeting released wednesday.\n\nwith the backdrop of market turmoil and rising concerns about global growth many participants expressed the view that, especially in the environment of muted inflation pressures, the fomc could afford to be patient about further policy firming, the minutes show.\n\nthey argued that weak inflation readings allowed th central bank some latitude to wait and see how the data developed in light of the rise in financial market volatility and increased uncertainty over the global economic outlook, the minutes show.\n\na number of officials said the fed should be mindful of the downside risks and the effects of past rate hikes before making any further changes to policy. officials stressed policy was not on a pre-set course.\n\nthe minutes suggest a cautious approach to future monetary policy, said michelle meyer, head of u.s. economics at bank of america merrill lynch, in an interview on cnbc.\n\nthe minutes also dovetail with the remarks from fed chairman jerome powell late last week, who stressed the fed would change policy swiftly if economic conditions warrant the change. powell 's remarks calmed markets who viewed the chairman as too upbeat at his press conference after the december rate hike.\n\nread: powell signals he's flexible on interest rates\n\nthe minutes also show some talk of slowing down the pace of the shrinking of the balance sheet. at the moment, the fed is letting $50 billion of maturing securities run off the balance sheet each month.\n\nbut other fed officials were against tapering the pace of the run-off, saying they were worried it would be misinterpreted as a signal about the stance of monetary policy.\n\na few fed officials were also against a december interest rate increase, the minutes show, although the voting members of the fomc decided to push ahead with an interest-rate hike.\n\nthough financial conditions had tightened and global growth had moderated, [voting] members generally anticipated that growth would remain above trend and the labor market would remain strong, the minutes said.\n\nthe voting members did say that they didn't see the need for many more interest-rate hikes.\n\nthe fomc judged that a relatively limited amount of additional tightening would likely be appropriate, the minutes said.\n\nthe fed has penciled in two rate hikes in 2019, down from three hikes projected in september.\n\nfinancial markets currently see no chance of a rate hike in 2019.\n\nwhile fed officials remained optimistic about the outlook, contacts in a number of fed districts were less upbeat, the minutes said.
