And grass-roots opinion has shifted in favor of conspiracy theories, a pattern that both follows the cues of political leaders and incentivizes those leaders' abasements. For instance, Twitter equips Trump to instantaneously air any theory, no matter how nutty, to raucous and affirming plaudits. Fox News also capitalizes on this shift to amplify Trumpian claims (Russia didn't hack our democracy, Fox host Tucker Carlson recently parroted). It's no wonder that, as Gallup found last February, 30 percent of Republicans see Russia in a favorable light.

So the party's mandarins allowed them to fester and grow until they spread from the toxic fringe to the mainstream, which they have finally overtaken. It's no wonder someone who embraced those ideas would become successful; Trump validates notions that his voters have long believed, ideas that the party refused to condemn and failed to repudiate.", "augmented": []}

Last spring, Guthrie and a number of S4CA partners — including several students — lobbied the National Association of School Psychologists to adopt a resolution stating that climate change is a children's issue, as the group's California chapter had done. But the organization declined. The group's executive director, Kathleen Minke, responded in an email to Guthrie that her group focuses on issues that have a very direct impact on schools, student learning and children's mental and behavioral health. Climate change, she said, falls outside this professional focus. When I interviewed her later, Minke told me that her organization isn't ignoring climate change and has dedicated resources to help school psychologists deal with kids affected by natural disasters. But when it comes to managing anxiety, their focus is on coping, not causes. You're not going to develop an entire curriculum around anxiety related to 'x,'  she says.

{"original": "Sept. 5 Included many stances and quotes from 10 candidates who participated in CNN's climate town hall event."}
{"original": "It has also been nearly unbearable for some animals. Anytime we have any type of heat event, we know we're going to have a lot of animals in need, animal specialist Kristie Harris told the BBC. It was so hot that possums burned their paws on roofs and roads. Birds needed to be specially rehydrated. Koalas around the region were being sprayed down to keep them cool."}
{"original": "The problem is that once you get outside of the South, and particularly in the big states, the Democratic electorate looks more like the people who have been voting for Sanders than it does like conservative southern black voters. If Biden runs the tables in the South on Tuesday, and Sanders wins everywhere else, is the party going to nominate the guy who carried California and Texas and Massachusetts, or the guy who won all the states that are virtually guaranteed to vote for a Republican come November?"}
{"original": "Sipping a Bud Light on the back deck at the Salty Nut Cafe in downtown Columbia on Monday afternoon, Loveday, who leads the Biden super PAC, seemed largely untroubled. He could beat Trump. He could win South Carolina. Voters are too conservative to go for Sanders or other liberal candidates, said Loveday, who also works for a consulting firm."}
{"original": "Dec. 2 Bullock dropped out of presidential race."}
{"original": "Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the forum, thanked Trump for injecting optimism into the discussion."}
{"original": "I might be too pessimistic about Biden's chances. It all feels just too close to the emotional roller coaster we #NeverTrumpers rode back in 2016, when we spun elaborate fantasies about the field narrowing and a champion emerging to take down the Orange Menace."}
{"original": "Around the table tonight, we have the greatest businessmen in the world, he said. This is a great time to promote what you want to promote."}
{"original": "I think he glossed over some of the more controversial issues on the environment, said Steven Collis, chief executive of AmerisourceBergen, but he called it a surprisingly well-met speech overall."}
{"original": "This is the wreckage I was elected to clean up, Trump said Tuesday of the bleak economic landscape he inherited."}
{"original": "On Friday, Trump will address the march from the White House Rose Garden via satellite, according to organizers. But as marchers return for the major annual antiabortion gathering, almost none of the core vows the president made has been fulfilled and there's no clear sign they'll be attained soon. Even so, movement leaders don't blame the president — they fault Congress — and seem relatively hopeful they'll advance their movement in 2018 by limiting later-term abortions and expanding exemptions for businesses or people who don't want to be connected to abortion. At minimum, they agree, Trump welcomed their movement back into the White House and treats them with respect."}
{"original": "Trump largely steered clear of discussing domestic political issues during his speech to the forum in 2018, instead using his remarks to tout his accomplishments and encourage business leaders to invest in the United States. He did take a brief swipe at the opposing party, pointing out that some of the people in the room supported Democrats over him in 2016. He also drew a smattering of boos when he attacked the news media as fake."}
{"original": "Biden's biggest challenge in the state has come from billionaire Tom Steyer, who is also betting his campaign on a strong showing here. While Biden has been trying — and failing — elsewhere, Steyer has been blanketing South Carolina with ads and organization."}
{"original": "Experts link the plight of flying foxes to the globe's steadily rising temperature. More than 30,000 flying foxes died across Australia during heat waves between 1994 and 2008, bat ecologist Micaela Jemison wrote in 2014."}
{"original": "Try to watch an REM video on YouTube without seeing him, said Phil Bailey, a prominent Democratic consultant. You can't do it."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, Sanders has taken a different approach. Michael Wukela, a senior aide for the campaign, said Sanders is focused on places and issues where other candidates are not — a climate change town hall in Myrtle Beach, a Medicare-for-all breakfast in Florence and a visit to a shuttered hospital not far from Columbia."}
{"original": "March 4 Bloomberg dropped out of the presidential race."}
{"original": "Campaign officials and some Biden allies say he has been in the state for decades, raising money for local officials and representing Obama as his vice president. Benjamin, the Columbia mayor backing Bloomberg, and others lauded Kendall Corley, his campaign manager in the state, as one of the best political operatives in South Carolina. Biden has more than 100 pastors across the state who have endorsed him. His aides dismiss the other primaries as dominated by white liberal voters and activists — not the type where Biden necessarily does well."}
{"original": "Harpootlian, Biden's longtime friend and golf buddy, recently accused Jerry Govan, a state lawmaker, of endorsing Steyer only because he was paid $43,000 by the campaign. Filings show that Govan was paid that sum for consulting."}
{"original": "More and more, the people we talk to don't like being taken for granted and somebody's firewall, Wukela said. People are tired of the status quo."}
{"original": "March 2 Klobuchar dropped out of the presidential race."}
{"original": "Eventually, Prince said she went to the campaign office, where she was assigned to door-knock in a poorer part of Columbia. Prince, who is in her 70s, went alone, with a script to remind black voters that Biden was Obama's vice president. Hardly anyone was home, she said, and most yards had signs warning of dogs."}
{"original": "Everybody I talk to, they say, we know him, oh yeah, I'm supporting him, said Scott, a councilwoman and local activist."}
{"original": "The annual March for Life brings many thousands of people to the Mall, with buses from high schools and colleges and caravans from churches. It marks Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that said the constitutional right to privacy covers a woman's choice to end a pregnancy."}
{"original": "The scientists involved in the analysis rejected the hypothesis that climate change is making these cold extremes more likely by warming the Arctic more than the mid-latitudes and altering the atmosphere's circulation."}
{"original": "June 21 Updated Gabbard's position on carbon pricing from open to it to no based on a response from her campaign."}
{"original": "During the 2016 election campaign, abortion advocates on both sides studied Trump's past as a supporter of abortion rights and Planned Parenthood for clues about how reliable, true or deep his conversion to the other side has been. At this point, the analysis of Trump seems to have stopped, and the focus has shifted to the fact that he has surrounded himself with leaders well known in the antiabortion movement, including Vice President Pence (who spoke at last year's march) and Charmaine Yoest, longtime leader of Americans United for Life and now a top communications executive at the Department of Health and Human Services."}
{"original": "Yes, Biden had a big win on Saturday in South Carolina. He's catching up to Sanders in the delegate race, because South Carolina has a lot of delegates, and he will probably have a big fundraising night. He should have a nice tail wind heading into Super Tuesday. But where is he going to win big?"}
{"original": "It was a disaster, she said."}
{"original": "Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, did not directly address the theme during his 30-minute address here, although he did call for rejecting the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse and went out of his way to urge Europe to use America's vast supply of oil and natural gas."}
{"original": "State Sen. Marlon Kimpson, one of Biden's most prominent backers, was dismissive of Steyer's money and the notion that Biden's campaign is eroding. Even Ronald McDonald can move the needle with a billion dollars, he said."}
{"original": "Sept. 3 Added Klobuchar's position on fossil fuel leasing on federal lands after she released a climate plan."}
{"original": "In an apparent back of the hand to critics who say he is allowing massive backsliding on U.S. environmental progress, Trump said the United States has its cleanest air and water in 40 years. And in remarks outside the hall, Trump said he is a very big believer in the environment."}
{"original": "April 8 Sanders and Gabbard dropped out of the presidential race."}
{"original": "An international group of scientists has concluded the recent piercing chill was 15 times less likely than it would've been 100 years ago, when temperatures in such cold waves averaged about 4 degrees lower."}
{"original": "Daniel Swain, a researcher at UCLA, published a study late in 2017 that showed a warm-West, cold-East weather pattern over the United States has become more frequent in recent decades. A subsequent study linked the prevalence of this pattern to Arctic sea-ice loss driven by climate change."}
{"original": "We do not find any evidence for an intensification of these types of cold waves due to the Arctic warming faster than the midlatitudes, they concluded. In fact, they said, less Arctic air is coming south than it used to."}
{"original": "Feb. 25 Reflected Buttigieg's 2050 goal for net-zero U.S. emissions."}
{"original": "On a recent Monday, dozens of workers and volunteers were calling and plotting visits from the Sanders headquarters. A sign on the wall said the Bernie 2020 Wish List included folding chairs, water, juice, coffee, world peace, an espresso machine, snacks and Gatorade. The only item with a check mark was a microwave. The room looked like a College Democrats meeting."}
{"original": "June 3 Updated campaign carbon footprint question with additional categories to reflect variety of answers. Also added Harris answers on fossil fuel subsidies and leasing on public lands after her campaign indicated her co-sponsorship of relevant legislation."}
{"original": "The rapid-turnaround analysis was published as part of the World Weather Attribution project, in which — in a matter of days — scientists assess whether a recent weather event was made more or less likely by climate change. The project is a partnership of Climate Central, a nonprofit science communication organization in Princeton, N.J., and several international research institutions."}
{"original": "American views have remained quite steady for decades — since the mid-1990s, about half, give or take a few percentage points, have said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 40-odd percent have said it should be illegal in all or most cases. But the march draws a passionate, largely religious crowd that tends to highlight the political climate and take cues from whoever sits in the nearby White House and which party leads Congress."}
{"original": "Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce, has donated to several Democratic candidates for president, but he applauded Trump's announcement that the United States will join the Trillion Tree Campaign to plant more trees to help reduce carbon emissions."}
{"original": "Australia considers the gray-headed flying fox, one of four types, a vulnerable species — with about 400,000 left, down from more than 560,000 in 1989. The bats live in woods and swamps along Australia's east coast and play an important role in pollination and seed transportation."}
{"original": "Jan. 17 More clearly explained Sanders's stance on a carbon tax. Adjusted question order."}
{"original": "In December, Trump insulted the teenager and Time magazine Person of the Year as so ridiculous and suggested that she work on her anger management problem."}
{"original": "Last year, more than 2,000 flying foxes were found dead in the Richmond Valley region of northern New South Wales on Australia's east coast, the Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported. Temperatures topped 113 degrees Fahrenheit. About 100,000 bats across the state of Queensland died during a heat wave in 2014."}
{"original": "Even as the planet warms overall, some scientists who were not involved in this analysis have published studies that show climate change may be altering the atmosphere's steering currents in ways to concentrate punishing cold in certain locations at certain times."}
{"original": "For abortion opponents, this felt like night and day after the previous eight years, during which both parties became inhospitable to minority views (Democrats who oppose abortion access, Republicans who believe in protecting it) and the Democratic Party platform for the first time in 2016 called access to abortion core to women's, men's and young people's health and well-being."}
{"original": "Looking at the polls, I'd expect him to take Alabama, Tennessee and probably North Carolina. But is a big win in a state he was already widely expected to carry really going to push him over the top in Texas, where he is running eight points behind Sanders and where the Democratic electorate is heavily Latino? Or Virginia, where the D.C. wonketariat is gaga for the technocratic stylings of Warren, Buttigieg and Bloomberg, and where a large youth vote is clearly in the Sanders camp?"}
{"original": "Abortion rights supporters said they were surprised more hasn't gotten done."}
{"original": "It feels like it was with Bush, said Bart Stupak, a former Michigan congressman and a Democrat who opposes abortion and worked to keep federal funding out of the Affordable Care Act. It's all political posturing. The only thing that seemed newly energized, he said, was the House's attempt at the 20-week ban."}
{"original": "He took a swipe at the Federal Reserve for its interest rate policies, saying his economic achievements came despite the rate-setting body. Although his attacks on the Fed have become common, the once-taboo practice seemed to startle some in the audience here."}
{"original": "At the federal level, one of the bishops' top issues, Henricks said, is getting the omnibus spending act to include a provision called the Conscience Protection Act, which would allow institutions, companies and people who oppose abortion to not have to pay for it (in employee health plans) or be involved in providing it if they are health-care providers."}
{"original": "Up until now, we haven't heard from the most committed constituency of the Democratic Party, the African American community, he said."}
{"original": "While serving ham biscuits and cheddar grits to churchgoers at Lizard's Thicket on Sunday, Joann Prince recounted calling Biden's campaign office to volunteer. But no one called me back, she said."}
{"original": "Australia's heat wave — and the United States's bomb cyclone — come on the heels of the second-warmest global year on record since the 1800s."}
{"original": "On a recent evening in Orangeburg, more than 500 people showed up to see Biden, eclipsing a similar Steyer event. Bernice Scott, a fierce Biden supporter who organizes door-knocking with 35 other women wearing shirts labeled The Reckoning Crew, said many black voters in South Carolina are not won over by Steyer or others."}
{"original": "His path to a potential resurrection here is further complicated by his surging rivals — Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg — who want to show in South Carolina that they can broaden their support beyond heavily white constituencies."}
{"original": "In his speech, Trump made no mention of impeachment or U.S. politics, although he took a swipe at radical socialists, his term for Democrats and ideas about expansion of the government's role in health care, education and other issues."}
{"original": "March 5 Warren dropped out of the presidential race."}
{"original": "They have less heat tolerance, she said. Their brain just fries and they become incoherent. Often, she said, they will simply get too hot and fall to the ground while the adults seek out precious shade."}
{"original": "June 3 Adjusted Sanders answer on the Paris agreement after clarification from his campaign."}
{"original": "Harpootlian, a longtime bomb-thrower in the state, grinned on a recent morning when recounting the episode and his appearance in the debate. I'm sorry for causing a distraction, he said, when asked about Biden's comments during the Friday debate that Harpootlian was sorry. If they want to get in the weeds, I'm happy to get in the weeds with them."}
{"original": "June 20 Updated O'Rourke's position on fracking from don't ban it, but regulate it better to ban it and Hickenlooper's position on fracking from don't ban it to don't ban it, but regulate it better based on response from the campaigns. Added positions for Hickenlooper and Yang on several issues based on responses from the campaigns."}
{"original": "Steyer demanded an apology from Biden during Friday night's debate, which Biden did not give, and Govan called the charge that he was backing Steyer for money offensive."}
{"original": "June 21 Added Warren's position on carbon pricing based on a response from her campaign."}
{"original": "There were few signs for Biden in yards around Columbia, and a recent visit to the Columbia field office gave no indication of bustle."}
{"original": "Some activists said the national divisiveness over Trump is changing the direction they thought the movement was headed, one that looked at fighting abortion by providing paid family leave, chasing deadbeat dads and subsidizing child care and maternal health. That fuller approach, with a pro-woman and pro-child outlook, aimed to draw in more young people and even more abortion rights advocates."}
{"original": "Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University, described the recent winter weirdness as in no way evidence against climate change. In fact, he wrote, it is an example of precisely the sort of extreme weather we expect because of climate change."}
{"original": "Nov. 16 Adjusted Sanders's position on a carbon tax, from 'Open to it' to 'No' following a change from his campaign."}
{"original": "During a dinner with foreign business executives Tuesday, Trump had a simple message."}
{"original": "We do feel like this is an arc of a story that hasn't reached its final chapter, that these fights are ongoing, Boonstra said."}
{"original": "Trump was billed as the keynote speaker for the annual business-themed confab in this Alpine ski town, but the main attraction was Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, 17, who has sparred with Trump on Twitter."}
{"original": "Jan. 2 Castro dropped out of presidential race."}
{"original": "But as the impeachment trial began in the Senate during Trump's long day of activity here, the president repeatedly pivoted away from his broader economic message to lash out against his domestic political foes and the effort to remove him from office."}
{"original": "Feb. 11 Bennet and Yang dropped out of presidential race."}
{"original": "Steyer has spent more than $14 million on radio and television commercials in South Carolina. Biden recently went on the air for the first time last week, campaign and party officials say."}
{"original": "But the president faces continued questions about his approach to foreign affairs. His decision to order a strike that killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani this month — and his threat to impose a 25 percent tariff on European cars over a foreign policy dispute — created more tumult in the Middle East and in the transatlantic relationship between the United States and its closest allies."}
{"original": "June 4 Added Biden positions to several questions after he released his climate plan and his campaign confirmed his stances."}
{"original": "He occasionally strayed from the facts as he tried to paint a picture of an economy in shambles before his election."}
{"original": "Jan. 13 Booker dropped out of presidential race."}
{"original": "Temperatures were close to 25 degrees colder than normal in a zone that included Minneapolis, Detroit, Buffalo and Boston over the period from Dec. 26 to Jan. 7. Boston's high temperature did not escape the teens for seven days, tying its longest streak in recorded history."}
{"original": "When it comes to Planned Parenthood, the House and Senate health-care bills contained provisions to block the organization from getting federal reimbursements, but those efforts died with the legislation. Under President Barack Obama, states were prevented from withholding federal money from Planned Parenthood and other abortion clinics; Trump last spring signed a resolution reversing that rule."}
{"original": "Aug. 15 Hickenlooper dropped out of presidential race."}
{"original": "Asked whether Biden's campaign is in trouble, Dick Harpootlian, a longtime Biden friend and fundraiser, paused for two seconds and leaned back in his chair before saying no. Biden had 30 years of experience in South Carolina and could remind voters how many times he'd been in the state, how much he cared about middle-class people and his role backing President Barack Obama, Harpootlian said."}
{"original": "Trump skipped an onstage question-and-answer session with Schwab that had been expected following his address."}
{"original": "Dec. 3 Harris dropped out of presidential race."}
{"original": "And hundreds of flying fox bats died because they didn't have enough cover to protect themselves from the heat. Animal rescuers in Sydney described heartbreaking scenes of dozens of dead baby bats piled on the ground. As the adult bats sought shade near a creek, babies were left dangling from trees with no means to survive the heat, according to a charity organization in the Sydney suburb of Campbelltown, home to colonies of flying foxes. Many were found scattered on the ground. Others died before they made it down."}
{"original": "But some people close to the operation have grown worried that Biden is no longer a sure bet in this state's Feb. 29 primary and that his uneven performances on the campaign trail could dampen support. Some who once saw Biden as the strongest potential challenger to President Trump are looking at others, including billionaire Mike Bloomberg, who won't be on the ballot here but is competing in states that vote a few days later on Super Tuesday."}
{"original": "On multiple fronts, Biden seems behind. He has 43 aides in South Carolina, a campaign spokeswoman said, while Steyer has 93, and Sanders has 72."}
{"original": "Dec. 19 Patrick's campaign relayed his openness to a carbon pricing mechanism."}
{"original": "READ THE TRANSCRIPTS! Trump tweeted shortly after meeting with a group of global business leaders representing industries including energy, telecommunications and finance. Before the meeting, he decried the impeachment process in remarks to reporters — repeatedly calling it a hoax."}
{"original": "I believed the fantasies back then, but I find it hard to allow myself to believe again. And the map isn't exactly helping to restore my faith."}
{"original": "Dec. 11 Added Bloomberg and Patrick."}
{"original": "Henricks said he didn't notice Trump making a big difference in the movement, except for the impact of how controversial he is. I think [the Trump era is] changing clearly the character of the Republican Party, he said. Some pro-life folks are just as pro-life, but they are less Republican."}
{"original": "Upon Trump's election, many antiabortion groups circulated his list of four key pledges, goals he'd worked out with movement leaders: nominating antiabortion Supreme Court justices, signing a law ending late-term abortions, stripping funding from Planned Parenthood and making permanent a ban on taxpayer money going to abortions."}
{"original": "June 5 Adjusted O'Rourke position on the Green New Deal and added his specific U.S. target in the Paris agreement question, following campaign guidance."}
{"original": "Oct. 21 Removing Messam, who reported no spending in Q3 of 2019."}
{"original": "I certainly understand the perspective of those pro-life advocates who support him, said Kelsey Hazzard, president of Secular Pro-Life, who noted that things would be worse for the antiabortion movement under a Hillary Clinton presidency. President Trump has also sparked a tremendous backlash. His boorish comments give ammunition to the abortion lobby, which has long worked to caricature the antiabortion cause."}
{"original": "He added: I think people are frustrated that [Iowa and New Hampshire], the first state that couldn't even get the results counted, and the second, a very small state, are setting the narrative. Neither is representative of the electorate. We have to let the race play out."}
{"original": "They were much like so many of the Sanders supporters that one meets all over the country: young, full of passion, shining with belief in the better world promised by the self-described democratic socialist. Many of them were students at nearby colleges. When I asked one whether she'd attended any Sanders rallies in 2016, she laughed and said, I was in high school, and my parents are very conservative. Like Sanders voters everywhere, they said their top issues were either health care or climate change."}
{"original": "More than 100 billionaires are on the official attendee list for the World Economic Forum, and Trump plans to meet with the heads of several multinational companies while in Davos."}

{"original": "Their finding that the intensity of Arctic cold is easing in a warming world is supported by many other studies. For example, Jonathan Martin, a meteorology researcher at the University of Wisconsin, has documented considerable shrinkage of the pool of frigid air surrounding the Arctic in recent decades."}
{"original": "While Dannenfelser called late-term abortion the most effective piece of our ground game in moving voters, some say the issue is mostly symbolic. About 1 percent of abortions are performed in the third trimester (or after 21 weeks), according to the Guttmacher Institute, which provides research on reproductive health and was founded by Planned Parenthood."}
{"original": "It's a completely different atmosphere than four years ago, she said. We are encouraged, hopeful. The issue isn't buried. Candidates speak about it. It's not a movement in the ghetto. After eight years in the wilderness, eight years of having no ability to influence the president and then walking into the White House at the start of the administration — I felt like I was the pro-life movement walking in, after all those years."}
{"original": "We're pretty disappointed that the GOP Senate and House have still failed to fully defund Planned Parenthood — that was and continues to be our No. 1 legislative priority. This is something the president has promised to sign into law, she said. I think that one of my charges this year is making sure pro-lifers don't get complacent and say: 'We've elected them. They'll do what they say.' No, they're not doing what they said. You need to push them."}
{"original": "I don't think it's in trouble. But I do think they have to apply the resources and focus on South Carolina if they're going to have the kind of win that sends a message, he said. They need to send more resources here to get the message out."}
{"original": "June 25 Updated Inslee's position on carbon pricing from open to it to yes after he released a policy proposal."}

{"original": "Aug. 28 Gillibrand dropped out of presidential race."}
{"original": "Trump ran through economic statistics with a salesman's delivery, crowing about growth during his three years in office that he said bested his predecessors and defied his skeptics."}
{"original": "Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, before he became Trump's Supreme Court nominee, had not been called on to consider — or rule on — abortion as a federal judge. However, he has written about bioethics and human life with language that makes abortion opponents believe he will side with them on the topic."}
{"original": "Jan. 31 Delaney dropped out of presidential race."}
{"original": "Trump is using his day-and-a-half-long visit to lobby corporate chieftains for greater U.S. investment and meet with leaders including Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, Iraqi President Barham Salih and Kurdish leader Nechirvan Barzani."}
{"original": "Some in the audience laughed and rolled their eyes at Trump's claims he has created an inclusive economy that should be a global model. But many business leaders here believe Trump is likely to be reelected and are opting to praise him on topics they agree on."}
{"original": "Even as Trump faces an impeachment trial, his trip to Davos offers him an opportunity to focus on his economic message. The U.S. economy has continued to notch solid growth and maintain a low unemployment rate, and the stock market has reached record highs in recent days. Trump signed a partial trade deal with China last week, easing global tensions over his use of tariffs."}
{"original": "These findings are echoed in Australia's Bureau of Meteorology's climate report for 2017, the country's third-warmest year on record."}
{"original": "Volunteers for the Biden campaign have been instructed to tell potential supporters that Steyer is a good Democrat but lacks experience."}
{"original": "Ahead of Trump's address, Schwab told the gathering that the world is in a state of emergency and that the window to address climate change is closing. He also reminded the audience that every voice heard at the forum deserved respect."}
{"original": "This is of great concern to scientists not only due to the increased risk of these 'die off' events, but also for the long term impact it will have on the recovery of several of these already threatened species, Jemison wrote."}
{"original": "Many pups were on their last breaths before getting much needed help . . . There were tears shed and hearts sunken, the charity said Sunday in a lengthy Facebook post. It's devastating when a colony like our local one goes down like this due to heat, this colony needs more canopy cover and shaded areas to help with our ever rising hot summers because this episode will surely not be the last."}
