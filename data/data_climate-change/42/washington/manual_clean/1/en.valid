Jan. 6 Added Bloomberg answers on climate change in survey responses returned by his campaign.
But as she told stories of Biden taking photos as he held a fundraiser at her family's Charleston house, and being so distraught when he bowed out in 2016 that her mother sent her flowers, she conceded that it would probably be a dogfight.
The core goals aside, antiabortion advocates had a list of things they were happy about.
David Bryant, a retired social worker from New York who lives in Columbia, said he was deciding between Steyer — whose name he at first struggled to recall — and Sanders. He said he liked Biden but had not seen a commercial from him or heard anything from his campaign, and he thought Biden, 77, lacked the vigor that some of the other candidates had.
This account of Biden's increasingly important campaign in South Carolina is based on interviews with 39 party and campaign officials, activists, voters, political strategists and longtime political observers in the state, many of whom say Biden is underperforming.
Biden, addressing supporters here Tuesday night as New Hampshire results showed him running near the bottom of the field, portrayed South Carolina as friendlier political terrain for him — and more representative of the party.
Trump is making his second visit to the World Economic Forum, which for its 50th anniversary this year is focusing on climate change and sustainability. A sign at the entrance to the news center notes that paint for this year's installation was made from seaweed and carpets from recycled fishing nets.
Trump was accompanied here by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, and a delegation including national security adviser Robert C. O'Brien, Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. Also present was adviser and speechwriter Stephen Miller, whose hard-line stance on limiting immigration and denunciations of globalism infused Trump's address to the United Nations in September.
Black voters in South Carolina really like Joe Biden, trust Joe Biden and respect Joe Biden, said Steve Benjamin, the mayor of Columbia and a Bloomberg supporter. But they are pragmatic and want to win and beat Trump. If your number one argument is electability, and you can't crack the top four in two or three states in a row, that's a tough argument to make.
Nov. 1 O'Rourke dropped out of presidential race
But not enough South Carolina Democrats are like those hopeful college students or the rest of the people who had turned out to Finlay Park to hear Sanders and his surrogates thunder about radical change. More than half of South Carolina's Democratic voters are African American, a demographic that former vice president Joe Biden does well with, rather than Latinos and whites, with whom Sanders is strong; they are older, more religious and less liberal than the ideal Bernie electorate. Too many of the people those Sanders campaigners had tried to turn out were voting for Biden, or Elizabeth Warren, or Tom Steyer.
Sept. 20 De Blasio dropped out of presidential race.
Jayd Henricks, who just stepped down as the longtime lobbyist for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the main action both for and against abortion rights is in the states because Congress is generally broken, outside this whole issue.
Given how much the climate has warmed, the scientists called the recent cold exceptional. Yet, as frigid as it was, the scientists found that there were many similar or colder two-week periods in that region in earlier periods. They made clear that, on balance, cold outbreaks like these are getting less frequent due to global warming, but cold waves still occur somewhere in North America almost every winter.
Some antiabortion leaders describe him as a pro-life hero and pose grinning with him and their children. Others say the vulgarity of the president is poisoning the future of the movement, which has worked to change its anti-woman caricature by advocating for things such as paid family leave and maternal health care. Still others say that Trump's changes are more about tone and that he reminds them of other GOP presidents who said the right things but never prioritized fighting abortion on a large scale.
Aug. 23 Moulton dropped out of presidential race.
Oct. 27 Added responses from Steyer, including his stance of no new nuclear power plants at this time and a ban on all fracking, though that can't happen instantly.
In Sydney, temperatures hit 117 degrees Fahrenheit on Sunday, the hottest it has been since 1939. That oppressive heat, a side effect of climate change, has made life hard for the country's humans and infrastructure. Heat waves result in 10 percent more calls for ambulances and 10 percent more deaths, local experts said. Police in Victoria, on Australia's southeastern coast, warned drivers last week that a six-mile stretch of a freeway in the central part of the state had melted. A spokeswoman for VicRoads, which manages Victoria's road systems, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. that hot weather caused the asphalt to become soft and sticky and the road surface to bleed.
Oct. 24 Ryan dropped out of presidential race.
Biden has visited South Carolina eight times thus far, but aides say they expect a near-universal focus on the Palmetto State in upcoming weeks before the primary vote after his last-minute decision to speak there Tuesday night. The primary is heavily, though not entirely, African American and largely focused on the state's bigger cities, such as Columbia, Orangeburg, Charleston and Greenville.
We've seen more mail from Steyer than any candidate, times three, said Benjamin, echoing a sentiment from others in the state. Others said they had received so much mail and watched so many Steyer ads that it is a joke in their households that you cannot escape him.
Opinion Who could win the Democratic primary? Use the Post Opinions Simulator to pick a state and see what might happen in upcoming primaries and caucuses.
Antiabortion advocates have been pleased with the Trump administration's high-profile efforts for their cause, including attempting to block four undocumented minors from receiving abortions.
He praised himself repeatedly, saying that his actions saved the global economy from the brink of recession, rescued the U.S. manufacturing industry and reshaped the rules of international trade to reflect a fairer system.
Some party officials, lawmakers and strategists in Columbia say they have received little contact from Biden's campaign.
June 1 Adjusted Buttigieg's position on fracking given additional information from his campaign.
Our house is still on fire. Your inaction is fueling the flames by the hour, she told conference attendees Tuesday. And we are telling you to act as if you loved your children above all else.
Carol Fowler, a national Democratic committeewoman, said she had not received a call from Biden or his campaign asking for her support — though other candidates have called her. Some activists complained after Biden came to Abbeville to file his papers but did not meet with them.
If I thought he really wanted it, he'd be my first choice, Bryant said as he drove around Five Points, a bar district popular with college students. Biden don't seem to want it bad enough. He doesn't seem like he really wanted it.
Sept. 4 Adjusted Warren's position on fracking after a clarification from her campaign.
Jan. 10 Williamson dropped out of presidential race.
Feb. 12 Patrick dropped out of presidential race.
It seemed a year ago that Trump, with the leadership of the GOP in Congress, had the momentum to repeal and replace Obamacare, and certainly that also included the abortion provisions, said Heather Boonstra, director of public policy at Guttmacher. That also included the defunding of Planned Parenthood. This was a very real item and real concern for us. I think it goes to show how the Republicans just didn't have a plan, in many ways.
Jan. 18 Included Patrick's support for the Green New Deal, stopping the expansion of nuclear energy at this time, a moratorium on fracking, ending fossil fuel extraction on public lands and eliminating fossil fuel subsidies.
Aug. 19 Updated several positions for Castro based on a response from his campaign.
Although climate change and environmental stewardship lead the agenda here, a survey of chief executives released Monday shows that they do not count climate change as among the top 10 threats to business growth.
Thunberg was quick to respond, updating her Twitter biography to describe herself as a teenager working on her anger management problem.
But some longtime antiabortion figures say this all feels familiar: GOP leaders making promises about abortion but not following through in a dramatic way.
June 13 Adjusted Hickenlooper's position on carbon pricing after he released his climate plan.
He described the 4.7 percent unemployment rate before he took office as reasonably high, even though it was well below the average rate in the United States over the past 70 years. He also took credit for additional funding that has been approved for historically black colleges and universities, saying inaccurately that the funding saved the schools from ruin.
Kristan Hawkins, leader of Students for Life, blamed Congress for the stalled agenda. Before the election, Hawkins had been skeptical of Trump's history and commitment, but after he won, she has regularly raved about him in Breitbart, posted photos of herself with him and her baby and said she'll urge activists at the march to press harder.
The House a year ago passed a bill to make the prohibition on federal funding for abortions — usually contained in a legislative provision called the Hyde Amendment — permanent, but the Senate did not, and it's not on the agenda. The House also last year passed a bill banning abortions in most cases after 20 weeks (considered a late term abortion, one of Trump's pledges), but a similar measure in the Senate is seen as unlikely to pass.
As someone who loathes the administration, the short-term report card — [it] has to be said — is not bad. . . . Those of us who said, 'He's just playing you,' we were wrong about that — in the short term, said Charles Camosy, an ethics and theology professor at Fordham University who writes books and articles about abortion. But when we said that, we meant we're not fighting for the next five years but for the next 50. And what will our children think of the pro-life movement when it's headed by the 'Grab 'em by the p—y' guy?
Activists and party officials say Steyer has visited South Carolina more than a dozen times, taking advantage of his foes focusing on other states.
Sept. 10 Added positions for Steyer based on his climate plan, as well as quotes for several candidates on the fracking ban question.
Sure enough, even before polls closed, the Sanders campaign had all but conceded the state; he wasn't even there to give his concession speech, even though he'd come in a (distant) second. The television talking heads who had been increasingly panicked about a Sanders candidacy even began speculating that former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg could drop out and toss his massive ad buys to Biden. (The Bloomberg campaign hastened to announce he wouldn't.) The consensus was that we were now down to a two-man race, and that meant Biden could easily go all the way.
Others close to Biden have taken a more aggressive tack in criticizing Steyer, accusing him of paying supporters for their endorsements. Scott said she found it insulting that candidates like Steyer are spending so much money in the state when they have no history there. I can't be bought, and I won't be sold, she said.
I'm very excited that the United States has joined the Trillion Tree initiative, Benioff said as he left the speech.
Also mentioned was a recent rule change enacted by the Department of Health and Human Services exempting religious employers who objected to an Obama-era requirement that they cover employees' contraceptives. That is being challenged by several states.
Jan. 31 Adjusted Patrick's stance on fracking after additional input from his campaign.
Generally, a growing body of literature has suggested that as the Earth warms and Arctic ice melts, the jet stream may slow down and become more erratic, which could lead to pockets of extreme winter conditions, even as most places thaw.
We have many problems in the world, but we need dreams, he said.
If I do endorse, it will probably be someone who has called and asked me, she said, adding that Biden was still the favorite in South Carolina but seemed to be fading. A lot of undecided voters are just looking for someone who can beat Trump, and they are maybe looking to New Hampshire and other states more than in previous years.
Trump is an outlier at the forum for his views on climate change. The president has publicly criticized global efforts to combat rising temperatures and has made ridiculing energy-efficient products a key part of his reelection stump speeches.
I don't know if I have any data on how pro-lifers feel about Trump in general, Dannenfelser said. But 'Never Trumpers' and others all acknowledge that he has followed through on his pro-life commitment, and they're happy about that. Trump is a pro-life hero, she said.
Sept. 5 Adjusted Biden view on fracking following confirmation of his stance from the campaign.
But the Steyer campaign has worried advisers like Amanda Alpert Loveday, who runs Biden's super PAC in South Carolina and said Steyer's huge push into the state hurts because it eats into the margin.
Aug. 22 Inslee dropped out of presidential race.
June 3 Updated Bennet's details on the Green New Deal and fracking based on more information from his campaign.
The South Carolina primary will be one of the first contests in this process in which communities of color will have the opportunity to make their voices heard, said Biden senior adviser Symone Sanders, and our campaign has significantly increased its investments here, including with expanded television and radio ad buys covering the vast majority of the state's population.
July 30 Additional information on Gillibrand's support for a carbon tax. Added Sestak.
And the impact South Carolina may have on the broader race remains unclear. Biden can ill afford another defeat in the Feb. 22 Nevada caucuses, which take place one week before the primary here, and the outcome here will be quickly swamped by Super Tuesday on March 3, when states including California, Texas and Virginia hold their primaries.
Wildlife volunteers and rescuers spent Sunday picking up bodies of about 200 flying foxes, most of which were babies, according to the charity Help Save the Wildlife and Bushlands in Campbelltown. The death toll was expected to rise to the thousands, as many were still dangling from trees and were unreachable to volunteers.
Nov. 20 Warren's campaign confirmed that she supports phasing out nuclear power.
America is thriving, America is flourishing, and, yes, America is winning again like never before, he told an audience of billionaires, world leaders, and figures from academia, media and the kind of international organizations and think tanks for which his America First nationalism is anathema.
Biden, by contrast, speaks easily and naturally of his own faith and connects it with that of his likely voters here. He has been telling a story about how he shared his own suffering at the death of his son with the survivors of Dylann Roof's horrific attack on the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. It makes a big impression at the rally I attended on Friday night, and illustrates why Biden carried voters who regularly attend religious services by more than 40 percentage points while Sanders won those who never attend.
Flying foxes have adapted to Australia's warm climate, but these fruit-eating bats are unable to regulate their body temperature when the outside temperature rises above 104 degrees Fahrenheit. The young ones are especially vulnerable, Ryan told the Camden-Narellan Advertiser.
June 3 Moved Gabbard position on campaign carbon footprint and Harris stance on Paris agreement following additional campaign guidance.
The cold was highly unusual in the current climate, wrote the scientists who analyzed the temperatures.
Dec. 1 Sestak dropped out of presidential race.
Among them was the administration's expansion of the Mexico City policy, which withholds U.S. funding from foreign organizations that provide or promote abortion. The policy flips on and off when a new political party takes the White House, but Trump applied the policy to almost all global health assistance, some $8.8 billion. Past GOP presidents had limited it to the money the United States gives annually in family planning, about $600 million.
The other three pledges don't appear to be going anywhere.
March 1 Buttigieg dropped out of the presidential race.
Sept. 4 Additional information added from the climate plans of several candidates, including many that include specific U.S. emissions targets. Moved Castro out of 'Unclear' to better characterize his position on fracking.
Paul Taylor is a corner store cashier in an impoverished area of Charleston, S.C. He is gay, black and a Democrat. And he may vote for Trump. (The Washington Post)
Marjorie Jones Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which advocates for abortion opponents in politics, said that was not the federal piece abortion opponents were going after, but it is a type of defunding of Planned Parenthood. Everything is still in progress, she said.
Biden, in other words, seems to be doing really well in what Flannery O'Connor dubbed the Christ-haunted South. But that's the place where Sanders is particularly bad at campaigning. I heard some of his surrogates onstage working stilted religious references into their speeches and looked around at a crowd that clearly wasn't overly familiar with the Bible and thought, why are they bothering? They just don't speak fluent Church Lady and neither does anyone else here.
It was unbelievable. I saw a lot of dead bats on the ground and others were close to the ground and dying, volunteer Cate Ryan told the Guardian. I have never seen anything like it before.
Prince said she still likes Biden, but after dealing with his campaign, she is considering other candidates. I'm on the fence, she said.
But that may be where the agreement about Trump's impact on the antiabortion movement ends.
A new report, pointing to signs of climate change such as the thawing of Arctic ice and intensifying wildfires, says the global average surface air temperature in 2017 exceeded 14.7 degrees Celsius (58.46 Fahrenheit), making last year a bit cooler than 2016, the warmest on record. But 2016 included the tail end of a strong El Niño in the tropical Pacific, and that bumped up temperatures that year, as well as in 2015, according to the report by the Copernicus Climate Change Service, a European agency.
But even the die-hard fans of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) that I talked to at his Friday rally in Columbia, S.C., didn't express much confidence in his chances, though they hoped it would be close. They had been phone banking or canvassing for him, and the experience had been discouraging.
Trump had not yet arrived in Davos when Thunberg gave her first address Tuesday morning, saying that without treating this as a real crisis, then we cannot solve it. He did not attend her main speech later in the day, although she was in the audience for his.
Aug. 2 Added Booker quote on the Paris climate agreement, Biden quote on fracking.
Trump received a polite but not enthusiastic reception in the hall.
July 15 Updated categories on the fracking ban question after addition correspondence with several campaigns to clarify their stances.
March organizers announced Wednesday that Trump would address the event via satellite. They noted that Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush had addressed the march by telephone, Reagan in 1987 and Bush in 2008.
July 8 Swalwell dropped out of presidential race.
The frigid spell was particularly noteworthy for occurring when the planet is steadily warming because of the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Climate warming from the increase in these heat-trapping gases does not eliminate cold waves, but it tends to weaken them.
This is not a time for pessimism; this is a time for optimism. Fear and doubt is not a good thought process because this is a time for tremendous hope and joy and optimism and action, Trump said.
Sept. 5 Included many stances and quotes from 10 candidates who participated in CNN's climate town hall event.
It has also been nearly unbearable for some animals. Anytime we have any type of heat event, we know we're going to have a lot of animals in need, animal specialist Kristie Harris told the BBC. It was so hot that possums burned their paws on roofs and roads. Birds needed to be specially rehydrated. Koalas around the region were being sprayed down to keep them cool.
The problem is that once you get outside of the South, and particularly in the big states, the Democratic electorate looks more like the people who have been voting for Sanders than it does like conservative southern black voters. If Biden runs the tables in the South on Tuesday, and Sanders wins everywhere else, is the party going to nominate the guy who carried California and Texas and Massachusetts, or the guy who won all the states that are virtually guaranteed to vote for a Republican come November?
Sipping a Bud Light on the back deck at the Salty Nut Cafe in downtown Columbia on Monday afternoon, Loveday, who leads the Biden super PAC, seemed largely untroubled. He could beat Trump. He could win South Carolina. Voters are too conservative to go for Sanders or other liberal candidates, said Loveday, who also works for a consulting firm.
Dec. 2 Bullock dropped out of presidential race.
Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the forum, thanked Trump for injecting optimism into the discussion.
I might be too pessimistic about Biden's chances. It all feels just too close to the emotional roller coaster we #NeverTrumpers rode back in 2016, when we spun elaborate fantasies about the field narrowing and a champion emerging to take down the Orange Menace.
Around the table tonight, we have the greatest businessmen in the world, he said. This is a great time to promote what you want to promote.
I think he glossed over some of the more controversial issues on the environment, said Steven Collis, chief executive of AmerisourceBergen, but he called it a surprisingly well-met speech overall.
This is the wreckage I was elected to clean up, Trump said Tuesday of the bleak economic landscape he inherited.
On Friday, Trump will address the march from the White House Rose Garden via satellite, according to organizers. But as marchers return for the major annual antiabortion gathering, almost none of the core vows the president made has been fulfilled and there's no clear sign they'll be attained soon. Even so, movement leaders don't blame the president — they fault Congress — and seem relatively hopeful they'll advance their movement in 2018 by limiting later-term abortions and expanding exemptions for businesses or people who don't want to be connected to abortion. At minimum, they agree, Trump welcomed their movement back into the White House and treats them with respect.
Trump largely steered clear of discussing domestic political issues during his speech to the forum in 2018, instead using his remarks to tout his accomplishments and encourage business leaders to invest in the United States. He did take a brief swipe at the opposing party, pointing out that some of the people in the room supported Democrats over him in 2016. He also drew a smattering of boos when he attacked the news media as fake.
Biden's biggest challenge in the state has come from billionaire Tom Steyer, who is also betting his campaign on a strong showing here. While Biden has been trying — and failing — elsewhere, Steyer has been blanketing South Carolina with ads and organization.
Experts link the plight of flying foxes to the globe's steadily rising temperature. More than 30,000 flying foxes died across Australia during heat waves between 1994 and 2008, bat ecologist Micaela Jemison wrote in 2014.
Try to watch an REM video on YouTube without seeing him, said Phil Bailey, a prominent Democratic consultant. You can't do it.
Meanwhile, Sanders has taken a different approach. Michael Wukela, a senior aide for the campaign, said Sanders is focused on places and issues where other candidates are not — a climate change town hall in Myrtle Beach, a Medicare-for-all breakfast in Florence and a visit to a shuttered hospital not far from Columbia.
March 4 Bloomberg dropped out of the presidential race.
Campaign officials and some Biden allies say he has been in the state for decades, raising money for local officials and representing Obama as his vice president. Benjamin, the Columbia mayor backing Bloomberg, and others lauded Kendall Corley, his campaign manager in the state, as one of the best political operatives in South Carolina. Biden has more than 100 pastors across the state who have endorsed him. His aides dismiss the other primaries as dominated by white liberal voters and activists — not the type where Biden necessarily does well.
Harpootlian, Biden's longtime friend and golf buddy, recently accused Jerry Govan, a state lawmaker, of endorsing Steyer only because he was paid $43,000 by the campaign. Filings show that Govan was paid that sum for consulting.
More and more, the people we talk to don't like being taken for granted and somebody's firewall, Wukela said. People are tired of the status quo.
March 2 Klobuchar dropped out of the presidential race.
Eventually, Prince said she went to the campaign office, where she was assigned to door-knock in a poorer part of Columbia. Prince, who is in her 70s, went alone, with a script to remind black voters that Biden was Obama's vice president. Hardly anyone was home, she said, and most yards had signs warning of dogs.
Everybody I talk to, they say, we know him, oh yeah, I'm supporting him, said Scott, a councilwoman and local activist.
The annual March for Life brings many thousands of people to the Mall, with buses from high schools and colleges and caravans from churches. It marks Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that said the constitutional right to privacy covers a woman's choice to end a pregnancy.
The scientists involved in the analysis rejected the hypothesis that climate change is making these cold extremes more likely by warming the Arctic more than the mid-latitudes and altering the atmosphere's circulation.
June 21 Updated Gabbard's position on carbon pricing from open to it to no based on a response from her campaign.
During the 2016 election campaign, abortion advocates on both sides studied Trump's past as a supporter of abortion rights and Planned Parenthood for clues about how reliable, true or deep his conversion to the other side has been. At this point, the analysis of Trump seems to have stopped, and the focus has shifted to the fact that he has surrounded himself with leaders well known in the antiabortion movement, including Vice President Pence (who spoke at last year's march) and Charmaine Yoest, longtime leader of Americans United for Life and now a top communications executive at the Department of Health and Human Services.
Yes, Biden had a big win on Saturday in South Carolina. He's catching up to Sanders in the delegate race, because South Carolina has a lot of delegates, and he will probably have a big fundraising night. He should have a nice tail wind heading into Super Tuesday. But where is he going to win big?
It was a disaster, she said.
Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, did not directly address the theme during his 30-minute address here, although he did call for rejecting the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse and went out of his way to urge Europe to use America's vast supply of oil and natural gas.
State Sen. Marlon Kimpson, one of Biden's most prominent backers, was dismissive of Steyer's money and the notion that Biden's campaign is eroding. Even Ronald McDonald can move the needle with a billion dollars, he said.
Sept. 3 Added Klobuchar's position on fossil fuel leasing on federal lands after she released a climate plan.
In an apparent back of the hand to critics who say he is allowing massive backsliding on U.S. environmental progress, Trump said the United States has its cleanest air and water in 40 years. And in remarks outside the hall, Trump said he is a very big believer in the environment.
April 8 Sanders and Gabbard dropped out of the presidential race.
An international group of scientists has concluded the recent piercing chill was 15 times less likely than it would've been 100 years ago, when temperatures in such cold waves averaged about 4 degrees lower.
Daniel Swain, a researcher at UCLA, published a study late in 2017 that showed a warm-West, cold-East weather pattern over the United States has become more frequent in recent decades. A subsequent study linked the prevalence of this pattern to Arctic sea-ice loss driven by climate change.
We do not find any evidence for an intensification of these types of cold waves due to the Arctic warming faster than the midlatitudes, they concluded. In fact, they said, less Arctic air is coming south than it used to.
Feb. 25 Reflected Buttigieg's 2050 goal for net-zero U.S. emissions.
On a recent Monday, dozens of workers and volunteers were calling and plotting visits from the Sanders headquarters. A sign on the wall said the Bernie 2020 Wish List included folding chairs, water, juice, coffee, world peace, an espresso machine, snacks and Gatorade. The only item with a check mark was a microwave. The room looked like a College Democrats meeting.
June 3 Updated campaign carbon footprint question with additional categories to reflect variety of answers. Also added Harris answers on fossil fuel subsidies and leasing on public lands after her campaign indicated her co-sponsorship of relevant legislation.
The rapid-turnaround analysis was published as part of the World Weather Attribution project, in which — in a matter of days — scientists assess whether a recent weather event was made more or less likely by climate change. The project is a partnership of Climate Central, a nonprofit science communication organization in Princeton, N.J., and several international research institutions.
American views have remained quite steady for decades — since the mid-1990s, about half, give or take a few percentage points, have said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 40-odd percent have said it should be illegal in all or most cases. But the march draws a passionate, largely religious crowd that tends to highlight the political climate and take cues from whoever sits in the nearby White House and which party leads Congress.
Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce, has donated to several Democratic candidates for president, but he applauded Trump's announcement that the United States will join the Trillion Tree Campaign to plant more trees to help reduce carbon emissions.
Australia considers the gray-headed flying fox, one of four types, a vulnerable species — with about 400,000 left, down from more than 560,000 in 1989. The bats live in woods and swamps along Australia's east coast and play an important role in pollination and seed transportation.
Jan. 17 More clearly explained Sanders's stance on a carbon tax. Adjusted question order.
In December, Trump insulted the teenager and Time magazine Person of the Year as so ridiculous and suggested that she work on her anger management problem.
Last year, more than 2,000 flying foxes were found dead in the Richmond Valley region of northern New South Wales on Australia's east coast, the Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported. Temperatures topped 113 degrees Fahrenheit. About 100,000 bats across the state of Queensland died during a heat wave in 2014.
Even as the planet warms overall, some scientists who were not involved in this analysis have published studies that show climate change may be altering the atmosphere's steering currents in ways to concentrate punishing cold in certain locations at certain times.
For abortion opponents, this felt like night and day after the previous eight years, during which both parties became inhospitable to minority views (Democrats who oppose abortion access, Republicans who believe in protecting it) and the Democratic Party platform for the first time in 2016 called access to abortion core to women's, men's and young people's health and well-being.
Looking at the polls, I'd expect him to take Alabama, Tennessee and probably North Carolina. But is a big win in a state he was already widely expected to carry really going to push him over the top in Texas, where he is running eight points behind Sanders and where the Democratic electorate is heavily Latino? Or Virginia, where the D.C. wonketariat is gaga for the technocratic stylings of Warren, Buttigieg and Bloomberg, and where a large youth vote is clearly in the Sanders camp?
Abortion rights supporters said they were surprised more hasn't gotten done.
It feels like it was with Bush, said Bart Stupak, a former Michigan congressman and a Democrat who opposes abortion and worked to keep federal funding out of the Affordable Care Act. It's all political posturing. The only thing that seemed newly energized, he said, was the House's attempt at the 20-week ban.
He took a swipe at the Federal Reserve for its interest rate policies, saying his economic achievements came despite the rate-setting body. Although his attacks on the Fed have become common, the once-taboo practice seemed to startle some in the audience here.
At the federal level, one of the bishops' top issues, Henricks said, is getting the omnibus spending act to include a provision called the Conscience Protection Act, which would allow institutions, companies and people who oppose abortion to not have to pay for it (in employee health plans) or be involved in providing it if they are health-care providers.
Up until now, we haven't heard from the most committed constituency of the Democratic Party, the African American community, he said.
While serving ham biscuits and cheddar grits to churchgoers at Lizard's Thicket on Sunday, Joann Prince recounted calling Biden's campaign office to volunteer. But no one called me back, she said.
Australia's heat wave — and the United States's bomb cyclone — come on the heels of the second-warmest global year on record since the 1800s.
On a recent evening in Orangeburg, more than 500 people showed up to see Biden, eclipsing a similar Steyer event. Bernice Scott, a fierce Biden supporter who organizes door-knocking with 35 other women wearing shirts labeled The Reckoning Crew, said many black voters in South Carolina are not won over by Steyer or others.
His path to a potential resurrection here is further complicated by his surging rivals — Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg — who want to show in South Carolina that they can broaden their support beyond heavily white constituencies.
In his speech, Trump made no mention of impeachment or U.S. politics, although he took a swipe at radical socialists, his term for Democrats and ideas about expansion of the government's role in health care, education and other issues.
March 5 Warren dropped out of the presidential race.
They have less heat tolerance, she said. Their brain just fries and they become incoherent. Often, she said, they will simply get too hot and fall to the ground while the adults seek out precious shade.
June 3 Adjusted Sanders answer on the Paris agreement after clarification from his campaign.
Harpootlian, a longtime bomb-thrower in the state, grinned on a recent morning when recounting the episode and his appearance in the debate. I'm sorry for causing a distraction, he said, when asked about Biden's comments during the Friday debate that Harpootlian was sorry. If they want to get in the weeds, I'm happy to get in the weeds with them.
June 20 Updated O'Rourke's position on fracking from don't ban it, but regulate it better to ban it and Hickenlooper's position on fracking from don't ban it to don't ban it, but regulate it better based on response from the campaigns. Added positions for Hickenlooper and Yang on several issues based on responses from the campaigns.
Steyer demanded an apology from Biden during Friday night's debate, which Biden did not give, and Govan called the charge that he was backing Steyer for money offensive.
June 21 Added Warren's position on carbon pricing based on a response from her campaign.
There were few signs for Biden in yards around Columbia, and a recent visit to the Columbia field office gave no indication of bustle.
Some activists said the national divisiveness over Trump is changing the direction they thought the movement was headed, one that looked at fighting abortion by providing paid family leave, chasing deadbeat dads and subsidizing child care and maternal health. That fuller approach, with a pro-woman and pro-child outlook, aimed to draw in more young people and even more abortion rights advocates.
Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University, described the recent winter weirdness as in no way evidence against climate change. In fact, he wrote, it is an example of precisely the sort of extreme weather we expect because of climate change.
Nov. 16 Adjusted Sanders's position on a carbon tax, from 'Open to it' to 'No' following a change from his campaign.
During a dinner with foreign business executives Tuesday, Trump had a simple message.
We do feel like this is an arc of a story that hasn't reached its final chapter, that these fights are ongoing, Boonstra said.
Trump was billed as the keynote speaker for the annual business-themed confab in this Alpine ski town, but the main attraction was Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, 17, who has sparred with Trump on Twitter.
Jan. 2 Castro dropped out of presidential race.
But as the impeachment trial began in the Senate during Trump's long day of activity here, the president repeatedly pivoted away from his broader economic message to lash out against his domestic political foes and the effort to remove him from office.
Feb. 11 Bennet and Yang dropped out of presidential race.
Steyer has spent more than $14 million on radio and television commercials in South Carolina. Biden recently went on the air for the first time last week, campaign and party officials say.
But the president faces continued questions about his approach to foreign affairs. His decision to order a strike that killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani this month — and his threat to impose a 25 percent tariff on European cars over a foreign policy dispute — created more tumult in the Middle East and in the transatlantic relationship between the United States and its closest allies.
June 4 Added Biden positions to several questions after he released his climate plan and his campaign confirmed his stances.
He occasionally strayed from the facts as he tried to paint a picture of an economy in shambles before his election.
Jan. 13 Booker dropped out of presidential race.
Temperatures were close to 25 degrees colder than normal in a zone that included Minneapolis, Detroit, Buffalo and Boston over the period from Dec. 26 to Jan. 7. Boston's high temperature did not escape the teens for seven days, tying its longest streak in recorded history.
When it comes to Planned Parenthood, the House and Senate health-care bills contained provisions to block the organization from getting federal reimbursements, but those efforts died with the legislation. Under President Barack Obama, states were prevented from withholding federal money from Planned Parenthood and other abortion clinics; Trump last spring signed a resolution reversing that rule.
Aug. 15 Hickenlooper dropped out of presidential race.
Asked whether Biden's campaign is in trouble, Dick Harpootlian, a longtime Biden friend and fundraiser, paused for two seconds and leaned back in his chair before saying no. Biden had 30 years of experience in South Carolina and could remind voters how many times he'd been in the state, how much he cared about middle-class people and his role backing President Barack Obama, Harpootlian said.
Trump skipped an onstage question-and-answer session with Schwab that had been expected following his address.
Dec. 3 Harris dropped out of presidential race.
And hundreds of flying fox bats died because they didn't have enough cover to protect themselves from the heat. Animal rescuers in Sydney described heartbreaking scenes of dozens of dead baby bats piled on the ground. As the adult bats sought shade near a creek, babies were left dangling from trees with no means to survive the heat, according to a charity organization in the Sydney suburb of Campbelltown, home to colonies of flying foxes. Many were found scattered on the ground. Others died before they made it down.
But some people close to the operation have grown worried that Biden is no longer a sure bet in this state's Feb. 29 primary and that his uneven performances on the campaign trail could dampen support. Some who once saw Biden as the strongest potential challenger to President Trump are looking at others, including billionaire Mike Bloomberg, who won't be on the ballot here but is competing in states that vote a few days later on Super Tuesday.
On multiple fronts, Biden seems behind. He has 43 aides in South Carolina, a campaign spokeswoman said, while Steyer has 93, and Sanders has 72.
Dec. 19 Patrick's campaign relayed his openness to a carbon pricing mechanism.
READ THE TRANSCRIPTS! Trump tweeted shortly after meeting with a group of global business leaders representing industries including energy, telecommunications and finance. Before the meeting, he decried the impeachment process in remarks to reporters — repeatedly calling it a hoax.
I believed the fantasies back then, but I find it hard to allow myself to believe again. And the map isn't exactly helping to restore my faith.
Dec. 11 Added Bloomberg and Patrick.
Henricks said he didn't notice Trump making a big difference in the movement, except for the impact of how controversial he is. I think [the Trump era is] changing clearly the character of the Republican Party, he said. Some pro-life folks are just as pro-life, but they are less Republican.
Upon Trump's election, many antiabortion groups circulated his list of four key pledges, goals he'd worked out with movement leaders: nominating antiabortion Supreme Court justices, signing a law ending late-term abortions, stripping funding from Planned Parenthood and making permanent a ban on taxpayer money going to abortions.
June 5 Adjusted O'Rourke position on the Green New Deal and added his specific U.S. target in the Paris agreement question, following campaign guidance.
Oct. 21 Removing Messam, who reported no spending in Q3 of 2019.
I certainly understand the perspective of those pro-life advocates who support him, said Kelsey Hazzard, president of Secular Pro-Life, who noted that things would be worse for the antiabortion movement under a Hillary Clinton presidency. President Trump has also sparked a tremendous backlash. His boorish comments give ammunition to the abortion lobby, which has long worked to caricature the antiabortion cause.
He added: I think people are frustrated that [Iowa and New Hampshire], the first state that couldn't even get the results counted, and the second, a very small state, are setting the narrative. Neither is representative of the electorate. We have to let the race play out.
They were much like so many of the Sanders supporters that one meets all over the country: young, full of passion, shining with belief in the better world promised by the self-described democratic socialist. Many of them were students at nearby colleges. When I asked one whether she'd attended any Sanders rallies in 2016, she laughed and said, I was in high school, and my parents are very conservative. Like Sanders voters everywhere, they said their top issues were either health care or climate change.
More than 100 billionaires are on the official attendee list for the World Economic Forum, and Trump plans to meet with the heads of several multinational companies while in Davos.
June 1 Adjusted Gabbard's answers on the Green New Deal and the Paris climate agreement to reflect a clarification from her campaign and a specific pledge.
Their finding that the intensity of Arctic cold is easing in a warming world is supported by many other studies. For example, Jonathan Martin, a meteorology researcher at the University of Wisconsin, has documented considerable shrinkage of the pool of frigid air surrounding the Arctic in recent decades.
While Dannenfelser called late-term abortion the most effective piece of our ground game in moving voters, some say the issue is mostly symbolic. About 1 percent of abortions are performed in the third trimester (or after 21 weeks), according to the Guttmacher Institute, which provides research on reproductive health and was founded by Planned Parenthood.
It's a completely different atmosphere than four years ago, she said. We are encouraged, hopeful. The issue isn't buried. Candidates speak about it. It's not a movement in the ghetto. After eight years in the wilderness, eight years of having no ability to influence the president and then walking into the White House at the start of the administration — I felt like I was the pro-life movement walking in, after all those years.
We're pretty disappointed that the GOP Senate and House have still failed to fully defund Planned Parenthood — that was and continues to be our No. 1 legislative priority. This is something the president has promised to sign into law, she said. I think that one of my charges this year is making sure pro-lifers don't get complacent and say: 'We've elected them. They'll do what they say.' No, they're not doing what they said. You need to push them.
I don't think it's in trouble. But I do think they have to apply the resources and focus on South Carolina if they're going to have the kind of win that sends a message, he said. They need to send more resources here to get the message out.
June 25 Updated Inslee's position on carbon pricing from open to it to yes after he released a policy proposal.
March 1 Steyer dropped out of the presidential race.
Aug. 28 Gillibrand dropped out of presidential race.
Trump ran through economic statistics with a salesman's delivery, crowing about growth during his three years in office that he said bested his predecessors and defied his skeptics.
Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, before he became Trump's Supreme Court nominee, had not been called on to consider — or rule on — abortion as a federal judge. However, he has written about bioethics and human life with language that makes abortion opponents believe he will side with them on the topic.
Jan. 31 Delaney dropped out of presidential race.
Trump is using his day-and-a-half-long visit to lobby corporate chieftains for greater U.S. investment and meet with leaders including Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, Iraqi President Barham Salih and Kurdish leader Nechirvan Barzani.
Some in the audience laughed and rolled their eyes at Trump's claims he has created an inclusive economy that should be a global model. But many business leaders here believe Trump is likely to be reelected and are opting to praise him on topics they agree on.
Even as Trump faces an impeachment trial, his trip to Davos offers him an opportunity to focus on his economic message. The U.S. economy has continued to notch solid growth and maintain a low unemployment rate, and the stock market has reached record highs in recent days. Trump signed a partial trade deal with China last week, easing global tensions over his use of tariffs.
These findings are echoed in Australia's Bureau of Meteorology's climate report for 2017, the country's third-warmest year on record.
Volunteers for the Biden campaign have been instructed to tell potential supporters that Steyer is a good Democrat but lacks experience.
Ahead of Trump's address, Schwab told the gathering that the world is in a state of emergency and that the window to address climate change is closing. He also reminded the audience that every voice heard at the forum deserved respect.
This is of great concern to scientists not only due to the increased risk of these 'die off' events, but also for the long term impact it will have on the recovery of several of these already threatened species, Jemison wrote.
Many pups were on their last breaths before getting much needed help . . . There were tears shed and hearts sunken, the charity said Sunday in a lengthy Facebook post. It's devastating when a colony like our local one goes down like this due to heat, this colony needs more canopy cover and shaded areas to help with our ever rising hot summers because this episode will surely not be the last.
