Dear Amy: Due to a job layoff last year, our 32-year-old daughter has been living with my husband and me. She recently returned to work, but receives a low salary and has no health insurance.\n\nShe has a gluten intolerance, which requires meals without wheat and other additives. She refuses to eat the difficult-to-find and expensive gluten-free meals I purchase, accept any money or use the microwave. The food she purchases is scanty.\n\nShe appears emaciated but is adamant — without benefit of medical advice — that her weight is normal. She even pointed out that a certain model was skinny, although the model appeared to be heavier than she is. She became irate when I questioned the comparison.\n\nMy husband feels that as an adult she can make her own decisions. I believe that she is rebelling against her need to return home at her age. What can we do before she is hospitalized for anorexia?\n\nWorried Mother\n\nYour husband may not understand that if your daughter has an eating disorder, the disease will be calling the shots. Disordered eating trumps mature adult behavior. Anorexia is a pernicious illness that intensifies with time; professional treatment and specialized therapy are important.\n\nYour daughter's eating issues may have been triggered by her health problems. Underlying depression brought on by her personal and professional challenges could be a factor, too. Anorexia is an expression of a person's need to control a very basic aspect of her life when other things may seem out of control, but the lack of basic nutrition can make her ability to cope with other life challenges worse. Be honest, gentle and loving toward your daughter when discussing her eating issues. Don't judge or shame her.\n\nPlease urge your daughter to see a doctor and a nutritionist, if possible. The National Eating Disorders Association offers helpful tools for loved ones — you can communicate with a counselor through the website or join their Parent, Family & Friends Network: Nationaleatingdisorders.org.\n\nDear Amy: About a year ago, my younger brother (who is an alcoholic) called me to talk. We have rarely been in touch by phone or in person for nearly 35 years, due to me moving more than 2,000 miles away. During the course of our conversation, Chuck told me that he had been seeing a therapist. He said, I've finally found out what my problem is. I asked him what that is. He yelled into the phone, My problem is YOU! He continued to berate me until he slammed the phone down. I haven't had any communication with him since.\n\nI have had therapy for my own problems with alcohol, and have learned that a true alcoholic (I consider myself one, but have been sober for three years) normally blames other people for their own problems. And it's inconceivable that I'' am the root of my brother's anger.\n\nAccording to my siblings, Chuck has alienated every friend and most family members with his behavior. This includes drinking and taking Valium. He has blocked all my emails, will not answer any phone calls and rejects any attempt I make to contact him. He is stubborn and obviously has this progressive disease, yet he will not seek treatment. His other belief is also classic for an alcoholic — he thinks he can control his drinking.\n\nI'm at a loss as to how to help him. His blaming me for his own serious problems keeps him from discussing anything with me. I don't like his behavior, but I love him and don't want him to die. Any ideas?\n\nShut Out\n\nYou have learned a lot about alcoholism through your own experience and research. And now you need to absorb the biggest challenge of a family member of an alcoholic: The serenity to accept your own powerlessness in getting him to change.\n\nAt this point, you need to manage your own feelings about this relationship and the episodes that led to the estrangement. In addition to maintaining your own sobriety, you should sit in the chairs with other adults who struggle with a loved one's drinking, through attendance at an Al-Anon support group (al-anon.org).\n\nDear Amy: Thank you for your ongoing support for literacy through your Book on Every Bed holiday campaign.\n\nThis is the fifth year my husband and I have done this with our children, and starting Christmas morning with a wrapped book on their beds has become a treasured family tradition.\n\nGrateful\n\nThis makes me very happy. Thank you.

I believed that each generation should produce its own statement of problems and priorities, and that I had no special authority or vocation to speak on behalf of women of any but my own age, class, background and education. For 30 years, I have done my best to champion all the styles of feminism that came to public attention. Though I disagreed with some of the strategies and was troubled by some of the more fundamental conflicts, it was not until feminists of my own generation began to assert with apparent seriousness that feminism had gone too far that the fire flared up in my belly. When the lifestyle feminists chimed in that feminism had gone just far enough in giving them the right to have it all—i.e., money, sex and fashion—it would have been inexcusable to remain silent. In 1970, the movement was called women's liberation or, contemptuously, Women's Lib. When the name libbers was dropped for feminists, we were all relieved. What none of us noticed was that the ideal of liberation was fading out with the word. We were settling for equality. Liberation struggles are not about assimilation, but about asserting difference, endowing that difference with dignity and prestige, and insisting on it as a condition of self-definition and self-determination. Women's liberation did not see the female's potential in terms of the male's actual; the visionary feminists of the late sixties and early seventies knew that women could never find freedom by agreeing to live the lives of unfree men. Seekers after equality clamoured to be admitted to smoke-filled male haunts. Liberationists sought the world over for clues to what women's lives could be like if they were free to define their own values, order their own priorities and decide their own fate. The Female Eunuch was one feminist text that did not argue for equality. At a debate in Oxford, one William J. Clinton heard me arguing that equality legislation could not give me the right to have broad hips or hairy thighs, to be at ease in my woman's body. Thirty years on, femininity is still compulsory for women—and has become an option for men—while genuine femaleness remains grotesque to the point of obscenity. Meanwhile, the price of the small advances we have made towards sexual equality has been the denial of femaleness as any kind of a distinguishing character. In the last 30 years, women have come a long, long way; our lives are nobler and richer than they were, but they are also fiendishly difficult. The career woman does not know if she is to do her job like a man, or like herself. Is she supposed to change the organisation, or knuckle under to it? Is she supposed to endure harassment, or kick ass and take names? Is motherhood a privilege or a punishment? It is now understood that women can do anything that men can do: anyone who tries to stop them will be breaking the law. Even the President of the United States, the most powerful person in the world, can be called to account by a female nobody who accuses him of asking her to fellate him. Power indeed! The future is female, we are told. Feminism has served its purpose and should now eff off. Feminism was long hair, dungarees and dangling earrings; post-feminism was business suits, big hair and lipstick; post-post-feminism was ostentatious sluttishness and disorderly behaviour. We all agree that women should have equal pay for equal work, be equal before the law, do no more housework than men do, spend no more time with children than men do. Or do we? If the future is men and women dwelling as images of each other in a world unchanged, it is a nightmare. In The Female Eunuch, I argued that every girl child is conceived as a whole woman but, from the time of her birth to her death, she is progressively disabled. A woman's first duty to herself is to survive this process, then to recognise it, then to take measures to defend herself against it. For years after The Female Eunuch was written, I travelled the earth to see if I could glimpse a surviving whole woman. She would be a woman who did not exist to embody male sexual fantasies or rely upon a man to endow her with identity and social status; a woman who did not have to be beautiful, who could be clever, who would grow in authority as she aged. I gazed at women in segregated societies and found them in many ways stronger than women who would not go into a theatre or a restaurant without a man. Osage women in Oklahoma, and Anmatyerre and Pitjantjatara women in Central Australia, taught me about survival. No sooner had I caught sight of the whole woman than western marketing came blaring down upon her with its vast panoply of spectacular effects, strutting and trumpeting the highly seductive gospel of salvation according to hipless, wombless, hard-titted Barbie. My strong women thrust their muscular feet into high heels and learned to totter; they stuffed their useful breasts into brassieres and, instead of mothers' milk, fed commercial formulae made up with dirty water to their children; they spent their tiny store of cash on lipstick and nail varnish, and were made modern. While western feminists were valiantly contending for a key to the executive washroom, the feminine stereotype was completing her conquest of the world. This insidious process was floated on the lie of the sexual revolution. Along with spurious equality and flirty femininity, we were sold sexual freedom. One man's sexual freedom is another man's—or woman's or child's—sexual thraldom. In February 1997, a National Opinion Poll found that nearly seven out of 10 women feel political parties do not pay sufficient attention to issues of importance to women. These women would not answer to the description of feminist, but if feminism is the consciousness of women's oppression, they were not afraid to display it. Even now, women may enter political institutions only after those institutions have formed them in the institutional mould; the more female politicians a parliament may boast, the less likely it is to address women's issues. Prime Minister Blair has less trouble keeping his party under an unprecedented degree of central control because so many of the Labour MPs are inexperienced, young and female. A male Labour MP called them the Stepford Wives with a chip inserted in their brain to keep them on message; the media call them Blair's babes. Few of the silly rituals of the House have been abolished, nor has the parliamentary timetable been modified. After a year in the rowdy bear-garden that is the British House of Commons, and many weeks without seeing their families for more than a few minutes at a time, the new women MPs were reporting levels of stress approaching the unbearable. Changes in British legislation have been slow and tentative, commitment to the economic enfranchisement of women more apparent than real. A woman is now slightly more likely to find a job than a man, entirely because of the restructuring of the job market in the employer's favour. The workers who will accept a zero-hours contract, which means that they are only called upon if business is brisk and then paid an hourly rate, who will carry pagers and mobile phones and be at the employer's beck and call 24 hours a day, who take work home every night, who have no job protection or guarantee of safe and hygienic conditions or insurance against work-related injury, are women. Prestige and power have seeped out of professions as women joined them. Teaching is already rock-bottom; medicine is sliding fast. Though they are close to parity in numbers, the total earned by British women is only 60 percent of what men earn; their pay hour by hour is 79 pence for every pound earned by a man. The differential between women's pay and men's pay has now been enshrined. A woman who brings a case before an employment tribunal will wait for years before a decision will be reached; a decision in a single case is simply that. British equal pay legislation is legislation meant to be ineffective, designed to be ineffective. Women are discriminated against by building societies, who treat maternity leave as long-term sick leave and will not lend to couples with both partners in work if the woman is pregnant. Women pay 50 percent more for medical insurance. Women are the stomping ground of medical technology, routinely monitored, screened and tortured, to no purpose except the enactment of control. They have been punished for their acquisition of a modicum of economic independence by being left with virtually total responsibility for the welfare of children, while gangs of professionals perpetually assess and record their inadequacies. Idealisation of the mother has been driven out by criminalisation of the mother. Our culture is far more masculinist than it was thirty years ago. Movies deal with male obsessions. Soccer is Britain's most significant cultural activity. Computer use is spreading into every home, but more than 80 percent of Internet users are male. Women are ignored by manufacturers of video games, which are mostly war games of one sort or another. Popular music is split as never before; the consumers of commercial pop are female; the rock music that appeals to men is deliberately, unbelievably and outrageously misogynist. While women were struggling to live as responsible dignified adults, men have retreated into extravagantly masculinist fantasies and behaviours. Every day, terrible revenges are enacted on women who have dared to use their new privileges. Female military recruits are sexually abused and harassed, young policewomen subjected to degrading ordeals, and hideous brutality inflicted on women apparently simply because they are female. On every side, we see women troubled, exhausted, lonely, guilty, mocked by the headlined success of the few. The reality of women's lives is work—most of it unpaid and, what is worse, unappreciated. Every day, we hear of women abused; every day, we hear of new kinds of atrocities perpetrated on the minds and bodies of women; yet every day, we are told that there is nothing left to fight for. Even if it had been real, equality would have been a poor substitute for liberation; fake equality is leading women into double jeopardy. The rhetoric of equality is being used in the name of political correctness to mask the hammering that women are taking. When The Female Eunuch was written, our daughters were not cutting or starving themselves. On every side, speechless women endure endless hardship, grief and pain, in a world system that creates billions of losers for every handful of winners. It's time to get angry again.\n\nGreer on Adultery It seems there is never any shortage of women who will commit adultery with married men, and that even women who call themselves feminist are perfectly willing to marry a man who has already rendered a wife or two acutely miserable. Women are all too ready still to accept a man's view of his relations with women, and to understand men whose wives, with much longer and closer experience, don't understand them. When women are ready to believe that a man's saying My wife doesn't understand me means I behave unreasonably towards my wife, feminism will have got to first base. One wife is all any man deserves.\n\nGreer on the Tyranny of Housework By the millennium, housework should have been abolished. In a sane world, meaningless repetition of non-productive activity would be seen to be a variety of obsessive-compulsive disorder. People who said that they enjoyed doing housework, or needed to do it, or that doing it made them feel good would be known as addicts. Once the word got out that a person was cleaning her toilet every day, therapists would come to her house and reclaim her for rationality and the pleasure principle. Instead, we have Professor Jean-Claude Kaufman of the Sorbonne telling us that housework is a deeply sensual experience—for women, that is, not for himself. Women do menial work because it turns them on; it doesn't turn men on, therefore they should not be expected to do it. Strange, isn't it, how much men know about sensations they have never had? Kaufman knows a woman in whom dish-washing produces explosions of joy. According to him, rhythmic, repetitive, mindless tasks function as sexual anticipation, building up pleasurable tension until it climaxes in conjugal relations. Faking it in bed has clearly not been enough; now women are having to fake sexual arousal even when they are cleaning the toilet. These days, housework doesn't just use people; it requires a gang of machines: vacuum cleaners, washing machines, dishwashers, driers, food processors, microwave ovens, refrigerators and freezers, immense quantities of water, power and detergent to feed into them, and an army of technicians who treat them when they malfunction—and charge more than doctors do for a home visit. Though the houseworker doesn't now scrub and polish floors or pound clothes on a washboard or put aside an evening for ironing, she is equally busy Hoovering, spraying-and-wiping and stuffing clothes in washing machines. As more and more home appliances have appeared in more and more homes, they have brought anything but increased leisure for the houseworker (who probably also has to earn the money to pay for them). Changing standards and notions of cleanliness have made cleaning more time-consuming than ever before. Kitchen worktops need to be constantly wiped; kitchen floors need to be mopped whenever a footprint or a pawprint appears; the bath has to be cleaned between baths; once a day is not often enough for the toilet. Every few minutes, a television commercial illustrates the standard and shows a way of achieving it, tightening the headlock on the housewife. A recent television commercial for Bold laundry detergent opened with a mid-shot of a slender, good-looking, but not too good-looking, woman. A door opens behind her and a schoolboy rushes in. Hi, Darren, she says. He does not answer. She answers herself, Hi, Mum. Darren enters bedroom, looks surprised. She says, Thanks for tidying my room, Mum. He rips off his school shirt, grabs a fresh shirt from neatly folded pile (the inference being that he is immediately going out again). As the neatly ironed shirt billows out, a special effect signifies the effects of Bold. Mum says, Thanks for washing my shirt, Mum. No response. Then she says, I know you appreciate me, really. Darren smirks at himself in mirror, like any snotnose git with a doormat mother. This commercial would have been shown to a focus group of housewives at the story-board stage, and again before it was transmitted. They must have responded positively to this version of doting motherhood as the training of a tyrant, or the commercial would never have gone to air. Even as feminism is trying to transform attitudes, marketing is obliterating its traces. In commercial after commercial, the performer of mindless routine tasks is an inanely smiling woman, unless some inanely smiling man pops up to demonstrate a new and better way of using even more of the product by dint of making her look a complete fool. A mythical battle has to be waged by the houseworker against germs, depicted as intelligent beings of deviant appearance lurking under the rim of the toilet ready to infect helpless kiddies if the houseworker should be so remiss as to allow a single one to survive. There are more germs in her mouth and under her fingernails and in her hair than there are under the rim of the toilet, but the houseworker is not told this. Her vocation is to rid the world of germs with the aid of a knight in shining armour, a genie in a bottle, a white tornado. This is housework as heroic exploit. The houseworker can only know that she has done her duty when she has squirted bleach-based agents into every nook and cranny of her house, even down the drains. Houses no longer smell of cooking; they smell of cleaning. Yet kitchens are not operating theatres and antisepsis in kitchens is as undesirable as it is impossible, because it can only be achieved by huge overuse of powerful chemicals. Millennial food preparation takes less time than the old methods; the time spent getting food on and off the table has shrunk by a third, but it must not be thought the houseworker has more leisure time as a result. Housework expands to fill the time available. Time not spent doing one task will be taken up by another. Washing used to be done on a single day of the week, usually Monday. When washing machines became cheap enough to be owned by the majority, washing came gradually to be done on any day of the week, and then on every day of the week. Laundry is nowadays done several times a day. Television commercials show beaming women snatching a single soiled garment from the back of husband or child, and producing it blazing clean minutes later, having been through the whole washing and drying process aided by a horde of sophisticated bio-digesters, enzymes and whitening agents as well as immense amounts of power and water, all squandered on a single garment. Kids won't wear their jeans and T-shirts for more than a few hours each before into the machine they go. The person who does all this work is usually female. Advertisers and market researchers who tried to buck the stereotype and show men spraying Harpic under the rim of the toilet very soon realised their mistake. Nowadays, it is always a woman who pops the meal in the microwave, whips off her apron, uncorks the wine, lights the candles and waits. There is no magazine called Man and Home. The 23 percent of men who will consent to cook when they have a woman in the house do so on special occasions with great song and dance, leaving the clearing up to be done by her. Men who clean and wash are presumed to have a wife in hospital. The few men who do a hand's turn around the house expect gratitude and recognition, so sure are they that, though it is their dirt, it is not their job. Work around the house is as gendered as ever it was. Men have not agreed to do a share, let alone a fair share, of domestic work, because they have never agreed on the amount of work that needs to be done. It is difficult to know how they could, because most of the work done in the home does not need to be done. The men who leave ziggurats of dirty dishes festering in the sink are actually involved in a power play which they have no intention of losing. All they need to do is to exploit inertia, and wait it out. Sooner or later, the woman will give in, because the squalor is not held against the menfolk but against her. A man who is slovenly and untidy is considered normal; the woman who is, either a slut or a slommack or a sloven or a slag. The external attribute becomes a moral quality, as it does not for a man. This works both ways; a house-proud woman equates her spotless house with her virtuous self and derives her sense of self-worth from the orderliness of her cupboards, rather than qualities of her mind or soul. The only way to escape this tyranny of housework is to abandon the house. You can live with nomads or hunter-gatherers, maybe, or become a nun with nothing but a cell to distract you from the day-long excitement of prayer. Or maybe you can make a vow that no more than an hour in any day may be spent on housework—and keep it. This really would be the end of civilisation as we know it.\n\nGreer on Marriage Some of the briefest marriages are those that follow a long period of cohabitation. Nobody quite knows why this is so, but the theory is that unforced cohabitation is less oppressive than sanctioned cohabitation. Marriage does make a difference; even when the marriage service does not contain the bride's pledge to love, honour and obey, it acts in the interest of a husband rather than a wife. Though the bride herself may not feel that she has left the family of her father and been taken into the family of her husband, the ancient dynamic still prevails. His friends will now be her friends, but her friends are unlikely to become his; even if her parents are not entirely displaced by his, his will take precedence. The dynamic of mutual accommodation that propelled a couple's informal cohabitation is unnecessary once marriage has confined them. As both are bound, the power will come to be concentrated in the person best prepared to take advantage of the situation, and that person is the male partner. Having been so lucky as to acquire a wife, he begins to take the liberties that husbands have traditionally taken, comes and goes as he pleases, spends more time outside the connubial home, spends more money on himself, leaves off the share of the housework that he may have formerly done. She sees her job as making him happy; he feels that in marrying her, he has done all that is necessary to make her happy. The less she expected it, the more generous he feels for having done it. To her anxious question Do you love me? he has an easy answer. Of course. I married you, didn't I? The interesting thing about this particular con is that men need marriage more than women do. A man without a wife is fragile; prisons are full of men who never married and unmarried men are more likely to die violently. A wife, whose first duty is to stand by her man, reassure him, build up his confidence and attend to his creature comforts, is an asset to any man; performing such a role is not necessarily advantageous to the performer. Yet marriage is represented to women rather than men as a sign of success so effectively that failure in a woman's pair-bonding will neutralise success in any other field. Success which might put pressure on her pair-bond is success too dearly bought. Magazine after magazine offers young women advice on how to get their man to commit himself; there is nothing comparable in men's literature. Men buy literature about men's toys and pastimes; women buy magazines about men and relationships. Though young men have searing anxieties of their own about relationships, relationships are not represented to them as the only things of value in their lives. This fundamental asymmetry distorts all youthful male-female interaction: the girls put too much into their sexual relationships and set too much store by them, making demands that immature males cannot afford to recognise.\n\nGreer on Sex and the Singly Woman Out of 3.8 million British women in their thirties, almost a million are single or divorced. Not only are many women not at present half of a couple, and not likely to become so, but they are also sexually inactive, which is a dereliction of their duty to themselves and the body politic. There is very little they can do about this, bar spending a fortune on body, clothes, face and hair, because, though they can signal availability in a dozen ways, they cannot actually make themselves attractive. The power to make an object attractive lies with the beholder of the object, not the object itself. As a woman grows older, her chances of mating on any but humiliating terms grow less and less. The constant pressure to be sexually active, which has replaced the old pressure to reproduce, actually places unmated women in jeopardy, and fills them with anxiety and the sense of failure. It is the greater pity then that so many feminists accept and perpetuate the notion that people who are not sexually active are of no account. So let this feminist say it again: No sex is better than bad sex. Bad sex is bad for you. Looking for sex can be humiliating, disappointing and dangerous. Making yourself available can mean putting yourself in jeopardy. No sex does you no harm at all. As many a sole woman out there knows, being single and free is bliss compared to the misery inflicted by an unfair partner, good though the sex may have been. Besides, the things you want don't tend to turn up until you have given over looking for them.\n\nGreer on Body Image Show me a woman who loves her body Every woman knows that, regardless of all her other achievements, she is a failure if she is not beautiful. She also knows that whatever beauty she has is leaving her, stealthily, day by day. Even if she is as freakishly beautiful as the supermodels whose images she sees replicated all around her until they are more familiar than the features of her own mother, she cannot be beautiful enough. There must be bits of her that will not do: her knees, her feet, her buttocks, her breasts. However much body hair she has, it is too much. However little and sweetly she sweats, it is too much. Left to her own devices, she is sure to smell bad. If her body is thin enough, her breasts are sad. If her breasts are full, her arse is surely too big. What is pathological behaviour in a man is required of a woman. A bald man who wears a wig is a ridiculous figure; a bald woman who refuses to wear a wig is being stroppy and confrontational. Women with too much (i.e., any) body hair are expected to struggle daily with depilatories of all kinds in order to appear hairless. Scientists call abnormal preoccupation with a perceived defect in one's appearance Body Dysmorphic Disorder, or BDD. Yet no one would say that the woman who puts herself through the agonising ordeal of hot-waxing her bikini-line must be suffering from BDD. Such insecurity has been instilled into women over generations; we have made not the least headway in the struggle to dispel it. Every issue of every woman's magazine exploits women's anxiety about unwanted hair. Even if you escape hairiness, you will fall foul of cellulite. When The Female Eunuch has written, cellulite was a French disease. The English word should by rights be cellulitis, but, as British pharmaceutical companies jumped on a bandwagon set off by sales campaigns for French products, they adopted the French word. Cellulite is subcutaneous fat, pure and simple. It keeps women warm and softens the contours of their bodies and, if it builds up, it often dimples. Whether or not your fat dimples is a matter of genetic endowment; some women have tight smooth fat and some women have softer fat, which droops and dimples, even on their knees, invariably on their bottoms. The characteristic orange-peel appearance can be seen even in the bottoms of babies who have not eaten chocolate, drunk coffee or alcohol or smoked, or committed any other of the sins that are punishable by cellulite. Once upon a time, men and women both admired dimply fat; it took 20th-century marketing to render it disgusting. Most of what is written about globular fat cells, poor lymphatic drainage and toxins that have solidified is cynical tosh. Dimply fat will only disappear if it is starved off; no amount of pounding or vibrating or massaging will have any effect on it whatsoever. No cream, whether made of placenta or the brains of aborted fetuses or ground glass, will break down cellulite. Your cellulite is you, and will be with you till death or liposuction, which is expensive and extremely painful and sometimes more disfiguring than the dimply fat itself. As fat distribution is hormonally regulated, the fat will probably build up again gradually after liposuction. As cellulite will neither kill you nor go away, it is a goldmine for doctors, nutritionists, naturopaths, aromatherapists, fitness experts and lifestyle managers. The manufacturers of creams, exercise equipment, skin brushes and dietary supplements all make a bundle out of women's carefully cultivated disgust with their own bodies, scarfed about as they are by unsightly fat cells. Criminalising cellulite is just another way of demonising fat, any fat, anywhere. As a way of inducing them to buy products of no use or value, women have been deliberately infected with BDD. Conditions that practically all women suffer from are spoken of as unsightly and abnormal, to make women feel that parts of their bodies, perhaps their whole bodies, are defective and should be worked on, even surgically altered. Most women think that their hair is not good enough and dye it or bleach it or perm it. Most women feel that their legs are not long enough, that their thighs are too heavy or not firm enough. Most women are unhappy about their bottoms, which are either too flat, too low-slung, too fat or too broad. Preoccupation about her appearance goes some way towards ruining some part of every women's day. Multi-million-dollar industries exploit both her need for reassurance and her need to do something about the way she looks. Thirty years ago, it was enough to look beautiful; now a woman has to have a tight, toned body, including her buttocks and thighs, so that she is good to touch, all over. Remember, she will be told, beauty starts from within, so she keeps her bowels open with plenty of fibre and her kidneys flushed with lots of pure water. Being beautiful from within takes even more time than slapping beauty on from without. Demi Moore is said to work out for four hours a day, beginning with a cardiovascular aerobic workout, then working her legs and buttocks with pliés, standing lunges and thigh lifts, her upper body with shoulder and punching exercises, and toning her abdominal muscles. She also eats only non-processed, pesticide-free, totally vegetarian foods. The result—taut abs, a rock-hard butt and twanging musculature—was still not enough to save her marriage. Whatever a woman does, she must not look her age. The fitness regime is lifelong, to go with the lifelong sexual activity that is nowadays obligatory. The UK beauty industry takes ú8-9 billion a year out of women's pockets. Magazines financed by the beauty industry teach little girls that they need make-up and train them to use it, so establishing their lifelong reliance on beauty products. Not content with showing pre-teens how to use foundations, powders, concealers, blushers, eye-shadows, eye-liners, lip-liners, lipstick and lip gloss, the magazines identify problems of dryness, flakiness, blackheads, shininess, dullness, blemishes, puffiness, oiliness, spots, greasiness, that little girls are meant to treat with moisturisers, fresheners, masks, packs, washes, lotions, cleansers, toners, scrubs, astringents—none of which will make the slightest difference and all of which would cost money the child does not have. Pre-teen cosmetics are relatively cheap but, within a few years, more sophisticated marketing will have persuaded the most level-headed young woman to throw money away on alchemical preparations containing anything from silk to cashmere, pearls, proteins, royal jelly, placenta extracts, ceramides, biotin, collagen, phytotensers, bisabolol, jojoba, hydra-captors, serine, fruit hydroxy-acids, oleospheres, corneospheres, nanovectors, glycerol—anything real or phony that might fend off her imminent collapse into hideous decrepitude. Yet consumer research regularly reports that nothing applied to the surface of the skin can affect the underlying structures or prevent aging, and still the anti-aging products sell. Every day, hospitals put placenta into special freezers to be collected once a week by unmarked vans and sold to face-cream manufacturers. So desperate are some women to stave off aging that they are prepared to submit to injections of botulin toxin to freeze their facial muscles and prevent wrinkles. What is truly depressing about the false dawn of feminism is that, as we have been congratulating ourselves on largely imaginary victories, BDD has become a global pandemic. Women who were unselfconscious and unmade-up 30 years ago, who walked at a natural pace and worked alongside men in the fields and the factories, are now infected. In provincial cities in China, hanging up over shop doorways, you can see boards with padded brassieres pinned all over them, and trays of cheap lacquer and lipstick under fly-spotted glass, so that women who are naturally small-breasted can assume the new shape. Beauty salons crimp and curl shining hair with a fall like silk into shapeless frizz. The two billion people worldwide who regularly view Baywatch are all recognising a single, tawdry, synthetic kind of skinnied-down, pumped-up, bleached and depilated female beauty. Real girls tell me that when they run along the beach, their male companions make fun of their real breasts that bounce up and down—unlike the rigid half-tennis-ball boobs of the Baywatch babes. Who cares that Pamela Anderson, who has been put together out of all the movable parts of male and female fetishism, has been abused by her husband? We are selling fantasy here.\n\nGreer on Barbie It seemed, a quarter of a century ago, that the days of the Barbie doll were numbered. Barbie was descended from a swimsuit-clad German porno-toy called Lilli—a 12-inch peroxided nymph with a sidelong glance, designed to be sold to men in tobacconists' shops. At her American debut in the spring of 1959, Barbie was the first toy to be directly marketed to three- to 11-year-old girls on Saturday morning television. American girls now own eight Barbies apiece, British girls six. With her non-functional body, boasting a nipple-free bosom more than twice the circumference of her minute waist, legs twice as long as her torso, and feet so tiny that she cannot stand on them, Barbie is unlikely to have been very effective in her career roles as astronaut, vet or stewardess. Every year, Barbie gets 120 new outfits, including a range of sexy underwear, and a new career. She has 35 pets, as well as a kitchen, a bathroom and a patio. She is put together by 11,000 Chinese peasant women in two factories in Guangdong Province; 23p of the total price of a Barbie doll is payment for their labour. Sales last year topped $1.2 billion. More than one billion Barbies have been sold since 1959; she is brand leader in every one of the 140 countries where she is sold. In 1998, a makeover was announced; the millennial Barbie is to stand on flat feet, her bosom and hips are to be slightly reduced and her waist slightly enlarged, but she will still be a far cry from Action Woman. Even so, a U.S. columnist objected, Why not just give her a moustache, cellulite and varicose veins too? The further from the natural a female form, the more attractive it becomes. The further from the natural a female form, the more feminine it is. Barbie has been instrumental in teaching broad-shouldered women, short-legged women, wide-bodied women, real women the world over, to despise their bodies as we do, so that they pay out money that could be put towards the cost of books or computers or bicycles, for cheaply produced, expensively packaged beauty products.\n\nGreer in Abortion Feminism is supposed to be pro-abortion. There are some who fancy that feminists used to march shouting, What do we want? Abortion! When do we want it? We want it now! Those same people think that, for once, marching and shouting were effective. Reluctant authorities gave in to the women's screaming, and allowed a tide of feticide to sweep the world. This is not what happened. In the United States, the crucial factor was a decision in the Supreme Court in the case of Roe v. Wade, which upheld the principle that, as the law had no part to play in what passed between a woman and her doctor, intervention by the state to prevent an abortion was a breach of the patient's privacy. Jane Roe or Norma McCorvey, a sometime carnival barker and druggie who was pregnant for the third time, was the stooge selected by a young Texas lawyer. She has subsequently been born again and now repudiates her part in the decision that legalised abortion in the U.S. The decision in Roe v. Wade did nothing to confront, let alone resolve, the deep moral conflicts surrounding the issue of abortion. Pregnancy is unlike other patient-doctor relations in that there are two other individuals involved—the father-to-be and the child-to-be. Every time a fetus is recognised as a party to other litigation, the safety of the decision in the case of Roe v. Wade is called into question. What women won was the right to undergo invasive procedures in order to terminate unwanted pregnancies—unwanted not just by them but by their parents, their sexual partners, the governments who would not support mothers, the employers who would not employ mothers, the landlords who would not accept tenants with children, the schools that would not accept students with children. Historically, the only thing pro-abortion agitation achieved was to make an illiberal establishment look far more feminist than it was. The abortionists who went to prison in the run-up to legalisation for helping girls in trouble were all male. All saw themselves as champions of women and defenders of women's rights. They were repaid with the love and loyalty of women, who were grateful for the right to expiate their sexual activity in pain and grief. The goal was every child a wanted child; it should also have been every abortion a wanted abortion, but the two sides of the phony debate were never to meet. Any feminist who saw abortion as an assault on women and agitated for a concomitant right to bear children without being condemned to poverty, misery and failure was suspected of being a crypto-right-to-lifer. In 1997, Cardinal Winning [leader of Scotland's 750,000 Catholics] took the first step in the direction of providing a genuine alternative to abortion by offering support in the form of an unspecified lump sum of money to women who would otherwise have an abortion because they could not afford to have a baby. The outcry was immediate; the money was called a bribe that would lure women away from what was best for them—i.e., childlessness. Nevertheless, donations poured into Cardinal Winning's fund until, at the time of writing, £180,000 had been donated, half of which had been paid out. Two hundred women had applied for assistance, 50 of whom had borne children, with 50 more on the way. Cardinal Winning no doubt hopes that government will take over his responsibility and offer support to every child conceived. Feminists should share his hope, but the media has locked feminists into a position which they define as pro-abortion. Feminism is pro-woman rather than pro-abortion; we have always argued for freedom of reproductive choice. But a choice is only possible if there are genuine alternatives. In Britain, the anti-abortion lobby in the House of Commons brings Private Members' Bills year after year, apparently unaware that the medical establishment has no intention of allowing any curb on its right to dispose of blastocysts, fetuses and embryos as, when and how it sees fit. Feminists react to each successive attack on the availability of abortion with grave concern, fighting a battle on behalf of the richest and most powerful organisations in the world. The pharmaceutical multi-nationals will not allow any wholesale revision of abortion rights, in case the mode of operation of their so-called contraceptives should be called in question. In the British elections of 1997, the pro-Life alliance hoped to field 50 candidates, thus qualifying for a party political broadcast in which to alert the unconscious public to the horrors of pregnancy termination—but they were fighting a rearguard action. A poll conducted by a Sunday newspaper found that, even after a series of pregnancy-related scandals, 81 percent of people still thought that a woman had the right to choose whether or not to continue a pregnancy. Another poll, carried out by MORI, showed that abortion was no longer a minority issue; 45 percent of the sample knew close friends or members of the family who had had abortions, compared with 27 percent in 1980. The people polled were asked if they thought that abortion should be available for all who wanted it and 64 percent answered in the affirmative; of the 11 percent of the people polled who were Catholics, half agreed with what 30 years ago would have been considered an extreme position. People also showed the beginnings of a retreat from the notion of eugenic abortion in cases where mental or physical handicap was suspected, which was supported by 84 percent of people in 1980 and by only 66 percent in 1997. In the contest between the doctor's right to choose versus the woman's right to choose whether to deliver a handicapped baby, the woman appears to be gaining ground. There can be no gainsaying that women cannot manage their own lives if access to abortion is to be denied, but the need for abortion is itself the consequence of oppression. If we accept every instance of abortion as the outcome of unwanted and easily avoided pregnancy, we have to ask ourselves how it is that women are still exposing themselves to this risk. A woman who is unable to protect her cervix from exposure to male hyperfertility is certainly not calling the shots. The man is most likely to have initiated the episode of intercourse, to have chosen the place and the time; the woman is probably still dancing backwards. If the child is unwanted, whether by her or her partner or her parents, it will be her duty to undergo an invasive procedure and an emotional trauma, and so sort the situation out. The crowning insult is that this ordeal is represented to her as some kind of a privilege: her sad and onerous duty is garbed in the rhetoric of a civil right. She is confronted with other people who know better than she what she ought to do. She will be required to undergo investigations of her pregnancy for which there is no treatment but termination, whether she would countenance a termination or not. If she undergoes the tests, say for Down's Syndrome, and refuses the termination, she will be asked why she had the test in the first place. And she will probably be talked into the termination. Her agony of mind is increased by the regular publication of results of research to establish whether and when human fetuses become aware, feel pain, can learn. In March 1998, we learned that fetuses are alert and can learn at 20 weeks gestation, before the formation of a cerebral cortex. The evidence was unconvincing, in that reaction was being construed as consciousness, but it had the desired effect—which was to worry women. Feminists have argued that delaying abortion is immoral, but all measures to put in place speedy and non-traumatic abortion procedures, which would be embryologically identical with what passes for contraception, have been blocked by the same authorities who regularly produce evidence about the developing sensibilities of the fetus. A woman who is granted an abortion does not get to choose between abortions: abortion is presented to her as a single entity, when there is a bewildering array of options. Non-surgical, do-it-yourself abortion has been possible for 20 years or more, but the health establishment rations and controls access to it. In the United States, the so-called morning-after pill is unavailable. In Britain, it is not usually made available until the client has endured a sermon on reliable contraception. (One of the best-kept secrets in gynecology is the use of methotrexate and other cytotoxics for non-surgical abortion.) In the United States, surgical abortion is usually a 10-minute procedure—vacuum aspiration with local anaesthetic; in Canada, a cumbersome two-stage procedure, involving the insertion of a laminaria tent, and dilatation and curette under general anaesthetic 24 hours later, is preferred; in Russia, which has the highest abortion rate in the world, no anaesthesia is used; in Britain, vacuum aspiration under general anaesthetic is usual. Recently, the use of better pregnancy testing and smaller cannulas has made possible the surgical removal of the fertilised ovum as early as eight to 10 days after conception, when it is no bigger than a pinhead—at much the same point that it would be shed by the women using the contraceptive pill or an intrauterine device. At the time of writing, only about 20 of the clinics affiliated with Planned Parenthood are using the method—and only in the United States. To be pregnant against your will is to see your life swerve out of control. To become a mother without wanting to is to live like a slave or a domestic animal. Like any other adult, a woman would wish to be infertile and fertile when appropriate: she is led to believe that contraception is her duty and that the available techniques are easy to use and completely effective. If she were totally in control of the manner in which she is sexually active, she might insist that her male partner control his excessive fertility rather than delegating to her the responsibility for inhibiting his power to fecundate. Though vasectomy is available, it is culturally invisible. Men don't get pregnant, therefore men don't bother about contraception. Men do get sexually transmitted diseases so they do use condoms, sometimes, but nowhere near as often as they should. These days, contraception is abortion, because the third-generation Pills cannot be shown to prevent sperm fertilising an ovum. Yet no one feels so strongly against abortion at any stage that they picket the factories where birth control pills are produced. IUDs are clearly abortifacient: these devices work by creating inflammation of the uterus, often accompanied by infection. Women who accept them as contraceptive devices are actually being equipped with a do-it-yourself abortionist's tool. The outcome is frequent occult abortion, heavy bleeding and pelvic inflammatory disease, with the accompanying elevated risk of ectopic pregnancy. Whether you feel that the creation and wastage of so many embryos is an important issue or not, you must see that the cynical deception of millions of women by selling abortifacients as if they were contraceptives is incompatible with the respect due to women as human beings. You must also see that expecting women to be grateful for the opportunity to have inserted into their bodies instruments for sucking and scraping out the products of avoidable conception shows them as much contempt. Fake contraceptive technology manipulates women in ways that we are coming to condemn when they are practised on members of other species. What women don't know does hurt them. If we ask ourselves whether we would have any hope of imposing upon men the duty to protect women's fertility and their health, and avoid the abortions that occur in their uncounted millions every day, we will see in a blinding light how unfree women are. Women, from the youngest to the oldest, are aware that to impose conditions on intimacy would be to be accorded even less of it than they get already. The women who refuses to enter the gynecological abattoir, which extends into every bathroom in the country, must be prepared to do without male approval and attention.
The conclusion of the regular season is more signpost than finish line. Before the season, Allen Sills, the NFL's chief medical officer, compared finishing training camp with a small number of cases to scoring a touchdown on the first drive. The league is now entering the fourth quarter with a tenuous lead, momentum tipping toward its opponent.\n\nNFL teams have been inseparable from their communities. As coronavirus cases cases exploded across the country, they increased within the league. This weekend, more than 10 starters missed games after testing positive, with many more out because of close-contact risk. The New Orleans Saints played without all of the running backs on their active roster. CBS's Tony Romo, a grinning, football-savant face of the league, missed Sunday's Arizona Cardinals-Los Angeles Rams broadcast because of coronavirus protocols.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere was no guarantee the NFL would make it through unscathed after it resolved to play a season — owners motivated by the massive television revenue at stake, players unwilling to surrender a year of careers that run short. When 32 teams convened at August training camps, questions mounted about playing football in a pandemic. Would the virus be spread in huddles? Passed across the line of scrimmage?\n\nThis was a novel emerging virus, and we were tasked with figuring out a way to play a contact sport while a contact virus is out there, said NFL Players Association President JC Tretter, an offensive lineman for the Cleveland Browns. And that is something that was difficult to wrestle with, difficult to figure out the best way to handle it.\n\nThe NFL and the NFLPA had to set guidelines that affected every facet of the league. They established testing regulations, stipulations for behavior inside and outside team facilities, new roster rules and myriad other protocols that evolved during the season. It required uncommon trust between usually fractious parties.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe fact that we worked together in a way we haven't in the 11 years since I've had this job, that'll be the thing that sticks out to me, said George Atallah, the NFLPA's assistant executive director. … The flip side is how incredibly frustrating it is that we had to have a global pandemic to make the NFL and NFL owners realize that they need us to do this.\n\nThe NFL learned quickly that football itself did not spread the coronavirus. But the act of gathering at team facilities and in locker rooms could lead to infections, and the season did not pass without health costs. According to the NFL's most recent data, 222 players and 396 other personnel tested positive between Aug. 1 and Dec. 26. Most of those players recovered and returned to play, seemingly without long-term ramifications. But not all.\n\nRyquell Armstead, a 24-year-old Jacksonville Jaguars running back, contracted the coronavirus in late summer. He had not recovered by late September and missed the entire season. The extent of his recovery is unclear, and his agent, Ed Wasielewski, said last week in an email that Armstead's condition is not something that we would want to discuss at this time.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTommy Sweeney, a 25-year-old Buffalo Bills tight end, developed myocarditis, inflammation of the heart that studies have tied to covid-19, in November and missed the rest of the season. Denver Broncos defensive coordinator Ed Donatell, 63, missed six games and spent five days in the hospital after contracting the virus.\n\nI think everybody should be nervous, Donatell told reporters upon his return. I wouldn't be telling the truth if I didn't think so.\n\nThe toll of playing football during a pandemic cannot be measured in positive cases alone. For months, the league and players lived in what Atallah called the 24-hour stress cycle. Testing results rolled into the league daily, creating constant worry.\n\nAD\n\nPeople use 'day-to-day' as a cliche, Atallah said. I don't think people realize how literal it was to be 'day-to-day.' \n\nAD\n\nEither to protect their families from the virus or to prevent themselves from catching it from a relative, many players lived apart from family. Last Monday night, after he played poorly in a dismal loss, New England Patriots quarterback Cam Newton expressed frustration about sacrifices going unrewarded. Newton reminded reporters they were talking to a person who ain't seen his kids in three months.\n\nI'll always remember the time I had to spend away from my family, Baltimore Ravens defensive end Derek Wolfe said. Those moments in my daughter's life that I'll never get back, that I never got to see.\n\nAD\n\nWithout sacrifice and discipline, the season could not have survived. The times when staffers broke protocols demonstrated the season's fragility and created logistical nightmares. The NFL prioritized medical considerations and playing games on time over competitive fairness, which led to some bizarre moments.\n\nThe most existential threat to the season's viability came in Week 4. The Tennessee Titans experienced an outbreak that ended with 24 players and staffers testing positive. The NFL postponed their game and rescheduled it for another week, rearranging a host of other games. The league eventually fined the Titans $350,000 for lack of compliance, including lax mask-wearing.\n\nAD\n\nThe Ravens were scheduled to play the Pittsburgh Steelers on Thanksgiving night, a marquee rivalry and pivotal division showdown expected to be a ratings bonanza. But one week before the scheduled meeting, strength and conditioning coach Steve Saunders tested positive. It would later be revealed that Saunders had come to work without reporting symptoms, failed to wear a mask at times and didn't always wear a tracking device. The Ravens suspended him for a month.\n\nAD\n\nThe NFL postponed the game that Wednesday, pushing it back to Sunday. On Thanksgiving Day, quarterback Lamar Jackson, the reigning MVP, tested positive. The cases continued to mount until at least a dozen Ravens tested positive and 20 players ended up on the covid-19 reserve list.\n\nThe NFL postponed the game again, to Tuesday. Ravens players pressured the league into delaying the game once more, to Wednesday. Another delay would have encroached on the next week's schedule and forced the creation of a Week 18.\n\nAD\n\nI can't tell you how close — you'd have to ask the commissioner how close we came to making the change, Steelers owner Art Rooney II said. But it was under consideration, I know that. … That's probably as close as we've come so far to having to open up that 18th week.\n\nAD\n\nThe result still stood as a bizarre symbol of a twisted season. The Steelers and Ravens played at Pittsburgh's Heinz Field at 3:40 p.m. on a Wednesday, in dying light in an empty cavern, competing for ratings in a time slot normally reserved for TV judges and paternity tests.\n\nOther absurdities mounted. On Nov. 28, the Saturday before they played the New Orleans Saints, the Broncos learned their quarterbacks had violated protocols by gathering in a meeting room unmasked. After one of them tested positive, the Broncos were forced to play without any quarterbacks. Kendall Hinton, a rookie wide receiver on the team's practice squad who started his career at Wake Forest as a quarterback, completed one pass and threw two interceptions in a 31-3 loss.\n\nThe constant roster juggling and schedule adjustments because of positive cases, along with the persistent empty seats, made normalcy impossible. The season still provided thrills for an audience stuck indoors and whose NFL obsession did not abate — 71 of the 100 highest-rated shows in 2020 were NFL games.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn defense of their Super Bowl title, the Kansas City Chiefs went 14-2. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes will win his second MVP award by age 25 unless it goes to the Green Bay Packers' Aaron Rodgers, who at 37 produced perhaps the best season of his incandescent career. The Patriots' reign collapsed in their first year post-Tom Brady, while Brady made the Tampa Bay Buccaneers look like a team capable of becoming the first to play a Super Bowl in its home stadium.\n\nThe NFL still has to make it there. With cases across the country and within the league rising, the NFL will attempt to conduct the playoffs and hold the Super Bowl, the highest-stakes games on and off the field. It will be a massive test for the league to pull it off.\n\nThe short answer is: better likelihood of success with a smaller margin of error, Atallah said.\n\nAD\n\nThere will be 14 playoff teams to start, dropping weekly to eight, four and then two. Having fewer players, coaches and staffers means a lower probability of infections. But an outbreak would have a greater chance of jeopardizing the enterprise. Playoff games cannot be rescheduled easily, if at all; TV networks will not allow a conference championship game to be played at 3:40 p.m. on a Wednesday.\n\nWe said from the beginning, it wasn't about getting started, Tretter said. … It was about staying started and continuing the season and finishing at the Super Bowl. And we are closing in on that goal. It's going to need everybody to continue to comply with protocols and do the right thing.\n\nEven if the NFL makes it through the playoffs, it still has to reshape its future. The league lost revenue without a full complement of fans in the stands. A television negotiation is underway. How to divvy revenue will have to be determined.\n\nThe NFL made it this far. Its reward, fitting for these unrelenting times, is another challenge.
Travelers easily could adapt in the early days of the coronavirus outbreak, when the illness was mostly contained to a province in China. Then cases started turning up — and spreading — in other countries.\n\nConcerns about widespread illness in such places as Italy have brought anxieties closer to American travelers. Late Friday, the U.S. State Department raised its advisory level to warn Americans to reconsider travel to all of Italy because of sustained community spread of the virus and warned against traveling in the Lombardy and Veneto regions. More than 1,600 people have tested positive there. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also elevated its language about the country, issuing a warning to avoid all nonessential travel.\n\nI wouldn't have predicted a week ago that Northern Italy would be a place you wouldn't want to travel to right now, Robert Quigley, regional medical director for travel risk mitigation company International SOS, said Thursday before the advisories were raised. You can't predict where there's going to be the next hit.\n\nLate last week, authorities confirmed cases in the United States with no known origin, marking a new chapter for the spread in the country.\n\nAs each day brings news of more cases, what is a potential traveler to do? Is it time to cancel a trip? Should people move forward with their already-scheduled vacations? And for those still set on traveling, what's the best way to plan?\n\n[Coronavirus live updates]\n\nIf you decide to cancel\n\nStaying put is not an uncommon practice of late. Major corporations called off large gatherings, and hotel chains reported rising cancellations. Some travel agents report that clients are canceling cruise plans abroad and changing to U.S.-based sailings or all-inclusive resorts. Airlines including American, JetBlue and Alaska waived change and cancellation fees for new bookings in case customers get nervous about traveling.\n\nExperts say there are resources potential travelers should consider when deciding whether to call off a trip, including advice and situation reports from the World Health Organization, advisories from the State Department — which often contain detailed information about specific regions within a country — and notices from the CDC. As of Monday, the health agency warned Americans to avoid nonessential travel to China, Iran, South Korea and Italy and to enhance precautions in Japan because of the coronavirus.\n\n\n\nFew people are seen March 2 in Rome's Piazza Navona, which would usually be full of tourists. Italy's tourism industry has been affected by a coronavirus outbreak, with hotels reporting mass cancellations even in cities with few or no cases of the virus. (Remo Casilli/Reuters)\n\nI think right now what we're seeing is there is more transmission in certain parts of the world, and so it's important to keep an eye on where the transmission is being reported, said Crystal Watson, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Right now those places might not be the best places to go if you can avoid traveling there. But I think soon we're going to see a lot more transmission around the world.\n\n[These airlines are offering flexible travel options to adapt to the spread of coronavirus]\n\nThose deciding what to do, Watson said, should consider whether they are at a higher risk for severe illness if they are infected. That includes people 65 and older and those with underlying health conditions.\n\nIsaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases physician and scientist based at the University of Toronto, said that although patterns so far show most people infected with the coronavirus will have mild symptoms, there are still many questions.\n\nI think we still have to remain humble that we don't have the answers yet, he said. Because of that and because we don't have a vaccine and because we don't know a lot about this virus, people may have some fear wherever there are unknowns.\n\nSquaremouth, the travel insurance comparison website, noted a very large spike in calls from customers last week after the virus spread to Italy. According to a survey the company provides after people buy insurance, 27 percent said they made the purchase because of the coronavirus.\n\nRight now we are primarily hearing from customers who want to cancel their trip because they are worried about how the virus is going to spread, just general feelings of fear and uncertainty, said Squaremouth spokeswoman Kasara Barto. Or they are still planning on traveling, but they want to be able to purchase a policy that lets them cancel in case the outbreak spreads.\n\n[Companies are canceling U.S. domestic travel over coronavirus fears]\n\nMost who have booked and want to cancel because they're scared to travel — or because their original reason for traveling might no longer be valid — are out of luck, unless they bought a comprehensive policy that allows them to call off their trip for any reason.\n\nBarto recommends calling hotels, airlines and cruise lines to find out if they can waive rebooking fees, change trip dates or otherwise offer flexibility. Those who booked a trip with a travel agent should ask whether that person — who may have ongoing relationships with travel companies — can help make changes without a penalty, Becky Powell, president of Protravel International, said in an email.\n\nLaurel Brunvoll, owner of Unforgettable Trips travel agency, recommends taking a wait-and-see approach to cancellation to watch how the situation plays out.\n\nFor areas with a heightened risk, it may all depend upon when someone is planning to travel there, she said in an email.\n\nIf you go ahead with a trip\n\nMaybe it would be too costly to cancel. Maybe travelers just don't want to reschedule, they're not in a high-risk group and the destination isn't under an advisory. Whatever the reason, the trip is still on the table.\n\nExperts say the key before heading out is preparing in case the situation changes.\n\nI think if you're going to travel — and I'm not saying that's a bad idea, I would really like to take a vacation myself — I think people should be aware that there's a possibility you could get stuck somewhere for an extended period of time, Watson said.\n\n[What you need to know about coronavirus]\n\nBc the corona virus has made Italy a level 3: 'do not travel to if u can help it' zone me my sister and my mom are calling to see where we can go instead of Italy lol — ahtzy (@bwabiewonnie) March 1, 2020\n\nShe said during a trip, travelers should watch for news of changes and adjust their behavior accordingly if the disease is circulating in a community by staying away from public places, anyone who appears sick and large gatherings of people.\n\nSome countries are restricting where people can go or whether anyone is allowed to enter from affected areas, which could interfere with travel plans. Popular attractions might not be open; the Louvre closed Sunday, and Disney's theme parks in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo all closed temporarily.\n\n\n\nA sign informs people about the closure of Louvre Museum in Paris on March 2. (Adrienne Surprenant/Bloomberg News)\n\nTony Roccaforte, senior security adviser at risk management company WorldAware, said in an email that travelers should build redundancy into their plans, adding time for delays and preparing to improvise if conditions change.\n\nHave backups for your backups for everything from your communications devices, batteries, food/water, medication/eyeglasses, financial tools, transportation, lodging, airfare, etc., he said.\n\nBefore leaving, he said, vacationers should get all their ducks in a row back home: update their will and powers of attorney, confirm life insurance and health insurance coverage and update their international immunization record. Travelers should create a detailed itinerary of where they'll be and when and give it to a colleague or someone they trust at home.\n\n[How likely are you to actually get sick from being on a plane?]\n\nErika Richter, spokeswoman for the American Society of Travel Advisors, said in an email that travelers might consider bringing work materials with them in case they end up marooned and that they should bring extra copies of their passport, itinerary and proof of health insurance.\n\nWatson said the recommendation is for people to have 30 days of prescription medications with them, and they also should bring their original prescription in case they need more on the road.\n\nAnyone who is sick should not travel — not just to keep from spreading illness but also to avoid getting pulled out of lines and potentially quarantined, said Quigley, of International SOS.\n\nHe said thoroughly wiping down surfaces while traveling is always in order, because many viruses and bacteria can survive on objects. The CDC said it may be possible for someone to get the coronavirus by touching something that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose or eyes, but it's still not known how long the virus can survive on surfaces.\n\nThe basics are key to preventing infection, Courtney Kansler, senior health intelligence analyst at WorldAware, said in an email.\n\nThis includes frequent hand washing with soap and water or use of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are unavailable, she said. Use social distancing and avoid obviously sick people. Transit quickly through airports or similarly crowded transportation hubs.\n\nTravelers who didn't buy travel insurance when they booked a trip should consider adding a medical policy before heading out, Squaremouth's Barto said — though coverage is limited. She said last week that about a third of providers on the site are offering coverage that would include the virus.\n\nI'm sincerely concerned about coronavirus, but I'm also worried about the insane amount of money my mom and I won't get back if travel is completely shut down in the next month 😰 — Jacqueline Buringa (@jackieburinga) February 28, 2020\n\nIf you plan future travel\n\nFor some travelers, no spreading virus will be enough to stifle wanderlust, especially with spring break and summer vacation season approaching. So how to proceed?\n\nThere are official travel advisories and warnings on where not to go. And there are maps showing where the virus has spread. But experts caution against merely picking a spot that has not yet seen a confirmed case.\n\nEvery day we see more and more countries reporting their first case of this virus, and in addition to that, we see countries known to have this virus reporting an increase, said Bogoch, the infectious diseases specialist, who has co-written research on the spread of the virus. If we're not calling this a pandemic, we're at least sitting at the precipice of a pandemic.\n\nQuigley said it's important for travelers to look constantly at the regulations and rules being enforced wherever they're going — and to realize everything could change if and when the World Health Organization declares a pandemic.\n\nThe responses will all be different, but clearly there will be a significant impact on travel both domestic and across borders, he said.\n\nTravelers considering where to go need to factor potential consequences of the virus' spread into their decision-making, said Roccaforte, of WorldAware. He said that includes the possibility of quarantines, travel restrictions, public transportation bans, food and water rationing, civil unrest and strained health-care systems.\n\n[Sign up for our coronavirus newsletter to stay updated on the outbreak]\n\nAnyone traveling should think about how they would find medical care if they got sick or hurt.\n\nThis is more important for people who have underlying health conditions, and it becomes even more important if there is an infectious disease outbreak, said Watson, of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\n\nThose making plans now still can buy insurance if they decide later to cancel because of coronavirus fears — though the policy won't be cheap.\n\nRight now, the only and best option we are recommending for people is a 'cancel for any reason' policy, Barto said. That's only available within the first 10 to 21 days of booking a trip, she said, and it costs about 40 percent more than a standard cancellation policy. It reimburses 75 percent of the cost of the trip.\n\nRichter, the spokeswoman for the American Society of Travel Advisors, suggests using a professional to help make plans for the spring or summer.\n\nA travel adviser can help talk you through your list of options and pricing — they can help you come up with a plan A, B and C and having those back-up options on hand might put your mind at ease, she said in an email.

I think it's time to stop the tweeting about Department of Justice criminal cases, Barr said in an interview with ABC News, adding that such statements about the department, about people in the department, our men and women here, about cases pending here, and about judges before whom we have cases, make it impossible for me to do my job and to assure the courts and the prosecutors and the department that we're doing our work with integrity.\n\nPeople close to Barr said that in recent months he has become increasingly frustrated with Trump's tweets about the Justice Department. The president, they said, seemed not only to be undercutting his own political momentum but also to be fostering doubts about the department's independence. Trump's tweet complaining that he believed his friend was being treated unfairly proved something of a last straw, they said, because it was so damaging to morale at the department.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBarr was comfortable not being universally loved by career employees, but he felt the tweet Tuesday raised a bigger problem, giving people reason to wonder whether the department had been corrupted by political influence and decided he could no longer remain silent about the president's public denunciations, these people said.\n\nLike others, they spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail private discussions within the administration.\n\nBehind that public fight, according to people familiar with the discussions, is a deeper tension between Trump and Barr's Justice Department over the lack of criminal charges against former FBI director James B. Comey and those close to him.\n\nAttorney General William P. Barr pushed back against President Trump's recent attacks on the Justice Department during a Feb. 13 interview with ABC News. (The Washington Post)\n\nAD\n\nThe tension has worsened in the past month, these people said, and came to a head Monday when prosecutors on the Stone case filed a recommendation to the court that Stone receive a seven- to nine-year prison sentence for his conviction on charges of obstruction of Congress and witness tampering.\n\nAD\n\nOn Tuesday, after Trump denounced the move, the Justice Department filed a softer sentencing recommendation, and the four prosecutors who signed the initial court filing quit the Stone case. One left the government entirely.\n\nBarr insisted Thursday that he had planned to modify the sentencing recommendation before Trump issued his tweet but that the president's comments made the department look bad.\n\nAD\n\nSince becoming attorney general last year, Barr has enthusiastically defended the president, much to the frustration of congressional Democrats and some current and former Justice Department officials upset over what they consider an erosion of the agency's independence. Thursday's interview marked a stunning break from that practice.\n\nThe attorney general said he was prepared to accept the consequences of his comments.\n\nAD\n\nI cannot do my job here at the department with a constant background commentary that undercuts me, he said. He also noted that when he became attorney general, he pledged to resist improper influence from any quarter, whether Congress, the White House or elsewhere.\n\nAD\n\nThe president has harshly criticized multiple current and former Justice Department officials — and a federal judge — over prosecutions and investigations involving Trump's former associates and alleged leaking by government officials. But Barr insisted Thursday that Trump has never asked me to do anything in a criminal case. Trump, he said, never talked with him about the Stone sentencing recommendation, and he had not discussed the Roger Stone case at the White House.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement late Thursday that the president had not lost confidence in the attorney general.\n\nAD\n\nThe President wasn't bothered by the comments at all and he has the right, just like any American citizen, to publicly offer his opinions, Grisham said. President Trump uses social media very effectively to fight for the American people against injustices in our country, including the fake news. The President has full faith and confidence in Attorney General Barr to do his job and uphold the law.\n\nAD\n\nThe flare-up over the Stone case comes against a backdrop of growing behind-the-scenes anger from the president toward the Justice Department — more about whom the department has not charged with crimes than about whom it has charged, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\nTrump has repeatedly complained about FBI Director Christopher A. Wray in recent months, saying that Wray has not done enough to change the FBI's culture, purge the bureau of people who are disloyal to him or change policies after violations of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n\nAD\n\nHe has also tweeted many times that he thinks Comey should be charged with crimes, and he was particularly upset that no charges were filed over the former FBI director's handling of memos about his interactions with Trump. An inspector general report faulted the former director for keeping some of those memos at his home and for arranging for the contents of one of the memos to be shared with a reporter after Comey was fired in 2017.\n\nAD\n\nJustice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz referred Comey's handling of the memos to prosecutors for possible criminal prosecution, but lawyers quickly determined it was not a close call and did not seek to build a case.\n\nThat sent Trump into a rage, according to people briefed on his comments. He complained so loudly and swore so frequently in the Oval Office that some of his aides discussed it for days, these people said. Trump repeatedly said that Comey deserved to be charged, according to their account.\n\nAD\n\nCan you [expletive] believe they didn't charge him? Trump said on the night of the decision, these people said. Trump has also wanted charges filed against Comey's former deputy, Andrew McCabe. A separate inspector general investigation concluded that McCabe lied to investigators about his role in authorizing disclosures for a Wall Street Journal story in October 2016 about internal FBI tensions over an investigation of the Clinton Foundation. A grand jury in Washington seemed poised to make a decision on the case last year before fizzling into inaction.\n\nAD\n\nTrump's anger over the lack of charges against FBI personnel flared again in January, prompted by two unrelated developments, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nFirst, prosecutors updated their position in the case of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, saying a sentence of some prison time would be appropriate. Around the same time, The Washington Post reported that U.S. Attorney John Huber in Utah — tapped years earlier to reinvestigate several issues related to vague allegations of corruption against Hillary Clinton — had quietly wound down his work after finding nothing of consequence.\n\nThose two developments further enraged the president, according to people familiar with the discussions. These people said that while the public debate in recent days has focused on leniency for Stone, the president is more upset that the Justice Department has not been tougher on his perceived enemies.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the president's mind, it is unacceptable that people such as Comey and McCabe have not been charged, particularly if people such as Stone and Flynn are going to be treated harshly, these people said.\n\nIn recent weeks, these people said, the president's anger has focused increasingly on Jessie Liu, the former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, whose office has been handling many of the cases related to Comey and other former FBI officials.\n\nThat office has recently conducted interviews in a leak inquiry, eyeing senior FBI officials over news stories in 2017 that discussed a top-secret Russian intelligence document that influenced Comey's decision-making in 2016. Many of investigators' questions have seemed focused on the former FBI director.\n\nSeparately, Barr tapped U.S. Attorney John Durham in Connecticut to investigate whether any crimes were committed by FBI and CIA officials in the pursuit of allegations in 2016 that Russia interfered in the election to benefit Trump's campaign.\n\nAD\n\nAfter learning that the Huber investigation is not likely to produce charges, Trump has become more insistent that Durham finish his work soon, according to people familiar with the discussions. Trump, these people said, wants to be able to use whatever Durham finds as a cudgel in his reelection campaign.\n\nAll of that frustration has fed into the public fight over the Stone case.\n\nIn Thursday's ABC News interview, Barr said that he was surprised by prosecutors' first filing in the Stone case and that the president's tweet had nothing to do with his decision to soften the Stone sentencing recommendation less than 24 hours after it was filed.\n\nThe attorney general said that Tim Shea, Liu's successor as U.S. attorney for the District, had spoken with him briefly Monday, before the Stone filing, and told him the prosecutors very much wanted to recommend the seven to nine years to the judge. But Barr claimed that Shea told him he thought that there was a way of satisfying everybody and providing more flexibility.\n\nI was under the impression that what was going to happen was very much as I had suggested, which is deferring to the judge, and then pointing out various factors and circumstances, Barr said.\n\nBarr said when he saw news reports Monday night of the recommendation that was filed, he thought, Gee, the news is spinning this; this is not what we were going to do.\n\nI was very surprised, Barr said. And once I confirmed that that's actually what we filed, I said that night, to my staff, that we had to get ready because we had to do something in the morning to amend that and clarify what our position was.\n\nNext came the president's tweet complaining that Stone was being treated unfairly, which Barr said put him in an untenable position.\n\nOnce the tweet occurred, the question is, 'Well, now what do I do?'  Barr said. And do you go forward with what you think is the right decision, or do you pull back because of the tweet? And that just sort of illustrates how disruptive these tweets can be.\n\nBarr said Trump would be within his rights to ask for an investigation in an area that didn't affect his personal interests — such as in a terrorism case, or fraud by a bank. But he said an attorney general would not listen to an order to investigate a political opponent.\n\nIf he were to say go investigate somebody, and you sense it's because they're a political opponent, then an attorney general shouldn't carry that out, wouldn't carry that out, Barr said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump praised the department's change of course and singled out Barr specifically.\n\nCongratulations to Attorney General Bill Barr for taking charge of a case that was totally out of control and perhaps should not have even been brought, Trump wrote on Twitter. Evidence now clearly shows that the Mueller Scam was improperly brought & tainted.\n\nPeople close to Barr said that the tweet of praise frustrated the attorney general because it further cemented the public notion that the attorney general was doing Trump's bidding on the Stone case.\n\nDemocrats called this week for the Justice Department inspector general to investigate the dispute surrounding Stone's sentence recommendation.\n\nStone was convicted by a jury in November. The charges against him were the last filed by former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe new sentencing recommendation — signed by Shea and a different career prosecutor — said the previous guidance could be considered excessive and unwarranted under the circumstances. Shea, a former close adviser to Barr at Justice Department headquarters, was installed at the U.S. attorney's office in the District last month.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers can only make recommendations about prison sentences. Stone's sentencing is scheduled for Feb. 20 before U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, whom Trump also targeted this week in tweets complaining about her treatment of Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman, and suggesting Jackson had, in another case, gone too easy on his Democratic rival in 2016, Hillary Clinton.\n\nSeparately on Thursday, Chief U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell of Washington also issued a rare statement responding to President Trump's attacks on Jackson.\n\nThe Judges of this Court base their sentencing decisions on careful consideration of the actual record in the case before them; the applicable sentencing guidelines and statutory factors; the submissions of the parties, the Probation Office and victims; and their own judgment and experience, Howell said. Public criticism or pressure is not a factor.

Under the concept of disparate impact, actions can amount to discrimination if they have an uneven effect even if that was not the intent, and rolling back this approach has been a longtime goal of conservative legal thinkers. Past Republican administrations have done little to erode the concept's application, partly out of concerns that the Supreme Court might disagree, or that such changes would be unpopular and viewed as racist.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCivil rights advocates said diminishing this tool could have sweeping consequences.\n\nDisparate impact is a bedrock principle, said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Through the courts, we've been able to marshal data and use the disparate-impact doctrine as a robust tool for ferreting out discrimination.\n\nIn New York, a lawsuit alleges that a large apartment complex in Queens will not rent to anyone with a criminal record, and that this has the effect of discriminating against African American and Latino renters. The suit is pending, relying on disparate impact to make the case.\n\nAD\n\nIn Maryland, civil rights groups complained to the federal government after the state shifted transportation money from a light-rail project that would have helped mostly African American residents of Baltimore. The money instead went to bridge and road projects that served mostly white residents elsewhere in the state. A Transportation Department investigation into the matter was closed this summer.\n\nAD\n\nIn education, the Obama administration reached settlements with school systems such as the one in Lodi, Calif., where an investigation found widespread disparities in student discipline. African American students, for instance, were five times as likely as white peers to receive out-of-school suspensions for willful defiance or disruption.\n\nIn 2014, the Obama administration formally advised school systems they may be guilty of racial discrimination if students of color are punished at higher rates.\n\nAD\n\nWhen investigators and courts incorporate disparate impact in a review, they are looking at more than the intent of laws or practices. They are also evaluating whether a policy's impact varies based on race, ethnicity or other factors. Regulations across the government implementing the 1964 Civil Rights Act and its amendments define discrimination as including this unintentional form of bias.\n\nAD\n\nThe Trump administration signaled its hostility to this approach in a report issued last month by the Federal Commission on School Safety, which recommended rescinding the school discipline guidance. In a sharply worded and controversial chapter, the report said the validity of disparate impact analysis cannot be squared with the Supreme Court's holdings. The administration revoked the guidance a few days later.\n\nDisparate impact was written into the original regulations that implemented Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which bars discrimination based on race, color or national origin by entities, including schools, that receive federal funding. The school safety report argued that earlier administrations had adopted the concept without regard for what the underlying statute said. It said that interpretation was of questionable validity and dubious, at best.\n\nAD\n\nOne person familiar with the administration's planning said the strong language in the school safety panel's report really signals the direction that the administration is going in. To that end, the Education Department is considering replacing the original Title VI regulation, this person said. He and others spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to describe internal discussions.\n\nAD\n\nOne option under consideration includes clarifying the Title VI regulation to make its use consistent with the Trump administration's legal views. Another option would replace the regulation with a new one, which would require a formal and lengthy process of public notice and comment.\n\nThose options are separate from the Justice Department memo, which was described by a person familiar with the document as a starting point for moving toward removing disparate-impact-based regulations across the federal government.\n\nAD\n\nIn June, the Department of Housing and Urban Development published a notice announcing that it plans to consider revising its 2013 regulation on disparate-impact claims in the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, religion and other factors in sale, rental or financing of housing. The agency signaled that it was reconsidering how the regulations affect the insurance industry, which has challenged them in court.\n\nAD\n\nData showing that a policy resulted in uneven consequences is not sufficient to prove a discrimination claim. A school or other institution accused of discrimination under the concept of disparate impact can defend itself by showing the policy is justified and that no other method exists to accomplish a goal.\n\nThe Supreme Court has recognized disparate-impact claims, but in a 2015 housing case, its use was upheld by a narrow 5-to-4 vote, in an opinion written by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, now retired. Some conservatives have speculated that the new court, with Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh in Kennedy's place, might decide the same matter differently.\n\nAD\n\nMuch — but not all — of the disparate-impact law could be changed by the administration because the concept was incorporated through regulations, which administrations are free to change by following a formal process. A broad-based rewrite of regulations could affect areas such as transportation and environmental law, as well as education and housing. But it would be harder to make changes to voting and employment law, experts say, because the concept of disparate impact is overtly written into the underlying statute, not just the regulations.\n\nAD\n\nSupporters of disparate-impact analysis say it is a critical tool because finding smoking gun evidence to prove someone intended to discriminate is difficult. And even if the intention wasn't to discriminate, advocates say institutions should be held accountable for discriminatory effects.\n\nMost people don't have access to what's going on in somebody's mind. Even if a decision was intentionally discriminatory, it's going to be very difficult to prove, said Ajmel Quereshi, senior counsel with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.\n\nAD\n\nBut conservatives have long argued that proving discrimination should require proof that someone intended to treat people differently. And they say that if people are being judged by numbers, they may feel pressure to make decisions based on racial quotas.\n\nThe disparate-impact approach requires decision-makers to make decisions with an eye on race. That is exactly what the civil rights laws are supposed to prohibit, said Roger Clegg, president of the Center for Equal Opportunity, a conservative think tank focused on race and ethnicity. He said he has lobbied Trump administration officials to write the idea out of federal regulations.\n\nAD\n\nDisparate-impact analysis, he argued, is not necessary to combat true discrimination. He said he also tried to persuade officials in the George W. Bush administration to do the same, without results. The Bushes were very skittish on civil rights issues, he said.
Dunn, a dynamic attacker who won the 2015 league MVP trophy, was free to pursue other opportunities after the expiration of her contract with the U.S. Soccer Federation, which underwrites the NWSL and allocates national team members to the 10 teams. Krieger and Dunn were the Spirit's only U.S. team representatives.\n\nAD\n\nThey were among a group of players who had grown disenchanted with the Spirit organization, several sources said. Dunn played down her issues with the Spirit, saying in a phone interview from Europe: My decision is based on trying a new environment. I absolutely loved the Spirit. It was a hard decision, but it's the right time for me.\n\nAD\n\nDunn, 24, is the second prominent national team figure to move overseas this winter: Forward Alex Morgan signed a six-month pact with French club Olympique Lyonnais, the reigning European champion.\n\nWhile Morgan plans to report back to Orlando this summer, Dunn has no such arrangement, even though the English season ends in May, the second month on the NWSL calendar. Her contract does include options to leave if things don't work out, but she said, I will not be in the NWSL in 2017.\n\nDunn was in London about a month ago, touring Chelsea's facilities and meeting club officials.\n\nAD\n\nI felt at home, she said. After the visit, we had some conversations. What's it going to take? They knew I was interested, so it was only a matter of dotting some I's and crossing some T's.\n\nContract terms were not disclosed. She is the first high-profile American to sign a major deal with a team in the English league, which is a step below the NWSL but, with increased backing from traditional clubs such as Chelsea, is beginning to grow.\n\nAD\n\nDunn's departure is a setback for both the Spirit and NWSL, which is seeking to gain a lasting foothold after the failure of two previous women's pro soccer ventures (WUSA and WPS).\n\nOf course it hurts to lose such a talented player, Spirit Coach Jim Gabarra said, but this is professional sports, and every time there's a roster spot open, it creates opportunities for others.\n\nAD\n\nAfter a U.S. camp in the Los Angeles area this month, Dunn will join Chelsea full time in late January. She'll return home regularly for national team events.\n\nBefore signing with Chelsea, she consulted with U.S. Coach Jill Ellis.\n\nI told her I want to do it but also am very committed to the national team, said Dunn, a winger whose 14 U.S. goals in 2016 were third on the squad behind Morgan and World Cup hero Carli Lloyd. Jill told me, if I was going to do it any year, it's this year. It was a good feeling having her support. That was something very important to me, being able to feel as though I am part of the national team and not feel as though I am missing out on opportunities.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt's a great deal, being able to do the national team and also have the experience of playing overseas.\n\nChelsea is a founding member of the 19-team FA Women's Super League, which features two divisions and promotion-relegation. Home matches are played at a 3,000-seat suburban stadium. The Blues won the top-flight title in 2015 and qualified for the UEFA Women's Champions League the past two years.\n\nDunn is not the only American eyeing England: Multiple sources said Heather O'Reilly, who retired from the national team last fall, has spoken with London-based Arsenal. The winger, 32, played the past two seasons in Kansas City after two in Boston.\n\nAD\n\nEvery member of the 2015 U.S. World Cup squad and 2016 Olympic team was domestically based. And over the years, the few aligned with European clubs, such as Krieger (Germany) and Lindsey Horan (France), have moved to the NWSL. However, with big European clubs beginning to invest more heavily in women's soccer, U.S. players have greater club options abroad today.\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, the national team players have been locked in a long-running labor dispute with the USSF. The collective bargaining agreement expired Dec. 31, and, while negotiations continue, the previous terms have carried over.\n\nThe USSF compensates about two-dozen elite players for service with both an NWSL squad and the national team. Because Dunn will collect a salary from Chelsea, she'll accept a prorated deal for national team activity.\n\nAD\n\nBy joining the English team, she leaves what sources say was a toxic atmosphere in Washington last season.\n\nKrieger, a Northern Virginia native who joined the team for the inaugural 2013 season, was unhappy with Gabarra's playing style and player management. She differed with owner Bill Lynch, a local software executive, on how he ran the team. Those sources, ranging from players to people familiar with the team, also cited communication issues between Gabarra and the players.\n\nAD\n\nOne source, who requested anonymity in fear of retaliation, said the players went to the championship, and yet were so unhappy.\n\nKrieger did not respond to interview requests. A day after she was traded, the defender, 32, told her half-million Instagram followers that the deal was a surprise but I do think change can be a good thing. She learned of the trade from Orlando officials, not Washington's.\n\nAD\n\nDespite the successful season, several others are gone or possibly on the way out.\n\nShortly after the season ended, Argentine forward Estefania Banini, Washington's leading scorer and a free agent, signed with Spanish club Valencia.\n\nAnnapolis native Christine Nairn, a starting midfielder coming off a quality season, was traded this past fall to her previous team, the Seattle Reign, for a player and three draft picks. Defender Megan Oyster (15 starts) was dealt to Boston for two players. The latter deal also yielded the No. 1 position in the NWSL's distribution ranking order, the mechanism for placing unaffiliated U.S. and Canadian national team players.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe status of midfielder Diana Matheson and goalkeeper Stephanie Labbe, Olympic bronze medalists with Canada last summer, is unclear. Matheson, 32, has been with the team since 2013. Labbe lost the starting job the second half of the season.\n\nDunn said, I would be lying if Kriegs leaving and Christine Nairn leaving isn't something I thought about, but my decision to leave was far beyond the different changes happening with the Spirit.\n\nAddressing fans angered by the trades, Gabarra said: There are numerous factors and decisions to be made, often based on dozens of moving parts involving multiple points of interest. In most every case, the public will never see or know all of the reasons.\n\nGabarra, who is also the general manager, was in his first year with the Spirit after coaching Washington teams in previous women's pro leagues.\n\nAD\n\nReaching the NWSL championship match in Houston was great, he said. However, it's still my job to look forward and continue to put things in place that give the club the best chance to keep reaching for our goals. As is the case with every team in pro sports, changes must be made because no matter how successful a season, things can always be better.\n\nLynch made headlines late in the season when he broke league protocol and ordered The Star-Spangled Banner played while Washington and Seattle players were in the locker room, preventing Reign star Megan Rapinoe from kneeling during the anthem.\n\nIn subsequent days, the players expressed disappointment by posting a statement on the team's website. Lynch made an emotional, in-person apology to the group for overshadowing the game, a victory that clinched home-field advantage in the playoffs.\n\nAD\n\nThe offseason upheaval comes in the wake of the best season in the team's short history: Washington (12-5-3) was second in the regular season behind the Portland Thorns and defeated the Chicago Red Stars in the semifinals for its first playoff victory.\n\nThe team thrived despite Dunn's lower production. After posting a league-leading 15 goals in 2015, the Long Island native split time between club and country this past year and did not score for the Spirit until late in the campaign. She shined in the final against the Western New York Flash, scoring twice, including a go-ahead strike in extra time, but the Spirit conceded a late equalizer and ultimately lost in a penalty-kick tiebreaker.
In Sydney, temperatures hit 117 degrees Fahrenheit on Sunday, the hottest it has been since 1939. That oppressive heat, a side effect of climate change, has made life hard for the country's humans and infrastructure. Heat waves result in 10 percent more calls for ambulances and 10 percent more deaths, local experts said. Police in Victoria, on Australia's southeastern coast, warned drivers last week that a six-mile stretch of a freeway in the central part of the state had melted. A spokeswoman for VicRoads, which manages Victoria's road systems, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. that hot weather caused the asphalt to become soft and sticky and the road surface to bleed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt has also been nearly unbearable for some animals. Anytime we have any type of heat event, we know we're going to have a lot of animals in need, animal specialist Kristie Harris told the BBC. It was so hot that possums burned their paws on roofs and roads. Birds needed to be specially rehydrated. Koalas around the region were being sprayed down to keep them cool.\n\nAnd hundreds of flying fox bats died because they didn't have enough cover to protect themselves from the heat. Animal rescuers in Sydney described heartbreaking scenes of dozens of dead baby bats piled on the ground. As the adult bats sought shade near a creek, babies were left dangling from trees with no means to survive the heat, according to a charity organization in the Sydney suburb of Campbelltown, home to colonies of flying foxes. Many were found scattered on the ground. Others died before they made it down.\n\nIt was unbelievable. I saw a lot of dead bats on the ground and others were close to the ground and dying, volunteer Cate Ryan told the Guardian. I have never seen anything like it before.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFlying foxes have adapted to Australia's warm climate, but these fruit-eating bats are unable to regulate their body temperature when the outside temperature rises above 104 degrees Fahrenheit. The young ones are especially vulnerable, Ryan told the Camden-Narellan Advertiser.\n\nThey have less heat tolerance, she said. Their brain just fries and they become incoherent. Often, she said, they will simply get too hot and fall to the ground while the adults seek out precious shade.\n\nWildlife volunteers and rescuers spent Sunday picking up bodies of about 200 flying foxes, most of which were babies, according to the charity Help Save the Wildlife and Bushlands in Campbelltown. The death toll was expected to rise to the thousands, as many were still dangling from trees and were unreachable to volunteers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany pups were on their last breaths before getting much needed help . . . There were tears shed and hearts sunken, the charity said Sunday in a lengthy Facebook post. It's devastating when a colony like our local one goes down like this due to heat, this colony needs more canopy cover and shaded areas to help with our ever rising hot summers because this episode will surely not be the last.\n\nAustralia considers the gray-headed flying fox, one of four types, a vulnerable species — with about 400,000 left, down from more than 560,000 in 1989. The bats live in woods and swamps along Australia's east coast and play an important role in pollination and seed transportation.\n\nExperts link the plight of flying foxes to the globe's steadily rising temperature. More than 30,000 flying foxes died across Australia during heat waves between 1994 and 2008, bat ecologist Micaela Jemison wrote in 2014.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLast year, more than 2,000 flying foxes were found dead in the Richmond Valley region of northern New South Wales on Australia's east coast, the Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported. Temperatures topped 113 degrees Fahrenheit. About 100,000 bats across the state of Queensland died during a heat wave in 2014.\n\nThis is of great concern to scientists not only due to the increased risk of these 'die off' events, but also for the long term impact it will have on the recovery of several of these already threatened species, Jemison wrote.\n\nAustralia's heat wave — and the United States's bomb cyclone — come on the heels of the second-warmest global year on record since the 1800s.\n\nAD\n\nA new report, pointing to signs of climate change such as the thawing of Arctic ice and intensifying wildfires, says the global average surface air temperature in 2017 exceeded 14.7 degrees Celsius (58.46 Fahrenheit), making last year a bit cooler than 2016, the warmest on record. But 2016 included the tail end of a strong El Niño in the tropical Pacific, and that bumped up temperatures that year, as well as in 2015, according to the report by the Copernicus Climate Change Service, a European agency.\n\nAD\n\nThese findings are echoed in Australia's Bureau of Meteorology's climate report for 2017, the country's third-warmest year on record.
As Washington rallied for a 114-110 New Year's Eve win over the Chicago Bulls, the team connected on 16 three-pointers. It was the third time in five games in which the Wizards had made at least 16 and the second straight game they tied an franchise mark with 36 attempts from beyond the arc.\n\nAD\n\nTeam basketball. Just moving the ball. Guys making extra passes is all it is, John Wall said. We got guys who can make some tough ones, but when you're moving the ball and just trusting the offense anything can happen.\n\nBefore the recent uptick, Washington had ranked in the lower third of the NBA in three-point attempts per game. However, if the fluctuating lineups at the end of 2017 serve as an indication of a new emphasis on long-distance shooting, then the Wizards will look more like the team that has averaged 32.0 threes over the past three games.\n\nAD\n\nOn Sunday, reserve forward Mike Scott returned to rhythm after missing one game because of the birth of his daughter and scored 17 points with a trio of threes while playing crucial minutes in the team's small lineup. Scott, a 6-foot-9 forward, even logged some time at center in the fourth quarter and took some lumps against Bulls 7-footer Robin Lopez.\n\nAD\n\nHe's like 7-5. He's doing hook shots for them, Scott said. I can't block that [stuff].\n\nEven so, Scott created offensive mismatches, and while forming an athletic front line with Otto Porter Jr. he helped open the floor for Beal to make three game-changing triples in the quarter.\n\nObviously, when you have a smaller lineup, you have the ability to have more three-point shooters on the floor, Coach Scott Brooks said. A lot of teams are going small, and we're one of them also. It's nothing against our bigs, but we just have to keep adjusting. It could be game-to-game. I thought Ian [Mahinmi] was our main guy to give Houston trouble scoring last game and I thought our small ball gave them trouble scoring, especially in that fourth quarter. Mike can battle their bigger players. I know [Robin] Lopez had a couple of post-ups down low, but that's not how they want to play. Nobody wants to play that way. That's a low-percentage shot throughout the league.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBeal made 7 of 13 attempts from beyond the arc overall and scored a game-high 39 points. For a man who doesn't make resolutions, Beal's plans for 2018 will look much like last year: Keep shooting.\n\nLike I always told you guys from the get-go, I might have games where I don't might make any, and games where I make seven, and games where I make two, Beal said. That doesn't change my confidence. I continue to shoot the same way, with the same mechanics and the same mentality. I believe that every shot is going to go in. I was happy and fortunate that they were falling [Sunday].\n\nRead more:\n\nScott Brooks thinks this Wizards season would make for a thrilling Six Flags ride\n\nAD
Buttigieg proved to be a powerhouse of the middle lane with a Goldilocks hold on being seen as about right between more liberal and conservative wings of the party.\n\nPreliminary exit poll results show Sanders dominated among voters in his core groups of very liberal, less wealthy and very young voters, but faded at the other end of the spectrum. Similarly, Klobuchar was strong with older and more religious voters and more moderate and conservative voters, but dropped off outside those groups.\n\nBy contrast, Buttigieg ran a steady line, never too popular, never far behind. Voters were asked whether four major candidates' positions on the issues were too liberal, not liberal enough or about right. About 7 in 10 voters called Buttigieg about right, more than 20 percentage points higher in that middle ground than anyone else. About half of voters called Sanders too liberal, and roughly 4 in 10 said Warren was too liberal. Four in 10 said Biden was not liberal enough. The exit poll did not ask this question about Klobuchar, who finished stronger than in final pre-primary polls.\n\nButtigieg showed the same steady pattern with voters who were more religious or less religious. Klobuchar narrowly won voters who attend worship services at least occasionally, and Sanders won those who never attend services. But Buttigieg got about 2 in 10 of those who do attend services and those who don't.\n\nWhile Sanders was much more popular among men than women and Klobuchar was considerably stronger among women than men, Buttigieg was about the same with both men and women.\n\nButtigieg got 2 in 10 of voters 45 and older as well as among voters younger than that. Sanders won 4 in 10 of the younger but 1 in 6 of the older, and Klobuchar reversed that with 3 in 10 of the older voters but 1 in 10 of the younger. Buttigieg was about equally popular among voters with or without college degrees, while Sanders and Klobuchar once again swung up and down, with Sanders taking voters without college degrees and Klobuchar leading narrowly among college graduates.\n\nSanders clobbered Klobuchar and other candidates among very liberal voters, getting nearly twice as many as her, while Klobuchar got almost twice as many moderate or conservative voters as Sanders. Buttigieg sat right in the middle, getting over 2 in 10 of both groups.
For one thing, aside from the #DTS (drain the swamp) hashtag, he doesn't actually disagree with Republicans on the substance of the move — the office is unfair, he writes. It's just the timing he seems to take issue with.\n\nAnd some House Republicans say they just weren't prepared for the media storm that hit them when news of the rules change broke.\n\nI don't think that a lot of people believed that the press would be as bad as it was, Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho) told reporters.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCongressional experts say Trump's tweet undeniably had some effect on Republicans' decision to suddenly drop the ethics changes. Draining an independent ethics office of power is not on-brand with Trump's drain the swamp message, a populist platform that proved terribly efficient at vaulting him and Republicans into power in 2017.\n\nIn that sense, Trump's words matter. Ryan credited Trump with helping Republicans sweep Wisconsin at the federal level in November, and he and other Republican leaders know all too well how quickly Trump can turn on them.\n\nTo that point, Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), a recent chairman of the ethics committee embroiled in all this, told reporters that House GOP leadership said Trump's opposition should be a consideration in whether to pull the rule. In a closed-door meeting Tuesday morning, Republicans nearly unanimously decided to pull it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Republicans also have a reputation to uphold beyond the one with their president. In a few weeks, they'll have nearly all the keys to Washington — Congress, the White House, the power to put a conservative on the Supreme Court — and no one else to blame but themselves for anything that goes wrong.\n\nRepublicans have unified control of Washington for the first time since 2006, and they have an ambitious agenda that they want to start working on right away, said Molly Reynolds, a congressional analyst with the Brookings Institution. It's not in their interest to have things in the news that distract from that.\n\nSome members of Congress do have serious issues with the Office of Congressional Ethics, issues they say the media failed to grasp when reporting the changes to the office, said Joe Kasper, chief of staff to Rep. Duncan D. Hunter (R-Calif.).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHunter didn't write the rule change, but he supported it after spending much of this past year under investigation by the office for campaign expenditures for transport for a family pet rabbit, money he said was an oversight and that he quickly repaid but felt the office unfairly pursued.\n\nStill, no one's going to cry for a member of Congress who feels he or she has been unfairly investigated by an ethics committee. And as the public pressure piled on from all sides, and calls poured into Capitol Hill, more and more Republicans started to realize that, even before Trump tweeted his thoughts, the GOP should table the changes (at least for now.)\n\nIt's a hard issue for a lot of members to deal with, Kasper said. And it's an issue that most members want to avoid.\n\nAD\n\nRepublican leaders were already squeamish about the change before the media or Trump knew what was happening. GOP staffers told reporters that when Republicans were discussing it Monday night, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) didn't like the political optics of it. (Ryan ended up sending out a statement Tuesday saying he supported the rules change, just a few minutes after Trump criticized it.)\n\nAD\n\nTrump's tweet may have actually offered Republicans an alternative path to the same destination: just wait for the controversy to blow over. Congressional ethics expert Norman Ornstein, a vocal opponent of the ethics changes, summarized Trump's tweets like this: In effect what he's saying is, 'Hey, don't kill it in broad daylight at noon in Times Square; wait a few months and drag it behind a back alley and nobody will see.' \n\nIn the end, Ornstein says the Republican flip-flop on the ethics change was probably the result of a perfect storm of pressure: Trump's tweets; the sensitivity around their first and potentially narrative-setting day in power; and a stronger-than-expected backlash in the media and from constituents, whose calls flooded Capitol Hill Tuesday.\n\nNot a matter of debate: the fact that this was just a dumb political play for Republicans to pursue on their first day in office.
The enforced inactivity could rattle supply chains for products that are sold in U.S. stores and around the world. Some of Apple's Chinese suppliers, for example, now are scheduled to remain closed until Feb. 10, chief executive Tim Cook told investors Tuesday, adding that executives are working on mitigation plans to make up any expected production loss.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMost analysts remain upbeat, but the economic consequences of the fast-moving virus could snowball if the problem isn't soon contained, some executives said. China is the world's second-largest economy and home to factories that produce machinery, computers, furniture and chemicals for customers on every continent. In one sign of mounting worry, a growing number of major airlines have halted or reduced flights to and from China.\n\nThe health crisis comes just two weeks after the signing of a U.S.-China trade deal eased the uncertainty that had shrouded Chinese export factories for nearly two years. Across the globe, health officials, corporate executives and central bankers on Wednesday struggled to determine the bottom-line impact of the outbreak.\n\nThe situation is really in its early stages. It's very uncertain about how far it will spread and what the macroeconomic effects will be, Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome H. Powell told reporters. I'm not going to speculate about it at this point. We are very carefully monitoring the situation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFinancial markets in the United States and Europe, however, shrugged off virus fears. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day relatively flat, closing at 28,734, up just 11 points or 0.04 percent. Chinese markets are closed for the holiday.\n\nBut in the absence of concrete information from China, many investors appeared to be gambling that the outbreak would prove no more damaging than earlier scares, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) episode of 2003.\n\nWe simply don't know how far, or fast, the novel coronavirus outbreak will ultimately spread, John Higgins, chief markets economist for Capital Economics in London, wrote in a research note. So for the time being, we are assuming that the response … will follow the same pattern observed during and after previous epidemics — that the initial panic will be unwound after a few weeks or months.\n\nChina's economy has roughly quadrupled since 2003, measured in yuan, and now accounts for close to one-third of annual global growth, according to the International Monetary Fund. Beijing's debt also has swelled, perhaps limiting the government's ability to spend its way out of any downturn as it did after SARS. And the global economy is less robust than it was during the earlier epidemic.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt's hard to see what the generator of a significant rebound would be, said one executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preserve relationships with Chinese officials.\n\nThe number of confirmed coronavirus cases in China already has surpassed the 2003 SARS count. With Chinese officials anticipating thousands more patients in the coming days, businesses are confronting difficult decisions.\n\nStarbucks temporarily closed more than half of its stores — or more than 2,000 locations — in China, its largest market outside the United States. Google said it closed its five offices in mainland China, Hong Kong and self-governing Taiwan.\n\nThe airline industry has been a particular focus. White House officials have been meeting with airline executives about the virus, according to one person briefed on the talks. The White House has told airline executives that it is considering suspending all flights between the United States and China.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Wednesday, American Airlines and British Airways reduced direct flights to and from the country, joining a growing cluster of international carriers suspending service. Lufthansa canceled all flights to and from China until Feb. 9, though the German airline said it would continue service to Hong Kong.\n\nAmerican, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines extended their change-fee waivers through the end of February.\n\nPassenger air traffic was about 35 percent lower at the SARS outbreak's worst point for airlines in the Asia-Pacific region, according to the International Air Transport Association. And for 2003 as a whole, the association estimated that SARS cost those carriers 8 percent of their revenue, or roughly $6 billion at the time.\n\nAD\n\nChinese sales account for about 10 percent of the global revenue of Starbucks. Chief executive Kevin Johnson said he had planned to raise the company's financial forecast for the year on Tuesday but decided not to because of the virus. Company shares fell more than 2 percent.\n\nWe're now managing a very dynamic situation in China. … We realize this is a temporary issue we've got to deal with, Johnson told CNBC.\n\nAD\n\nMcDonald's, KFC and Apple have also announced closures, which will probably dent their financial results. Walt Disney said it would temporarily close its Disneyland and Disneytown parks in Shanghai. Ikea said it would close nearly half of its 30 Chinese locations.\n\nAD\n\nSmaller manufacturers that lack multinationals' global support staffs are scrambling to assess the threat to their operations. They are freaking out, said Dan Harris, a Seattle-based attorney whose clients operate in China. It's extremely difficult to plan because nobody knows what's going to happen.\n\nFinding alternatives to Chinese suppliers cannot be done quickly or easily, as companies that tried to escape President Trump's tariffs learned. Other countries such as Vietnam, Thailand or Malaysia lack China's mix of qualified suppliers, trained workers and modern logistics.\n\nAD\n\nIf this virus is not contained within the next few weeks, some companies are going to die because of this, Harris said.\n\nAD\n\nTrump's tariffs prompted many companies to begin looking for replacement suppliers, according to Jake Parker, senior vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council. Coupled with the continuing tariff uncertainty, the virus has triggered an increased sensitivity to the risk exposure of the Chinese market, he added.\n\nSome industries could be especially hard-hit. China accounts for about 80 percent of raw pharmaceutical ingredients sold to manufacturers, according to specialists. Drug manufacturers and the Food and Drug Administration have yet to report any shortages, but the potential for such issues exists if the crisis persists.\n\n``The coronavirus is a warning shot across the bow that we have to rethink and diversify the sourcing of the core raw materials, chemical intermediates and active ingredients for our generic drugs, said Rosemary Gibson, author of China Rx and a senior adviser at the Hastings Center, a nonprofit bioethics research institute.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSwitching to an alternative supplier in India would not solve the problem because Indian drugmakers depend on China for their raw ingredients.\n\nMost factories and businesses in China are closed as the nation celebrates the new year. For now, the most visible disruption has been to consumer-oriented industries such as travel.\n\nThis year, about 3.1 million cars and trucks are expected to come off the assembly lines in Hubei province and nearby Shanghai, said Carla Bailo, president of the Center for Automotive Research. Those vehicles account for about 12 percent of China's output. But if manufacturers in Hubei and Shanghai — Honda, Toyota, Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi and Volkswagen among them — delayed operations for a five-day workweek, that could result in 150,000 lost units, Bailo said.
The frigid spell was particularly noteworthy for occurring when the planet is steadily warming because of the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Climate warming from the increase in these heat-trapping gases does not eliminate cold waves, but it tends to weaken them.\n\nAD\n\nAn international group of scientists has concluded the recent piercing chill was 15 times less likely than it would've been 100 years ago, when temperatures in such cold waves averaged about 4 degrees lower.\n\nAD\n\nThe cold was highly unusual in the current climate, wrote the scientists who analyzed the temperatures.\n\nTemperatures were close to 25 degrees colder than normal in a zone that included Minneapolis, Detroit, Buffalo and Boston over the period from Dec. 26 to Jan. 7. Boston's high temperature did not escape the teens for seven days, tying its longest streak in recorded history.\n\nGiven how much the climate has warmed, the scientists called the recent cold exceptional. Yet, as frigid as it was, the scientists found that there were many similar or colder two-week periods in that region in earlier periods. They made clear that, on balance, cold outbreaks like these are getting less frequent due to global warming, but cold waves still occur somewhere in North America almost every winter.\n\nTheir finding that the intensity of Arctic cold is easing in a warming world is supported by many other studies. For example, Jonathan Martin, a meteorology researcher at the University of Wisconsin, has documented considerable shrinkage of the pool of frigid air surrounding the Arctic in recent decades.\n\nThe scientists involved in the analysis rejected the hypothesis that climate change is making these cold extremes more likely by warming the Arctic more than the mid-latitudes and altering the atmosphere's circulation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe do not find any evidence for an intensification of these types of cold waves due to the Arctic warming faster than the midlatitudes, they concluded. In fact, they said, less Arctic air is coming south than it used to.\n\nThe rapid-turnaround analysis was published as part of the World Weather Attribution project, in which — in a matter of days — scientists assess whether a recent weather event was made more or less likely by climate change. The project is a partnership of Climate Central, a nonprofit science communication organization in Princeton, N.J., and several international research institutions.\n\nEven as the planet warms overall, some scientists who were not involved in this analysis have published studies that show climate change may be altering the atmosphere's steering currents in ways to concentrate punishing cold in certain locations at certain times.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDaniel Swain, a researcher at UCLA, published a study late in 2017 that showed a warm-West, cold-East weather pattern over the United States has become more frequent in recent decades. A subsequent study linked the prevalence of this pattern to Arctic sea-ice loss driven by climate change.\n\nGenerally, a growing body of literature has suggested that as the Earth warms and Arctic ice melts, the jet stream may slow down and become more erratic, which could lead to pockets of extreme winter conditions, even as most places thaw.\n\nMichael Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University, described the recent winter weirdness as in no way evidence against climate change. In fact, he wrote, it is an example of precisely the sort of extreme weather we expect because of climate change.

Alas, there is real change on the horizon. Keep that in mind, especially over the next 24 hours or so, while we're still dealing with some of the most punishing winter weather we see around here of late. Tomorrow's still cold, but more typical stuff. Then we really start to notice a difference.\n\nAD\n\nGet our daily forecasts on your Amazon Alexa device. Click here to find out how.\n\nAD\n\nToday (Saturday): It's yet another about as cold as it gets around here kind of day. It is also the last of the worst of this stretch. Winds stay up, and temperatures struggle. We'll be playing with wind chills near and a little below zero for much of the day. It is at least very sunny! That doesn't help temperatures much, as they reach the upper teens to near 20. Winds are out of the northwest about 10 to 20 mph, with gusts near or past 30 mph. Dulles stands a chance of breaking its record low maximum for the day of 20. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nAD\n\nTonight: Skies remain clear, and winds finally die off. This is a recipe for reaching for the very coldest of depths. The one question mark might be the fact that cold air is beginning to move away aloft, which may limit lows. Even so, near zero to 10 should do it most spots. There is a better chance someone gets below zero as well, especially in valleys with snow cover.

I never said we're doing it that quickly, but we're decimating ISIS, Trump told reporters Sunday morning as he headed for Camp David. With that being said, we're pulling out of Syria. But … we won't be finally pulled out until ISIS is gone.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat's a big but. It's also at odds with Trump's initial announcement that the U.S. would depart within 30 days and that the Islamic State has been defeated, not decimated.\n\nMeanwhile, visiting Jerusalem to reassure Israeli leaders on Sunday, White House national security adviser John Bolton acknowledged that pockets of the Islamic State remain undefeated and argued that a quick pullout could endanger U.S. forces. He pledged that the Kurds in Syria would be protected and added that the defense of Israel and other friends in the region is absolutely assured.\n\nThe timetable flows from the policy decisions that we need to implement, Bolton said during a news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nNational security advisor John Bolton said on Jan. 6 the withdrawal of troops depends on a guarantee that Turkey will not target Kurdish forces. (Reuters)\n\n-- Two fresh data points from Sunday show that the Islamic State, while in retreat, has not been vanquished.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n1. A missile attack by the Islamic State wounded two British soldiers and killed at least one Kurdish fighter they were with in eastern Syria, per the AP. It's the first known casualty by coalition forces since Trump announced the pullout.\n\n2. Kurdish forces in Syria said Sunday that they had captured two American citizens hiding out in the country's final Islamic State stronghold, per Louisa Loveluck and Erin Cunningham. In a statement, the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, identified the detainees as Warren Christopher Clark, 34, and Zaid Abed al-Hamid, 35. … In a sign of how far some of the group's members had traveled as their battlefields shrank, the SDF said Sunday that Clark and Hamid had been captured hundreds of miles from Mosul, in the Hajin area of eastern Syria. … Clark was a Texas resident and worked as a substitute teacher in the Houston area before traveling to Saudi Arabia and Turkey to teach English … He reportedly converted to Islam in 2004 and later became radicalized online.\n\n-- Moreover, the U.S.-led coalition appears to have ramped up active military operations in the wake of Trump's announcement. Between December 16 and December 29, US-led coalition military forces conducted 469 air and artillery strikes targeting ISIS in Syria, CNN reports. The strikes were carried out against ISIS fighters, buildings, oil facilities, vehicles, tunnels, weapons caches and improvised explosive device facilities … Prior to that period the coalition had been averaging about 200 strikes per week in Syria as fighting around the ISIS-held town of Hajin ramped up.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n-- Among the policy decisions still to be made is what to do about the tens of thousands of Syrian Kurdish fighters that U.S. forces have trained, armed and advised to carry out the ground war against the Islamic State, Karen DeYoung and Karoun Demirjian report. While Trump has expressed confidence that Turkey, which controls its own Syrian force opposed to both the Kurds and to President Bashar al-Assad, is capable of picking up the remaining fight against the Islamic State, Pentagon and State Department officials question Turkish priorities and capabilities. … Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have stated repeatedly in recent months that driving Iran from Syria was also an objective for both the United States and Israel. But Trump appeared to indicate Sunday that both Iran and Russia, whose forces in Syria back Assad, were potential U.S. allies against the Islamic State.\n\nDuring a Jan. 2 Cabinet meeting, President Trump said his decision to pull the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal had significantly weakened Iran. (The Washington Post)\n\n-- These are the kinds of significant questions that would typically be hashed out during an interagency process before a public announcement. A review of the timeline illustrates how erratic the Trump administration's rhetoric has been:\n\nDec. 14: What triggered all this was a phone call from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Trump was briefed before to warn the Turkish leader not to invade Syria, as he had been threatening to do, per David Ignatius. But Trump instead told Erdogan: 'You know what? It's yours. I'm leaving.'\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDec. 19: Trump announces the withdrawal. Our boys, our young women, our men, they're all coming back, and they're coming back now, he said in a video posted to Twitter. We won.\n\nWe have defeated ISIS in Syria, Trump added, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency.\n\nDec. 20: Jim Mattis resigned as defense secretary during what one senior administration official described that day as a disagreement in the Oval Office, in which Mattis sought to persuade the president to stand down on the Syria withdrawal but was rejected.\n\nGetting out of Syria was no surprise, Trump tweeted. I've been campaigning on it for years, and six months ago, when I very publicly wanted to do it, I agreed to stay longer. … Time to come home.\n\nAD\n\nIndeed, Trump had declared extemporaneously in March during a speech in Ohio: We'll be coming out of Syria, like, very soon. Let the other people take care of it now! Then he backed off in the face of resistance from aides and the brass — just like he might be doing again.\n\nAD\n\nDec. 24: Trump declared that Saudi Arabia has now agreed to spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild Syria, instead of the United States. The Saudis responded that they had not made any financial pledges since August, when the State Department announced that Riyadh had committed $100 million to a stabilization fund.\n\nDec. 26: Trump told reporters on Air Force One during his flight to Iraq that he would reject any request from generals to again extend his deadline for pulling out. They said again, recently, 'Can we have more time?' Trump said of U.S. generals. I said: 'Nope! You can't have any more time! You've had enough time!' We've knocked them out.\n\nAD\n\nSpeaking to the troops, Trump criticized their commanders for failing to meet the previous deadlines he set. We're no longer the suckers, folks, the president said.\n\nAD\n\nDec. 30: Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters after eating lunch with Trump at the White House that the president reassured him the Syria decision was more of a pause situation than a withdrawal.\n\nDec. 31: ISIS is mostly gone, Trump tweeted. We're slowly sending our troops back home.\n\nJan. 3: Trump said during a Cabinet meeting that Iran's leadership can do what they want in Syria.\n\nJan. 4: In response to reports that Trump extended his deadline for pulling out from 30 days to four months, one of four senior administration officials speaking to reporters during a background briefing said, We have no timeline for our forces to withdraw from Syria.\n\nPresident Trump defended his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria during an unannounced visit to Iraq on Dec. 26. (The Washington Post)\n\n-- All these recalibrations have underscored just how rash that initial announcement was. Trump's words pack less of a punch when allies and adversaries alike take them less seriously. President Barack Obama also learned this the hard way when he said Assad using chemical weapons would be a red line and then didn't forcefully respond when he did.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n-- Cleanup on Aisle Nine: Senior administration officials are fanning out across the Middle East this week on a handholding mission to reassure anxious allies. Bolton will visit Turkey on Tuesday. Pompeo has stops scheduled in eight countries: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Egypt and Jordan.\n\n-- For his part, Trump continues to insist on unflinching loyalty. The chief of staff at the Pentagon has been forced out of his post because of White House concerns about his close ties to Mattis, the Wall Street Journal's Gordon Lubold reports: The Pentagon announced that Kevin Sweeney, a retired Navy rear admiral who had worked closely with Mr. Mattis, had stepped down. … Mr. Sweeney had worked alongside Mr. Mattis at several points during his career, including when Mr. Mattis was still in uniform … The bond was a source of concern to the White House, the U.S. officials said, adding the appointment of Pat Shanahan as acting secretary by [Trump] last month was seen as an opportunity to remove Mr. Sweeney. …\n\nMr. Sweeney had expressed a desire to stay on at the Pentagon as recently as last week, per the Journal. Some officials believed he would provide continuity during the transition from Mr. Mattis to Mr. Shanahan. But, under pressure from the White House, Mr. Shanahan informed Mr. Sweeney on Friday that he was removing him as chief of staff Friday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\n-- Bohemian Rhapsody and Green Book took home surprise honors at a Golden Globes ceremony marked by a Hollywood consensus on the need for industry change, television critic Hank Stuever reports. The stars are bored. It's their own fault, really, and it's mostly a good thing: They're woke and on board with Hollywood's attempts at a corrective course on diversity and equal rights, which is why Sunday night's telecast of the 76th annual Golden Globe Awards on NBC lacked the boozy, loosey-goosey tension of its renowned past. But is that really such a sacrifice, in exchange for solidarity?

In the television categories, Golden Globes went to FX's 'The Americans' (best drama, at long last); Netflix's 'The Kominsky Method' (best comedy, a very Golden Globes-kind of choice); and FX's 'The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story' (best limited series).

(AP)\n\nLawmakers from both parties discussed on Jan. 6 how a deal could be reached to end the government shutdown. (Luis Velarde/The Washington Post)\n\nSHUTDOWN LATEST:\n\n-- The Trump administration and Democratic leaders are still at an impasse over the border wall — signaling an indefinite continuation of the partial government shutdown that is now in its third week. Robert Costa, Juliet Eilperin, Damian Paletta and Nick Miroff report: As agencies sought to deal with cascading problems across the federal bureaucracy, acting White House budget director Russell T. Vought sent congressional leaders a letter detailing the administration's latest offer to end the shutdown. It demanded $5.7 billion 'for construction of a steel barrier for the Southwest border' but also proposed 'an additional $800 million to address urgent humanitarian needs' and unaccompanied migrant children arriving at the border. The administration has also signaled it would be willing to restore some version of an Obama-era program that allowed children in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to apply for refugee resettlement in the United States ...\n\nBut a border wall is 'central to any strategy,' Vought wrote, and Democrats — who have said the wall should not be tied to an agreement to reopen the government — remained skeptical of any overtures by the president, suggesting that there is no end in sight to the shutdown, which has entered its third week. A Democratic official familiar with the meeting said no progress was made over the weekend, in large part because the White House hasn't been forthcoming about how the money would be used or why the request is for so much more than the administration sought only a few months ago.\n\n-- Trump reiterated his threat to declare a national emergency to fund a border wall. Robert Costa, Felicia Sonmez and Nick Miroff report: Trump also said Sunday that he understood the predicament facing hundreds of thousands of federal workers who are not receiving their paychecks. 'I can relate, and I'm sure the people who are on the receiving end will make adjustments; they always do,' Trump said. He claimed that 'many of those people agree with what I'm doing': refusing to reopen the government without obtaining funding for his long-promised border wall. And he further backed away from the notion of a concrete wall, telling reporters that he has informed his staff to now say 'steel barrier.' \n\n-- White House officials have been looking into the possibility of declaring a national emergency at the border for weeks now, according to Bloomberg News's Justin Sink and Jennifer Jacobs. Some advisers close to Trump are recommending that he declare a national emergency, despite wide recognition that it would be immediately challenged in court. … But Trump's consideration of such an extraordinary step indicates that some in the White House see the gambit as the president's lone way to salvage his wall pledge as the consequences of the shutdown begin to amplify and talks with Democrats fall flat.\n\n-- Trump's press secretary left open the possibility of declaring a national emergency in a Fox News interview. From Politico's Victoria Guida: [Sarah] Sanders said Trump 'is prepared to do what it takes to protect our borders to protect the people of this country.' 'We're looking at exploring every option available that the president has,' she said. 'Whatever action he takes will certainly be lawful.' She also argued that the president isn't 'holding anybody hostage' by not signing legislation that would fund government agencies other than the Department of Homeland Security. 'He knows it's better if they can focus on getting all these packages done at once,' Sanders said.\n\n-- Republican Sen. Susan Collins (Maine), who is up for reelection next year, said the Senate should vote on the funding bills passed in the House. From the Hill's Brett Samuels: Collins said on NBC's 'Meet the Press' that she understands [Mitch McConnell] is in a difficult spot because the president may not sign bills passed by the Democratic-held House, but pressed for a vote to reopen agencies like Agriculture, Interior, Transportation and Housing and Urban Development. 'I'm frustrated in the situation that we've gotten to this point where both sides appear to be intransigent,' Collins said. 'It is not a sign of weakness to figure out a middle ground. I think that both sides need to indicate a willingness to listen and to compromise.'\n\nPeople are streaming into national parks to find trash cans overflowing and restrooms locked. Volunteers are stepping in to stop conditions from deteriorating. (Luis Velarde, Juca Favela/The Washington Post)\n\n-- Meanwhile, the effects of the shutdown are mounting. From Costa, Eilperin, Paletta and Miroff: The Department of Housing and Urban Development sent letters to 1,500 landlords Friday as part of a last-minute effort to prevent the eviction of thousands of tenants. A lot of those tenants live in units covered by a HUD program that many agency officials didn't realize had expired on Jan. 1 and that they are now unable to renew. … Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service officials are trying to determine whether they will be able to pay tax refunds next month, despite the fact that they said last year they would be prohibited from doing so in the event of a government shutdown.\n\n-- The National Park Service has decided to use entrance fees to pay for expanded operations at popular sites, an unprecedented step that some call illegal. Juliet Eilperin reports: Under a memorandum signed Saturday by the Interior Department's acting secretary, David Bernhardt ... park managers will be permitted to bring on additional staff to clean restrooms, haul trash, patrol the parks and open areas that have been shut during the more-than-two-week budget impasse. In a statement Sunday, National Park Service Deputy Director P. Daniel Smith acknowledged that the administration's practice of keeping parks open but understaffed has become unsustainable at some of its most beloved sites. … Congressional Democrats and some park advocates question whether the park-fee move is legal, because the fees that parks collect under the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act are expressly designated to support visitor services instead of operations and basic maintenance.\n\n-- Small towns with federal workers are seeing the strain on local businesses. Heather May, Annie Gowen and Joel Achenbach report: Many of the affected federal workers — including 10,000 people in Utah, 6,200 in West Virginia and 5,500 in Alabama — have salaries far below the average $85,000 for government employees. But those paychecks drive local economies, and workers are starting to make tough choices about how to spend them — eating out less, limiting travel and shopping at food pantries instead of grocery stores — creating a ripple effect through the neighborhoods and towns where they live.\n\n-- Millions of food-stamp recipients could have their benefits disrupted if the shutdown drags past January. CBS News's Grace Segers reports: The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP at the federal level, is one of the agencies unfunded during the partial government shutdown. Although SNAP is automatically renewed, it has not been allocated funding from Congress beyond January. Congress has appropriated $3 billion in emergency funds for SNAP distribution, but that would not cover all of February's obligations.\n\n-- Some federal prison employees expressed frustration about serving meals of steak and Cornish hen to inmates as they work without pay. Cleve R. Wootson Jr. reports: For inmates at [Florida's Coleman Federal Correctional Complex], New Year's Day lunch was grilled steak, steamed rice with gravy, black-eyed peas, green beans, macaroni and cheese, a choice of garlic biscuits or whole wheat bread and an assortment of holiday pies. The feast was served by not-particularly-festive prison guards and workers who have no idea when they will receive their next paycheck — but who have to come to work anyway because they work in crucial public safety jobs.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren campaigned in northwest Iowa as part of her inaugural appearances in the first presidential caucus state. (Alice Li/The Washington Post)\n\n2020 WATCH:\n\n-- Joe Biden is nearing a final decision on a 2020 presidential run. The New York Times's Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns report: [Biden] has told allies he is skeptical the other Democrats eyeing the White House can defeat [Trump], an assessment that foreshadows a clash between the veteran Washington insider and the more liberal and fresh-faced contenders for the party's 2020 nomination. … Yet Mr. Biden's skepticism about the field could alienate female and minority voters who are excited that several women and African-Americans are expected to run. … More broadly, debate around Mr. Biden's possible candidacy illustrates the dueling visions in the party and particularly the divisions between its pragmatic and liberal wing. … But Mr. Biden has indicated that he is leaning toward running and will most likely make a decision within the next two weeks.\n\n-- Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) zeroed in on her 2020 message during an Iowa visit as she conspicuously avoided using Trump's name. Annie Linskey and Chelsea Janes report: She aimed directly at voters tempted by [Trump's] angry populism in 2016 but avoided mentions of Trump himself almost entirely. … For Warren, virtually every position she advocated was, in policy terms, a repudiation of the president and the course he has set for the nation in his first two years. That was true from specifics — her demand that presidential candidates release their taxes, which the president has refused to do — to the generic — her repeated lament that the middle class has been hollowed out as economic and political fairness has been lost.\n\n-- Trump has become the silence between the notes of Warren's speeches, which portray an economic system that has been rigged, for decades, to favor the wealthy, David Weigel writes. When Warren talks about the fights she's been through, she focuses on the 'million dollars a day' that bank lobbyists spent, unsuccessfully, to stop the creation of the financial-industry regulatory agency she proposed and initially ran, and on her evisceration of former Wells Fargo chief executive John Stumpf, which was a factor in his resignation. It's a return to the rhetoric that worked so well for her in 2012, affirming her status as an icon of the left.\n\n-- In a blog Warren wrote between 2005 and 2008, the then-Harvard law professor criticized Biden for a vote he cast in the Senate. NBC News's Jack Bohrer reports: In March of 2006, Warren wrote that Biden's 2005 vote in favor of the bankruptcy bill that spurred her foray into blogging made him part of 'a bi-partisan coalition to prefer powerful corporation [sic] over hard-working families.' 'For years, Senator Joe Biden vied with Republican Senators Charles Grassley and [Orrin] Hatch for head cheerleader for this bill,' Warren wrote. 'Even as he tried to position his national image as a strong supporter of women, Senator Biden was twisting arms to get the bankruptcy bill through Congress.'\n\n-- Warren's Senate colleagues are not jumping to endorse her — or any of her prospective challengers. Politico's Burgess Everett reports: Even Sen. Ed Markey isn't ready to endorse his fellow Massachusetts Democrat, at least not yet. 'When she is moving forward, we're going to be talking,' Markey said as he prepared for Warren's swearing in to another term in the Senate. 'I've just got to get today done.' Warren's hard-edged brand of progressive politics has annoyed some of her colleagues at times, but the lack of support from her caucus isn't personal. With a wide open Democratic primary, including perhaps a half-dozen of Warren's own colleagues set to join the race, there's no sense in getting out ahead of anyone, according to a dozen Democratic senators from across the ideological spectrum.\n\n-- Trump's campaign is devoting extensive resources to ensure the 2020 Republican convention is a smooth advertisement for his reelection. Politico's Alex Isenstadt reports: The president's reelection campaign is intent on avoiding the kind of circus that unfolded on the convention floor in 2016, when Never Trump Republicans loudly protested his nomination before a national TV audience. … For Trump adversaries, the possibilities for mischief in Charlotte would be endless. They could attempt headline-grabbing floor protests, demand prime-time speaking slots for presidential detractors, or even wage a long-shot bid to nominate someone else. The campaign is so focused on ensuring the convention is a smooth-running affair devoid of presidential critics that it's building out an entire wing of the campaign devoted solely to the endeavor. The initiative appears to be unique in both how early it's been launched and how far-reaching it is.\n\nThe U.S. military said on Jan. 6 it had killed Yemeni militant Jamal al-Badawi, a suspected planner of the deadly bombing of a Navy destroyer, the USS Cole. (Reuters)\n\nTHE NEW WORLD ORDER:\n\n-- Trump tweeted that the al-Qaeda operative accused of organizing the 2000 bombing on the USS Cole, Jamal al-Badawi, was killed in a U.S. airstrike. Felicia Sonmez reports: U.S. Central Command, which oversees military operations in the Middle East, confirmed Badawi's death Sunday afternoon. … Seventeen American sailors were killed and more than 40 were injured in the Oct. 12, 2000, attack, in which al-Qaeda suicide bombers pulled up to the refueling destroyer in an explosives-laden boat and blasted a hole in its hull.\n\n-- With Trump seemingly offering to play the role of mediator, Serbia and Kosovo appear to inching closer to peace talks. Anne Gearan reports: Kosovo President Hashim Thaci made a previously unreported diplomatic trip to Berlin last month, where he met with U.S. Ambassador Richard Grenell, a Trump confidant. Thaci pledged then that he would reverse course on punitive tariffs imposed on all Serb goods. … Serbia has never recognized Kosovo's independence and has warned of an armed intervention over the latest disagreements. … Trump sent personal letters to the leaders of both countries last month, urging them to return to peace talks and offering the possibility of a joint White House invitation.\n\n-- Trump's trade war is increasingly disrupting U.S. factory operations as more firms contemplate moving elsewhere. The New York Times's Peter S. Goodman reports: In the United States, factories that buy steel and aluminum — now more expensive — are struggling to pass on extra costs to their customers. Some are losing orders to overseas competitors that can buy metal free of American tariffs. Companies that import electronics and other parts are scrambling to remain profitable while exploring alternatives, such as moving plants beyond reach of the duties. … The tariffs have been sold to Americans as a means of forcing multinational companies to make their products in the United States, abandoning China, Mexico and other low-cost centers of industry. But the tariffs are threatening jobs that are already here.\n\n-- A South Korean newspaper reported that Trump and Kim Jong Un may meet in Hanoi for a second nuclear summit. From Bloomberg News's Jihye Lee: U.S. officials have met their North Korean counterparts in Hanoi for discussions to adjust scheduling for the talks, [the South Korean newspaper Munhwa Ilbo] said, citing high-level diplomatic sources in Seoul and Washington it did not identify. … Vietnam is a long-standing ally of Pyongyang that has good relations with Washington. Speculation about the country's prospects as a summit site grew following North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho's visit there from Nov. 29-Dec. 2.\n\n-- A top royal adviser Saudi officials have named as a key suspect in the killing of Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi has dropped out of sight. Kareem Fahim reports: So in the seven weeks since [Saud al-Qahtani] was placed under investigation, only rumors have filled the silence. He was spotted recently in the coastal city of Jiddah, a resident said, and in the offices of the royal court here in the capital, according to a person who works with the government. Other accounts put Qahtani, once a top aide to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, in a remote corner of the kingdom, laying low. The government's treatment of Qahtani is being closely watched in Washington and other foreign capitals as a test of whether Saudi Arabia is sincere about prosecuting everyone found to be involved in Khashoggi's killing, including senior officials.\n\n-- Scientists say the high-pitched noise that diplomats in Havana complained about before displaying mysterious neurological symptoms may have been caused by one of the region's insects. The Guardian's Ian Sample reports: [A] fresh analysis of the audio recording has revealed what scientists in the UK and the US now believe is the true source of the piercing din: it is the song of the Indies short-tailed cricket, known formally as Anurogryllus celerinictus. … The identification of the sound source does not mean that an attack of some sort did not happen, but it casts doubt over the sound being responsible for the diplomats' health problems.\n\n-- British Prime Minister Theresa May urged Parliament members to back her Brexit deal when it comes up for another vote this month. Politico's Laura Kayali reports: She refused to rule out repeated votes on the same deal if she loses the first time round. … 'Don't let the search for the perfect Brexit be the enemy of the good,' May said, a reference to the criticisms of hard-line Brexiteers and EU supporters such as former European Commissioner Peter Mandelson, who argue the deal undermines British sovereignty and should be rejected. … May slammed MPs asking for a second referendum. 'It would divide our country and we wouldn't be able to organize a referendum before March 29 [when Brexit will take effect],' she said, pointing out it would therefore require an extension of Article 50 (the treaty article allowing withdrawals from the EU).\n\n-- If Britain leaves the European Union without a deal, it could reverberate across other E.U. countries, including the Netherlands. Michael Birnbaum reports: The Netherlands — Britain's main trading partner on mainland Europe — is among the most-prepared for the possibility that Britons will leave the E.U. on March 29 without a deal to manage the withdrawal. Leaders here fear that the best efforts of a nation that loves to be prepared may not be enough to safeguard against the mess. And Britain's other trading partnerships in Europe could be even worse off. … Irish lawmakers may have to set aside all other business this month to pass 45 pieces of emergency legislation aimed at mitigating the impact of Brexit. France is building roads, warehouses and checkpoints near its ports in preparation for new customs controls.\n\nTHERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\n\n-- Democratic operatives with ties to a disinformation campaign in last year's Alabama Senate race, which was inspired by Russian tactics, are attempting to distance themselves from the effort. Craig Timberg, Tony Romm, Aaron C. Davis and Elizabeth Dwoskin report: Recent revelations about Project Birmingham … have shocked Democrats in Alabama and Washington. And news of the effort has underscored the warnings of disinformation experts who long have said that threats to honest, transparent political discourse in the age of social media are as likely to be domestic as foreign. … But all those who have acknowledged playing a role in Project Birmingham have denied knowing the full extent of the activities described in [a document on the operation]. Project Birmingham got its funding from Internet billionaire Reid Hoffman, who emerged as a leading underwriter of Democratic causes after the 2016 election. While acknowledging his money ended up paying for Project Birmingham, Hoffman said he did not know how his funds were used until details began to emerge in the New York Times and The Post.\n\n-- One Facebook page tied to the disinformation campaign impersonated Baptist prohibitionists who allegedly supported Republican Roy Moore's candidacy. The New York Times's Scott Shane and Alan Blinder report: The 'Dry Alabama' Facebook page, illustrated with stark images of car wrecks and videos of families ruined by drink, had a blunt message: Alcohol is the devil's work, and the state should ban it entirely. Along with a companion Twitter feed, the Facebook page appeared to be the work of Baptist teetotalers who supported [Moore]. 'Pray for Roy Moore,' one tweet exhorted. In fact, the Dry Alabama campaign, not previously reported, was the stealth creation of progressive Democrats who were out to defeat Mr. Moore — the second such secret effort to be unmasked.\n\n-- Nancy Pelosi downplayed the possibility that House Democrats would attempt to impeach Trump without bipartisan support to do so after hearing the findings from Robert Mueller's investigation. Brian Fung reports: Democrats are unlikely to pursue a path of impeachment without Republican backing, Pelosi hinted. That could hinge significantly on whether Mueller's probe uncovers concrete evidence of wrongdoing. 'If and when the time comes for impeachment,' she said, 'it will have to be something that has such a crescendo in a bipartisan way.' Pelosi's remarks were echoed Sunday by House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), who said calls for Trump's impeachment were a 'distraction' from Democrats' 'substantive agenda.'\n\n-- House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said he wants to share the panel's testimony transcripts with Mueller to determine whether any witnesses have committed perjury. I don't want to go into enumerating particularly who I have concerns about, but I do have concerns about certainly multiple witnesses, Schiff said on CNN. Bob Mueller, by virtue of the fact that he has been able to conduct this investigation using tools that we didn't have in our committee, meaning compulsion, is in a better position to determine, OK, who was telling the truth? Who wasn't? And who can I make a case against in terms of perjury?

by Steven Rogelberg, expected Jan. 2\n\nIf one of your New Year's resolutions is to spend less time sitting in or leading useless meetings, this book is for you. Rogelberg, a researcher who studies teamwork and meetings at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, offers evidence-based ideas for how long meetings should be (about 5 to 10 percent shorter in length than your initial estimate), how to make agendas more effective (move status updates to the end) and how to improve idea generation (consider a silent reading period for workers to consider a new proposal and then have a discussion rather than listen to a long presentation).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nby Cal Newport, expected Feb. 5\n\nA follow-up to Newport's first book (Deep Work) on the digital communication distractions people experience at work, Digital Minimalism looks at the tyranny of online social media, mobile phones and technological interruptions in our personal lives. Newport, an associate professor of computer science at Georgetown University who has written several books related to work, technology and study habits, suggests that people need to take more comprehensive steps than just, say, not keeping their phones by their beds at night. Instead, they need a full-fledged philosophy of technological use, opting out of any optional online activities for 30 days and then slowly adding back the ones they need in a sustainable way.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nby James O'Toole, expected Feb. 26\n\nO'Toole, an emeritus professor at the University of Southern California's business school, shares the stories of more than two dozen business entrepreneurs — some famous, some little known — who tried to incorporate socially responsible business practices into how they ran their companies. Yet the result is not a hagiography lauding the careers of these enlightened capitalists, which includes everyone from chocolate magnate Milton Hershey to cosmetics and skin care founder Anita Roddick, but a cautionary look at how so many of their sustainable practices were cut short by bankruptcies, acquisitions or unwilling successors — and what other executives can learn from them. At a time when more and more consumers expect business to benefit the greater good, the book is timely. It asks big questions like whether socially virtuous business tactics are actually compatible with shareholder capitalism, and, as he writes in the preface, what may matter most: Whether in the collective judgment of corporate executives, executives actually believe it is possible — or sensible — to try to do good as they seek to do well.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nby Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, expected March 12\n\nA provocative title that began life as a Harvard Business Review article — and has grown to become one of the publication's most-read stories online — this upcoming book looks at how to spot incompetent leaders and identify good ones, as well as why companies so often mix up the two. Chamorro-Premuzic, who is chief talent scientist at ManpowerGroup and teaches at University College London and Columbia University, explores our inability to distinguish between confidence and competence, how narcissism affects the gender imbalance in leadership, the advantages he says women generally have with traits like emotional intelligence and how organizations can better evaluate potential and coach and develop leaders.\n\nAD\n\nby Evan Thomas, expected March 19\n\nBusiness leaders often turn to examples from history for inspiration — bullet points from business consultants can only take people so far. For those readers, this biography of former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor — the first woman on the highest court — by journalist Evan Thomas is unlikely to disappoint. Before joining the Court, O'Connor became the first female majority leader of a state senate and then served time as a judge on the Arizona State Court of Appeals. The book's synopsis suggests that it offers inspiration for women and men who want to be leaders and be first in their own lives — who want to learn when to walk away and when to stand their ground.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nby Safi Bahcall, expected March 19\n\nBahcall, a physicist and biotech entrepreneur who worked on President Barack Obama's council of science advisers in 2011, uses the science of phase transitions to explain how teams or organizations with a mission begin rejecting wild new ideas and suggests ways to better nurture those crazy notions. Stanford professor Bob Sutton said in an email recommending the book that it is sort of physics meets history meets innovation meets management and organizational design, as well as that Bahcall's argument that structure is not appreciated enough and culture is appreciated too much is, I think, right.\n\nAD\n\nby Marcus Buckingham and Ashley Goodall, expected April 2\n\nBuckingham, the management guru whose books about finding your strengths at work have become best-sellers, and Goodall, an executive at Cisco, argue that several of the basic truths of the workplace today are not really true, but lies — or at least distorted conventions, wrong assumptions or under-analyzed habits. Prompted by a Harvard Business Review article that condemned the traditional performance review, their upcoming book busts open and calls out ingrained ideas such as people can reliably rate other people and people care which company they work for, making it a guide that could help you rethink your organization's thinking.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nby Melinda Gates, expected April 23\n\nPart memoir, part call to action, part profile of women she's met through her work as co-chair of the Gates Foundation, Gates' debut book is an inspirational look at the need to empower women to make change in the world. The book is organized by issue (family planning, education for girls, child marriage, women in the workplace), and Gates weaves in personal stories of her own life and tales of women she's met along the way to describe why lifting up women is the key to lasting change. As she writes in her introduction: I quickly realized —because I was quickly told — that it wasn't enough to speak up for family planning, or even for each of the issues I've just named. I had to speak up for women. And I soon saw that if we are going to take our place as equals with men, it won't come from winning our rights one by one or step by step; we'll win our rights in waves as we become empowered.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nby David Epstein, expected May 28\n\nIn a world where expertise feels less and less valued, it may seem heretical to suggest that generalists can win out over specialists. But Epstein, a ProPublica journalist and author of The Sports Gene, which examined the nature vs. nurture debate on athletic performance, writes that in most fields — especially complex and unpredictable ones — generalists are better positioned to excel. Relying on scientific research, Epstein examined successful athletes, artists, musicians, inventors, forecasters and scientists for this study of performance, a reminder that having many interests, starting late and quitting frequently can have value, too.\n\nby Ash Carter, expected June 11\n\nThis year will be full of autobiographies or books about American ideals, many of them leadership-themed, by potential presidential aspirants. Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz has a book launching in February. Sen. Kamala D. Harris has a title coming this month. We didn't consider any of those for the list, but former Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter's memoir about his career and the leadership lessons from running the Pentagon seems worth a look, especially following the sudden departure of Jim Mattis from President Trump's Cabinet. Carter, who served more than 35 years in the Department of Defense, draws on his career to describe what it takes to be the chief executive officer of a department that employs millions of people and manages one of the most complex organizations on earth.
To recap, Cousins played his fifth season in Washington (and his second as the Redskins' starting quarterback) under the NFL franchise tag in 2016, which guaranteed a $19.953 million annual salary. Cousins started all 16 games for a second consecutive season and broke the Redskins' single-season passing record of 4,166 yards, which he set the previous year, by throwing for 4,917. He finished with 25 touchdown passes and 12 interceptions while leading the Redskins to their first back-to-back winning seasons in 20 years.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut unlike 2015, when Cousins played his best down the stretch of the season (finishing with 29 touchdown passes and 11 interceptions), he played poorly in two late-season games, against Carolina and the New York Giants, that were crucial to the team's playoff hopes. Largely as a result, the Redskins missed the playoffs with an 8-7-1 record.\n\nNonetheless, Cousins is a good fit for the Redskins' offense. He is sturdy, starting all 32 regular season games since being named the starter. Though Cousins will be 29 when the 2017 NFL season opens, Coach Jay Gruden believes he is still improving. And the Redskins have few appealing alternatives, with the 2017 draft class and free agent crop regarded as thin on quality quarterbacks.\n\nAD\n\nHere's a look at the various scenarios in play regarding Cousins's future, followed by a comment on the probability of each:\n\nScenario No. 1 — The Redskins complete a long-term deal with Cousins by March 1, the deadline for NFL teams to apply the franchise or transition tag.\n\nProbability: Low. Cousins has no incentive to get the process over quickly, before his agent has a chance to see the value of other quarterback contracts this offseason and before Cousins has a chance to gauge with other NFL teams might have interest in him.\n\nScenario No. 2 — The Redskins allow Cousins to become an unrestricted free agent and take their chances on re-signing him, bidding against other teams on the open market, if they decide they want him back in 2017.\n\nProbability: Low. Needlessly risky, when the Redskins have other options for limiting Cousins's movement while they work toward a long-term contract.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nScenario No. 3 — If the two sides can't agree on a long-term deal by Feb. 15, the Redskins prevent Cousins from going elsewhere by using the NFL's exclusive franchise tag during the permissible window, Feb. 15 through March 1. The exclusive franchise tag prevents Cousins from negotiating with other teams while buying time for the Redskins and Cousins to reach a long-term deal by July 15.\n\nProbability: High to middle. The exclusive franchise tag gives the Redskins the most control over the situation, while giving them roughly five months to keep working toward a long-term deal.\n\nScenario 3B — The Redskins and Cousins reach a long-term deal by the July 15 deadline, which replaces the exclusive franchise tag the moment Cousins signs it.\n\nProbability: Middle. The Redskins' top offer during the failed talks for a long-term deal in 2016 was $16 million annually, with $24 million guaranteed. Cousins sought $20 million annually and $60 million guaranteed. Neither side budged much, if at all. It's logical to assume that in 2017, Cousins would seek a minimum annual salary of $24 million and a guarantee of $60 million or more in any long-term deal. Both sides would have to 'give,' in all likelihood, in order to reach a long-term deal this offseason.\n\nScenario 3C — If no long-term deal is reached by July 15, Cousins must play for the Redskins under the franchise tag for one more year, at a guaranteed salary that's estimated to be about $24 million.\n\nProbability: High to middle. A sound option that gives the Redskins total control of Cousins's next step.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nScenario No. 4 — If the two sides can't agree on a long-term deal by Feb. 15, the Redskins limit Cousins's ability to go elsewhere by using the NFL's non-exclusive franchise tag during the permissible window, Feb. 15 to March 1. Under the non-exclusive tag, which guarantees a salary that's slightly less than the exclusive tag, Cousins can negotiate with other teams and sign an offer from another team. But the Redskins have the right to match that other team's offer.\n\nProbability: High to middle. Also a sound option that buys time for the Redskins, protects their investment in Cousins and assures compensation (see below), if another team wants to pay above what the Redskins are willing to match.\n\nScenario 4B — If Cousins signs an offer sheet with another team, the Redskins match the offer to keep him in Washington.\n\nProbability: High to middle, depending on the value of the offer.\n\nScenario 4C — If Cousins signs an offer sheet with another team that the Redskins decline to match, the Redskins are compensated with two first-round draft picks by the team that signs Cousins.\n\nProbability: Low. Many are skeptical that an NFL team would give up two first-round picks for Cousins, but all it takes is for one team to feel he's worth the price if they believe he's the best fit. Redskins General Manager Scot McCloughan loves additional draft picks, and the Redskins have multiple needs to address on their roster.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nScenario 4D — If Cousins signs an offer sheet with another team that the Redskins decline to match, the Redskins can agree to accept less than two first-round picks as compensation by working out a tag and trade deal — for example, accepting a first- and third-round pick or a second- and third-round pick in a trade for Cousins.\n\nProbability: Middle. The Redskins would get something of value in exchange for Cousins, but they would need to have a solid Plan B in mind for their starting quarterback in 2017.\n\nScenario No. 5 — If the two sides can't agree on a long-term deal by Feb. 15, the Redskins limit Cousins's ability to go elsewhere by using the NFL's transition tag during the permissible window ( Feb. 15 to March 1). The transition tag's salary guarantee is less than franchise tag (The NFL hasn't yet released the position-by-position tag values for 2017. In 2016, the transition tag value for quarterbacks was $17.696 million — or roughly $2.3 million less than the franchise tag.) Under the franchise tag, Cousins could negotiate with other teams and sign an offer from another team. The Redskins would have only the right of first refusal and would get no draft-pick compensation if they choose not to match the other team's offer.\n\nProbability: Low. The savings of the transition tag isn't worth the risk of losing Cousins without getting any compensation.\n\nScenario No. 6 — If the Redskins give up on negotiations toward a long-term deal after tagging Cousins and, for any reason, change their mind about bringing him back (as the Carolina Panthers did in March/April 2016 after applying the non-exclusive tag to cornerback Josh Norman) — they rescind the tag, making Cousins a free agent. If they rescind the tag, the Redskins would get no compensation.\n\nProbability: Low. It's all but impossible to imagine a change of heart that would involve the Redskins letting Cousins go without getting something in return.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nScenario No. 7 — Cousins signs the contract once he is franchised by the Redskins, guaranteeing the one-year deal and effectively ending the need for further negotiations toward a long-term deal.\n\nProbability: Low. It's in Cousins's interest to wait until the last possible minute to sign any contract, so he can weigh the Redskins' offer against other quarterbacks' 2017 deals.
The New York freshman floated the idea in a 60 Minutes interview that aired Sunday. She said those earning more than $10 million a year should face a top rate of 60 to 70 percent on that income to help pay for a Green New Deal that would eliminate fossil fuels in 12 years. She is seeking a seat on the House Financial Services Committee, which oversees the banking and housing industry.\n\nAD\n\nWatch her here:\n\nBlowback from the right was fierce. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) misconstrued the proposal as a broad-based tax hike on all income:\n\nAs did anti-tax lobbyist Grover Norquist, likening it to slavery:\n\nBut left-leaning economists note the proposal is hardly radical, given rates that high — and higher — were on the books for for the top income bracket amid the prosperous middle decades of the last century. And some recent research (including from Nobel-winning economist Peter Diamond) argues a top rate slightly north of 70 percent is optimal for the ultra-rich. (The idea also drew praise from at least one figure on the right, with Ann Coulter tweeting she agrees.) Julián Castro, the former Obama administration housing chief moving toward a presidential bid, pointed to history in endorsing Ocasio-Cortez's idea during a Sunday appearance on ABC's This Week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs my colleague Dave Weigel noted, Castro's breezy co-signing signals just how quickly the tax policy discussion within the party can leap to the left:\n\nExpect other Democratic 2020 hopefuls to go there soon, too. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), for example, has said she wants to roll back Republican tax cuts passed in 2017. Though she has eschewed naming a number she would favor for a top marginal rate, she has pointed out it was well above 50 percent in the post-World War II era. And in her kickoff tour through Iowa this weekend, she said Washington needs to embrace big structural change to restore economic fairness.\n\nThe goal for aspiring Democratic leaders won't simply be extracting a pound of flesh from point-one-percenters. Ocasio-Cortez invoked the idea as a revenue source for a moonshot proposal — and her party's presidential pool will shortly be teeming with others looking to for ways to pay for similarly ambitious projects. (One estimate puts a $2.8 trillion price tag on Sen. Kamala D. Harris's proposal to offer tax credits or direct payments to lower and middle-income families.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Washington Post's Jeff Stein crunched the numbers with tax experts and found a new bracket for those earning more than $10 million a year would hit 16,000 households. Roughly doubling the rate they pay on income over that threshold, as a 70 percent rate would, could generate $720 billion over a decade. That could pay for a number of liberal dream programs. From Jeff: It could come close to funding the entirety of Sanders's free college tuition plan ($800 billion), fund President Barack Obama's plan to get close to universal prekindergarten ($75 billion over a decade), forgive more than half the student debt in America ($1.4 trillion), cover Democratic leaders' plan for boosting teacher pay and school funding ($100 billion), or come close to funding a $1 trillion infrastructure plan.\n\nThe soak-the-rich idea's early traction points to party in which the center of gravity has already moved measurably to the left. Barely two years ago, Hillary Clinton's platform called for imposing a surcharge on the incomes of those earning more than $5 million, effectively saddling them with a 44 percent top marginal rate. And four years before that, after winning a resounding reelection victory in part on a pledge to raise taxes on the rich, Obama signed a package that raised the top rate from 35 percent to 39.6 percent for couples earning more than $450,000 a year. Obama negotiated that deal with a Republican Congress.\n\nBut the fact remains that the Democrats' last two standard bearers proposed tax policy changes at the margins. The party's next one is likely to call for a much sharper departure.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMARKET MOVERS\n\n— Second thoughts on 2019 market forecasts. The Wall Street Journal's Michael Wursthorn and Akane Otani: The market's roller-coaster ride has prompted some Wall Street analysts to cut their 2019 forecasts, the latest sign of unease as the stock bull market approaches its 10th year. Major indexes rallied Friday after a stronger-than-expected jobs report boosted investors' confidence in the U.S. economy, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell suggested the central bank would be flexible with its policy plans.\n\nStill, a brutal December selloff and lingering worries about the health of the global economy have kept major indexes well below their records. Investors' confidence also took a hit after Apple Inc. late Wednesday slashed its quarterly revenue forecast for the first time in more than 15 years due to slowing iPhone sales in China, raising anxieties that other companies could follow suit in a nod to the ramifications of ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China.\n\nNervous investors seek refuge in yen and gold. WSJ's Ira Iosebashvili: Uneven economic data and volatility in stocks have accelerated a surge into assets perceived as relatively safe, highlighting the unease felt by many investors at the start of 2019. The Japanese yen is up nearly 5% against the dollar since markets began sliding at the end of last year's third quarter. That move picked up speed after weaker-than-expected manufacturing data and a sales warning from Apple Inc. last week bolstered fears of a global slowdown.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOther so-called haven assets are also rising. Gold prices have strengthened around 7% in that period and stand near their highest level in about half a year, and gold-focused funds have notched inflows in 12 of the past 13 weeks ... The broad shift toward havens suggests that investors are now more eager to diversify their holdings in the face of recent market swings.\n\nAmerica is a world leader ... in volatility. Bloomberg's Justina Lee: As the world's largest and deepest equity market, the U.S. tends to be the relatively steady hand among volatile peers. Not anymore. The country is at the epicenter of global market anxieties from trade to monetary tightening and an economic slowdown. The U.S. gauge of future volatility, the VIX, has exceeded the equivalents in Europe, Hong Kong and even emerging markets a few times over the past month. This is an anomaly that's become more commonplace since the market sell-off in February 2018.\n\n— Powell attempts a soft landing. WSJ's Greg Ip, Nick Timiraos and Eric Moriath: Federal Reserve officials, after navigating the U.S. economy through the financial crisis and its rebound, face a fresh test in 2019: engineering an economic soft landing. The central bank's challenge is to manage a moderation in growth that keeps inflation contained but avoids a recession. It was a main topic at an annual economic conference in Atlanta this weekend that featured top current and former Fed officials. Investors will look this week to talks by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Vice Chairman Richard Clarida for new clues on the officials' thinking, as well as Wednesday's release of minutes from the Fed's December meeting.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGoldman sees Fed pausing. Jan Hatzius, the firm's chief economist, writes in a note this morning: Fed officials are acutely focused on both financial conditions and the growth outlook, at a time when they have the luxury to be 'patient' because core PCE inflation is at 1.9% year-on-year and unlikely to rise significantly for at least the next several months. This implies a pause in the rate hike process until conditions have settled down, as well as a strong incentive to sound market-friendly in the near term.\n\n— A majority of Britons want a Brexit re-do. CNBC: More Britons want to remain a member of the European Union than leave, according to a survey published on Sunday which also showed voters want to make the final decision themselves. Britain is due leave the EU on March 29, but Prime Minister Theresa May is struggling to get her exit deal approved by parliament, opening up huge uncertainty over whether a deal is possible, or even whether the country will leave at all.\n\nThe survey by polling firm YouGov showed that if a referendum were held immediately, 46 percent would vote to remain, 39 percent would vote to leave, and the rest either did not know, would not vote, or refused to answer the question. When the undecided and those who refused to answer were removed from the sample, the split was 54-46 in favor of remaining. That is broadly in line with other polls in recent months which show a deeply divided electorate, in which opinion has swung slightly towards remaining in the EU.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTRUMP TRACKER\n\nTRADE FLY-AROUND:\n\n— Trade talks with China finally get underway. CNN's Donna Borak: Trump claims his administration is 'doing very well in negotiations with China,' but the US team heading to Beijing this week is starting almost from scratch. While China has made some preemptive concessions in the weeks since Trump met with his counterpart Xi Jinping in Argentina, including lowering auto tariffs and restarting purchases of American soybeans, little concrete progress has been made toward developing a comprehensive trade agreement between Beijing and Washington.\n\nInstead, the meeting of deputy-level negotiators will give each side a chance to take stock and serve as a litmus test for whether a deal can be achieved before March 1, when Trump has threatened to impose another round of tariffs and to raise duties on imports to 25% from 10%. 'Next week's negotiations are important because they will establish expectations,' said Myron Brilliant, executive vice president and head of international affairs at the US Chamber of Commerce. 'However, we shouldn't expect major breakthroughs next week.'\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPositive sign? Liu He joins talks. Bloomberg: Chinese Vice Premier Liu He unexpectedly attended the first day of talks aimed at resolving the trade dispute between the world's two biggest economies, according to people familiar with the matter and a photo seen by Bloomberg. Liu is the top economic adviser to Chinese President Xi Jinping, who led previous negotiations in Washington that produced a deal that President Donald Trump then repudiated. China had previously said the talks would be led by a lower-ranking official from the Ministry of Commerce.\n\nChinese economy slows as trade talks loom. WSJ's Lingling Wei: China's economy is slowing faster than expected as Beijing this week heads into a crucial new round of negotiations with the U.S. over trade. For the past couple of months, senior Chinese officials have sought to play down the impact of U.S.-China trade tensions on the world's second-largest economy, telling the public the conflict is doing little more than hurting the nation's stock indexes, making it a good time to buy China again. ...\n\n[But] the Trump administration's trade offensive, say the people and business executives, is hitting China's export-oriented manufacturing sector especially hard, reducing new orders for business and forcing factories to cut production and delay decisions on investing and hiring.\n\nAD\n\nU.S. has leverage in trade talks, Trump says. Alan Rappeport and Jim Tankersley at the New York Times: Trump is cheerleading his way past the economic warning signs that have rattled financial markets and unnerved economists, insisting that the United States has an advantage in a crucial first round of trade negotiations beginning on Monday in Beijing. It helps his case that the Labor Department published a jobs report for December that soared past expectations.\n\n'China's not doing very well now,' Mr. Trump said in a news conference at the White House, hours after the report came out on Friday. 'It puts us in a very strong position. We are doing very well.' Mr. Trump is correct about China's economy, which by several measures appears to be hobbled by American tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports. But the president's confidence about the domestic economy largely ignores what others see as looming threats.\n\nMeet in the middle? Given the stakes, Horizon Investment's Greg Valliere predicts progress. Both sides have compelling reasons to act – China quite clearly is suffering from an economic slowdown, and Donald Trump obviously fears that a nervous stock market could imperil his re-election, he writes in his morning note. Thus we believe there will be a constructive statement tomorrow, with hints that high-level officials will meet later this month to hammer out an agreement in principle.\n\n— Tariffs, not jobs for the industrial U.S. Peter S. Goodman at the NYT: Plants in every direction shut down and moved their operations to Mexico, succumbing to the relentless pressure to cut costs in an age of globalization. Not EBW Electronics. As the decades passed, the family-owned business stayed put, on the eastern edge of Lake Michigan, churning out lights for the auto industry. But now, the company's management is reluctantly mulling the possibility of moving its production to Mexico to escape the tariffs that President Trump has put on imported components, his primary weapons in a trade war waged in the name of bringing jobs home to America.\n\n'It's killing us,' said the chairman of the company, Pat LeBlanc, 63, a Republican who voted for Mr. Trump. He now expects the president's tariffs will chop his 2019 profits in half. 'I just feel so betrayed. If we fail because the company is being harmed by the government, that just makes me sick.' Across the industrial United States, including in the crucial political battleground state of Michigan, such complaints are intensifying as the trade war disrupts factory operations that depend on imported parts.\n\nMELTDOWN WATCH:\n\nPOCKET CHANGE\n\n— On the front lines of the app wars. The Post's Brian Fung: A growing number of software companies are looking to bypass the dominant app store gatekeepers at Apple and Google — selling their services directly to consumers and undercutting the tech giants that for years have controlled how most of iPhone and Android users discover, download and pay for their apps.\n\nThe revolt is being led by companies such as Netflix, which became the latest firm to cut off a lucrative relationship for Apple when it confirmed that new customers will no longer be able to pay their monthly subscription fees through iTunes. Instead, subscribers are being redirected to make payments on Netflix's own website. ... Netflix's announcement could save it hundreds of millions of dollars, and is potentially devastating for Apple.\n\n— When box stores use a tax loophole, small towns bear the brunt. NYT's Patricia Cohen: With astonishing range and rapidity, big-box retailers and corporate giants are using an aggressive legal tactic to shrink their property tax bills, a strategy that is costing local governments and school districts around the country hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue. These businesses — many of them brick-and-mortar stores like Walmart, Home Depot, Target, Kohl's, Menards and Walgreens that have faced fierce online competition — maintain that no matter how valuable a thriving store is to its current owner, these warehouse-type structures are not worth much to anyone else.\n\nSo the best way to appraise their property, they contend in their tax appeals, is to look at the sale prices on the open market of vacant or formerly vacant shells in other places. As shuttered stores spread across the landscape, their argument has resonated. To municipalities, these appeals amount to a far-fetched tax dodge that allows corporations to wriggle out of paying their fair share.\n\n— Possible liquidation looms over Sears. Bloomberg News's Eliza Ronalds-Hannon, Lauren Coleman-Lochner, Nabila Ahmed, Lily Katz and Tiffany Kary: Sears Holdings Corp. is preparing a potential wind down after Chairman Eddie Lampert's bid to buy several hundred stores out of bankruptcy fell short of bankers' qualifications ... The iconic retailer started laying the groundwork for a liquidation after meetings Friday in which its advisers weighed the merits of a $4.4 billion bid by Lampert's hedge fund to buy Sears as a going concern ... If the 125-year-old retailer does die in bankruptcy — like Toys R Us in 2018, and Borders Group Inc. in 2011 — it would mark the largest fatality yet in the retail apocalypse prompted by a shift to online shopping.\n\nMONEY ON THE HILL\n\nHere's what you missed at President Trump's Jan. 4 news conference on the 14th day of the partial government shutdown. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)\n\n— Shutdown drags on with no end in sight. The Post's Bob Costa and co.: Trump administration officials began taking extraordinary steps to contain the fallout from the partial federal government shutdown Sunday, as the budget impasse between the president and congressional Democrats showed no signs of nearing a breakthrough.\n\nAs agencies sought to deal with cascading problems across the federal bureaucracy, acting White House budget director Russell T. Vought sent congressional leaders a letter detailing the administration's latest offer to end the shutdown. It demanded $5.7 billion 'for construction of a steel barrier for the Southwest border' but also proposed 'an additional $800 million to address urgent humanitarian needs' and unaccompanied migrant children arriving at the border...\n\nA Democratic official familiar with the meeting said no progress was made over the weekend, in large part because the White House hasn't been forthcoming about how the money would be used or why the request is for so much more than the administration sought only a few months ago.\n\nDAYBOOK\n\nCOMING SOON:\n\nTHE FUNNIES\n\n— From The New Yorker's Mick Stevens, circa 1998:\n\nBULL SESSION\n\nFrom California to Washington, shutdown takes toll on parks and museums\n\nPeople are streaming into national parks to find trash cans overflowing and restrooms locked.

On Wednesday, in a dramatic exchange at the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court, he confronted Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, a Republican, whom he believed was ultimately responsible for twice barring him from casting ballots.\n\nAD\n\nBut after video of the encounter circulated online, Cleveland.com and Husted's surrogates noted that Husted had nothing to do with Helle's removal. The process for canceling his registration was actually set in motion when Husted's predecessor, Democrat Jennifer Brunner, was secretary of state.\n\nAD\n\nI've made it my mission as Secretary of State to make Ohio a place where it is both easy to vote and hard to cheat and by any objective measure we have achieved this goal, Husted said in a statement emailed to The Washington Post.\n\nIt is now easier for Ohioans serving in the military to vote than at any time in our state's history, he added, pointing to the state's early voting program, online registration and military ready-to-vote program as examples.\n\nAD\n\nHelle said his message remained the same.\n\nWe shouldn't be purging service members or veterans, or any Ohioans for that matter, he told The Post on Friday.\n\nFor Helle, the moment was more than six years in the making. In 2011, he returned from tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and tried to vote in a local election, only to be told that poll workers couldn't find his name. A couple of months later, in the general election, he was blocked again. This time, board of elections officials revealed he had been removed from the state's roll due to inactivity.\n\nAD\n\nI started crying, Helle told The Post. To come home after defending that fundamental right and to be told that I couldn't exercise it, that was heartbreaking.\n\nAD\n\nOhio's voter registration rules are some of the country's most punitive. Voters who fail to cast ballots for two years receive a notice in the mail. If they don't respond, change their registration or vote in the following four years, they are purged from the rolls.\n\nSince 2011, the practice has been overseen by Husted, who, like other supporters of such measures, says it is necessary to curb fraud and ensure the integrity of the state electoral system. The Democratic secretary of state before him used the practice as well.\n\nBut a group of Ohioans like Helle allege they were wrongfully disenfranchised under the use-it-or-lose-it policy, as it's casually known. Purporting to represent thousands of other similarly situated Ohioans, they sued Husted in federal court, arguing the policy violates the U.S. Constitution and voting rights law. They were joined by the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio and a homeless advocacy group.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Wednesday morning, after the lawsuit climbed through the lower courts over 18 months, the Supreme Court held closely watched oral arguments in the case.\n\nThe justices peppered the attorneys for the parties with questions about whether the policy was a reasonable and legally sound way for the state to prune its voter lists. But the real fireworks happened outside.\n\nWhen Husted emerged from the building, Helle was waiting for him, flanked by supporters and camera crews.\n\nWe believe our state is one where we make it easy to vote and hard to cheat, Husted told Helle, according to NPR. We make every effort possible to reach out to voters to get them registered to vote.\n\nAD\n\nHelle, who is not a plaintiff in the litigation, pushed back.\n\nI never received any such notice, he told Husted, because I was an active-duty soldier that maintained my home of record in the state of Ohio, came back home after defending that right, and could not exercise it because of this archaic, terrible policy.\n\nAD\n\nVideo of the exchange captured by Cleveland.com showed the two standing just a few feet apart as a group of onlookers watched. Husted pursed his lips as he listened to Helle talk. Helle, he said, didn't seem to grasp the policy.\n\nAll you have to do is use your right to vote, Husted said.\n\nFrom a mountainside, sir? responded Helle, a former airborne infantry sergeant.\n\nAD\n\nHusted told him the registration process took only minutes.\n\nWhat about soldiers serving overseas anywhere in the world, riding around in a Humvee, conducting missions 20 hours a day? Helle asked. What I know is that I was wrongfully purged.\n\nYou weren't wrongfully purged, Husted said. He then walked off, with Helle and several people behind him chanting shame.\n\nAs political theater, it seemed to work well for the 31-year-old veteran-turned-politician, who recently announced that he was running for the Ohio House of Representatives, hoping to unseat a Republican incumbent.\n\nAD\n\nHusted is running for Ohio lieutenant governor on a ticket with Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, who is running for governor\n\nAD\n\nBrunner, Husted's predecessor, in 2007 and again in 2009 ordered county election boards to take steps that resulted in people like Helle being scrubbed, Cleveland.com reported Friday. Under her directives, the boards mailed notices to anyone who hadn't voted in two years and hand't confirmed their address. If the voters didn't reply to the mailings or vote in back-to-back elections, their names got deleted.\n\nHelle first registered to vote in 2004, when he was 18. After joining the Army, he was sent to Alaska, then deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom between 2006 and 2011. He told The Post he tried to vote absentee from overseas, but his ballot never made it to Ohio.\n\nAD\n\nCounty officials sent Helle a confirmation letter in 2008, then removed him as a registered voter on Jan. 13, 2011 after he didn't respond, according to Cleveland.com. Husted had been in office for three days at that point. Helle learned of the move when he tried unsuccessfully to vote in two elections later that year.\n\nAD\n\nCarol Ann Hill, director of the Ottawa County Board of Elections, said local officials, not Husted, were responsible for the decision.\n\nNo. All 88 counties follow the law, Hill told Cleveland.com. The secretary of state does not say 'OK, now it's time to remove these voters.'\n\nBy all appearances on Wednesday, Helle blamed Husted for disenfranchising him. Following their confrontation, a tweet went out from Helle's Twitter account reading: I was able to speak my truth to the man who silenced my vote.\n\nAD\n\nBut he now suggests otherwise. And the tweet, Helle said, was written by a member of his team.\n\nI've never publicly, to my recollection, stated Jon Husted was specifically responsible, he told The Post in an email. However, while in DC I did have someone using my Twitter for me, to which they made an honest mistake and wrote a tweet that said I faced the person who purged me. It's since been corrected.\n\nHelle, who was elected mayor of Oak Harbor in 2015, said his involvement with the voter purge case was a pure accident.\n\nWhen he learned he was removed from Ohio's rolls, nobody really cared about the issue, he told The Post. Years later, after putting the issue behind him, he stumbled across a Facebook post about the Supreme Court case and left a comment about what he went through. The left-leaning interest group Progress Ohio took notice, as did the ACLU, he said. Soon after, the calls started coming in from news organizations and advocacy groups.\n\nAD\n\nHis trip to Washington on Wednesday was paid for by an organization affiliated with one of the plaintiffs, he said. He woke up at 2 a.m., drove two hours to the airport in Detroit and boarded a predawn flight. By late morning, he was on Capitol Hill.\n\nBefore his confrontation with Husted, he gave a short speech about voting rights outside the high court. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) joined him in front of the portico, where the senator told reporters his state was engaging in wholesale eliminating names of people who have served our country or people who haven't.\n\nVoter fraud is rare in both Ohio and nationwide. Probes of supposed voting irregularities routinely fail to turn up evidence of widespread or even marginal instances of it. In Ohio, Husted's own review of the 2016 election referred a mere 52 cases of possible fraud for prosecution or further investigation, as Cleveland.com reported.\n\nHelle, who returned to Oak Harbor late Wednesday, said he was glad for the chance to look this gentleman in the eye that's driving the cart and ask him why this is worth removing servicemen and women from voter rolls.\n\nThe secretary of state, he said, is out of touch.
To illustrate how different he and Saban are, he pulls up a graphic on his phone. The text comes from Dr. Chenavis Evans, a psychologist who works with Alabama, NFL franchises and other colleges in her job as the owner and CEO of Critical Insights Consulting. Evans profiles the personalities of the coaches and players to help maximize how they work together. Kiffin's profile comes up as a conceptual thinker. You'll like this, Kiffin says with a smile. It means I'm imaginative, intuitive about ideas, visionary, enjoys the unusual and learns by experimenting.\n\nHe laughs: Doesn't that explain me and everything that's not in the staff room at Alabama?\n\nHe then points out that Saban and a majority of the Crimson Tide staff are labeled structural: Practical thinker, likes guidelines, cautious with new ideas, predictable and learns by doing.
But Trump has no choice but to try to create an imperfect enemy if he wants to attack election results in Georgia. It's a state run entirely by Republicans, and Raffensperger is the Republican in charge of elections there.\n\nAD\n\nHere's more about the Republican standing in the way of Trump's remarkable attempt to change the will of voters in one of the most important states of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIn a phone call on Jan. 2, President Trump insisted he won the state and threatened vague legal consequences. Here are excerpts from the call. (Obtained by The Washington Post)\n\nRaffensperger drew national attention as a candidate for secretary of state during the 2018 Georgia governor's race. The then-secretary of state, Republican Brian Kemp, was running for governor against Democrat Stacey Abrams. She narrowly lost and accused Kemp of using his role as secretary of state to disenfranchise Democratic voters.\n\nAD\n\nRaffensperger was running that year to take Kemp's place as the top election official. He was and has been supportive of Kemp's questionable maneuvers to purge voter rolls (which require people to re-register to vote) and of strict voter ID laws. As The Fix's Aaron Blake recaps, in 2019 Raffensperger purged about 4 percent of Georgia voters from voter registration, a move critics labeled undemocratic. He was also critical of absentee voting before the pandemic; like many Republicans, he argued it opened the door to fraud.\n\nAD\n\nHis next high-profile moment in the job came in June, during Georgia's presidential primaries. These were among the first major primaries of the pandemic, and they didn't go well. There were hours-long lines, particularly in Democratic-leaning communities in and around Atlanta, and poll workers struggled to handle new voting machines. Voting rights advocates said Georgia election officials didn't prepare enough for the increase in mail balloting. Abrams directly blamed Raffensperger for inaction, poor planning and horrific execution. Raffensperger said much of the trouble was the fault of Democratic county officials.\n\nBefore running as secretary of state, Raffensperger was a city council member outside Atlanta, and he's a multimillionaire businessman and an engineer by training.\n\nAD\n\nHe's a Trump supporter. Or at least he was before all of this. Trump endorsed him in his secretary of state race. Raffensperger said he voted for the president and was rooting for him to win Georgia.\n\nAD\n\nIn the week after the election, Georgia was still counting votes, and pressure by Trump and his allies was just ramping up on the secretary of state. Here's what Raffensperger told The Washington Post's Reis Thebault and Amy Gardner at the time: If people want to understand what I'm doing, I'm just doing what the law says. We're just going to do that. Do I hope that President Trump wins? Yeah, I certainly do. I'm a Republican. But I can't put my thumb on the scale of the process.\n\nRaffensperger hasn't denounced Trump or the Republican Party. But the more Trump escalates pressure on him, the sharper Raffensperger's criticism of the president's efforts has become.\n\nAD\n\nThere's no love lost between him and the two Republican senators from Georgia. Once allies, Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler were some of the first Georgia Republicans to turn on Raffensperger after it became clear Trump had lost the state.\n\nAD\n\nThey called on Raffensperger to resign but offered no actual evidence for why. Raffensperger's response was biting: If I was Senator Perdue, I'd be irritated I was in a runoff. The drama has some Republican strategists worried that the party is least unified when it most needs to be to win Tuesday's runoffs in two races that will determine which party controls the Senate.\n\nHe's outing Republicans who have tried to pressure him to change results. In November, Raffensperger told The Post's Gardner that Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) called him and asked if he could toss thousands of mailed ballots based on baseless concerns about whether election workers properly confirmed voters' signatures. Graham denied explicitly asking Raffensperger to throw out legal ballots, but Raffensperger was insistent: It sure looked like he was wanting to go down that road, he said.\n\nAD\n\nHe and his family have received death threats: You better not botch this recount. Your life depends on it. That's one text he shared with The Post. His office has said his wife received threats they characterized as sexualized. Someone broke into one of his adult children's homes.\n\nAD\n\nAs he presided over the election, then three counts confirming former vice president Joe Biden's narrow win in the state, Raffensperger accepted a security detail.\n\nHe's also defended election workers in his state, saying they are driven to accurately count results and are not part of some deep-state conspiracy to swing the election for Biden.\n\nHe's become one of the most forceful voices against Trump and his Republican allies' attempts to overturn the election. Raffensperger has pushed back against broad accusations that the election he presided over was somehow fraudulent.\n\nAD\n\nBut he's also used his authority as secretary of state to directly confront conspiracy theories about voting machines having been manipulated or ballots cast by mail having been improperly approved. He's presided over three recounts — one by hand, which is the most secure way to confirm that machines and people counted ballots properly. And he acquiesced to one of Trump's demands to review signatures on the outside of voters' envelopes to confirm they match the signature the state had on file for that voter. Each time, they found no evidence of widespread fraud — as he told the president in that phone call.\n\nAD\n\nPresident Trump, he said in that call Saturday, we've had several lawsuits, and we've had to respond in court to the lawsuits and the contentions. We don't agree that you have won.\n\nThis is what it looks like when your party is losing: scapegoating, finger-pointing, he told The Post in a December emailed statement.\n\nAD\n\nIn December, he gave the green light for a top GOP election official who reports to him to hold a news conference and directly address Trump and tell him to stop leading people to believe Georgia's election was fraudulent: Someone's going to get hurt, said an angry Gabriel Sterling, who manages voting systems for Raffensperger. Someone's going to get shot. Someone's going to get killed.\n\nAD\n\nRaffensperger on Monday said of the leaked call that Trump first betrayed confidence about the conversation. It was a private conversation as far as I was concerned, Raffensperger told an Atlanta reporter in an interview. He broke privacy when he put out a tweet, but then his tweet was false.
— Relocation\n\nRelocation: Just moved is a state of being that makes just about any place seem miserable. Plus, homesickness is normal after leaving a place you loved. Plus, pregnancy could be heightening your emotions and attachments. So, make the best of this by recognizing, to start, that your feelings are 1.) normal and 2.) going to change sooner rather than later.\n\nAD\n\nNote that I didn't say they'd change for the better, necessarily; a year from now you might still believe moving was a mistake. But you'll have had a year to adjust and you'll have your routines, and basics like going to the grocery store won't feel alien anymore.\n\nAD\n\nOf course, your pregnancy means you'll have other changes to adapt to, but that's a variable we can't account for yet besides never sleeping or leaving the house — I kid! — so I'll leave it out. It could make you glad you moved or regret your move even more.\n\nAnyway, the key to starting over as an adult is, in my experience, patience + effort + an open mind. Strong new roots can take years, and those years can be difficult.\n\nAD\n\nShould you decide for some reason that the new location will never be what you'd hoped and that you want to return to the old one, owning a home makes that decision complicated but not impossible. People uproot at inconvenient times — it's just a fact of life; that's why houses get rented and, even, losses get absorbed.\n\nThinking this way tends to undermine the patience-and-open-mind plan, though, so I suggest you consider it, rule it out for now and really invest in your new place. You moved for a reason, and it may still hold up — after this initial panic clears.\n\nAD\n\nRe: Stressful: They say the stressful life changes are marriage, death, divorce, babies, moving, buying a house and starting a new job. You have a few of those. And hormones. You are possibly isolated and alone because you are in a new place. Do you know anyone nearby to connect with? Can you find a new moms' group? When I had my first kid, I felt isolated, and I had lived in that city for quite some time. I had no friends with kids. I presume you have limited time and energy to socialize between work and being pregnant, but try, at least, to make the best of it, and make an informed decision after having more data.\n\nAD\n\n— Been There\n\nRe: Moving: Five years after I bought at the top of the market, I got a job on the opposite coast and the market tanked, so my home was unsellable without a massive loss. I found a manager, rented it out, and it has been great to have the income and the tax deduction. There is nothing that can't be survived.\n\n— Anonymous\n\nAnonymous: Surmounted, let's say, and thanks.
On Friday, Trump will address the march from the White House Rose Garden via satellite, according to organizers. But as marchers return for the major annual antiabortion gathering, almost none of the core vows the president made has been fulfilled and there's no clear sign they'll be attained soon. Even so, movement leaders don't blame the president — they fault Congress — and seem relatively hopeful they'll advance their movement in 2018 by limiting later-term abortions and expanding exemptions for businesses or people who don't want to be connected to abortion. At minimum, they agree, Trump welcomed their movement back into the White House and treats them with respect.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut that may be where the agreement about Trump's impact on the antiabortion movement ends.\n\nSome antiabortion leaders describe him as a pro-life hero and pose grinning with him and their children. Others say the vulgarity of the president is poisoning the future of the movement, which has worked to change its anti-woman caricature by advocating for things such as paid family leave and maternal health care. Still others say that Trump's changes are more about tone and that he reminds them of other GOP presidents who said the right things but never prioritized fighting abortion on a large scale.\n\nAs someone who loathes the administration, the short-term report card — [it] has to be said — is not bad. . . . Those of us who said, 'He's just playing you,' we were wrong about that — in the short term, said Charles Camosy, an ethics and theology professor at Fordham University who writes books and articles about abortion. But when we said that, we meant we're not fighting for the next five years but for the next 50. And what will our children think of the pro-life movement when it's headed by the 'Grab 'em by the p—y' guy?\n\nThe annual March for Life brings many thousands of people to the Mall, with buses from high schools and colleges and caravans from churches. It marks Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that said the constitutional right to privacy covers a woman's choice to end a pregnancy.\n\nAmerican views have remained quite steady for decades — since the mid-1990s, about half, give or take a few percentage points, have said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 40-odd percent have said it should be illegal in all or most cases. But the march draws a passionate, largely religious crowd that tends to highlight the political climate and take cues from whoever sits in the nearby White House and which party leads Congress.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDuring the 2016 election campaign, abortion advocates on both sides studied Trump's past as a supporter of abortion rights and Planned Parenthood for clues about how reliable, true or deep his conversion to the other side has been. At this point, the analysis of Trump seems to have stopped, and the focus has shifted to the fact that he has surrounded himself with leaders well known in the antiabortion movement, including Vice President Pence (who spoke at last year's march) and Charmaine Yoest, longtime leader of Americans United for Life and now a top communications executive at the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nFor abortion opponents, this felt like night and day after the previous eight years, during which both parties became inhospitable to minority views (Democrats who oppose abortion access, Republicans who believe in protecting it) and the Democratic Party platform for the first time in 2016 called access to abortion core to women's, men's and young people's health and well-being.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUpon Trump's election, many antiabortion groups circulated his list of four key pledges, goals he'd worked out with movement leaders: nominating antiabortion Supreme Court justices, signing a law ending late-term abortions, stripping funding from Planned Parenthood and making permanent a ban on taxpayer money going to abortions.\n\nJustice Neil M. Gorsuch, before he became Trump's Supreme Court nominee, had not been called on to consider — or rule on — abortion as a federal judge. However, he has written about bioethics and human life with language that makes abortion opponents believe he will side with them on the topic.\n\nThe other three pledges don't appear to be going anywhere.\n\nAD\n\nThe House a year ago passed a bill to make the prohibition on federal funding for abortions — usually contained in a legislative provision called the Hyde Amendment — permanent, but the Senate did not, and it's not on the agenda. The House also last year passed a bill banning abortions in most cases after 20 weeks (considered a late term abortion, one of Trump's pledges), but a similar measure in the Senate is seen as unlikely to pass.\n\nAD\n\nWhen it comes to Planned Parenthood, the House and Senate health-care bills contained provisions to block the organization from getting federal reimbursements, but those efforts died with the legislation. Under President Barack Obama, states were prevented from withholding federal money from Planned Parenthood and other abortion clinics; Trump last spring signed a resolution reversing that rule.\n\nAD\n\nMarjorie Jones Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which advocates for abortion opponents in politics, said that was not the federal piece abortion opponents were going after, but it is a type of defunding of Planned Parenthood. Everything is still in progress, she said.\n\nI don't know if I have any data on how pro-lifers feel about Trump in general, Dannenfelser said. But 'Never Trumpers' and others all acknowledge that he has followed through on his pro-life commitment, and they're happy about that. Trump is a pro-life hero, she said.\n\nAD\n\nIt's a completely different atmosphere than four years ago, she said. We are encouraged, hopeful. The issue isn't buried. Candidates speak about it. It's not a movement in the ghetto. After eight years in the wilderness, eight years of having no ability to influence the president and then walking into the White House at the start of the administration — I felt like I was the pro-life movement walking in, after all those years.\n\nAD\n\nWhile Dannenfelser called late-term abortion the most effective piece of our ground game in moving voters, some say the issue is mostly symbolic. About 1 percent of abortions are performed in the third trimester (or after 21 weeks), according to the Guttmacher Institute, which provides research on reproductive health and was founded by Planned Parenthood.\n\nKristan Hawkins, leader of Students for Life, blamed Congress for the stalled agenda. Before the election, Hawkins had been skeptical of Trump's history and commitment, but after he won, she has regularly raved about him in Breitbart, posted photos of herself with him and her baby and said she'll urge activists at the march to press harder.\n\nAD\n\nWe're pretty disappointed that the GOP Senate and House have still failed to fully defund Planned Parenthood — that was and continues to be our No. 1 legislative priority. This is something the president has promised to sign into law, she said. I think that one of my charges this year is making sure pro-lifers don't get complacent and say: 'We've elected them. They'll do what they say.' No, they're not doing what they said. You need to push them.\n\nAD\n\nMarch organizers announced Wednesday that Trump would address the event via satellite. They noted that Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush had addressed the march by telephone, Reagan in 1987 and Bush in 2008.\n\nAbortion rights supporters said they were surprised more hasn't gotten done.\n\nIt seemed a year ago that Trump, with the leadership of the GOP in Congress, had the momentum to repeal and replace Obamacare, and certainly that also included the abortion provisions, said Heather Boonstra, director of public policy at Guttmacher. That also included the defunding of Planned Parenthood. This was a very real item and real concern for us. I think it goes to show how the Republicans just didn't have a plan, in many ways.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe do feel like this is an arc of a story that hasn't reached its final chapter, that these fights are ongoing, Boonstra said.\n\nThe core goals aside, antiabortion advocates had a list of things they were happy about.\n\nAmong them was the administration's expansion of the Mexico City policy, which withholds U.S. funding from foreign organizations that provide or promote abortion. The policy flips on and off when a new political party takes the White House, but Trump applied the policy to almost all global health assistance, some $8.8 billion. Past GOP presidents had limited it to the money the United States gives annually in family planning, about $600 million.\n\nAlso mentioned was a recent rule change enacted by the Department of Health and Human Services exempting religious employers who objected to an Obama-era requirement that they cover employees' contraceptives. That is being challenged by several states.\n\nAD\n\nAntiabortion advocates have been pleased with the Trump administration's high-profile efforts for their cause, including attempting to block four undocumented minors from receiving abortions.\n\nBut some longtime antiabortion figures say this all feels familiar: GOP leaders making promises about abortion but not following through in a dramatic way.\n\nIt feels like it was with Bush, said Bart Stupak, a former Michigan congressman and a Democrat who opposes abortion and worked to keep federal funding out of the Affordable Care Act. It's all political posturing. The only thing that seemed newly energized, he said, was the House's attempt at the 20-week ban.\n\nJayd Henricks, who just stepped down as the longtime lobbyist for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the main action both for and against abortion rights is in the states because Congress is generally broken, outside this whole issue.\n\nAt the federal level, one of the bishops' top issues, Henricks said, is getting the omnibus spending act to include a provision called the Conscience Protection Act, which would allow institutions, companies and people who oppose abortion to not have to pay for it (in employee health plans) or be involved in providing it if they are health-care providers.\n\nHenricks said he didn't notice Trump making a big difference in the movement, except for the impact of how controversial he is. I think [the Trump era is] changing clearly the character of the Republican Party, he said. Some pro-life folks are just as pro-life, but they are less Republican.\n\nSome activists said the national divisiveness over Trump is changing the direction they thought the movement was headed, one that looked at fighting abortion by providing paid family leave, chasing deadbeat dads and subsidizing child care and maternal health. That fuller approach, with a pro-woman and pro-child outlook, aimed to draw in more young people and even more abortion rights advocates.\n\nI certainly understand the perspective of those pro-life advocates who support him, said Kelsey Hazzard, president of Secular Pro-Life, who noted that things would be worse for the antiabortion movement under a Hillary Clinton presidency. President Trump has also sparked a tremendous backlash. His boorish comments give ammunition to the abortion lobby, which has long worked to caricature the antiabortion cause.
Over and over, she then turned to family members briefly granted access to their loved one, their newly tear-stained faces also hidden behind layers of fabric and plastic. And over and over, she has found the strength to help them mourn — pushing aside the knowledge that she can never know for certain whether they, too, are infected.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShe says mustering this strength, at least in public, has been part of how she survived this difficult year. But when she sat down next to a hospital doctor to be vaccinated a few days before Christmas, becoming one of the first faith leaders in the world to do so, she couldn't stop the tears.\n\nI told the doctor: 'I'm a little bit weepy today because, like . . . I don't know how to explain it,'  said Jennie, who asked Religion News Service to withhold her last name so she could speak freely about her experience. She looked at me and was like, 'I was the same way. Out of all this darkness, hope is on the horizon.' \n\nVariations of this complicated feeling — a mixture of hope, euphoria and lingering despair — were reported to RNS by a number of hospital chaplains who were vaccinated in recent days. Even while they rolled up their sleeves to join other front-line workers as some of the first to be gifted with human-made immunity to the novel coronavirus, many reflected on the work that led them to the historic moment — jobs that are sometimes harrowing, sometimes beautiful and always deeply felt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome chaplains who spoke to RNS expressed surprise that they were included in the first round of vaccinations.\n\nChaplains have a really valuable role on the care team, but it's not all the time we are told, 'You're just as important,'  Jennie said.\n\nBut even as protocols and systems vary depending on the hospital or the state, the exposure many chaplains have to covid-19 is very real. Daniel Russell, a Fuller Seminary graduate who works as a hospital and hospice chaplain in the Los Angeles area, regularly visits covid units. Before each session, he stops at the black tape that marks the entrance to the covid hallway to don gloves, a gown and a PAPR — a futuristic white helmet that encases his entire face.\n\nAD\n\nThen he enters a patient's room, taps on a phone or iPad, and holds it aloft so family members can see their loved one via video chat. Sometimes, if the patient is not intubated, they talk. Sometimes they pray together. Sometimes the families burst into songs, or even hymns.\n\nAD\n\nIt's so clear, every time, that their loved one is so loved, he said. As a chaplain, it's okay to tear up. But the amount of crying I've done this year . . . it's hard.\n\nAll chaplains who spoke to RNS reported a notable change in the tenor of their conversations with others this year. The Rev. Andy Karlson, a Unitarian Universalist chaplain for St. Mary's hospital in Madison, Wis., observed patients are open to longer conversations because there's just a loneliness. Anxiety is paramount, as are profound questions about why a greater power would allow them or their loved one to suffer.\n\nAD\n\nAnd even when they don't hear such questions from patients, they hear them from medical personnel.\n\nWe do as much staff support as we do patient support, Karlson said, noting that while all such conversations are part of his job as a chaplain, they also put him at risk of exposure.\n\nAD\n\nIndeed, covid-19 has not spared faith leaders who serve the sick. In April, a chaplain at NYU Langone Health, Rabbi Mordecai Katz, succumbed to the disease.\n\nAnd then there's the emotional and spiritual toll. Russell, who is pursuing ordination with the Free Methodist Church, said he began lighting candles as part of his Advent practice when he returned home at night and has continued doing so. As the death toll mounts, he has taken to thinking of each patient who died that day as he sets each wick alight. He said it can be overwhelming.\n\nAD\n\nThis is really the first time I've processed all of this, Russell said.\n\nThese and other experiences created the backdrop for hospital chaplains across the country as they received emails this month informing them they were in line to receive the vaccine. Again, systems vary: Some chaplains have already gotten the vaccine; others told RNS they expect to receive it sometime in the next month, and still others aren't sure when they will get the shots.\n\nAD\n\nBut regardless of when they get the vaccine, many say their decision to do so will be driven in part by faith-fueled altruism. The Rev. Hiram L. Brett, chaplain and coordinator of spiritual services at Connecticut Mental Health Center, recently told the Yale School of Medicine that his choice to get vaccinated was informed by his faith and his desire to quell vaccine hesitancy among religious groups — particularly his fellow African American Christians.\n\nAD\n\nI'm a preacher, so I have to say this: In this situation I would lean to faith as opposed to fear, Brett said. If you're choosing to keep yourself exposed to the virus with the potentiality that you don't know how it will affect you or your loved ones, are you letting fear drive you? I would opt toward faith and lean to the vaccine.\n\nKarlson said he talked with his family about getting the shot, and acknowledged it made him a little afraid. But he also felt driven to set a good example for his children — I want them to see their dad doing his part, he said.\n\nAD\n\nAnd, like Brett, he felt compelled by his faith.\n\nI trust God will be with me, he said. I can lean into my faith for this.\n\nAD\n\nWhen he finally pulled up his shirt to receive the vaccine — a quick, almost painless prick just beneath a tattoo — he suddenly found himself engulfed by the enormity of it all.\n\nI was trying to play it cool, but I could feel the gravity, the weight of the pandemic, he said. We're having a 9/11 of deaths every day. We've had to remap the structure of our whole society. We're facing this exacerbated wealth gap — communities of color and people on the margins are being hit incredibly hard by this. Feeling that, as I was taking off my sweater and rolling up my sleeves . . . it was heavy, and hopeful.\n\nJennie felt similarly. Although some have invoked faith as a reason to resist vaccines or mask-wearing during the pandemic, she saw the shot as an embodiment of Jesus Christ's command to care for others.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe golden rule is treating your neighbor as yourself, she said. I would hope my neighbor would care for my well-being enough to also get the vaccine, and to protect themselves and me and others they interact with. So why would I not do the same?\n\nAs for Russell, the moment took on a liturgical significance. For him, the pandemic has been shrouded in shadows: He often works nights, shuffling around hospital hallways that could feel barren even before the pandemic. It has been grueling, difficult work, and he stressed it is far from over: Vaccine rollout will take many months, and patients will still need him after the pandemic, coronavirus or no.\n\nImportant things will continue to happen at night; the Christmas story, after all, occurred in darkness.\n\nWe continue to show up for them, he said. We continue to grieve.\n\nAD\n\nBut as the Pfizer vaccine entered his arm on Dec. 17 — just four days before the winter solstice — he recalled that even in a year plagued with sorrow, there have been moments of joy. At his hospital, staff have developed a ritual of sorts: Whenever a patient recovers and is released from the covid unit, they play the song Here Comes the Sun by the Beatles.\n\nPerhaps, he thought, morning has finally come.\n\nThe days are going to begin to get longer again, and I felt such a sense of joy — like Christmas really was here, he said. It's actually happening. The sun is coming.
While models yesterday suggested that the snow would stay well south of Washington, their forecasts have crept the northern boundary of the snow back into the metro region.\n\nWe want to stress that this is a particularly tough forecast. Whenever a location is on the edge of a storm, the forecast can change significantly due to even small shifts in the storm track and intensity.\n\nFor the District and Interstate 95 corridor, the forecast could go either way: We could see no snow or perhaps up to an inch or so. The National Weather Service suggests that we have between a 20 and 30 percent chance of one inch of snow Saturday.\n\nFor our southeast areas in Calvert and St. Mary's county, shifts in the storm track could have more profound implications, meaning the difference between a dusting of snow and up to three to six inches.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe most likely timing of any snow in the region is between the pre-dawn hours Saturday and midday. The snow could potentially last longer into the afternoon in areas well east of the District toward the Chesapeake Bay, depending on how close the storm tracks.\n\nLocations north and northwest of the city still have a good chance of escaping snow unless the storm track makes a fairly dramatic shift in their direction.\n\nModel discussion\n\nWednesday's various model runs generally kept the precipitation shield suppressed to our south and east. The GFS even kept the northern edge of the snow shield confined to North Carolina.\n\nThat same model (the GFS) now predicts two to four inches in a six-hour period Saturday morning across southern Calvert and St. Mary's counties with snow coming perilously close to the District.\n\nThe high resolution NAM model (see below) is the most aggressive with the northern edge of the precipitation, forecasting one to two inches of snow in Washington on Saturday morning. That seems to be a long shot but is not a totally insane forecast if the storm tracks a bit west of its current forecast.\n\nA more likely result for Washington would be for the snow to stay just to the south or for the city to get a dusting.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe farther north and west of the city you live, the better your chances for seeing no snow.\n\nWhy have models shifted the snow northward?\n\nA comparison of the upper level (high-altitude) and surface forecasts from last night and today valid at 4 a.m. Saturday (see images to the right) provides insight into why the models have edged the precipitation field northward.\n\nLet's look first at the southernmost green areas at upper levels (500 millibars). Note that the jet stream, portrayed by the U-shape in the green shading, dips farther south into Tennessee on today's map compared to last night's forecast. Also notice that the same green shade is a tad farther north in our area today than last night. This indicates the upper flow over our area is little more from the south today than last night — which helps the storm come farther north.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlso, as a result of the more pronounced jet stream dip (green dip) over Tennessee, the 1016 millibar surface pressure contour (black line off the Southeast coast) is north of where last night's was. That indicates low pressure has shifted north a bit.\n\nAdditional changes to these features could either nudge the precipitation shield back to the south a bit or allow it to edge north.\n\nThe bottom line is the snow threat is still alive Saturday from the District south. The farther south and east you live, the higher the probability of getting accumulating snow.\n\nThe city will probably only see a dusting to an inch if that. North of the city flurries or no snow at all looks like the best bet.\n\nFolks south and east of the city should really pay attention to their weather forecasts over the next 36 hours as any snow that falls will stick as the temperatures are expected to remain well below freezing.
Then they'll go to halftime and start over.\n\nAlabama (14-0) has won its first quarters by a total score of 220-45, rendering unwise any late arrival to a Crimson Tide game no matter how highbrow the Tuscaloosan tailgate. Clemson (14-0) has won its second quarters by 211-38, allowing more time for pregame libations on the off chance any fans are into that.\n\nAD\n\nSadly, Alabama has cooled off in second quarters, winning them only 199-68 — the lousiness of it! — while Clemson has won its first quarters by an unforgivable 107-38.\n\nAD\n\nIn game prep, one of the things that we do, we script plays, said Michael Locksley, the Alabama offensive coordinator bound for Maryland right after this episode. I script my first 15 plays, and they usually include different formations, personnel groupings, to be able to see defensively how they want to defend us so that we can start the chess match. I think we've been really good with how we've executed those plays. You know, we usually get them in to our players on Thursdays, practice on Fridays, walk through.\n\nAnd so by the time we go to play the game, they've gone through these scripted 15 plays three times and I think their execution has been pretty good in those opening drives. We've been able to score points, and I attribute it to the way our guys have executed our opening script.\n\nAs the Tide's weekly first waves became one of the foremost sub-themes of the season, Alabama has executed so expertly that in most cases, the scoreboard might want to start off 7-0 just to save time. Alabama has driven for a touchdown on the first possession in an absurd 11 of its 14 games. In the other three, it punted against LSU before getting around to scoring on its second possession, did the same against Auburn, and it threw an interception against Georgia in the SEC championship game, which may or may not have related to the high-ankle sprain quarterback Tua Tagovailoa took on the fourth offensive play.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStill, when Georgia closed that first quarter with a 7-0 lead, most everyone would agree the game should have been stopped briefly for the Bulldogs defenders to receive medals. Brent Venables, the formidable Clemson defensive coordinator, called Alabama the best offense that we've seen since I've been at Clemson, top to bottom, and he has been at Clemson since 2012.\n\nI think you can get overwhelmed and feel like you're playing from behind, he said, soon adding, It can rattle your confidence. Certainly, for Oklahoma [in last weekend's College Football Playoff semifinal], what was it, 28-0? That's a hole that . . . you could still come [back], but it's gonna be really hard when you're playing somebody as good as Alabama.\n\nTo come across this Tide on a field, Venables said, brings the realization that they're different from about everybody.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNumber one, they're a very physical team, Clemson co-offensive coordinator Jeff Scott said. So they come out of the gate very physical. I think that happened last year [in Alabama's 24-6 win over Clemson in a national semifinal]. I don't think that we matched the physicality in the first quarter last year, and it really kind of hurt us getting a little bit of momentum going. Obviously, they've got great coaches, they're gonna have a great plan. And part of the first quarter is kind of a feeling-out process, everybody kind of feeling out each other, and you know, they've done a great job, obviously.\n\nYeah.\n\nThen he said, And you know, for us this year, we've kind of been a second-quarter team.\n\nAD\n\nAs to what's going on with that, Scott said, I don't know. We've talked about that as a staff.\n\nHe made an educated guess: A little bit of it, maybe, you've got a freshman quarterback [Trevor Lawrence], you've still got some young guys on the offense that even though they've been through a lot of battles, are still kind of feeling their way out. I remember that with Deshaun's group a little bit their freshman and sophomore year — referring to Deshaun Watson of the NFL, formerly of Clemson — we kind of got better as the game went, and then by Deshaun's junior year, we got off to some really fast starts early. I think that comes with experience. But there's no doubt, we want to get off to a fast start, but you know, the same thing two years ago, I think we were down 14-0 [early in the second quarter, before winning, 35-31]. So there's some lessons to go if you get in that situation as well.\n\nAD\n\nAs Venables reinforced, It's not like you say, 'Look, this week, we don't have to start fast.' \n\nAD\n\nAs Locksley explained, Once you get into the second quarter, that's typically where you have an idea or a good feeling for how they want to defend you that day, and that's where you start the chess match of countering what they're doing and making adjustments to your calls or your game sheets, so obviously Brent does a good job of making sure he kind of sees how we want to attack, when he starts to chess-match from his end.\n\nIf Clemson has had its (relative) first-quarter sighs — tied 0-0 with Florida State, trailing 6-0 to Duke, tied 3-3 with Notre Dame last weekend — it looks to have mastered what to do after that, with its halftime scores such as 28-0 against Florida State, 14-6 against Duke and 23-3 against Notre Dame. To Tosh Lupoi, the Alabama defensive coordinator, this owes to Clemson's unusual array of capabilities, from its smashing freshman quarterback to its thrilling list of receivers — Tee Higgins, Justyn Ross, the eternal Hunter Renfrow — to its 1,572-yard running back, Travis Etienne.\n\nAD\n\nYou know, they've got a lot of talent out there, they have a lot of versatility with their offense, and they have the ability to respond to what you're showing them, Lupoi said. . . . I think within the body of their offense, they have answers to the different looks that they see, and within our scheme, we do our best to respond to those looks and change those looks as well.\n\nAD\n\nPer usual, this quarter-by-quarter dance actually got going Saturday afternoon California time. That's when Alabama had its Thursday practice in its hardcore weekly routine. That's when Alabama finished with that, and that's when, as Locksley said Saturday morning, I'll sit down and start scripting those first 15.
Trump ran through economic statistics with a salesman's delivery, crowing about growth during his three years in office that he said bested his predecessors and defied his skeptics.\n\nAmerica is thriving, America is flourishing, and, yes, America is winning again like never before, he told an audience of billionaires, world leaders, and figures from academia, media and the kind of international organizations and think tanks for which his America First nationalism is anathema.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut as the impeachment trial began in the Senate during Trump's long day of activity here, the president repeatedly pivoted away from his broader economic message to lash out against his domestic political foes and the effort to remove him from office.\n\nREAD THE TRANSCRIPTS! Trump tweeted shortly after meeting with a group of global business leaders representing industries including energy, telecommunications and finance. Before the meeting, he decried the impeachment process in remarks to reporters — repeatedly calling it a hoax.\n\nTrump is making his second visit to the World Economic Forum, which for its 50th anniversary this year is focusing on climate change and sustainability. A sign at the entrance to the news center notes that paint for this year's installation was made from seaweed and carpets from recycled fishing nets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump, who has called climate change a hoax, did not directly address the theme during his 30-minute address here, although he did call for rejecting the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse and went out of his way to urge Europe to use America's vast supply of oil and natural gas.\n\nThis is not a time for pessimism; this is a time for optimism. Fear and doubt is not a good thought process because this is a time for tremendous hope and joy and optimism and action, Trump said.\n\nIn an apparent back of the hand to critics who say he is allowing massive backsliding on U.S. environmental progress, Trump said the United States has its cleanest air and water in 40 years. And in remarks outside the hall, Trump said he is a very big believer in the environment.\n\nAD\n\nIn his speech, Trump made no mention of impeachment or U.S. politics, although he took a swipe at radical socialists, his term for Democrats and ideas about expansion of the government's role in health care, education and other issues.\n\nAD\n\nKlaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the forum, thanked Trump for injecting optimism into the discussion.\n\nWe have many problems in the world, but we need dreams, he said.\n\nTrump skipped an onstage question-and-answer session with Schwab that had been expected following his address.\n\nTrump received a polite but not enthusiastic reception in the hall.\n\nEven as Trump faces an impeachment trial, his trip to Davos offers him an opportunity to focus on his economic message. The U.S. economy has continued to notch solid growth and maintain a low unemployment rate, and the stock market has reached record highs in recent days. Trump signed a partial trade deal with China last week, easing global tensions over his use of tariffs.\n\nBut the president faces continued questions about his approach to foreign affairs. His decision to order a strike that killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani this month — and his threat to impose a 25 percent tariff on European cars over a foreign policy dispute — created more tumult in the Middle East and in the transatlantic relationship between the United States and its closest allies.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump was billed as the keynote speaker for the annual business-themed confab in this Alpine ski town, but the main attraction was Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, 17, who has sparred with Trump on Twitter.\n\nOur house is still on fire. Your inaction is fueling the flames by the hour, she told conference attendees Tuesday. And we are telling you to act as if you loved your children above all else.\n\nIn December, Trump insulted the teenager and Time magazine Person of the Year as so ridiculous and suggested that she work on her anger management problem.\n\nThunberg was quick to respond, updating her Twitter biography to describe herself as a teenager working on her anger management problem.\n\nAD\n\nTrump had not yet arrived in Davos when Thunberg gave her first address Tuesday morning, saying that without treating this as a real crisis, then we cannot solve it. He did not attend her main speech later in the day, although she was in the audience for his.\n\nTrump is an outlier at the forum for his views on climate change. The president has publicly criticized global efforts to combat rising temperatures and has made ridiculing energy-efficient products a key part of his reelection stump speeches.\n\nAhead of Trump's address, Schwab told the gathering that the world is in a state of emergency and that the window to address climate change is closing. He also reminded the audience that every voice heard at the forum deserved respect.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlthough climate change and environmental stewardship lead the agenda here, a survey of chief executives released Monday shows that they do not count climate change as among the top 10 threats to business growth.\n\nTrump was accompanied here by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, and a delegation including national security adviser Robert C. O'Brien, Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. Also present was adviser and speechwriter Stephen Miller, whose hard-line stance on limiting immigration and denunciations of globalism infused Trump's address to the United Nations in September.\n\nThis is the wreckage I was elected to clean up, Trump said Tuesday of the bleak economic landscape he inherited.\n\nAD\n\nHe praised himself repeatedly, saying that his actions saved the global economy from the brink of recession, rescued the U.S. manufacturing industry and reshaped the rules of international trade to reflect a fairer system.\n\nAD\n\nHe occasionally strayed from the facts as he tried to paint a picture of an economy in shambles before his election.\n\nHe described the 4.7 percent unemployment rate before he took office as reasonably high, even though it was well below the average rate in the United States over the past 70 years. He also took credit for additional funding that has been approved for historically black colleges and universities, saying inaccurately that the funding saved the schools from ruin.\n\nAD\n\nHe took a swipe at the Federal Reserve for its interest rate policies, saying his economic achievements came despite the rate-setting body. Although his attacks on the Fed have become common, the once-taboo practice seemed to startle some in the audience here.\n\nSome in the audience laughed and rolled their eyes at Trump's claims he has created an inclusive economy that should be a global model. But many business leaders here believe Trump is likely to be reelected and are opting to praise him on topics they agree on.\n\nAD\n\nI think he glossed over some of the more controversial issues on the environment, said Steven Collis, chief executive of AmerisourceBergen, but he called it a surprisingly well-met speech overall.\n\nMarc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce, has donated to several Democratic candidates for president, but he applauded Trump's announcement that the United States will join the Trillion Tree Campaign to plant more trees to help reduce carbon emissions.\n\nI'm very excited that the United States has joined the Trillion Tree initiative, Benioff said as he left the speech.\n\nTrump is using his day-and-a-half-long visit to lobby corporate chieftains for greater U.S. investment and meet with leaders including Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, Iraqi President Barham Salih and Kurdish leader Nechirvan Barzani.\n\nAD\n\nTrump largely steered clear of discussing domestic political issues during his speech to the forum in 2018, instead using his remarks to tout his accomplishments and encourage business leaders to invest in the United States. He did take a brief swipe at the opposing party, pointing out that some of the people in the room supported Democrats over him in 2016. He also drew a smattering of boos when he attacked the news media as fake.\n\nMore than 100 billionaires are on the official attendee list for the World Economic Forum, and Trump plans to meet with the heads of several multinational companies while in Davos.\n\nDuring a dinner with foreign business executives Tuesday, Trump had a simple message.\n\nAround the table tonight, we have the greatest businessmen in the world, he said. This is a great time to promote what you want to promote.
We don't ever want to be outworked, Reed said of his team's mentality to start the year. And we talk about trust often. Trusting our staff and system but also trusting each other.\n\nAD\n\nThe team is led by senior big man Qudus Wahab, and their goal on offense is often to get the ball down low. Wahab is one of four players on the roster taller than 6-foot-6. That provides the team with some versatility. An example: when Wahab missed last week's game against Bullis, 6-foot-10 transfer Noel Brown filled in admirably.\n\nIn the backcourt, the team starts three point guards. Senior Ethan Jones, junior Justice Ellison and Westfield transfer Jordan Hairston all provide different skillsets, but can each run the offense. When the Huskies dominate the boards, something that isn't too difficult with their size, there's a good chance their outlet pass will find a point guard.\n\nAD\n\nWe don't have to get it to a certain player to make things happen, Reed said. We trust all of them with the ball.\n\nAD\n\nThe Huskies' distinctive roster makeup could help them stand out in a Mid-Atlantic Conference that is packed with size and talent this season. Reed said his team's first priority is to protect home court. They have not lost a game at Flint Hill since early 2017.\n\nTheir second goal is to not get ahead of themselves. They want to keep stacking one-game win streaks, all the way through the postseason.\n\nWe all recognize that we have our best basketball ahead of us, Reed said.\n\n- Michael Errigo\n\nMount Hebron wants to build something big\n\nBecause Jared Ettinger coached Mount Hebron's junior varsity team before taking over the varsity squad this season, he knows all about the players and the team culture. And he knows Mt. Hebron has been a mediocre program over the past 10 years, with a winning percentage hovering around .500.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEttinger wants to change that.\n\nI want to build a community-based program that year in and year out sees sustained success, Ettinger said. Sustained success isn't always the best record or county championship. ... We want to build something with longevity — something where year in and year out we can have a program that expects better than a mediocre overall record.\n\nIt may sound like a lofty goal for a first-year head coach. But with players such as Odell Dickerson, a 6-foot-4 transfer from Chapelgate Christian averaging 21 points and eight rebounds, and Brandon Prox, whose 79 made threes last season was the most by a Howard County public school player in the last decade, Ettinger has the tools to begin strong. Now, he's working on transitioning that talent into team chemistry and success.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Vikings finished last season by winning nine of their final 12 games. With an up-and-down season so far — they won four of their first five games but lost three of the last four — the Vikings hope to make a similar run to push for the playoffs.\n\nWe're hoping to go on a similar run, but there's no pressure to replicate that, Ettinger said. But if we want to go on a run, we're going to have to do the little things better, like running the offense off the ball, being more disciplined, working on the defensive glass.\n\n- David J. Kim\n\nOsbourn Takes Down Rival Osbourn Park\n\nOsbourn and Osbourn Park are no strangers, but the Osbourn Eagles found themselves in unfamiliar territory Friday.\n\nAD\n\nThe Eagles usually have no trouble handling the Yellowjackets, but this time proved different, as new Coach Jeremy Coleman and more offensive depth have made Osbourn Park stronger this season.\n\nAD\n\nUltimately, thanks to the efforts of senior Draykeau Hogan and sophomore Manny Ojo, the Eagles were able to secure a 69-58 win, their 11th straight victory against their rivals.\n\nHogan had a career-high 27 points, and Ojo sunk five three-pointers as the duo combined for 48 points. The two were also able to slow down Osbourn Park's top scorer, Ethan Wilson, who averages 22 points per game but had 19 in the game on just 26-percent shooting.\n\nI'd argue we have two of the best guards in the area, Osbourn Coach Rocky Carter said. We got an incredibly unselfish team… we're very fortunate to have the guards that we have and very fortunate to have the team that we have.\n\nAD\n\nOsbourn (12-1) ranks second in the 6A division while Osbourn Park, who had won five straight prior to the loss, dropped to 5-8.\n\nThere's no night off in our district, there's no game we can look at that we can say, 'oh, we should win that one...' Carter said. We must make sure that we do the little things correctly.\n\nAD\n\n-Sammi Silber\n\nAfter close losses, Eastern comes up clutch\n\nEntering its game against Ron Brown on Friday night, Eastern's previous three losses came by seven or fewer points. But the Ramblers found themselves on the opposite end of a close game during their 71-68 win over the Monarchs.\n\nWith about three seconds remaining and the game tied at 68, the officials called a technical foul on Ron Brown for having too many players on the court. Guard Christopher Green sunk one of two free throws. On the ensuing possession, the Monarchs fouled Green, who drained two more shots from the charity stripe. Ron Brown didn't get off a shot at the buzzer.\n\nAD\n\nI was like, 'We need this win because it's league play,' Eastern guard Darryl Carter said.\n\nEastern (7-5) went 11-18 last season, but Carter said the Ramblers' offense is more versatile this year with a deeper bench and more guards who can handle the ball.\n\nCarter said Eastern focused on making smarter decisions and boxing out on offense during practices after their array of close defeats.\n\nThe Ramblers play Banneker on Monday before tests against McKinley Tech and Wilson later this week.\n\nIt could boost our energy and confidence, Carter said of Friday's victory. We haven't reached our potential yet.

Apollo 14 astronaut Alan Shepard conducts an experiment on the moon in February 1971. A research team used rocks that Shepard and Edgar Mitchell brought back to Earth to figure out the moon's age. The estimate is 4.51 billion years old. (NASA via AP)\n\nIt turns out the moon is older than many scientists suspected: a ripe 4.51 billion years old.\n\nThat's the newest estimate, thanks to rocks and soil collected by the Apollo 14 moonwalkers in 1971.\n\nA research team reported Wednesday that the moon formed within 60 million years of the birth of the solar system. Previous estimates ranged within 100 million years, all the way out to 200 million years after the solar system's creation, not quite 4.6 billion years ago.\n\nThe scientists conducted uranium-lead dating on fragments of the mineral zircon that were pulled from Apollo 14 lunar samples. The pieces of zircon were tiny — no bigger than a grain of sand.\n\nSize doesn't matter, they record amazing information nonetheless! lead author Melanie Barboni of the University of California at Los Angeles, said in an email.\n\nUntil recently, the moon was estimated to be millions of years younger. (Matt Cardy/Getty Images)\n\nShe noted that the moon holds so much magic . . . the key to understand how our beautiful Earth formed and evolved.\n\nSome of the eight zircon samples were used in an earlier study, also conducted at UCLA. Barboni said she is studying more zircons from Apollo 14 samples, but she doesn't expect it to change her estimate of 4.51 billion years for the moon's age, possibly 4.52 billion years at the most.\n\nIt would be more a double-checking than anything else, she explained.\n\nShe and her co-workers — whose research appeared Wednesday in the journal Science Advances — are eager to learn more about the moon's history and, in turn, the evolution of early Earth and the entire solar system.\n\nApollo 11's Alan Shepard and Edgar Mitchell collected 92 pounds of rocks and used tubes to dig up soil while exploring the moon's Fra Mauro highlands in February 1971. They conducted two spacewalks, spending nine hours altogether out on the lunar surface.\n\nIt's the second major moon study this week.\n\nOn Monday, Israeli scientists suggested our Earth's constant companion may actually be a melting pot of many mini-moons. Rather than one giant impact that shaved off a chunk of Earth and formed the moon, a series of smaller collisions may have created multiple moonlets that eventually merged into one, according to the researchers.\n\nThe giant-impact theory says that the resulting energy formed a lunar lava ocean that later became solid. It's the age that it became solid that Barboni and her team have now figured out.\n\nWe finally pinned down a minimum age for the moon formation, she said, regardless of how it formed.
Wells's obstetrician/gynecologist explained that the test, called a cell-free DNA screen, analyzes the fetal genetic information that travels from the mother's placenta and poses no risk to the baby. The doctor had been routinely prescribing it for her patients who were older and higher risk, now she was prescribing it to younger women, as well.\n\nThe doctor's reasoning: women under 35 had more babies overall and account for 80 percent of country's 6,000 annual Down births, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She explained that the test was more accurate than the current standard of care for younger women, which can include other blood tests and an ultrasound to measure the fluid at the base of the fetus's neck that can signal the presence of Down. Plus, the parents could learn the gender during the first trimester if they wanted, rather than wait to see the baby's anatomy on the 20-week ultrasound.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt was an easy blood draw, and we didn't see a downside, says Wells, a public relations specialist from Baltimore. My husband and I hadn't discussed what we would do if we got a bad result, but I thought if we did, wouldn't we want to know as far in advance as possible?'\n\nWells is part of a new wave of younger women gaining access to what is marketed as the noninvasive prenatal test (NIPT). Becoming available in 2011, the NIPT was rapidly embraced by OB/GYNs and covered by insurers for women over 35 because it was less risky than two other tests, amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS), and more sensitive in picking up genetic abnormalities. It also could be performed earlier in pregnancy than amniocentesis.\n\nIn a 2015 study in the New England Journal of Medicine of nearly 16,000 pregnant women undergoing first trimester screening, cell-free DNA testing detected the presence of trisomy 21, the marker for Down syndrome, in 38 of 38 women, compared with just 30 of 38 women who were given current standard-of-care tests.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDiana Bianchi, director of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, argued that cell-free DNA testing has led to a global transformation of prenatal care in an article last summer in the New England Journal of Medicine. Not only did it spare women unnecessary angst from fewer falsely abnormal results than current methods, but the increased use of the NIPT led to fewer invasive amniocentesis or CVS procedures that carry a small risk of miscarriage, she wrote.\n\nToday, as many insurers expand coverage of the test — and more women request it — more OB/GYNs are making the NIPT a standard offering for all patients. In 2017, nearly 60 percent of OB/GYNs prescribed it to younger women — up from 35 percent the year before, according to the asset management firm Piper Jaffray.\n\nYet the NIPT's entry into the mainstream has raised some questions as busy health-care providers scramble to figure out how to offer it en masse to a public with varying understanding of genetic testing and little access to genetic counselors. Sometimes, OB/GYNs don't have time to explain the nuances of the tests before they order them, says OB/GYN Neeta Vora, who works as the director of reproductive genetics at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat communication gap is further exacerbated by what Houston prenatal genetic counselor Blair Stevens calls the elephant in the OB/GYN's office: some patients agree to take the NIPT simply to learn the sex of their baby. They may not understand that the NIPT is not 100 percent accurate and should be confirmed by a diagnostic amniocentesis or CVS. And they also might not be prepared for — or even expecting — the possible genetic problems the test can reveal.\n\nWhen Casey Delperdang was pregnant with her son, Simon, two years ago, she says the main appeal was the chance to learn she was carrying a boy. I was 25 at the time and wasn't even thinking about genetic abnormalities because of my age. I sort of took the test for granted, says Delperdang, who works in health-care marketing in Houston.\n\nWhen she received her results, she and her husband threw a gender reveal party that involved an elaborate scavenger hunt leading guests to a tray of custom-made cupcakes. The blue frosting hidden inside indicated they were having a boy. I have a lot of similarly aged friends who've been pregnant recently, and it's not even a question that they get the test for the same reason. she said. Thankfully, her test results were genetically normal.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlthough disclosing fetal sex information is forbidden in some countries — such as China and India — out of concern that girls will be selectively aborted, research shows that is not an issue in the United States. Rather, Blair says, she is worried about ­parents-to-be getting emotionally blindsided by upsetting genetic results.\n\nAs a culture, we've gotten so swept in gender reveal parties that we've forgotten the real purpose of the test, she says. I see women in my office with positive results who don't know what they've have their blood drawn for.\n\nIn addition to testing for Down syndrome, a cognitive impairment disorder with a risk of heart defects, vision and hearing problems, the NIPT also detects the rarer Edwards and Patau syndromes that occur in 1 in 5,000 and 1 in 16,000 births, respectively, and usually result in death shortly after birth.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDespite the test's increase in popularity, public health experts have not uniformly embraced the technology as the preferred first-line test for all women — and some major insurers are not yet covering it for average-risk women, generally meaning under age 35.\n\nFor instance, in a 2016 bulletin advocating prenatal screening for women of all ages, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine stopped short of explicitly endorsing the NIPT.\n\nWe say that all women should be offered testing, but we don't recommend one kind, says Nancy Rose, a maternal fetal medicine physician at the University of Utah Health Sciences Center and a former genetics chair of ACOG. All these tests are good, and they all offer advantages and disadvantages. For example, some of the older blood tests also assess neural tube and ventral wall defects.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTwo years ago, six leading genetic NIPT manufacturers and providers formed an alliance to expand coverage for the test and persuade two of the largest private insurers, UnitedHealthcare and Aetna, which cover more than 50 million people in the U.S. combined, to offer NIPT for younger women.\n\nBoth Aetna and UnitedHealthcare, which only cover NIPT for high-risk pregnancies, said they cover traditional blood and ultrasound tests for younger women in line with the professional groups' recommendations.\n\nACOG is reviewing its position, says Chris Zahn, ACOG's vice president for practice activities. (A recent study suggested that NIPT may also detect some ovarian and cervical cancers in the mother.)\n\nAD\n\nThere's new evidence every day about how this technology is expanding to detect abnormalities earlier, he says. But from a clinical perspective, we still need to figure out how to counsel women to think about the results.\n\nAD\n\nAt UNC, Vora teaches OB/GYN residents how to talk to patients about the NIPT and genetic testing in general.\n\nI encourage residents to ask the basics, such as, 'Have you ever heard of Down syndrome?'  she says. Based on what patients say, you're obligated to spend more time with them and explain the general concepts of chromosomes.\n\nVora's department is developing an educational program that patients can scroll through on an electronic tablet during an office visit. Similarly, Illumina, the San Diego maker of DNA sequencers used in 90 percent of NIPT samples processed in the United States, plans to launch a multilingual app soon that patients could consult before or after an appointment.\n\nAD\n\nPart of adequately counseling women, Stevens says, is realizing that not all women want to know everything modern science can tell them about their pregnancies. It causes them anxiety, she says. They don't want to know because they don't know what they would do with a positive result.\n\nAD\n\nAlthough a 2012 retrospective analysis of 24 studies found that 67 percent of U.S. women who learned their fetuses probably had Down syndrome had terminated their pregnancies between 1995 to 2011, Stevens says she also tells patients that they can use such information to prepare for a special-needs child by connecting with other parents or finding the right doctors and birth centers.\n\nYet, unlike previous prenatal testing that might occur in the second trimester, some observers say the NIPT is poised to change the American pregnancy experience as we know it — by making early testing a standard part of the OB/GYN checklist, whether a woman really wants it or not.\n\nJust the fact that it's routinely offered forces you into a decision, or you're an irresponsible mother, says Vardit Ravitsky, a bioethicist at the University of Montreal who studies the social impact of prenatal testing. With an amniocentesis, you could say you didn't want to risk miscarriage, but with NIPT, what's your excuse?\n\nThe focus on testing also could dampen the joy of those early months of pregnancy. It's no longer 'Congratulations! You're pregnant!' It's 'Here's a test to see what could be wrong,'  says Barbara Katz Rothman, a sociologist at City University of New York and the author of Tentative Pregnancy: Prenatal Diagnosis and the Future of Motherhood. It induces a kind of anxiety that's not healthy.\n\nYet for Wells, receiving a negative NIPT result before the end of her pregnancy's first trimester gave her peace of mind — and made her pregnancy more real.\n\nIt was a huge relief, she says. I thought, 'Now we can tell people and celebrate.' \n\nShe and her husband declined to hold a gender reveal party, but they did engage in another modern ritual of pregnancy: a funny Facebook post.\n\nThe couple took a photo of their two male cats posed next to an ultrasound image and a copy of book The Expectant Father.
But even the die-hard fans of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) that I talked to at his Friday rally in Columbia, S.C., didn't express much confidence in his chances, though they hoped it would be close. They had been phone banking or canvassing for him, and the experience had been discouraging.\n\nThey were much like so many of the Sanders supporters that one meets all over the country: young, full of passion, shining with belief in the better world promised by the self-described democratic socialist. Many of them were students at nearby colleges. When I asked one whether she'd attended any Sanders rallies in 2016, she laughed and said, I was in high school, and my parents are very conservative. Like Sanders voters everywhere, they said their top issues were either health care or climate change.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut not enough South Carolina Democrats are like those hopeful college students or the rest of the people who had turned out to Finlay Park to hear Sanders and his surrogates thunder about radical change. More than half of South Carolina's Democratic voters are African American, a demographic that former vice president Joe Biden does well with, rather than Latinos and whites, with whom Sanders is strong; they are older, more religious and less liberal than the ideal Bernie electorate. Too many of the people those Sanders campaigners had tried to turn out were voting for Biden, or Elizabeth Warren, or Tom Steyer.\n\nPaul Taylor is a corner store cashier in an impoverished area of Charleston, S.C. He is gay, black and a Democrat. And he may vote for Trump. (The Washington Post)\n\nSure enough, even before polls closed, the Sanders campaign had all but conceded the state; he wasn't even there to give his concession speech, even though he'd come in a (distant) second. The television talking heads who had been increasingly panicked about a Sanders candidacy even began speculating that former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg could drop out and toss his massive ad buys to Biden. (The Bloomberg campaign hastened to announce he wouldn't.) The consensus was that we were now down to a two-man race, and that meant Biden could easily go all the way.\n\nI might be too pessimistic about Biden's chances. It all feels just too close to the emotional roller coaster we #NeverTrumpers rode back in 2016, when we spun elaborate fantasies about the field narrowing and a champion emerging to take down the Orange Menace.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI believed the fantasies back then, but I find it hard to allow myself to believe again. And the map isn't exactly helping to restore my faith.\n\nYes, Biden had a big win on Saturday in South Carolina. He's catching up to Sanders in the delegate race, because South Carolina has a lot of delegates, and he will probably have a big fundraising night. He should have a nice tail wind heading into Super Tuesday. But where is he going to win big?\n\nLooking at the polls, I'd expect him to take Alabama, Tennessee and probably North Carolina. But is a big win in a state he was already widely expected to carry really going to push him over the top in Texas, where he is running eight points behind Sanders and where the Democratic electorate is heavily Latino? Or Virginia, where the D.C. wonketariat is gaga for the technocratic stylings of Warren, Buttigieg and Bloomberg, and where a large youth vote is clearly in the Sanders camp?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBiden, in other words, seems to be doing really well in what Flannery O'Connor dubbed the Christ-haunted South. But that's the place where Sanders is particularly bad at campaigning. I heard some of his surrogates onstage working stilted religious references into their speeches and looked around at a crowd that clearly wasn't overly familiar with the Bible and thought, why are they bothering? They just don't speak fluent Church Lady and neither does anyone else here.\n\nOpinion Who could win the Democratic primary? Use the Post Opinions Simulator to pick a state and see what might happen in upcoming primaries and caucuses.\n\nBiden, by contrast, speaks easily and naturally of his own faith and connects it with that of his likely voters here. He has been telling a story about how he shared his own suffering at the death of his son with the survivors of Dylann Roof's horrific attack on the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. It makes a big impression at the rally I attended on Friday night, and illustrates why Biden carried voters who regularly attend religious services by more than 40 percentage points while Sanders won those who never attend.\n\nThe problem is that once you get outside of the South, and particularly in the big states, the Democratic electorate looks more like the people who have been voting for Sanders than it does like conservative southern black voters. If Biden runs the tables in the South on Tuesday, and Sanders wins everywhere else, is the party going to nominate the guy who carried California and Texas and Massachusetts, or the guy who won all the states that are virtually guaranteed to vote for a Republican come November?\n\nAD\n\nAD
He moved up through the ranks — assigned to an elite rescue truck, then promoted to battalion chief, and on up to the executive office. He earned the department's highest honor for rescuing an unconscious man trapped in a burning house.\n\nIn September, Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) announced that the 54-year-old Donnelly was her choice to be the District's new chief of the Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department. Donnelly did not predict drastic change, saying at a news conference: Our path forward is the path we have been on.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe District's new fire chief is signaling a continuation of policies and plans put in place by his predecessor, Gregory M. Dean, whom the mayor lured out of retirement from Seattle in 2015 to turn around what was then a troubled agency marred by high-profile failures. Donnelly was one of the insiders Dean turned to for help.\n\nBut Donnelly — who started fighting fires for a volunteer company in Prince George's County when he was 16, and later battled forest and brush fires in remote areas of the West Coast — faces some daunting challenges.\n\nHe assumes the role in the midst of a global pandemic that has sickened more than 285 D.C. firefighters, including himself, and sidelined many more in quarantine. D.C. leaders warn that his department will not be immune to budget cuts forced by a fall in revenue and expenditures because of covid-19.\n\nThere is a crisis in front of us, D.C. Council member Charles Allen (D-Ward 6) told Donnelly at his brief confirmation hearing in December, which drew just two other lawmakers and the supportive president of the firefighter's union.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYou're under incredible stress every day, and throw on top of it the pandemic, said Allen, who chairs the Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety.\n\nThe last nine months have been really hard, Donnelly answered, noting that one of his most important jobs is ensuring that first responders have enough masks and other protective equipment.\n\nEmergency calls during the coronavirus pandemic have decreased, he said, corresponding to a decline in the numbers of workers and tourists who can more than double the District's population on a typical workday. But he said first responders falling ill or being forced into quarantine means their colleagues are working harder to fill vacant shifts.\n\nAD\n\nHe said paramedics are finding more people dying at home — in many cases not of covid-19. It is a phenomenon seen across the country, partly attributed to people's being afraid to seek treatment at hospitals during the pandemic.\n\nAD\n\nDonnelly lives in Manor Park in Northwest Washington with his wife, a city schoolteacher. They have a son who is a U.S. Army captain serving in Kuwait, a daughter studying to be an emergency medical technician in New York City and another son in high school. In his spare time, Donnelly volunteers with the Boy Scouts in the Brookland neighborhood of Northeast Washington.\n\nNot only was Donnelly among the first of the District's firefighters to contract covid-19, he donated his blood plasma in the search for treatments, and he later was among the first to be vaccinated against the novel coronavirus.\n\nAD\n\nFor him, the tumult brought on by the virus has an upside. Relationships built under stress, he said, are the ones that last.\n\nDonnelly started his firefighting career while still in high school, at the Allentown Road Volunteer Fire Company in Fort Washington, in Prince George's County.\n\nAD\n\nStill in his teens, he was struck by encountering people of different backgrounds, assembled in one place with a common goal of helping the community.\n\nTwo years later, he traveled to the West Coast, arriving in Cedarville, Calif., near the border with Nevada and Oregon — an hour and a half from a traffic light — with fire boots made for service in a city. He had to switch to gear more suitable for hiking as he set off to confront his first forest fire, which was ripping through 30,000 acres outside Reno, Nev.\n\nAD\n\nHe did not perform well.\n\nDonnelly said he was acting like a whiny teenager, and the fire commander threatened to send him home.\n\nHe turned himself around.\n\nBoy, did he help me grow up, the chief said. It was a lesson, and I was not going to be a failure.\n\nDonnelly returned home a short time later, taking firefighting jobs in Prince George's County and later at Reagan National Airport, before coming to the District in 1992. He helped during the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, commanded the EMS response to the mass shooting at the Navy Yard and at the four-alarm fire that burned the landmark Frager's Hardware on Capitol Hill in 2013.\n\nAD\n\nWhile working for the fire chief who preceded Dean, Donnelly was called on to help straighten up a department experiencing failures that led to delays in getting help to people in emergencies.\n\nAD\n\nDonnelly took on the unglamorous job of managing a fleet, then in disarray, with nearly half the department's firetrucks, engines and ambulances in disrepair or running without safety certificates. Firefighters were climbing ladders that had not been inspected, and help was not reaching people fast enough.\n\nDonnelly continued helping to improve the department when Bowser became mayor and hired Dean as chief. The two worked to restore credibility, and at his December confirmation hearing, Donnelly told lawmakers that for the first time in five years, every one of our apparatus that are in service are certified.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat means, Donnelly said, the vehicles stay in your community so they can help you when you need it.\n\nDonnelly carefully answered questions from council member Brooke Pinto (D-Ward 2) about lingering problems with dispatchers at the Office of Unified Communications, a separate D.C. agency also known as the 911 center. Firefighters have struggled recently with being sent to wrong addresses, which slows their response to critical emergency calls.\n\nDonnelly did not assess blame, and in a later interview, he said there are challenges we both face to get the system working to get the best outcome for all patients. In late December, the mayor's office announced that the director of the 911 center, Karima Holmes, was leaving for another job, and a national search for her replacement is underway.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe new chief said he plans to build on programs put in place under Dean, including hands-on CPR training given to tens of thousands of D.C. residents and workers. The technique is popular because it eliminates mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and emphasizes chest compressions to quickly pump blood to an oxygen-deprived brain. He said the cardiac arrest survival rate has doubled since 2014.\n\nDean and Donnelly developed a program in which nurses at the 911 center talk to patients calling in for help, diverting some away from hospitals and cutting back on unnecessary responses by EMT teams. Next year, Donnelly said, he wants to improve treatment for stroke patients and track their progress to determine whether paramedics can adjust their care to improve outcomes.\n\nDonnelly has been busy instilling core values that include first-responders thinking on their own.\n\nAD
Washington rookie defensive end Chase Young, who had a sack and a fumble recovery in Sunday's win, doesn't seem content with just making the playoffs, where a prime-time showdown with Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers awaits.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTom Brady, I'm coming! Young shouted as he skipped off the field. I want Tom!\n\nFail: Philadelphia's no-hat rule\n\nWe've got to have a no-hat rule this week, Eagles defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz said last week, explaining the motivation his team had to face Washington despite being eliminated from playoff contention. We can't let opponents put division win hats on at the Linc. There's a lot of pride in that, and all our focus has to be to accomplishing that this week.\n\nAfter Philadelphia allowed 70 points in its previous two games, Schwartz's defense did its best to enforce the rule, but it wasn't enough to prevent Washington from donning division champs gear as it headed off the field following an ugly win.\n\nHail: Washington's first drive\n\nAD\n\nWashington's opening possession was, for a change, a thing of beauty. After the defense forced a punt on Philadelphia's first drive, Alex Smith took over at his team's 9-yard line and proceeded to lead the offense 91 yards in 15 plays over the next eight minutes. The march, a mix of runs and passes, culminated in a touchdown grab by wide receiver Terry McLaurin.\n\nAD\n\nWashington avoided becoming the first NFL team this century to fail to score on its opening possession all season. New Orleans's offense didn't account for a first-drive score in 2004, but the Saints' Aaron Stecker returned the opening kickoff for a touchdown in Week 15 of that season.\n\nFail: Doug Pederson\n\nAD\n\nYes, I was coaching to win, Pederson, Philadelphia's coach, said of his decision to bench rookie quarterback Jalen Hurts for Nate Sudfeld, a sixth-round pick by Washington in the 2016 draft, with the Eagles trailing 17-14 in the fourth quarter. Nate has obviously been here for four years, and I felt that he deserved an opportunity to get some snaps.\n\nSudfeld leading a comeback to keep his former team out of the playoffs would've been rich, but it was not to be. On his third snap, he was intercepted by former Eagles safety Jeremy Reaves. On his next series, he fumbled a snap that was recovered by Young. He looked like someone who hadn't thrown a pass in a game since 2018.\n\nAD\n\nWhat was your reaction when Philadelphia put Sundberg in? NBC sideline reporter Michele Tafoya asked Smith after the game, before correcting her mispronunciation of Sudfeld's name.\n\nAD\n\nI didn't know if something had happened, Smith said. I didn't know if [Hurts] tweaked something. I didn't know if was because the rain kind of picked up at that point. I don't know if that had anything to do with it.\n\nNope. It was simply a coaching decision, which led to all sorts of criticism of Pederson for sabotaging his team's chances of winning the game.\n\nHail: Prime time in Philly\n\nWashington's struggles in prime time are well documented, but playing under the lights in the City of Brotherly Love has been an exception in recent years. For the second time in five seasons, Washington clinched an NFC East title with a prime-time win at Lincoln Financial Field. In 2015, Kirk Cousins led Washington to a 38-24 win the day after Christmas in Week 16. This year, it happened in the final game of the regular season. It's just a shame there weren't any Eagles fans in the stands to witness it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFail: Salty Giants players\n\nGiants players and fans were none too pleased with Pederson's personnel moves, as they needed a Philadelphia upset to claim the division title after knocking off the Dallas Cowboys earlier in the day. Considering the Giants would have become the first six-win team to qualify for the playoffs in a full season, it's hard to feel too much sympathy for their plight.\n\nHail: Terry McLaurin\n\nMcLaurin returned from a high-ankle sprain that sidelined him last week and had a game-high seven catches for 40 yards, including Washington's first touchdown. McLaurin said he felt a little sore and banged up as the game wore on, but his feelings didn't appear to be hurt too bad late in the first half when tight end Logan Thomas left him hanging after his own leaping touchdown grab. While Thomas focused on spiking the ball, McLaurin borrowed a page from Capitals forward Evgeny Kuznetsov's playbook and celebrated with himself.\n\nFail: Preseason predictions
In the letter, released Monday, Marine Corps Brig. Gen. William H. Seely III said that U.S. forces respect your sovereign decision to order our departure. A U.S. military official confirmed the letter's authenticity.\n\nBut on a day of confusion, Esper said he could not confirm the authenticity of the letter because he had seen it only after it was leaked, adding that it is inconsistent with where we are right now.\n\nGen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the letter incorrectly implies withdrawal and was a draft, it was a mistake, it was unsigned, it should not have been released.\n\nAsked whether the U.S. military was prepared to strike Iranian cultural sites, as President Trump has suggested, Esper said the military would follow the laws of armed conflict.\n\nEsper said that the United States remains prepared for any contingency with regard to Iran and that the message to Tehran is that the ball remains in their court.\n\nHere are key points of what we know:\n\n●The U.S. military said in a letter to Iraqi officials that it will reposition troops within Iraq in preparation for a possible withdrawal, but Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said shortly after that the United States has not made any decision to leave Iraq.\n\n●Gen. Mark A.

In a television interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corp., Sajjan said that the Iraqi parliament's decision to pass a nonbinding resolution calling on all foreign troops to leave the country created a complex situation. We know the current situation is now far more complicated, and we have to accept their process, he said, but it is more complicated than just one vote. Canada has hundreds of military personnel in Iraq as part of both the NATO mission and the global coalition fighting the Islamic State. It has suspended both of those missions, but Sajjan said he hopes they will continue. He told the CBC that Canada has taken the appropriate steps for force protection in Iraq and that some nonessential personnel have been moved out of the country in the wake of Soleimani's killing. Asked if U.S. officials had given Canada notice of their plan to kill the Iranian general, Sajjan said that Canada had an indication something was going to happen but did not know what was going to happen. In a television interview on Monday with CTV News, Sajjan condemned Iran's actions in the region but would not comment on whether he thought Soleimani's killing was legal. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted on Monday that he met with Sajjan and Jonathan Vance, the chief of the defense staff, in the morning. He said the safety of Canadians in the region is his top priority.

Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, denied reports that the intelligence that led to the U.S. killing of Soleimani was razor-thin. Speaking to reporters at the Pentagon, Milley said very, very few people saw the intelligence, which he said demonstrated that Soleimani was planning imminent operations against U.S. forces in the region. I would be happy when the appropriate time comes, in front of proper committees and anybody else, in history, I will stand by the intelligence I saw. That was compelling. It was imminent. It was very, very clear in scale/scope, Milley said. Did it exactly say who, what, when, where? No. But he was planning, coordinating and synchronizing significant combat operations against U.S. military forces in the region — and it was imminent, Milley added. Milley said he wouldn't give any more details about the intelligence because such a disclosure would jeopardize the sources and methods of the U.S. intelligence apparatus. I know people say, well, you're hiding behind it, and you lie. That's not true. I know what I saw, Milley said. Those of us who were involved in the decision-making of that, we would have been culpably negligent to the American people had we not made the decision we made, Milley added.

But Trump has actually spent closer to $420 billion on military equipment since he was elected, according to Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert and senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The rest of the money was spent on personnel, operations and maintenance, and research and development.

He said the potential targets represent the 52 Americans who were held hostage there for 444 days from 1979 to 1981. On Monday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani also invoked history in response to Trump's threat. Those who refer to the number 52 should also remember the number 290. #IR655 Never threaten the Iranian nation, he wrote. His hashtag #IR655 refers to Iran Air Flight 655, a commercial jet shot down by the U.S. military by mistake July 3, 1988, killing all 290 civilians and crew on board, including 66 children. Though the incident is nearly forgotten now in the United States, it is etched deeply in memory in Iran, where the country is mourning the U.S. airstrike that killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani.

McKenzie told him the draft letter was an honest mistake, but used other words that were a little more colorful than mistake, Milley said. The U.S. military drafted the letter because it is moving forces around the region, within Iraq and from Kuwait into Iraq, and anticipates increased helicopter movement, Milley said, noting that draft letters are often coordinated with partners in advance, but are circulated without the signature of the official sending the communication. The leaked letter wasn't signed. Milley said that McKenzie, the top U.S. commander overseeing the Middle East, said the letter should never have happened. We understand U.S. government policy — nobody is leaving, there's no onward movement, we got all that. Honest mistake. Draft, Milley said McKenzie told him. AD AD\n\nLink copied link Esper says U.S. has not made any decision to leave Iraq; Milley calls letter to Iraqi officials 'poorly worded' and 'a mistake' WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said during a briefing at the Pentagon that the United States has not made any decision to leave Iraq. We are repositioning forces throughout the region … beyond that, with regard to that letter, which I have read once, I can't tell you the veracity of that letter, I can tell you what I read, that letter is inconsistent with where we are right now, Esper said. Milley said the letter was a draft that the U.S. military sent to Iraqi military officials for coordination purposes but hasn't been signed or finalized. That letter — it was a draft, it was a mistake, it was unsigned, it should not have been released, Milley said. And the first part of it, which says 'repositioning forces over the course of the coming days to prepare for onward movement' … [was] poorly worded, implies withdrawal. That is not what's happening. Asked whether the U.S. military was prepared to strike Iranian cultural sites, as President Trump has suggested, Esper said the military would follow the laws of armed conflict. Asked whether that means no, because international law prohibits targeting such sites during war, Esper said: That's the laws of armed conflict. Esper said the United States remains prepared for any contingency with regard to Iran, and the message to Tehran is that the ball remains in their court.\n\nAD AD\n\nLink copied link U.S. military says it will reposition troops in Iraq in preparation for possible withdrawal WASHINGTON — In a draft letter released Monday, Marine Corps Brig. Gen. William H. Seely III said that U.S. forces will be relocated to prepare for onward movement and that we respect your sovereign decision to order our departure. A U.S. military official confirmed the letter's authenticity. The letter was released one day after Iraqi lawmakers passed a nonbinding resolution calling for foreign troops to leave the country. But because Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi resigned in November and is now acting only as a caretaker, he was not authorized to sign it into law. But a defense official speaking on the condition of anonymity said the letter was Gen Seely's attempt to notify the Iraqis that we are going to be moving people around Iraq … This is not an indication that we're leaving. The official said that because the United States had suspended at least some training activities, it was moving training-related forces out of Iraq and bringing force protection forces into the country. We're not making plans to leave, the official said. AD AD\n\nLink copied link Senators expected to be briefed by Pompeo, Esper, Milley and Haspel WASHINGTON — Senators are expected to receive a briefing Wednesday afternoon from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Mark Milley, and CIA director Gina Haspel about the strike on Soleimani, according to three people familiar with plans. House members are also expected to receive a similar briefing, but the time for their session had not been set as of midday Monday, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nLink copied link Iran releases satellite images showing crowds gathered for Soleimani's funeral WASHINGTON — Iran released photos Monday that showed massive crowds attending a funeral ceremony for Soleimani and others killed in the U.S. drone strike in Baghdad last Friday. Millions of people, most clad in black, attended the services Monday, according to Iranian state media. Other photos showed Iran's supreme leader, Khamenei, weeping as he presided over the ceremony.\n\nLink copied link Chevron pulls foreign workers out of Iraqi Kurdistan as 'precautionary measure' WASHINGTON — Chevron announced Monday that it has pulled out expatriates working in its oil fields in the Iraqi region of Kurdistan. A company spokesperson described it as a precautionary measure. The California-based oil giant shut down drilling in the region in 2015 because of the threat posed by Islamic State fighters at the time. Drilling resumed in 2017. For now, in contrast, work is continuing in the Kurdish fields with all-local workers. The company characterized the decision to withdraw foreign workers as not a huge evacuation, but it would not provide details on the numbers of people involved.\n\nLink copied link Pentagon tells force of 4,500 sailors and Marines to be ready to support Middle East operations if necessary WASHINGTON — The Pentagon has told the Bataan Amphibious Ready Group, a force of about 4,500 sailors and Marines aboard Navy ships, to be ready to support operations in the Middle East if required, a defense official said Monday, speaking on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue. The official declined to specify the location of the group, led by the amphibious assault ship USS Bataan. A second official said Friday that the ships were approaching the Mediterranean Sea and could be called upon if needed. The decision could bolster the number of U.S. troops in the region by about 10,000, as the Trump administration and Iranian officials threaten each other following numerous attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq and the U.S. killing of Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad last week. Those troop increases come on top of the Pentagon's deployment of an additional 14,000 troops to the Middle East in 2019, citing the need to counter Iranian aggression.\n\nLink copied link E.U. foreign ministers to hold emergency meeting Friday to respond to Iran crisis BRUSSELS — European Union foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting on Friday in Brussels to discuss how to respond to the escalating crisis with Iran, diplomats said Monday, including whether Europe starts the process that could lead to the eventual reimposition of sanctions on Iran. The unusual gathering will give Europeans a chance to coordinate plans among all 28 member states. Leaders have been reluctant to publicly condemn the United States for Soleimani's killing, focusing most of their ire on Iran, which they view as the core threat to their security interests. But they have invested more than a year of efforts to try to preserve the 2015 Iran nuclear deal following Trump's pullout. Many European diplomats view Soleimani's death as the final blow to hopes that the accord could hold together until the possible election in November of a U.S. president more supportive of the nuclear agreement than Trump. Iran on Sunday announced that it would take major additional steps to depart from the terms of the nuclear accord, although it stopped short of saying it would significantly increase its uranium enrichment. Europeans took that as a sign that Tehran is still interested in extracting concessions in exchange for returning to at least partial adherence to the deal, rather than walking away from it altogether. Triggering the process that could lead to the reimposition of sanctions would entail additional months of negotiations. If sanctions were reimposed, that would likely mark the end of any effort by Iran to uphold the deal.
But weeks after the Harrises' triumphant European tour, the White House unleashed a trade war with the European Union by slapping tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The E.U. retaliated with tariffs that made some American goods, including bourbon and rye whiskey, more expensive to import.\n\nCatoctin Creek's orders from Europe dried up, and a potential British distributor lost interest. He ghosted us like a bad girlfriend, Scott Harris said from the distillery's red-brick tasting room as a pair of shiny stills chugged away behind a plate-glass window. He just stopped answering the phone.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWashington's trade dispute with Europe may have faded from the headlines in recent months, eclipsed by grander tensions with China, but the fallout continues for many companies around the country that have long targeted Europe as an achievable export market.\n\nBarriers to Europe are especially vexing for small businesses, which often turn to the E.U. as their first export destination. The reliability of the legal system, the prevalence of English speakers and the high level of consumer income make it an easier market for small U.S. firms to navigate, entrepreneurs say.\n\nThe E.U.'s 25 percent tariffs have crimped the sales growth of a variety of U.S. exporters, including apparel companies, boat builders and peanut butter makers. Lee Zalben, founder of Peanut Butter & Co., a 15-person firm in Manhattan, said European buyers are canceling or trimming orders, or asking for discounts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nExports to the European Union make up less than 2 percent of the firm's revenue, but the company had been targeting Europe for sales growth, so we're having to find that growth in other areas, Zalben said.\n\nCatoctin Creek had been aiming to boost European exports from about 10­ percent of its sales in early 2018 to as much as 25 percent to take advantage of the hip profile American whiskey has developed overseas. Instead, exports have fallen to close to zero.\n\nIt's essentially decimated our European business, and it's put our expansion on hold, said Scott Harris, who has instituted a hiring freeze and put off buying new stills and fermentation tanks at the 20-person distillery on Purcellville's Main Street.\n\nAD\n\nEuropean officials are due to visit Washington next week to continue talks aimed at resolving the trade dispute.\n\nAD\n\nThe Office of the U.S. Trade Representative didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nBecky Harris, the chief distiller, said the slowdown also affects the company's suppliers. One of our [rye] farmers keeps asking when are we going to need more? she said.\n\nRivals are similarly discouraged. We've spent a lot of time and money to build up our business [in Europe], and to have it taken away with tariffs is frustrating, said Paul Hletko, founder of Few Spirits, a gin and whiskey distillery in Evanston, Ill., that employs about 100 people. The company's export volume fell by about 75 percent last year.\n\nCleveland Whiskey, an Ohio distiller with 15 employees, has lost about $150,000 in European revenue and has scrapped plans to hire two additional workers, said founder Tom Lix. He expressed frustration with what he sees as a self-inflicted wound. We started this, so I can't really blame [Europe], he said. We started this, and everything else was retaliatory.\n\nExports have become crucial in the whiskey business as the U.S. market grows crowded with craft distillers. When the Harrises co-founded Catoctin Creek in 2010, there were six distilleries in Virginia. Today there are 70 — and more than a thousand nationwide.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe boom has revived an industry that dates back to America's earliest English settlers, who made whiskey on the banks of Virginia's James River. George Washington eventually became one of the country's biggest distillers, producing more than 10,000 gallons of whiskey at Mount Vernon a year.\n\nWhiskey production withered in some parts of the country during Prohibition; when Catoctin Creek opened for business, it was the first legal distillery in Loudoun County since the 1920s.\n\nScott Harris, an engineer by training, had spent 20 years working in government contracting and wanted a change of pace. Becky Harris, a chemical engineer, was the brains behind the distilling process. If there is a fruit, vegetable, tuber with starch or sugar in it, you can bet that Becky will try to distill it, the company's website says.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe couple got a $250,000 small-business loan and renovated a former Buick dealership from the 1920s.\n\nOn a recent morning, a handful of employees filled and labeled bottles for shipping as a new batch of rye mash fermented in a large tank, filling the room with a sweet aroma.\n\nLater, the mixture will be pumped into a pair of German-made stills that will boil it and turn the alcohol into vapor, which will revert to liquid as it cools.\n\nCatoctin Creek did well in the U.S. market, but as competition grew, it found U.S. distributors weren't as interested in new products, Harris said.\n\nAbout five years ago, the distillery decided it wanted to crack Europe. It started investing in new bottles and labels that met E.U. standards, hired a European consultant, and began attending an annual trade show in Berlin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCatoctin Creek eventually found distributors in Germany and Italy, which helped get the company's whiskey into some high-end cocktail bars, Harris said.\n\nAll told, the company has spent about $100,000 on the effort, he said.\n\nEarly last year, the Harrises traveled to Britain to meet with a potential distributor and to market their whiskey to top hotel bars. They poured samples for buyers at London's famous Savoy and Claridge's hotels and struck a tentative agreement with a distributor in Manchester, Harris said.\n\nTwo weeks after they returned to the United States, the White House announced plans to levy tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the E.U. and elsewhere, calling the imports a threat to domestic production.\n\nPresident Trump announced on July 25 that the U.S. would work with the European Union to eliminate trade tariffs. (Reuters)\n\nThe E.U. soon threatened, and then enacted, retaliatory tariffs on a host of U.S. goods. Europe pointedly included products made in the home states of congressional Republican leaders Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and Mitch McConnell (Ky.), including motorcycles and whiskey, but the tariffs applied to producers nationwide.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn July, President Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker declared a truce in the trade war, promising to delay additional tariffs and to start negotiations toward a new trade deal. But they didn't roll back the tariffs levied earlier.
When it comes to the AFC East quarterback landscape, what a difference a year makes. At the end of the 2019 regular season, the New England Patriots had Tom Brady, the New York Jets were coming off a string of wins with Sam Darnold, the Miami Dolphins were assured of a top-five pick in the draft and a shot at a highly regarded prospect, and the Buffalo Bills still had question marks about the talented but very inconsistent Josh Allen.\n\nNow, having submitted a stunning campaign that put him on the fringes of the NFL MVP conversation, Allen is just about the only sure thing in the division.\n\nThe Patriots lost Brady in free agency and added Cam Newton late in last year's offseason, but after a promising start the 10th-year veteran showed why other teams were leery of taking a chance on him, while young backup Jarrett Stidham appeared to lose the confidence of Coach Bill Belichick. The Jets suffered through a miserable season that has landed them the No. 2 overall pick, and although it's not clear that they will part ways with Darnold, the former No. 3 pick in 2018 did nothing to help his cause with arguably his worst season in the NFL.\n\nThe Dolphins might be the most fascinating situation, because it's only recently become a fair question as to whether they might want to move on from Tua Tagovailoa. The former Alabama star, on whom they spent the fifth overall pick in 2020, did not exactly light up the league in nine starts this season, especially as compared to Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert, who went one pick after him in the draft.\n\nTagovailoa was careful almost to a fault, throwing just two interceptions in his first eight starts but averaging a subpar 6.3 yards per attempt as he generally eschewed shots downfield. Twice he was replaced late in games by veteran backup Ryan Fitzpatrick, but with the latter unavailable on Sunday, it was up to Tagovailoa to play well enough in Buffalo to ensure his team a playoff berth with a win. Instead, he played poorly, throwing three interceptions before connecting on a touchdown pass well after the outcome was decided in the Bills' favor. If Miami gets the No. 3 pick in this year's draft, which would convey from the Houston Texans after a 2019 trade, it might have quite a dilemma on its hands.
But some people close to the operation have grown worried that Biden is no longer a sure bet in this state's Feb. 29 primary and that his uneven performances on the campaign trail could dampen support. Some who once saw Biden as the strongest potential challenger to President Trump are looking at others, including billionaire Mike Bloomberg, who won't be on the ballot here but is competing in states that vote a few days later on Super Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlack voters in South Carolina really like Joe Biden, trust Joe Biden and respect Joe Biden, said Steve Benjamin, the mayor of Columbia and a Bloomberg supporter. But they are pragmatic and want to win and beat Trump. If your number one argument is electability, and you can't crack the top four in two or three states in a row, that's a tough argument to make.\n\nBiden's biggest challenge in the state has come from billionaire Tom Steyer, who is also betting his campaign on a strong showing here. While Biden has been trying — and failing — elsewhere, Steyer has been blanketing South Carolina with ads and organization.\n\nAsked whether Biden's campaign is in trouble, Dick Harpootlian, a longtime Biden friend and fundraiser, paused for two seconds and leaned back in his chair before saying no. Biden had 30 years of experience in South Carolina and could remind voters how many times he'd been in the state, how much he cared about middle-class people and his role backing President Barack Obama, Harpootlian said.\n\nI don't think it's in trouble. But I do think they have to apply the resources and focus on South Carolina if they're going to have the kind of win that sends a message, he said. They need to send more resources here to get the message out.\n\nBiden, addressing supporters here Tuesday night as New Hampshire results showed him running near the bottom of the field, portrayed South Carolina as friendlier political terrain for him — and more representative of the party.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUp until now, we haven't heard from the most committed constituency of the Democratic Party, the African American community, he said.\n\nThis account of Biden's increasingly important campaign in South Carolina is based on interviews with 39 party and campaign officials, activists, voters, political strategists and longtime political observers in the state, many of whom say Biden is underperforming.\n\nHis path to a potential resurrection here is further complicated by his surging rivals — Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg — who want to show in South Carolina that they can broaden their support beyond heavily white constituencies.\n\nAnd the impact South Carolina may have on the broader race remains unclear. Biden can ill afford another defeat in the Feb. 22 Nevada caucuses, which take place one week before the primary here, and the outcome here will be quickly swamped by Super Tuesday on March 3, when states including California, Texas and Virginia hold their primaries.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBiden has visited South Carolina eight times thus far, but aides say they expect a near-universal focus on the Palmetto State in upcoming weeks before the primary vote after his last-minute decision to speak there Tuesday night. The primary is heavily, though not entirely, African American and largely focused on the state's bigger cities, such as Columbia, Orangeburg, Charleston and Greenville.\n\nThe South Carolina primary will be one of the first contests in this process in which communities of color will have the opportunity to make their voices heard, said Biden senior adviser Symone Sanders, and our campaign has significantly increased its investments here, including with expanded television and radio ad buys covering the vast majority of the state's population.\n\nOn multiple fronts, Biden seems behind. He has 43 aides in South Carolina, a campaign spokeswoman said, while Steyer has 93, and Sanders has 72.\n\nSteyer has spent more than $14 million on radio and television commercials in South Carolina. Biden recently went on the air for the first time last week, campaign and party officials say.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe've seen more mail from Steyer than any candidate, times three, said Benjamin, echoing a sentiment from others in the state. Others said they had received so much mail and watched so many Steyer ads that it is a joke in their households that you cannot escape him.\n\nTry to watch an REM video on YouTube without seeing him, said Phil Bailey, a prominent Democratic consultant. You can't do it.\n\nDavid Bryant, a retired social worker from New York who lives in Columbia, said he was deciding between Steyer — whose name he at first struggled to recall — and Sanders. He said he liked Biden but had not seen a commercial from him or heard anything from his campaign, and he thought Biden, 77, lacked the vigor that some of the other candidates had.\n\nAD\n\nIf I thought he really wanted it, he'd be my first choice, Bryant said as he drove around Five Points, a bar district popular with college students. Biden don't seem to want it bad enough. He doesn't seem like he really wanted it.\n\nAD\n\nWhile serving ham biscuits and cheddar grits to churchgoers at Lizard's Thicket on Sunday, Joann Prince recounted calling Biden's campaign office to volunteer. But no one called me back, she said.\n\nEventually, Prince said she went to the campaign office, where she was assigned to door-knock in a poorer part of Columbia. Prince, who is in her 70s, went alone, with a script to remind black voters that Biden was Obama's vice president. Hardly anyone was home, she said, and most yards had signs warning of dogs.\n\nAD\n\nIt was a disaster, she said.\n\nPrince said she still likes Biden, but after dealing with his campaign, she is considering other candidates. I'm on the fence, she said.\n\nThere were few signs for Biden in yards around Columbia, and a recent visit to the Columbia field office gave no indication of bustle.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nSome party officials, lawmakers and strategists in Columbia say they have received little contact from Biden's campaign.\n\nCarol Fowler, a national Democratic committeewoman, said she had not received a call from Biden or his campaign asking for her support — though other candidates have called her. Some activists complained after Biden came to Abbeville to file his papers but did not meet with them.\n\nIf I do endorse, it will probably be someone who has called and asked me, she said, adding that Biden was still the favorite in South Carolina but seemed to be fading. A lot of undecided voters are just looking for someone who can beat Trump, and they are maybe looking to New Hampshire and other states more than in previous years.\n\nAD\n\nCampaign officials and some Biden allies say he has been in the state for decades, raising money for local officials and representing Obama as his vice president. Benjamin, the Columbia mayor backing Bloomberg, and others lauded Kendall Corley, his campaign manager in the state, as one of the best political operatives in South Carolina. Biden has more than 100 pastors across the state who have endorsed him. His aides dismiss the other primaries as dominated by white liberal voters and activists — not the type where Biden necessarily does well.\n\nAD\n\nState Sen. Marlon Kimpson, one of Biden's most prominent backers, was dismissive of Steyer's money and the notion that Biden's campaign is eroding. Even Ronald McDonald can move the needle with a billion dollars, he said.\n\nHe added: I think people are frustrated that [Iowa and New Hampshire], the first state that couldn't even get the results counted, and the second, a very small state, are setting the narrative. Neither is representative of the electorate. We have to let the race play out.\n\nAD\n\nOn a recent evening in Orangeburg, more than 500 people showed up to see Biden, eclipsing a similar Steyer event. Bernice Scott, a fierce Biden supporter who organizes door-knocking with 35 other women wearing shirts labeled The Reckoning Crew, said many black voters in South Carolina are not won over by Steyer or others.\n\nEverybody I talk to, they say, we know him, oh yeah, I'm supporting him, said Scott, a councilwoman and local activist.\n\nBut the Steyer campaign has worried advisers like Amanda Alpert Loveday, who runs Biden's super PAC in South Carolina and said Steyer's huge push into the state hurts because it eats into the margin.\n\nAD\n\nActivists and party officials say Steyer has visited South Carolina more than a dozen times, taking advantage of his foes focusing on other states.\n\nVolunteers for the Biden campaign have been instructed to tell potential supporters that Steyer is a good Democrat but lacks experience.\n\nOthers close to Biden have taken a more aggressive tack in criticizing Steyer, accusing him of paying supporters for their endorsements. Scott said she found it insulting that candidates like Steyer are spending so much money in the state when they have no history there. I can't be bought, and I won't be sold, she said.\n\nHarpootlian, Biden's longtime friend and golf buddy, recently accused Jerry Govan, a state lawmaker, of endorsing Steyer only because he was paid $43,000 by the campaign. Filings show that Govan was paid that sum for consulting.\n\nSteyer demanded an apology from Biden during Friday night's debate, which Biden did not give, and Govan called the charge that he was backing Steyer for money offensive.\n\nHarpootlian, a longtime bomb-thrower in the state, grinned on a recent morning when recounting the episode and his appearance in the debate. I'm sorry for causing a distraction, he said, when asked about Biden's comments during the Friday debate that Harpootlian was sorry. If they want to get in the weeds, I'm happy to get in the weeds with them.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanders has taken a different approach. Michael Wukela, a senior aide for the campaign, said Sanders is focused on places and issues where other candidates are not — a climate change town hall in Myrtle Beach, a Medicare-for-all breakfast in Florence and a visit to a shuttered hospital not far from Columbia.\n\nMore and more, the people we talk to don't like being taken for granted and somebody's firewall, Wukela said. People are tired of the status quo.\n\nOn a recent Monday, dozens of workers and volunteers were calling and plotting visits from the Sanders headquarters. A sign on the wall said the Bernie 2020 Wish List included folding chairs, water, juice, coffee, world peace, an espresso machine, snacks and Gatorade. The only item with a check mark was a microwave. The room looked like a College Democrats meeting.\n\nSipping a Bud Light on the back deck at the Salty Nut Cafe in downtown Columbia on Monday afternoon, Loveday, who leads the Biden super PAC, seemed largely untroubled. He could beat Trump. He could win South Carolina. Voters are too conservative to go for Sanders or other liberal candidates, said Loveday, who also works for a consulting firm.\n\nBut as she told stories of Biden taking photos as he held a fundraiser at her family's Charleston house, and being so distraught when he bowed out in 2016 that her mother sent her flowers, she conceded that it would probably be a dogfight.
Democrats kick off their presidential primaries and caucuses with February contests in four states. These states are small, contributing just 155 pledged delegates out of the Democratic total of 3,979, but they have an outsized role in the narratives that can determine the eventual nominee.\n\nTue., Feb 11 Sat., Feb 22 New Hampshire primary Nevada caucuses Mon., Feb 3 Iowa caucuses Sat., Feb 29 South Carolina primary Tue., Feb 11 New Hampshire primary Sat., Feb 22 Mon., Feb 3 Nevada caucuses Iowa caucuses Sat., Feb 29 South Carolina primary\n\nIn 2008, Barack Obama broke out of the pack with a surprisingly decisive Iowa win, putting him in a front-runner position he never relinquished. In 2016, Hillary Clinton countered a major victory by Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire with wins in Nevada and South Carolina, establishing a lead among nonwhite voters that guided her to eventual victory.\n\n[Which of these 2020 Democrats agrees with you most?]\n\nNone of the four states fully reflect America, and the least representative two go first. Taken together, though, the unique qualities of each mean several key blocs of voters get at least one opportunity to have an outsized role in the early nomination process.\n\nThe nomination starts rural, but then gets more urban\n\nLarge metro areas >1M Other metros <1M Small town Rural Iowa Sioux City Cedar Rapids Des Moines New Hampshire Manchester Nevada Reno Las Vegas South Carolina Greenville Columbia Charleston Large metro areas >1M Other metros <1M Small town Rural Iowa New Hampshire Nevada South Carolina Greenville Sioux City Reno Columbia Cedar Rapids Des Moines Charleston Las Vegas Manchester Large metro areas >1M Other metros <1M Small town Rural Iowa New Hampshire Nevada South Carolina Greenville Sioux City Reno Columbia Cedar Rapids Des Moines Charleston Las Vegas Manchester\n\nMore than half of Americans live in a large metropolitan area of more than a million people. But none of the February primary states fall near that average. Just one in 16 Americans lives in a rural county, and yet the nomination process begins in one of the most rural states in the nation. In fact, each of the four early states overrepresents a different kind of community.\n\nUnited States population Small town 8% 6 Metro 30% Large metro areas 56% Rural Iowa 59% 16% 25% New Hampshire 32% 31% 34% 4 Nevada 73% 17% 8% South Carolina 8% 77% 9% 6 Population distribution by counties\n\nIf Iowa gives rural voters a chance to be heard, New Hampshire is all about small towns; areas with towns of over 10,000 account for about a third of the state's population.\n\n[Iowa is a myth. Should we believe in it?]\n\nNevada falls at the other extreme: It is one of the most urbanized populations in the United States. The state's wide-open spaces are mostly empty of people, and three quarters of the state's population is packed into Las Vegas. South Carolina is uniquely urbanized in a different way. With no giant metro, South Carolina leads the nation with people in suburbs and smaller cities.\n\nThe last two have some diversity, but Iowa and New Hampshire do not\n\n\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden at a campaign event in Cedar Falls, Iowa, on Jan. 27. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nMinorities have little representation in the first two contests. States do not get much more heavily white than Iowa, with caucuses on Feb. 3 , and New Hampshire, which follows with a primary on Feb. 11.\n\nUnited States population Black Other White 61% 18% 12% Hispanic Asian Iowa 86% 6 3 New Hampshire 90% 4 Nevada 50% 29% 9% 8% South Carolina 64% 6 27%\n\nMore diversity enters the picture on Feb. 22 with the Nevada caucuses. Nevada has one of the highest concentrations of Hispanics in the nation, and South Carolina follows on Feb. 29 as one of the states with the highest share of African Americans. Nevada is one of the least white states in the country. While South Carolina still has roughly the same white population as the United States overall, the strong Democratic lean of its black voters means the primary is much more nonwhite than the state.\n\nThe position of the last two states in the February primary calendar is recent history. The Democratic Party moved them up for the 2008 election to offset the lack of diversity of New Hampshire and Iowa, and to represent more regions of the United States. In a Democratic National Committee vote, Nevada was selected over Arizona, and South Carolina was chosen over Alabama.\n\nOlder Democrats are overrepresented\n\nOlder adults, always among the most regular voters, play an oversized role in the earliest contests. Over a third of registered Democrats in Iowa and New Hampshire are age 65 or older, well above the U.S. average.\n\nJobs in goods industries Median household income Registered Democrats College education < 25 years old 65+ 9% 26% 32% $60K 19% US IA 7 34 25 28 59K NH 38 2 20 37 74K NV 9 26 13 24 58K SC 24 51K 9 21 27 Jobs in goods industries Median household income Registered Democrats College education < 25 years old 65+ 32% 9% 26% 19% $60K United States Iowa 7% 34% 25% 28% $59K New Hampshire 38% 2% 20% 37% $74K Nevada 26% $58K 9% 13% 24% South Carolina 9% 24% 21% 27% $51K\n\nWorkers in goods-producing industries like manufacturing and agriculture are also quite common in the early states, especially in Iowa and South Carolina. They may provide an insight into who could do well among blue-collar voters in key Midwestern swing states. But Nevada ranks near the bottom on workers who make or grow products. Service workers, who make up a lion's share of the national economy but get less attention politically — are the stars in Nevada, where Las Vegas union members are a critical voting block.\n\nSo who may be underrepresented in February? With the exception of New Hampshire, the residents of the early states have disproportionately lower income and levels of education. None of the states rank high in young registered Democrats, and workers in non-goods industries like technology or trade get short shrift as well.\n\nFew voters participate\n\n\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates Rep.

But the number of eligible voters is smaller, and the number that actually participates in the Democratic nominating process is smaller still.\n\nIn 2016, only about 900,000 Americans were part of these Democratic primaries and caucuses, placing critical decisions in the hands of about as many people as live in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nFewer Democrats participated in primaries than voted for Clinton in 2016 Each circle represents 10,000 votes Primary/caucus votes Clinton Votes Iowa 172,000 654,000 New Hampshire 251,000 349,000 Nevada 84,000 539,000 South Carolina 369,000 855,000 4 early states combined 876,000 2,397,000 Fewer Democrats participated in primaries than voted for Clinton in 2016 Each circle represents 10,000 votes Primary/caucus votes Clinton Votes 172,000 654,000 Iowa 251,000 349,000 New Hampshire 84,000 539,000 Nevada 369,000 855,000 South Carolina 4 early states combined 876,000 2,397,000\n\nWhy the big differences in turnout between the states? Iowa and Nevada hold caucuses, a time-intensive and extremely public method of voting that can drive people away. The Iowa and Nevada caucuses are both closed, but both do allow for same-day registration (with Nevada making the switch in 2019).\n\nNew Hampshire and South Carolina hold primaries instead. Those primaries are also open, meaning you do not need to be a registered Democrat to participate.\n\n[How do the Iowa caucuses work, and how are they different this year?]\n\nIn 2016, these early states made up just 3 percent Democratic primary voters. Yet their early influence far exceeded those numbers. In 2020 they set the stage for the March 3 Super Tuesday primaries, when 14 states with about 26 million Democratic registered voters will have their say.\n\nWhere the race stands in the next two primary and caucus states\n\nThe Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary are now over, if not conclusive. So candidates are moving on to the next two early states.\n\nAbout this story: This story is based on population demographics from the American Community Survey, voter registration data from L2 and election results from the Associated Press and the Elections Project.
Dear Amy: My boyfriend and I (we're gay) recently decided to get married, but my fiance and various family members suggest that we exclude my 92-year-old grandmother from the wedding.\n\nMy grandmother regularly shocks people. She says offensive and hurtful comments to everyone to elicit a reaction, regardless of the setting or situation.\n\nShe loves to call people fat or dumb, uses female pronouns for my fiance and me, and (our favorite) -- lights cigarettes indoors or in restaurants.\n\nShe's very with it and according to her doctors, exhibits no signs of senility. She was a soap opera actress in the '50s and '60s, so we think she just enjoys the attention.\n\nMy parents have talked to her about her behavior, and nothing has changed. My mother asked that we invite her.\n\nI called my grandmother and told her that I want to invite her to the wedding, but that I'm worried about her upsetting other guests. She laughed, and told me, That's just who I am; can't change now, and made it clear that she expects to be invited.\n\nHow should I manage this?\n\nFuture Groom\n\nFuture Groom: Your blowhard granny has thrown down the gauntlet by declaring her intention to offend others. If you definitely don't want her there, then don't invite her (her insults toward you and your fiance are reason enough to exclude her), but if including her is important to your mother, then you should consider it.\n\nYou might be able to marginalize Granny enough that you can reduce her from being the offensive center-of-attention, to the rude, eccentric elderly lady who keeps trying to smoke at the reception hall.\n\nLet her know that you actually do expect her to behave differently than usual while at your wedding. Don't hand her a microphone during the speechmaking. Ask a family member or caregiver to take her home if she becomes disruptive.\n\nDear Amy: I think I might be dating a liar. We've been together for three months. I am 28 and he is 34. I don't have any evidence to suggest that he has lied specifically to me, but I have seen him lie to other people.\n\nHe lies to his ex (with whom he has two children) in front of me. She will call and he will deliberately lie about something to get her off the phone. These are little lies, such as that he has something he needs to take care of. He will also call in to work with lies and excuses to get out of shifts.\n\nI am conflicted about this because the lies seem small. However, I don't understand why he feels the need to lie at all when the truth would suffice.\n\nIt is at the point where if he is late to dinner because work went late, I wonder if he is lying to me the same way I have seen him lie to others. Additionally, because he has lied to his ex about me, I wonder if he is seeing other women and is also lying about that.\n\nI don't really know if I am making something out of nothing. I am worried that if I bring it up to him he will just deny it and then try to be sneakier about it in the future.\n\nWorried\n\nWorried: Your boyfriend reflexively lies when telling the truth is awkward or inconvenient. You can assume that his behavior extends to you, as well.\n\nI can almost understand inventing an excuse to get off the phone with an ex-spouse (he needs to take these calls because they have children, but he doesn't need to stay on the call if it isn't important). Lying to get out of a work shift, however, is another story. At 34 years old, he should be able to commit to working when he is supposed to.\n\nIf you are determined to take your relationship to another level, you should be able to discuss almost anything with him, including this, without fear that the discussion would make his behavior worse.\n\nDear Amy: Your response to Outmuscled was so sexist. His girlfriend was stronger than he and regularly challenged and beat him in arm wrestling. Why didn't you tell him to leave this abusive relationship?\n\nDismayed\n\nDismayed: I pointed out that if Outmuscled was a woman, I would definitely tell him to leave. I agree with your implication that this behavior is abusive. If she won't stop outmuscling him, he should definitely leave.
