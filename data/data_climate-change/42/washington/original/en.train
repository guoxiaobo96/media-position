the call, an audio recording of which was obtained by the washington post's amy gardner, was as outrageous as it was chilling. legal experts can debate how close to the line trump was with the telephone call. others can speculate about the president's current state of mind. the content of the call speaks for itself, and the audio excerpts should be heard by anyone who cares about the integrity of elections in america.\n\nhere was a desperate president alternately begging, pleading, cajoling and, yes, seeming to threaten a state official — and fellow republican — by asking for a change in the outcome of an election that already had been recounted and then certified.\n\nthe president was not arguing facts or offering evidence. having failed time and again with multiple lawsuits brought by his campaign's legal teams or their allies, all of which were rejected by the courts, trump had nothing of substance to offer, just bluster and the baseless claims that he has made nonstop since he lost. he was trolling with rumor, innuendo (and the muscle that comes with calling from the white house), attempting one more time to bully and intimidate raffensperger.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nat one point, trump told the secretary of state: all i want to do is this. i just want to find 11,780 votes [biden won the state by 11,779 votes], which is one more than we have. because we won the state.\n\nat another point, he claimed that he had won by hundreds of thousands of votes. at another, he offered that he had heard rumors of ballot shredding in fulton county, home to atlanta.\n\nraffensperger has endured verbal abuse and threats to his safety throughout the entire process of counting, recounting and certifying georgia's results. he has stood firm, as he did once again on saturday, pushing back politely and repeatedly saying that the president's statements were incorrect.\n\nad\n\nryan germany, the general counsel to the secretary of state, was similarly direct when trump claimed that voting machines had been removed or in some way tampered with. no, he said. asked whether he was sure of this, he said: i'm sure. i'm sure, mr. president.\n\nad\n\ntrump will never let this go, not between now and the day he is forced to give up the office and biden is sworn in, not in the days and weeks and months after that. that he is on a mission is evident, but to what end, other than to avoid the ignominious label of loser after a single term in the white house? that, at least, is consistent with the behavior he has exhibited throughout the four years of his presidency. he cares nothing about collateral damage to democracy.\n\nthe president, however, is not on this mission alone. instead, he continues to gather support from members of a party he has remade in his own image. on wednesday, members of the house and the senate will meet to approve the results from the electoral college. those results show that biden won 306 votes to trump's 232. vice president pence will be in the chair, ultimately to read out that he and trump have lost the election, as a few other vice presidents have done in the past.\n\nad\n\nbut there will be objections in both chambers, debates and votes, prolonging what is normally a pro forma process and a brief way station to the transfer of power. trump's many allies in the house have made it clear that they will object to the results from a handful of states.\n\nad\n\nfor a time, it was questionable whether any member of the senate would do so. now there are a dozen, led by sen. ted cruz (r-tex.), who plan to challenge those results. pence added his support to those efforts.\n\ntheir argument is that, because there are allegations of improper voting or counting, congress should step in by appointing a commission to run a 10-day audit of disputed states and then those states could call special sessions to evaluate the findings and, if necessary, certify new results. it's difficult to imagine that this crash investigation of states, some of which have already scrubbed and rescrubbed their results, would produce something new.\n\nad\n\nfor the most part, these republicans claim they are not actually seeking to overturn the election results but only want to give voice to the allegations and the concerns of people who question the results — people who have been told repeatedly by trump and his allies that the allegations of fraud are in fact actual fraud. yet they persist.\n\nad\n\nthe republicans who will object are acting on the basis either of fear of the president or sheer political opportunism, or both. some are weighing a 2024 presidential campaign and know that being on the wrong side of trump could mean certain defeat.\n\nsome of the republicans who have joined this effort point to 2004, when a few democrats objected to the election results in ohio. but in that case, john f. kerry, the democratic nominee, disavowed the effort. others point to 1877, when a commission was appointed to resolve a dispute about the 1876 results. but in that case, unlike now, several states had not been certified in the electoral college.\n\nad\n\nthe party is now fracturing over the efforts to disrupt wednesday's procedure. after sen. josh hawley (r-mo.) became the first senator to announce that he would raise objections when congress meets this week, sen. ben sasse (r-neb.) rebuked the institutional arsonist members in both houses, saying they were playing with fire by raising objections without evidence of fraud on a scale that would overturn the election.\n\nad\n\nin the wake of the announcement on saturday by cruz and his colleagues, other republicans have weighed in with caustic criticism. sen. mitt romney (utah) called what cruz and the others are doing an egregious ploy that dangerously threatens our democratic republic. . . . i could never have imagined seeing these things in the greatest democracy in the world. has ambition so eclipsed principle?\n\nformer house speaker paul d. ryan (r-wis.) issued a statement sunday that said that the efforts to upend the electoral college results strike at the foundation of our republic, adding that he could not think of a more anti-democratic and anti-conservative act than a federal intervention to overturn the results of state-certified elections and disenfranchise millions of americans.\n\nad\n\ncompare ryan's statement with the behavior of house minority leader kevin mccarthy (r-calif.), who added his name to the more than 100 house republicans who joined an ill-fated texas lawsuit to overturn the results in four states, a move that was summarily dismissed by the supreme court, and who by some accounts had lent quiet support to the efforts by house members to object on wednesday.\n\nad
the team\n\nit all begins with recruiting the right people to your team. this includes every position–sales specialist, a marketing associate, staff accountant, it specialist, etc. these players are critically important to the success of the firm. however, their success is reliant upon excellent coaching. in football, that comes from coaching specialists – quarterback coach, receivers coach, linebackers coach, etc. in companies, it comes from people at the middle-management level who lead teams within the team – director of digital marketing, director of financial planning, director of it operations, etc. then of course you have the most senior executives — the chief information officer, chief marketing officer, and other c-suite executives or high-level vice presidents. much like the offensive coordinator and defensive coordinator, they head up major units within the team. finally, the head coach in business is the chief executive. to be a top nfl football team, you need players with talent who are developed by the various coaches. you need excellent coaches who know how to guide, develop and teach these players how to be at their best at their respective positions. it is critical that the coaching staff lead and get players to perform as a team, with the same ultimate mission – to win the game. every business needs to operate this way. identify great talent, develop the talent and teach them how to play as a team.\n\nad\n\nad\n\npreparation\n\nin football, teams have several days to prepare for the next game. this involves studying the playbook, studying the films of the other team in action to glean as much information as possible to create the best game plan to win. every business should do the same. let's say you are in consumer product sales and have an upcoming appointment with a fantastic retailer prospect currently working with your competitor. prepare properly: study the retailer, your potential customer. read everything you can about them – an annual report, a 10k and news releases. study their stores, making your own observations, particularly in the area where they are selling your products. finally, study your competitor who currently has the business, trying to understand how you can differentiate from them in a way that will give you a competitive advantage. this strategy applies to many aspects of business: if you have a new project to work on, you must do the proper research and homework, collecting enough data to create a strong plan or playbook for accomplishing your objective.\n\ncalling an audible\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin a football game, the quarterback may spot an unexpected defensive set and he may change the play on the spot by calling an audible. your business is the same way. even with outstanding preparation, dynamic circumstances may require a pivot or adjustment to your plan. in business it's important to be nimble and flexible to make necessary adjustments along the way.\n\nexecution\n\nan nfl team may have fantastic players and coaches and they may have done an outstanding job in preparing for the game. however, for 60 minutes on the field they must execute as flawlessly as possible or risk losing the game. it is incredibly frustrating for the team (and the fans) when they make mistakes during the game — dropped footballs, missed tackles, fumbles, interceptions. to keep this from happening, flawless execution requires excellent communication between members of your team, with each anticipating the other's move. this means playing well together, supporting each other and maintaining focus. if someone makes a mistake, don't assign blame; work harder together as a team and support each member to keep these mistakes to a minimum and improve each day.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nget ready for next week\n\neven great nfl teams usually lose a few games in a season. but during the regular season, there is no time to wallow in a loss – they have to prepare for next week's game. it's the same for you in your business. you will not always win. it's important to learn from your loss or setback and make adjustments to your strategy or game plan for future opportunities. it's time to get over your recent loss and begin preparing for that next game, working on being at your best.\n\nthe next time you watch an nfl game, think about the work ethic that is involved in the preparation, potential pivots and overall execution. put these practices in place and put your business team in a position to win.
that does not mean, however, that there are no ideas, no intellectual energy and no depth coming from those on the right. rather, it means these are from outcasts, struggling to sprout in a field of anti-intellectualism and rank dishonesty. who are these people? what are they saying?\n\nfar and away the most interesting ideas factory on the right these days is the niskanen center, a sort of haven for lapsed libertarians who've discovered that simply shrinking government or disabling it is not a moral good. it's put out two of the most important pieces on the future of the right, the center can hold: public policy for an age of extremes (discussed here) and republicanism for republicans. the latter, written by the center's vice president for policy brink lindsey, postulates:\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin the republican worldview, all americans are real americans, because we all pledge allegiance to one nation under god, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. as lincoln said in his first inaugural address, we are not enemies, but friends, because we are all members of one, all-embracing body politic. we're all in this together. this civic conception of patriotism stands in stark contrast to the blood-and-soil conception increasingly evident on the conservative right. . . . such attitudes and rhetoric are utterly poisonous.\n\nlindsey suggests a new political foundation based on devotion to democratic institutions, to the public interest, or the common weal — the values that we share across ethnic, regional, sectarian, and class lines and that require collective action for their advancement, to constructive governance (shrinking government just to make it smaller is not the goal, [but] hostility toward corruption and wastefulness does push toward making government simpler and more transparent) and to resisting concentrations of power and wealth (the basic intuition here is that freedom requires a level of personal independence among the citizenry, and that in turn requires a broad middle class and limited extremes of wealth and poverty. in the republican view, excessive imbalances of power and status undermine government in the public interest because both the rules themselves and their administration will end up slanted in favor of the powerful.).\n\nthis becomes something new from trumpian illiberalism and libertarian indifference to the public good:\n\nopposition to domination leads simultaneously toward a deep appreciation of markets and the recognition of a vital supporting role for government. competitive markets are a bulwark of independence because they encourage a proliferation of options; they are an important check against arbitrary power because they subject market actors to accountability at the hands of their customers. but for market competition to operate as intended, government has a few big jobs to do. first, it must provide and enforce rules that structure and sustain competition; second, it must secure the broad enabling conditions that allow people to participate successfully in the market system and protect them from the hazards of life when their participation goes awry.\n\nthen there are conservatives and defenders of the rule of law striving to remind us of four core conservative principles: free trade, robust legal immigration, defense of the rule of law and opposition to aggressive authoritarian regimes, including russia. an umbrella organization dubbed defending democracy together takes on tariffs, anti-immigrant exclusionism and assaults on the constitution and democratic norms. the group also urges republicans to return to american leadership in the world and defense of free peoples:\n\nthese four principles used to be assumed as central to modern conservatism. now they are under assault from self-labeled guardians of the right. while many aspects of gop policy of the past few decades (especially outright hostility to government) aren't worth saving, these four clearly are, for they nurture a free and diverse citizenry, promote innovation and social mobility, and adhere to the vision set out in our founding documents.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nrepublicans, ex-republicans and independents should not give up these principles simply because the gop has abandoned them and become enamored of statism, authoritarianism, xenophobia and russian toadyism — impulses inimical to anyone who had a passing familiarity with the sort of conservatism practiced by ronald reagan and george h.w. bush, the late senator john mccain (r-ariz.) and govs. larry hogan of maryland, john kasich of ohio and charlie baker of massachusetts. that half of the people on that list passed away and one is leaving office tells you how lacking we are in decent center-right leadership.
this group has had as good an attitude day in and day out as anyone i've coached, he said thursday afternoon. but they're still kids. and being ranked that high got their attention. they noticed — had to. i knew i was going to have my hands full before the baylor game.\n\nsure enough, west virginia had a brutal shooting night tuesday against the bears, making just 31 percent from the field. leading scorer jevon carter, who was averaging more than 16 points, was 2 for 7 and finished with eight points. baylor outrebounded the mountaineers 44-36, the kind of number that might set off huggins's defibrillator, which he has had since a heart attack more than 15 years ago.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ni always tell the guys that playing a basketball game is a little bit like playing a scramble in golf, huggins said. you don't have to be great on every play as long as one of your teammates is great and you do your part when you're needed. against baylor, we would have lost the scramble.\n\nonly they didn't. carter, arguably the country's best defensive player, hit a three-pointer with 57 seconds left, and west virginia survived, 57-54. it was the 15th straight victory for wvu since an opening-night loss to texas a&m in germany.\n\nit isn't going to get any easier anytime soon. the big 12 schedule is unrelenting. on saturday afternoon, west virginia fell, 72-71, at no. 8 texas tech, which is 15-2, including a win at kansas . forty-eight hours later wvu comes home to play kansas, which has won the past 13 regular season titles in the big 12. there is one break in the league schedule between now and march for the big 12-sec challenge the last weekend in january:\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe mountaineers will play kentucky.\n\nnothing but easy games, huggins said in his always-dry tone. the big 12 has no bottom this year. no matter who you play, night in and night out, you drop off at all, you're going to get beat.\n\nall coaches talk about how strong their conferences are and how every night is a challenge. the big 12 actually is that way this season, in part because there are only 10 teams. no one is truly bad, unlike the 15-team acc, which, for all its strength up top, drops off at the bottom. at least half of the big ten's 14 teams will be thrilled to play in the nit. same in the pacific-12 and the southeastern.\n\nhuggins loves the challenge night in and night out. he's 64 and has been a head coach for 36 years. he has won 834 games and taken both cincinnati (1992) and west virginia (2010) to the final four. there have, of course, been rocky moments along the way. although he took cincinnati to 14 straight ncaa tournaments and reached the elite eight twice in addition to the final four run, huggins developed a reputation for leading a renegade program. the bearcats were placed on ncaa probation in 1998 for wide-ranging violations, though huggins wasn't directly implicated. he also came under fire for his team's graduation rate, notably when a 1999 report cited the fact that it had been at zero for three years.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe number was misleading. huggins had recruited a number of junior college players who could not be counted as graduates in any case, and he had had a number of players leave early to play in the nba or europe. the ncaa has since changed those standards so that those players no longer count against a school.\n\nin huggins's 10 seasons at west virginia, his players have graduated at a rate that has floated between 80 percent (this past year) and 100 percent (2012). carter, the team's star, has a 3.6 grade-point average.\n\nwhen those stories first came out, yeah, they were upsetting, huggins said. i knew the number didn't tell the real story. i also knew that people believe what they want to believe. it was a long time ago, though. i'm long over it.\n\nad\n\nwhen i lost my job at cincinnati [in 2005], i had calls and notes from every president i ever worked for offering to help me any way they could. that was all i needed.\n\nad\n\nthe president who forced him to resign was nancy l. zimpher. she had apparently decided huggins's graduation numbers — deceiving or not — along with a 2004 dui were enough to allow her to make a change, although cincinnati had to pay huggins $3 million to leave .\n\nhe sat out the 2005-06 season, probably not a terrible thing for someone who had survived a massive heart attack in september 2002 at age 49. twice, he flatlined in a pittsburgh hospital, but he was back in time for the first day of practice three weeks later.\n\nad\n\nafter one season at kansas state, he couldn't resist the chance to come home to west virginia, an opportunity that arose when john beilein left to take the michigan job.\n\ni love this state, huggins said. this is my home, and i love the people here and my life here.\n\nhis two brothers and four sisters are at almost every home game. he's the oldest and likes to say, i've been number one my whole life.\n\nad\n\nhe no longer worries about those who bring up the graduation rate at cincinnati or the dui or the forced resignation. he loves where he is and the team he's coaching now.\n\ni've had more talented teams than this, he said. there's no one on this team with [nick] van exel's explosiveness or danny fortson-like ability or kenyon martin's talent. we don't have anyone like da'sean [butler]. but we do have kids who are smart, who are tough and who love to work and compete. the kind of team i love to coach.\n\nad\n\nhuggins may not show it outwardly, but he's happy again.\n\nhe insists he doesn't know how long he will coach unless . . .\n\ni've always said my dream is to bring a national championship to west virginia, he said. then i'd take the trophy, we'd put it on a bus and we'd go to every town in the state. we'd have [west virginia play-by-play man] tony caridi on every radio station saying, 'smithers, come on out, the trophy's arriving in 15 minutes.' we'd have everyone touch it, hold it, take a picture with it.\n\nad\n\nhe paused. then, he added, i think i'd be done. there'd be nothing left to do.\n\nfor more by john feinstein, visit washingtonpost.com/feinstein.
but as mike tyson famously said, everybody has a plan until they've been punched in the mouth. when it comes to covid-19, we're being punched in the mouth over and over again. it's time to change the plan; namely, we should give people a single vaccination now and defer their second shot until more doses of vaccine become available.\n\nad\n\nwhat changed? first, there's simply a supply constraint. we hoped that additional vaccines would be available by now. but only the pfizer and moderna vaccines have been authorized, and they're being produced more slowly than hoped. even more worrisome are the distribution bottlenecks that are making it difficult to vaccinate people as quickly as possible.\n\nad\n\nas of jan. 1, the united states has given first vaccine doses to about 1 percent of our population. contrast this with israel, which has vaccinated 10 percent of its population, including more than 40 percent of people older than 60. the benefits of the immunity these shots produce accrue not just to those getting vaccinated, but to broader society as well by slowing the virus's spread. until a lot more people are vaccinated, this latter benefit will be minimal.\n\nanother factor is the state of the pandemic: hundreds of thousands of people are being infected and thousands are dying every day. any high-risk person who isn't vaccinated today could be infected tomorrow and die in a month. but we are holding back half of the doses in reserve for people to get their second shots. that slows things down.\n\nad\n\nnow comes another punch to the mouth: the new variant of the coronavirus, which is likely much more contagious and is spreading rapidly in multiple u.s. communities. epidemiological models and britain's experience indicate that, while only a few cases of the variant have been identified in the united states, it will likely become our dominant strain within a few months. although the new variant doesn't seem deadlier at the individual level, a more infectious virus means more cases, which means more hospitalizations and deaths. we need to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible to save the most lives.\n\nad\n\nwhether the bottleneck is due to vaccine production or distribution, giving people a single shot now and waiting on the second until the shortage abates will get more people vaccinated sooner. but will it work? here, the clinical trial results for the pfizer and moderna vaccines are reassuring. while they were designed to test the effectiveness of two shots given about a month apart, both showed that the first shot had a substantial benefit beginning around 10 days afterward. in both trials, by the time of the second shot, the first was already 80 to 90 percent effective in preventing covid-19 cases.\n\nacross the united states, limited funding has undermined end-of-year efforts to hire coronavirus vaccine staff, create vaccination centers and raise awareness. (reuters)\n\nwe are not arguing against people receiving two shots. the second shot adds a measure of effectiveness and likely makes vaccination-derived immunity more durable. that's why we're advocating that it be delayed, not dropped altogether. and an argument can be made that for groups at highest risk for exposure (such as health-care workers) and for death (such as americans over age 75), sticking with the early second-shot strategy is reasonable. but for everyone else, the deferral strategy makes sense.\n\nad\n\nis there any potential downside to a delay? yes. the strategy hasn't been studied, so we don't know if and when the immunity from the first shot begins to wane. but data from moderna, for example, is reassuring. it shows robust immune response four weeks after the first shot, and most experts believe it is extremely unlikely immunity would somehow plummet by week eight or even week 12 following a single shot. another concern is that with a delay, some people may forget to get their second shot. it will require effort to track people and remind them to receive it.\n\nad\n\na more general risk is that this would be yet another change in our pandemic strategy at a time when people have grown weary of our ever-changing response regarding opening schools, touching surfaces and wearing masks. if this change causes them to become exasperated and choose not to be vaccinated at all, that would be a problem. but we believe the advantages of rapidly vaccinating twice as many people would outweigh these potential disadvantages.\n\nin a perfect world, there would be no trade-offs. but if 2020 taught us anything, it's that we don't live in a perfect world. between 50,000 and 100,000 americans will die of covid-19 this month alone. giving 100 million people — particularly those at high risk — a single shot that is 80 to 90 percent effective will save far more lives than giving 50 million people two shots that are 95 percent effective. it's what we should do.\n\nad\n\nwatch the latest opinion video:\n\nread more:
next week, the weather pattern is going to flip. instead of a cold-east, warm-west configuration, we will have the reverse. the jet stream, which has plunged over the east allowing arctic cold to spill south along its path, will seesaw, allowing mild air from the southwest to surge north.\n\ntemperatures will respond to this pattern change by thawing in a glorious way. we may be near 50 by tuesday and in the vicinity of 60 on friday.\n\nad\n\nboth the american and european models forecast the potential for 60-degree weather next friday. of course, these forecasts become less reliable with time. hopefully, they are not fools' gold. but, even if we don't see 60 degrees, it's safe to say temperatures will average above their normal highs in the low 40s next week. when the average high over the past 10 days has been in the upper 20s, that's progress.\n\nad\n\ni must end with a word of caution, however. seldom does arctic air exit gracefully.\n\non monday, a storm system will track through the region as the cold air is starting to erode. some model simulations earlier this week had predicted a nasty, wintry mix of sleet and freezing rain. with the ground so cold, that would be trouble.\n\nhowever, the latest models suggest the system will be weak and that temperatures should warm above freezing before precipitation moves in late monday, except well north of washington. most likely, this means just some plain, light rain in the immediate d.c. area.
almost anybody who comes into it with the attitude of, 'this is nothing, i got this,' when they get off the ice, [they say], 'this was way different than what i expected,'  rockenbach said, and they'll gain a lot more respect for the game.\n\nad\n\ntucked away in a small corner rink at the gardens ice house in laurel, md., rockenbach and others at the nonprofit potomac curling club welcomed media members monday morning for an information session in preparation for the expected spike in interest leading up to the winter olympics next month in pyeongchang. about a dozen media members were in attendance to get footage and also try their hand at the sport that is referred to by some as chess on ice for the cerebral nature of the game.\n\nad\n\ncurling remains largely a novelty in the united states and its athletes often feel the need to defend themselves against silly jokes or insults, but there are signs that the olympic interest has had lasting positive effects. potomac curling club, which is the only organization with a rink solely for curling in the washington area, gained and retained about 60 new members during the last olympic cycle, according to rockenbach. and as the sport grows, the respect will come, club members hope.\n\nit's not there yet but it's certainly improving, rockenbach said. there's more money in top level events, purses are getting bigger and we're getting more competitive players out of the u.s. … i'm really interested to see what happens in next olympic cycle or two.\n\nthe goal of the game is to get more 40-pound granite stones close to the center (the button) of a circular target on the ice (the house), than the opposing team. curling involves two teams made up of four players: the lead, the second, the third (or vice) and the skip.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nteams alternate taking shots during which a player is either sliding a stone (two stones per player), sweeping the ice in front of the stone or watching the action from the house.\n\nto some it might look like the easiest path to the olympics, but talk to any competitive curler, and they'll tell you about the many misconceptions about the sport: no, the players don't use skates; yes, it's much more difficult than it looks on television. and while there is certainly a social aspect to the sport, like bowling, elite curlers are serious about their fitness.\n\na lot of strength comes from the core. if you have good core, you have good balance, said 21-year-old hunter clawson, who is ranked internationally. leg workouts are important for driving out and making the big weight takeout shots, and the sweepers are putting a lot of weight on the upper body.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nclawson isn't your average weekend curler. tall and slim, he looks every bit like the former high school varsity lacrosse player he was at river hill high in clarksville.\n\ngrowing up, clawson also participated in myriad niche sports that his father, eric, introduced him to, including white-water kayaking, rock climbing, badminton and karate.\n\nbut it was curling that stuck. clawson joined the potomac curling club in 2008 and has become one of the club's most accomplished curlers since it was founded in 1961. he was part of the united states team that finished third at the olympic trials men's event in november. some members believe that clawson could be the club's first olympian.\n\nhe is very focused, very precise and willing to put in the work required to get there, said clawson's father. he's very dedicated both in fitness and in the actual sport of curling, in terms of strategy. he's watching the game and coming out to practices.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nclawson's younger brothers, 20-year-old caleb, who represented team usa in the 2017 mixed world championships and 17-year-old eli, are also high-level curlers.\n\nthe curling insults don't really bother clawson. he knows he's an athlete. but he wishes that the sport were on television more often. during the 2014 sochi winter olympics, an eye-popping 5 million people watched curling coverage on various channels in one day.\n\nby having more curling on the air, clawson reasons, more people would be exposed to the sport and maybe even understand it, including those who joke with clawson that he must be great at cleaning his house. (for those wondering, he says he's not.)\n\nad\n\nthe only thing that bothers me about those comments is that we haven't done enough to educate america about the sport, clawson said. there's a lot of interest in the sport and we just have to make that connection between the sport and the people interested in it.
known to his family and friends as tommy, the second-year student at harvard law school — an animal lover, committed vegan and moral philosophy devotee — recently found the pain of his illness overwhelming and unyielding and unbearable, his parents wrote.\n\non the last hellish brutal day of that godawful miserable year of 2020, their statement said, when hundreds of thousands of americans and millions of people all over the world died alone in bed in the darkness from an invisible killer disease ravaging their bodies and minds, we also lost our dear, dear, beloved son, hannah and tabitha's beloved irreplaceable brother, a radiant light in this broken world.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhe left us this farewell note on new year's eve day: 'please forgive me. my illness won today. please look after each other, the animals, and the global poor for me. all my love, tommy.' \n\na private funeral is planned for tuesday, and the raskin family announced last week that they had created the tommy raskin memorial fund for people and animals, which was being set up through the greater washington community foundation.\n\non monday, house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) told democratic lawmakers that president-elect joe biden — who lost his wife and young daughter in a car crash decades ago and his son beau to cancer in 2015 — had spoken with raskin to offer condolences.\n\nad\n\nthe two-term congressman and his wife, a former top treasury department official, described their son's life in glowing and vivid terms, from his youth in takoma park, md. — making mischief, kicking the soccer ball in the goal, acting out scenes from to kill a mockingbird with his little sister in his father's constitutional law class — to his final years in the classroom.\n\nad\n\nhe spent last fall as a teaching assistant in a harvard law justice course, meeting with students on zoom, finding what was precious in their work and teasing it out, the raskins wrote. a devotee of the effective altruists, he donated half his teaching salary to help save people with malaria by purchasing mosquito nets with global charities. once the course was finished, he made donations in each of his students' names to oxfam, givedirectly and other groups targeting global hunger.\n\nwhen i asked him why he did this, he quoted something that he loved which father daniel berrigan said about dorothy day: 'she lived as though the truth were true,'  the statement continued. tommy said: 'i wanted them to see that the truth is true.' \n\nthomas bloom raskin was born jan. 30, 1995, and became the middle child between his older sister, hannah, and younger sister, tabitha. his parents described a vast array of interests and habits as he grew up: playing jazz piano like a blues great from bourbon street; teaching other children the names of all the justices on the supreme court; hugging strangers on the street.\n\nin high school he loved the debate team, where he had to be constantly reminded by his teammates that the purpose of high school debate tournaments is to score points and not convince people of the truth or change the world, his parents wrote.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhe hated cliques and social snobbery, never had a negative word for anyone but tyrants and despots, and opposed all malicious gossip, stopping all such gossipers with a trademark tommy line — 'forgive me, but it's hard to be a human.' \n\ntommy graduated from amherst college, like his mother, before pursuing a law degree at harvard law school, following in the footsteps of both his parents.\n\nwe have barely been able to scratch the surface here, but you have a sense of our son, they wrote toward the end of the tribute, before describing his battle with depression.\n\ndespite very fine doctors and a loving family and friendship network of hundreds who adored him beyond words and whom he adored too, the pain became overwhelming and unyielding and unbearable at last for our dear boy, this young man of surpassing promise to our broken world.
ant! farello barked again. quit dancing with the ball!\n\ni got it, coach, harris said under his breath, and the next time the junior touched the ball he went coast-to-coast, squeezed his body between two dematha defenders and scored in a crowd around the rim. it took him no more than four seconds to burst from inside his own paint to atop dematha's, and the layup accounted for two of his 20 points in no. 1 paul vi's 93-78 road win over the no. 3 stags. harris, who was watched by virginia tech coach buzz williams and assistant christian webster, showed his ability to get to any spot on the floor, flashed his improving jump shot and was tasked with face-guarding dematha's justin moore (a junior with a handful of high-major offers) at critical points of the game.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhe did a little bit of everything, did it all at a high level, and maintained the scoring touch that should allow him to contribute from the start at whatever college he chooses in the coming year. harris' most recent unofficial visits were at the tail end of the summer, as he made trips to virginia tech, west virginia and wake forest. temple and ohio state have recently started to show interest, and temple is expected to extend a scholarship offer in the near future, according to a person with knowledge of harris' recruiting process. harris has offers from wake forest, west virginia, virginia tech, george mason, old dominion and central florida. he has not yet set a timetable for a college decision, he said thursday, but will likely have more options when it comes time to make a choice.\n\nharris, who is 6-foot-3, missed the beginning of the season with a fractured knee cap and is now averaging 12 points for the panthers (14-2). on thursday, he shared the court with top area players like moore, dematha sophomores earl timberlake and hunter dickinson, and standout teammates in freshman guard trevor keels (who already has a wake forest offer), sophomore point guard jeremy roach and villanova commit brandon slater. villanova coach jay wright, whose wildcats are currently ranked no. 1 in the country, was on hand with assistant kyle neptune to watch roach and moore, both of whom they have offered, and also check in on slater.\n\nhe doesn't have any holes as far as what he could do and what his potential is, farello said thursday night when asked what about harris' game is most enticing to college coaches. i think that's first and foremost what they love about him, and that competitive spirit.\n\nad\n\nad\n\none thing harris is working on, he and farello agreed, is fine-tuning his perimeter jump shot. he knocked down two three-pointers against dematha on thursday — one a quick-trigger jumper from the corner — but mostly went off the dribble and into the teeth of the stags' defense. a college assistant coach who is tracking harris, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to ncaa rules that prohibit schools from discussing potential recruits, said he was at first worried about harris' ability to knock down shots at the next level. but harris, the assistant said, is starting to quell that assessment this season. when asked for the biggest thing he wants to improve upon as the season rolls along, harris said, developing my jump shot. getting more consistent with it.\n\nthe other parts of his game appeared very polished thursday, and that was against some of the area's tougher guards in moore, timberlake, juniors jahmir young and josh wallace, and the scrappy justin gielen. harris' long arms and upper-body strength helped him shield the ball from pressed-up defenders. he was a one-on-one matchup problem from start to finish, whizzing by opponents and setting up his teammates with kick-out passes. he was a dogged defender, denying the ball to dematha's best perimeter scorers and helping double-down on dickinson, the stags' star sophomore center.\n\nnext is a more-than-reliable jumper, something he has already shown at times this season. then his game will be truly complete.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthat's the one thing, for him to take himself to the next level, is to knock down those shots, and take the right shots, said farello, who also called harris the team's best defensive player. because he can really get going 100 miles an hour, so if he can develop that change-of-pace game, he is going to be a real big problem.
for a long time, authorities at festivals in australia and elsewhere almost entirely focused on preventing people from taking drugs in the first place. that approach has done little to drive down the number of drug-related deaths, however, and a mounting body of research suggests that pill-testing facilities might be a more promising strategy.\n\nsupporters of drug testing sites acknowledge that there is no safe level of drug consumption, and participants in those tests usually have to sign disclaimers acknowledging that. in some cases, assistance is provided only if participants also attend short counseling sessions on drug use.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nfollowing last summer's trial effort in canberra, organizers said they had successfully prevented attendees from unknowingly taking hazardous substances. but in other australian states, local governments remain opposed, even amid a recent string of deaths.\n\nevery time there is an event now, people are asking: why aren't you providing a pill testing facility? why are people needlessly dying? said gino vumbaca, who works for one of the organizations involved in last year's test run, the international harm reduction association.\n\nwhile the idea has recently gained more support, drug tests aren't new and have also been tried in some parts of the united states. installing such facilities at music festivals has de facto been the norm in some european countries, including the netherlands and austria, for more than a decade. but amid more detailed research and increases in drug-related hospital admissions, supporters of drug tests are now also gaining momentum in australia and new zealand, where authorities have so far allowed only limited trials.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ni think they're a fantastic idea and should be installed at all our festivals, new zealand police minister stuart nash told news site stuff.co.nz, even though he cautioned that authorities still need to see how it works and better understand the implications of it first.\n\nthe war on drugs hasn't worked in the past 20 years, so it's time to change to a more compassionate and restorative approach, nash said.\n\ncritics argue that the approach could encourage young people to take more drugs and that it sends the wrong message. on-site tests have also been criticized as inaccurate, given the sometimes limited availability of equipment.\n\nbut supporters of the tests maintain that their approach is far more effective than focusing on arrests. pill testing has been shown to change the black market for the better and may even decrease overall drug consumption, as negative results would deter a majority of people from consuming drugs and spur them to warn their friends, according to a summary of arguments in favor of tests by australia's parliamentary library. research by the global drug survey came to a similar conclusion last year.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwhile police officers are not directly involved in those tests, authorities usually set up tolerance areas around testing tents, where consumers will not be arrested for drug use. volunteers inside the tents use laboratory equipment to examine the substances in tests that take about half an hour on average using infrared light. the visual analysis can quickly reveal possible contamination or whether a drug consumer was sold a different drug.\n\nin britain, a study published last year in the international journal of drug policy found that 20 percent of all drugs sold at a randomly chosen 2016 festival contained substances other than the ones dealers had declared.\n\nby anonymously revealing those findings to affected festivalgoers, researchers persuaded more than two-thirds of them to hand over other substances in their possession. drug-related hospital admissions fell 95 percent compared with the previous year — a trend researchers said was largely associated with the on-site drug testing trial. in a separate experiment, researchers in austria similarly noticed that tests raised awareness about the dangers of drug consumption.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe research results were published months after drug-related hospital admission rates soared in certain countries. whereas british consumers of mdma (popularly known as ecstasy) had a 0.7 percent chance of being admitted to a hospital after taking the drug in 2016, the rate had more than doubled by 2017, according to the 2018 global drug survey.\n\nglobally, more than two thirds of all mdma consumers interviewed for the survey said they would likely have used drug testing facilities if they had been available.
his allies on fox news similarly defended the president's withdrawal by arguing, this is one of the reasons people voted for him.\n\nbut trump's strongest supporters in the 2016 election were hardly isolationists. in fact, trump supporters in the republican primary were actually more hawkish about sending troops to iraq and syria than other republican voters.\n\nfour surveys show that trump's primary voters were more likely to support sending troops to the middle east than republicans who supported another candidate. in each survey, at least two-thirds of trump's primary voters favored sending troops to fight the islamic state, also known as isis.\n\ntrump voters' foreign policy views were even more distinct in the general election. the display below shows that trump voters were consistently twice as likely as clinton voters to support sending troops overseas.\n\ndespite trump's rhetoric, it's not surprising that his 2016 base was rather interventionist. trump's strongest supporters in the primary and general election were distinguished by their ethnocentric support for whites over minority groups. and americans with such beliefs tend to have more-hawkish views about foreign policy in general and the war on terror in particular.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nnor is it surprising that trump voters are now much more likely to support the president's decision to withdraw troops from syria than clinton voters (59 percent to 18 percent respectively). americans often change their opinions about foreign policy based on their views of the president who is guiding it.
however, some reports have bradley already in talks to go with anthony lynn as a package deal wherever lynn lands as head coach. so, we'll see how this plays out.\n\nleague insiders also expect that wade phillips, gregg williams and current inside linebackers coach greg manusky and carolina defensive backs coach steve wilks also will receive consideration.\n\nad\n\none person familiar with the team's deliberations said not to expect a quick hire. instead, gruden is expected to take his time finalizing his list and going through the interview process.\n\nad\n\nhowever, with draft-prospect-evaluation season kicking off later this month, the redskins will want to have their defensive coordinator in place before long.\n\nonce they do hire that coach and his staff, the redskins still have a lot of work to do to fix this defense and improve from 8-7-1 and return to the playoffs.\n\nfirst, the team needs a real talent infusion on defense. team brass can't make the mistake of thinking that a great defensive mind is going to mask all of the talent shortcomings.\n\nthe redskins need help at most positions, but no areas featured more instability than the secondary and inside linebacker.\n\nad\n\nlook at what joe b. had to work with:\n\nin his 33-game tenure, the coordinator started nine safeties, seven cornerbacks, six nickelbacks and six inside linebackers. you'd be hard-pressed to find any defensive coordinator who could coax dominance out of such injury-riddled/talent-deficient squads. it's almost surprising that the redskins still managed to win 17 games during that span.\n\nad\n\nso, priority no. 1 is to sign and draft difference-makers.\n\ni'm not saying load up with a lot of blockbuster deals like it's the year 2000. but the redskins must make true commitments to improving the roster through free agency, while also drafting with defense carrying a high priority.\n\nad\n\nthe past two years, washington has tried to acquire veteran talent on the cheap. but, you get what you pay for. those bargain deals to kendall reyes, jeron johnson and david bruton jr. (backups with their prior teams, who were expected to start here) bombed out. even the modest contract extended to stephen paea didn't pan out.\n\nthat's four potential starters who barely played the past two years. had one or both of those defensive linemen and one or both of those safeties worked out, last year's decision to take josh doctson in the first round wouldn't have been nearly as big a deal. washington's defense would have been okay another year until more significant changes came this offseason.\n\nad\n\nbut anyway, the redskins need athletes. speed, size, strength and versatility. this is important for any unit, but especially if you're running that seattle cover-three that a guy like bradley would.\n\nad\n\nthat scheme only works if you have an aggressive pass rush, athletic inside linebackers and safeties with good range. those traits don't sound like the stuff that barry had at his disposal the past two years.\n\nthe redskins do have some talent on this unit. but some of these players have yet to tap into their full potential.\n\nteam officials were miffed as to why preston smith didn't make the leap to double-digit sack artist despite the tutelage of manusky, who helped trent murphy go from pass-rushing non-factor to nine-sack contributor.\n\nthe regression of bashaud breeland was curious. the redskins also expected to get more out of chris baker. su'a cravens and kendall fuller need more nurturing. so, a coordinator with strong teaching/developing position coaches is required.\n\nall the while, gruden and sean mcvay (if the offensive coordinator is still here because he didn't get a head coaching job) must work to improve the offense further.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe redskins' defense didn't get nearly as many takeaways as it needed. but the offense didn't do enough with the 17 turnovers it received this season, washington managed only 53 points off turnovers. that's 23rd in the nfl. contrast that with the 92 points that atlanta scored off its defense's 22 takeaways, or the 71 that pittsburgh scored off 23 takeaways.\n\nso, the redskins need to capitalize more. whether it's when receiving the ball near midfield because of a takeaway or a strong defensive stand, or after marching downfield and into the red zone, this unit has to become more opportunistic.\n\nthe final game of the season perfectly reflects this.\n\nad\n\nthe game plan was to not let eli manning, odell beckham jr. and sterling shepard beat them. washington's defense held manning without a touchdown pass, and to a quarterback rating of 81. the redskins played a lot of cover-two, rolled coverage to beckham, and held the giants to 13 points. it helped that new york was content to run the ball in the third quarter rather than attempt to do much else. but in the first quarter, when the giants tried to get off to a fast start and big first-half lead, washington's defense got key stops, and the offense couldn't capitalize.
the program — officially known as the migrant protection protocols, or mpp — has required tens of thousands of migrants to cross back into mexico to await their u.s. asylum hearings, part of an effort to limit access to u.s. soil and to deter people from attempting the journey north to the united states. after more than 470,000 parents and children crossed into the united states last fiscal year, with most quickly freed into the united states amid a massive immigration court backlog, the administration implemented mpp to stop that practice.\n\nthe mpp program stranded migrants in mexican border towns without the promise of entry into the united states, and it evolved into one of the administration's most heavily used policies. it played a central role in stemming the record flow of border crossings, and trump administration officials warned friday that blocking the program risked another influx, citing concerns that smugglers and central american migrants would continue to exploit legal loopholes to gain entry.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin its initial ruling friday, the panel of the u.s. court of appeals for the 9th circuit ruled 2 to 1 to reinstate a district court judge's preliminary injunction that stopped mpp, saying that the policy violates federal law and should be enjoined in its entirety. the two judges in the majority agreed with immigration advocates who argued that pushing central americans back into mexico could put asylum seekers in grave danger, as they were forced to wait in mexican cities where they could continue to face persecution, in contravention of the long-held american ideal of offering sanctuary to the oppressed.\n\nchad wolf, the acting secretary of the department of homeland security, called the injunction grave and reckless and said the dhs is working with the justice department to appeal the ruling. he said border officials would apply a range of other effective tools to prevent migrants from crossing the border and being released into the united states. officials said in court filings that they planned to file a petition in the case with the supreme court.\n\nmpp has been a game-changer in the u.s. government's efforts to address the ongoing crisis at the southwest border, he said in a statement late friday. by implementing mpp we have also effectively reduced the incentive for smugglers and traffickers to use children in their illicit cross-border activity. should this ruling stand, the safety and security of our border communities, international relationships and regional stability is at risk.\n\nad\n\nad\n\njudges richard a. paez and william a. fletcher, both appointed by president bill clinton, agreed with a lower-court judge in california that mpp probably violated federal immigration law by ousting undocumented asylum seekers who should be allowed to apply for protection in the united states. the judges also said the program probably vio­lated the administration's non-refoulement obligations under international and domestic law, which prohibit the government from sending people to countries where they face danger. the 57-page ruling cited asylum seekers who feared kidnapping, threats and violence in mexico.\n\nthere is a significant likelihood that the individual plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the mpp is not enjoined, fletcher wrote in the opinion. uncontested evidence in the record establishes that non-mexicans returned to mexico under the mpp risk substantial harm, even death, while they await adjudication of their applications for asylum.\n\njudge ferdinand f. fernandez, a president george h.w. bush appointee, dissented, arguing that the panel should have adhered to a prior appeals court decision that allowed mpp to take effect.\n\nlinda rivas is an immigration attorney whose work regularly takes her to the dangerous mexican border city of juarez, where thousands of migrants are stranded. (the washington post)\n\nthe trump administration had been declaring near-victory in stemming irregular migration just weeks ago, in part because of mpp's success, and the 9th circuit's decision stops the policy along the southern border.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe justice department issued a statement friday saying that the decision once again highlights the consequences and impropriety of nationwide injunctions.\n\nthe trump administration has acted faithfully to implement a statutory authority provided by congress over two decades ago and signed into law by president clinton, the statement said. the ninth circuit's decision not only ignores the constitutional authority of congress and the administration for a policy in effect for over a year, but also extends relief beyond the parties before the court.\n\nthe department of homeland security instructed asylum officers to immediately cease all mpp processing, according to a federal official with direct knowledge of an email message sent to the officers. the asylum officers' labor union had filed a brief in the mpp case arguing that the policy threatened migrants' lives and is fundamentally contrary to the moral fabric of our nation.\n\njudy rabinovitz, special counsel in the american civil liberties union's immigrants' rights project, who argued the case in court, hailed the initial decision and called the court's stay later friday a temporary step that does not change the fact that courts have ruled multiple times against this illegal policy.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwe will continue working to permanently end this unspeakably cruel policy, she said in a statement.\n\nmark morgan, the acting commissioner of customs and border protection, said in a tweet after the court stayed its ruling friday night that the agency immediately reinstated the mpp.\n\nalong the mexican side of the nearly 2,000-mile border, where tens of thousands of migrants are hunkered down in shelters, apartments and tent camps, migrants scrolled through social media as lawyers waited for the trump administration to say whether it would allow them back into the united states.\n\ni've been reading about the suspension online and trying to understand, but what does it mean for my case? said daniel, an hiv-positive 20-year-old political activist from venezuela who says he fled threats under the government of nicolás maduro. he has lived in a small apartment in piedras negras since october while awaiting a hearing in his asylum case. what happens to people already under mpp?\n\nimmigration lawyers said they fear that the justice department will swiftly appeal to the u.s. supreme court, as it did to lift a similar injunction in january and to implement a public charge rule that bars low-income foreigners from immigrating to the united states.\n\nlawyers say they are monitoring border checkpoints to ensure that the u.s. government does not return migrants to mexico, and some prepared to escort migrants to the border with the hope that the department of homeland security will let their clients in.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nkarla vargas, a lawyer with the texas civil rights project, said that for now the group is advising migrants to stay calm while we figure out the best way to proceed.\n\nvargas said the ruling clearly establishes that mpp is illegal and that those sent to mexico under the program have a right to enter the united states to pursue their asylum proceedings. but she said it is unclear when the ruling will take effect and what window migrants will have to exercise the rights she says they have.\n\nthe trump administration has been working to reduce its reliance on mpp in recent months by fast-tracking deportation hearings and sending about 700 migrants from central america by airplane to guatemala as part of an agreement that allows them to seek asylum there instead. the number of people waiting in mexican border cities for u.s. immigration court dates has dwindled, in part because would-be migrants in central america said they were not making the trek to the u.s. border in the first place, given how unlikely it would be that they would gain entry.\n\nit is unclear whether the court's decision could spur another surge in u.s.-bound migration by central americans. it is possible that many people waiting in mexico for u.s. court hearings could try to reenter the united states in coming days.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ni wouldn't say that access to the asylum system in the united states is assured because of this injunction, because they've already put all these other programs in place to restrict that, said erika pinheiro, the litigation and policy director at al otro lado, a nonprofit organization and one of the plaintiffs in the mpp lawsuit. all that said, mpp is a horror show of human rights violations. the less people subject to it the better.\n\nthe ruling came on the same day mexico announced its first coronavirus case — a traveler returning from italy — raising potential fears about what a run on the u.s. border could mean. sanitary conditions are abysmal in the squalid border camps where thousands of would-be asylum seekers are waiting. human rights first, an advocacy group, said it has documented more than 1,000 reports of murder, rape and kidnapping, including of children, among those forced into mexico under mpp.\n\none former dhs official said the court decision could prompt the white house to invoke emergency executive powers to impose even tighter restrictions on asylum seekers at the border by citing a public health emergency involving the coronavirus. one legal provision, known as return to territory, gives u.s. border officials broad powers to compel a foreign national to go back to mexico or canada if that person is deemed inadmissible to the united states.\n\nthe same three-judge panel issued a separate 3-to-0 ruling friday blocking trump's first asylum restriction, which aimed to bar migrants who crossed the border illegally from seeking asylum. the policy was temporarily halted in 2018. trump blasted the lower-court jurist in the case as an obama judge, prompting a public rebuke from u.s. chief justice john g. roberts jr., who voted with the supreme court's four liberal justices months later to let the injunction stand.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nroberts and other conservative justices have since allowed other trump policies to unfold despite pending lawsuits against them.\n\nafter mpp officially began in january 2019, it became a central aspect of the trump administration's bulwark against irregular migration. a federal judge in california initially halted the program, but in may, a three-judge panel on the 9th circuit allowed it to resume until another set of judges could hear arguments on its legality.\n\nthe mpp program was expanded in june when mexico agreed to host thousands of migrants and to crack down on smugglers after trump threatened to impose tariffs on mexico's exports to the united states.\n\napproximately 60,000 migrants from countries including cuba, honduras, guatemala, el salvador and venezuela have been sent back to mexico to wait until their asylum cases can be heard in the united states. mexican officials said many of those sent back ultimately gave up and went home.\n\nhomeland security officials have credited mpp and other policies with a more than 70 percent drop in the number of migrants taken into custody at the border since the peak of 144,000 in may.
he says that the restaurant's pricey tasting-menu dinner wasn't filling seats or covering costs. so on sunday, gorsuch called onwuachi and vakiner into a meeting and told them he was closing shaw bijou, effective immediately. gorsuch and the other principal investor glenn paik could no longer afford to keep the place running.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthank you to all the people that supported us, onwuachi said monday on facebook. thank you to all of the people that worked countless hours on this project. thank you to my best friend for opening this place with me. thank you to my friends that moved across the country to work with me. thank you to all of the people that came in to dine with us. thank you to my family. . . . thank you to my fiancé for being my rock. thank you life for this lesson. thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\nneither onwuachi nor vakiner could be reached for comment.\n\n[the restaurant] bled too much, at too much of a clip, to be able to salvage it, says gorsuch, the president of gorsuch holdings, a company that operates upscale salons and other luxury brands. it just cost a lot of money. it was a very expensive business. i've never quite seen that in business at all. that was new for me. the numbers were staggering.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe closing of shaw bijou, first reported by washingtonian, brings an abrupt end to a restaurant that endured wild mood swings before it served a single meal. even before appearing on top chef, where he finished sixth out of 17 contestants last year, onwuachi was a hot commodity. he not only had a compelling back story, but he also had an impressive run with dinner lab, a series of pop-up dinners in which the chef consistently impressed diners. onwuachi's appearances on top chef only contributed to the buzz around the young cook, even though he had never run his own restaurant or managed a kitchen.\n\nthe hype took a turn in august when onwuachi and his team announced the price tag of their 13-course tasting menu, which would take diners on a journey through a converted townhouse. it wasn't long before washingtonians realized that dinner for two at shaw bijou could top out at $1,000, immediately making it one of the most expensive restaurants in the city. diners couldn't understand how someone with such a thin resume could compete with the likes of josé andrés, eric ziebold and aaron silverman.\n\nwhen shaw bijou opened on nov. 1, the early reviews were mixed. in his first bite review, the post's tom sietsema enjoyed several of his savory courses but found the desserts fell flat. more dispiriting, the critic realized that after dropping $500 per person on the meal, he was still hungry. washingtonian gave the place two stars in a review that couldn't make sense of the story that onwuachi was trying to weave.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ntwo months into its existence, shaw bijou slashed its prices and its offerings: onwuachi rolled out a seven-course, $95 tasting menu on jan. 3. the chef also offered up a little humble pie. humility creeps up on you when least expected, onwuachi noted in a letter. the opening of this restaurant has taught us just that.\n\nbut gorsuch says it was too little, too late.\n\ni think all business is difficult. you have to be able to move and change and adapt quickly, especially when you're starting out, gorsuch says. it wasn't happening. it wasn't where it needed to be.\n\nthe owner says he had been trying for weeks to convince onwuachi and vakiner to change the concept, but he says he couldn't convince them.\n\nad\n\ni think the biggest problem here, from the get, was that we were not listening to the guests, gorsuch says. we spent two years working on this thing . . . i don't care what the industry is, you put your people first and you care about the guests and you care about the details. . . i mean, numbers can be tweaked. you can cut things, but you have to have those elements.\n\nad\n\ngorsuch says he had spent most of sunday trying to find jobs for the servers, cooks and bartenders at shaw bijou. the owner wasn't as concerned about the chef and general manager. the longtime friends, who first met while attending the culinary institute of america, will probably find a new home soon, gorsuch says.\n\nthey'll be fine, the owner says. onwuachi had tons of offers before us.\n\nad\n\ngorsuch says this experience has shaken him. he's never closed a business before. this is probably the roughest week i've ever had, he says.\n\nbut more than that, gorsuch is upset by the lost opportunity. he says he believed in the team behind shaw bijou. he thought they could have pulled off the concept with proper oversight.\n\nthe game plan was always to be super innovative, gorsuch says. for all the things we did wrong, the talent that was in that building was special.
our grown kids are the same way: hard to buy for because they have everything they need!\n\nmuch as miss manners dislikes entering grumpyville, she worries whether the world hasn't gotten too crass for the ancient and beautiful custom of exchanging presents to be meaningful.\n\nad\n\nit is not just you who has, or can buy, anything you want. those who need and want material things are often disappointed by presents. and even when they are satisfied, they might fail to get what you also miss: thoughtfulness.\n\nad\n\nthe idea of exchanging presents is not to barter goods, much less to pay people for milestones and holidays. it is to symbolize that not only do you have some feelings for another person, but you appreciate that person's interests and taste.\n\nthis is not easy, which is why it often falls short of delighting the recipient. you can be fond of people whose preferences you don't understand or are not in a position to observe. furthermore, these may change over time, and do so especially rapidly with growing children.\n\nad\n\nso we augment our observations with indirect questions to parents or partners, and drop hints to those likely to be givers. at least, that was the system until people decided it was not efficient enough, and it became common to hand out lists of what one wanted. and if that is too much trouble, the symbol itself is eliminated in favor of giving money.\n\nad\n\nnot only does this get others to pay for what one had wanted to buy for oneself, but it relieves those people of having to think up pleasant surprises. what was thereby removed from the custom was thoughtfulness — the very thing that you do want.\n\nmiss manners has to ask herself what is left. as these exchanges are supposed to be reciprocal, nobody should come out ahead in the long run. and nobody will have the thrill of receiving something that shows how well the giver understood oneself — or the amusement of receiving a misfit, which is nevertheless treasured because of the person who gave it.\n\nad\n\ndear miss manners: what do you think about the fairly new practice of return receipts — sales receipts to include with a gift, provided by the store to facilitate returns?\n\ni'm of two minds about it, myself. such receipts certainly make returning gifts easier, but i dislike the presumption that goes hand in hand with the receipt: that the recipient probably won't care much for what i've picked out.\n\nad\n\noh, those naughty stores, packing such receipts with presents that are perfect and no one would ever want to return. however, considering that it is not done by the giver, miss manners considers these a good idea.\n\nnew miss manners columns are posted monday through saturday on washingtonpost.com/advice. you can send questions to miss manners at her website, missmanners.com. you can also follow her @realmissmanners.
the heart of the case is a 30-square-foot treehouse that protrudes about 20 inches over a mulched tree box in a u-shaped alley called archibald walk. the saga started three years ago when ellen psychas and her husband, bonding yee, wanted a play place for their young daughters, now 5 and 7, and built a castle-looking treehouse in a 100-year-old american elm tree.\n\nad\n\nbut through the years, the treehouse has divided neighbors on the narrow street, near g and sixth in southeast washington, that's lined with a half-dozen homes. supporters say that it's a gathering spot for neighborhood children to play. opponents argue that it extends into a public alley and wasn't properly permitted.\n\nafter a january 2016 hearing, the district government later fined the couple $2,000 and ordered them to take down the treehouse. but they appealed the decision and have since ratcheted the case up a notch.\n\nad\n\nthey filed suit last week in u.s. district court, alleging, among other things, that officials with the district department of transportation (ddot) hacked into psychas's online city zoning account without her knowledge — a violation of a federal computer fraud and abuse act, they claim.\n\nad\n\nwhile a permitting matter pertaining to a child's backyard play fort would not normally be the topic of litigation in federal court, a violation of the [computer fraud and abuse act] is a serious federal criminal offense, the lawsuit reads.\n\nthe suit seeks undisclosed compensatory damages, plus damages for emotional distress and a jury trial.\n\nddot officials referred a request for comment to the city's lawyers. robert marus, a spokesman for the d.c. attorney general's office, said in an email that his office was reviewing the complaint and had no comment on the pending litigation.\n\nad\n\nthe treehouse tale has a long trail of paperwork, including permits, stop-work orders, appeals and letters of support and criticism.\n\npsychas, who counsels high school students about college, and yee, a department of homeland security lawyer, maintain that the city didn't have clear rules on whether the treehouse needed a permit. but they said they do have a city-issued balcony permit issued after an inspector looked at the treehouse after neighbors complained.\n\nad\n\nsome neighbors argue, however, that the treehouse owners took control of a small public space and extended a private treehouse without the proper approval.\n\non a neighborhood blog, capitol hill corner, neighbors commented on the division it's created. one commenter, brian c., wrote: people who oppose treehouses never had, nor ever will have, any quality of life. another, identifying as rd, wrote: it's a treehouse. relax people.\n\nad\n\nas the treehouse fight has continued through the years, the family said it has received support, including from pruners who take care of decaying branches for free and bags of change in their mailbox with handwritten notes from kids that read, please don't let anybody hurt the princess castle.\n\nyee said he took the case to federal court after attempts at zoning appeals and negotiations with the city seemed to stall or fail. and he faced a statute of limitations on filing the federal lawsuit in u.s. district court, he said.\n\nad\n\nbut ultimately, he said, it is about a treehouse for kids.\n\nthe city shouldn't be hassling a family like this, he said. this isn't one of those matters they should be spending a lot of time on. yee said he's spent a lot of time and effort in his fight to save the treehouse.\n\nad\n\nwe want to do right by our children, he said. especially if our government is abusing its authority in this way, we can fight that. i think it is well worth it.\n\nthe couple said their daughters play in the treehouse once or twice a week and it has hosted more than 250 kids who have had parties or playdates. it also has its own web page — www.rescuetreehouse.com.\n\nin their suit, the couple alleges that psychas's online permit account for the treehouse was hacked on jan. 15, 2016, by a citywide permitting manager at ddot, with approval from his supervisor.\n\npsychas said in court filings that d.c. officials told her in an email that they, unbeknown to her, changed her account password and submitted an unrequested and unauthorized permit application on her behalf for the treehouse. according to records, she said she believes city officials were unaware that their actions were a crime.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe couple said they've reported the alleged hacking to the fbi's internet crime complaint center.\n\nin a jan. 15 email to psychas, the city permit manager said he created an active permit application and changed her password before a critical jan. 28, 2016, meeting of the district's public space committee. the official told psychas via email that he needed to make a renewal permit application so that comments could be uploaded prior to the meeting.\n\nthe couple said they believe they didn't need a renewal permit because they already had what they believed was the necessary permit for the treehouse. so the public space committee, they claim, ruled on a permit they never officially applied for. the couple alleged that the city was trying to pull off a well-orchestrated permitting trick.\n\nad\n\nin their 49-page federal lawsuit — plus another 69 pages of exhibits — they said, drawn-out litigation, lasting almost two years to date, stems not only from the ddot's permitting malfeasance and incompetence, but from the agency's intransigence and lack of common sense in declining to amicably settle a trifling public space management matter that has long since ceased to be an active controversy in the capitol hill neighborhood.\n\nwhy not move the treehouse?\n\nthe couple said it would cost about $5,000 to take down and move.
it's also incredibly easy to make and use. here's how:\n\nstart with the basics. it begins with butter, of course. unconventional diner chef-owner david deshaies, a native of france, where compound butter is a staple of the cuisine, likes to leave his butter out overnight to come to room temperature. that might be fine for a home cook if your kitchen is cool, but if you're not working with 20 pounds of butter at a time like he is, an hour or so should be sufficient to make the butter pliable and ready for mixing.\n\ndeshaies's preferred mixing tool is a stand mixer. use one if you have it, though you can easily pull together a compound butter with no more than a bowl and wooden spoon. a hand mixer works well, too.\n\nin her comprehensive piece on compound butter for the washington post in 2002, renee schettler offers a base recipe that starts with 1 stick (8 tablespoons/4 ounces) of butter. (keep in mind that smaller amounts can be harder to work with.) first, beat the butter on its own to make it smooth, getting it as light and fluffy as you want, depending on whether you prefer it denser or airier. add a pinch of salt and your flavoring ingredients (more on that below), and combine thoroughly. adjust the seasoning to taste before scraping the butter onto a sheet of parchment or wax paper (plastic wrap can be less ideal if it's not smooth and the wrinkles get stuck in the solidified butter), close to one of the long ends. roll the butter into about a 1-inch diameter cylinder, twist the ends of the paper (if the log is looking a bit wonky, this step helps even it out) and refrigerate or freeze. the butter will keep in the fridge for 3 to 5 days and in the freezer for several months.\n\nflavor to taste. deshaies recommends keeping your flavoring ingredients to about 30 percent of the final product, tweaking as necessary to accommodate stronger (salty anchovies, spicy pepper) or weaker (more delicate herbs) flavors. you still want the main flavor to be butter, the chef says. after that, it's up to you.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthis is the beauty of it, deshaies says. you can be extremely creative.\n\nclassic additions, separately or together, are garlic, parsley and shallot. citrus is a natural, too, whether it's zest, juice or even something like preserved lemon or lemon confit. the possibilities with dried spices are almost endless. schettler's piece also includes variations with cheese, mustard, olives and even alcohol. you can lean sweet, too, incorporating jams, freeze-dried fruit (ground to a fine powder in the food processor), crystallized ginger and warming spices such as cinnamon and nutmeg.\n\navoid turning the butter soupy with excessive amounts of liquid. too much liquid may change how the butter sets and melts. and keep in mind that you want your butter to be free of large chunks. so finely chop your firmer ingredients. deshaies, though, says you can have some fun with texture with such additions as finely chopped peanuts, fried grains of rice and quinoa that can leave behind a crunchy garnish as the butter melts. ditto finely chopped chives on the outside of an herbed butter.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthink about colors, too. freeze-dried fruit, squid ink and turmeric are vivid ingredients that lend both hue and flavor.\n\nas with any improvised recipe, it's good to taste as you go. it's much easier to add more ingredients than take them away.\n\nuse far and wide. compound butters can be incorporated into a dish before cooking — saffron wedding cookies, anyone? — or after. you're probably most familiar with the concept thanks to those pats of butter you might find enticingly melting over a steak at a restaurant. you can do the same with a piece of salmon and vegetables, roasting them with the butter or using the butter as a finishing touch.\n\nwith a garlic-and-herb butter already stashed in the fridge, homemade garlic bread is within reach even on a weeknight. leave store-bought croutons in the dust when you toast cubes of bread with your own flavored butter. savory compound butters can serve as a quick sauce as well. after you've seared or roasted meat, use something acidic (wine, a little vinegar, etc.) to scrape up those tasty browned bits — deglaze in fancy speak — and then whisk in the compound butter for a rich, glossy sauce.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nsweet or spiced butters are wonderful when spread on toast and crowning a stack of pancakes. they'll make your scones sing, too.\n\nno one will complain to have a little piece of flavored butter on top of a dish, deshaies says.
the redskins have tweeted five times in the new year, once to congratulate former washington linebacker brian orakpo on his retirement and four times to applaud current members of the team on individual accomplishments during the 2018 season. the replies to each of these tweets feature the same 15-character message, in hashtag form, over and over and over again: #firebruceallen.\n\nwhile the redskins ousted president of business operations brian lafemina in december after less than eight months on the job, allen, whom many fans hold most responsible for the redskins' current predicament, remained as team president.\n\nad\n\nad\n\n#firebruceallen first emerged as a popular hashtag in 2014, when allen assured reporters and fans after a 4-12 season that the redskins were winning off the field. the hashtag virtually disappeared after washington's nfc east title in 2015, but it resurfaced after the redskins fired general manager scot mccloughan in march 2017 and has seemingly gained steam with every misstep by the once-proud franchise since then. it has never been as prevalent as it is right now.\n\neric doctor was way ahead of the curve. on dec. 21, 2009, doctor became the first person, as best as i can tell, to use the hashtag #firebruceallen on twitter. allen had been on the job for four days.\n\ndoctor's tweet came during the redskins' 45-12 loss to the giants on monday night football, an embarrassing defeat that will forever be remembered for jim zorn's failed swinging gate.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ni think the fact that i tweeted it four days after he was hired is a unique window into the woes of being a skins fan, because we didn't have vinny cerrato to scapegoat anymore, doctor, whose bigger claim to fame is scribbling a giant shrug emoticon as his final answer on jeopardy! last month, said in a phone interview on thursday.\n\ndoctor, 30, grew up in rochester, n.y. and inherited his redskins fandom from his dad. his grandfather was on the season-ticket waiting list for 35 years before finally being offered the chance to purchase tickets when fedex field opened in 1997.\n\ni'm still a die-hard, doctor said. i keep up with the team and try to go to one home game every year, but it's harder to be a fan for sure. i guess i'm a masochist, but the first song i learned was 'hail to the redskins.'\n\nad\n\nad\n\nlike other fans, doctor said he's noticed a steady decline in the fan experience at fedex field during allen's tenure, and is frustrated with many of the recent decisions made by his favorite team.\n\nyou would go to a game at fedex field 10 years ago, and we'd have 95,000 seats filled with burgundy and gold jerseys, he said. now you go to a game and they can't sell it out, and a real significant portion of the crowd is for the other team. i don't know if bruce allen has some dirt on dan snyder or something, but it seems like everyone but him gets fired. we signed reuben foster two days after he had been arrested for domestic violence and we fired d.j. swearinger for expressing frustrations with the team. this isn't an easy franchise to root for.\n\nwhile doctor's initial #firebruceallen tweet was made in jest and he hasn't joined the legion of redskins fans flooding timelines with the hashtag in recent weeks, he said he would fully support the move.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe team's failing from a football perspective, it's failing from a business perspective, and bruce allen is in charge of both, doctor said.
dear miss manners: while it's important not to waste resources, what is the proper thing to do when one flush doesn't remove all of the waste?\n\nit seems to be wasteful to continue flushing just to be sure all is gone before the next user needs to use the facilities, but also not nice to leave anything behind.\n\nwhile miss manners does not advocate being unnecessarily wasteful — she has her limits. and that is to do whatever it takes to make a public facility reasonably hygienic after use. after all, throwing up in the toilet after seeing its previous contents will also cost an additional flush. so let us call this one even.\n\ndear miss manners: what should i wear to a black tie optional'' wedding when the ceremony begins at 2 p.m. and the reception begins at 5 p.m.?\n\nshould i wear my reception dress to the ceremony, or something more casual and change during the gap between the ceremony and reception? i've purchased a floor-length chiffon gown to wear to the reception but don't want to be overdressed!\n\nyour instinct is correct. long dresses and black tie should not be worn before dusk.\n\nyour hosts must think that the more important event is the party, rather than the marriage ceremony. so while miss manners considers the phrase black tie optional'' silly — hosts cannot make their dress codes compulsory — she suggest taking the option and choosing a dressy short dress or suit proper for a formal daytime occasion.\n\ndear miss manners: my wife and i live in a very sociable neighborhood. the neighbors are not just casual acquaintances but good friends whose company we enjoy.\n\nour frustration lies with one friend in particular who lives in the house facing ours. the lady in question promptly accepts invitations to dinners or cocktail parties, and when she attends is a welcome and enjoyable guest.\n\nhowever, she regularly texts my wife and me 15 minutes before the event and announces that she has settled in for the evening in her pajamas and is going to watch tv. this happens even though cocktails are early, around 6 p.m. most times.\n\nperhaps you could suggest a response to this friend for these texts, which make us feel that our event is of so little importance she cannot walk 100 feet to our door for an hour and then politely excuse herself before settling in to watch tv.\n\nwhile there may be no response that will get her to change, not inviting her at all surely will. if she is bold enough to question why, say, oh, we felt so bad asking you to part with your valuable time at home. you are, of course, always welcome here if you see that we are entertaining. just let us know when you are free.''\n\nmiss manners feels confident that this woman will soon come running.\n\nnew miss manners columns are posted sundays, tuesdays and thursdays on washingtonpost.com/advice. you can send questions to miss manners at her website, missmanners.com.
customers who travel with a smart bag must be able to remove the battery in case the bag has to be checked at any point in the customer's journey, american airlines said in a statement. if the battery cannot be removed, the bag will not be allowed.\n\nad\n\nthe rule springs from safety concerns. lithium metal and lithium ion/polymer batteries are susceptible to emitting smoke, catching fire and even exploding. between march 1991 and may 2017, the federal aviation administration documented 160 incidents involving lithium batteries that were being transported as cargo or baggage. the agency already prohibits passengers from checking spare lithium batteries used for personal electronic devices and portable rechargers, as well as several lithium-powered items such as e-cigarettes and vape pens. the faa permits the items inside the cabin. (for information on flying with hazardous materials, see the faa's pack safe guidelines.)\n\nthe airlines are not snubbing all smart bags: luggage with extractable batteries is permitted, with some oversight. passengers who check their smart carriers must remove the battery and tote it onboard. as carry-on, the battery can stay put but must be turned off, per faa protocol. however, if a flight attendant decides to gate-check the bag, you must remove the battery before it goes into the belly of the plane.\n\nad\n\nsmart luggage performs more than beast-of-burden duties. depending on the model, the brainy bag might come with usb ports for charging gadgets, gps tracking, electronic locks and built-in digital scales. one company called modobag allows travelers to zoom around on their luggage like a scooter, which tops out at 8 mph. many manufacturers, such as away, barracuda, g-ro, raden, arlo skye, travelpro and heys (the only maker to use aaa batteries), sell smart luggage that complies with the new rule. the ones that do not are rethinking their designs.\n\nad\n\nluggage manufacturers are already responding to airlines' safety concerns, said michele marini pittenger, president of the travel goods association. the recent attention surrounding lithium ion batteries will surely lead to action by manufacturers to make new iterations of smart luggage as safe as possible.\n\nthe rule came earlier than expected. the international civil aviation organization, the u.n. agency that sets aviation safety standards and recommends practices for more than 190 countries, had decided to start restricting smart luggage next january. however, the international air transport association, which represents about 275 airlines worldwide, instituted the ban a year early. an iata spokesman said the organization's members will follow its recommendations starting monday. participants include major carriers such as united, jetblue, klm and virgin atlantic, as well as many smaller airlines, including slovenia's adria airways, egypt's nile air and iran's kish airlines.\n\nad\n\nconsider yourself warned: if you arrive at the airport with the luggage non grata, the airline will not permit the piece onboard. you will have to repack your belongings in your secondary bags or purchase new luggage at the airport — a costly solution for a careless mistake.
public health experts differ on how quickly that might happen — and when things might start to feel normal again around the country.\n\nto inaugurate our first health 202 of the new year, we asked eight experts for their predictions.\n\nafter all, we all want to know when we can go to concerts and ballgames again. or even just go to the office. (let's start small.)\n\nad\n\nwe asked two questions. the first has to do with when the united states will reach herd immunity — the point at which enough people are immune to a virus, either by recovering from it or getting vaccinated against it. herd immunity generally kicks in when about 70 percent of people are immune, although experts differ on the precise threshold.\n\nad\n\nto reach herd immunity with the coronavirus, approximately 230 million americans would need the vaccine. as of yesterday, just 4 million had gotten the first of two shots. daily immunizations have increased considerably over the past few days, with about 500,000 people getting the shot each day, but experts say that number needs to at least double and ideally quadruple.\n\nwe also asked these experts when they personally expect their lives to return to normal.\n\nad\n\nhere are their responses, edited lightly for clarity and brevity.\n\nwhen will enough americans be vaccinated for the u.s. to reach herd immunity, based on how things look right now?\n\ncarlos del rio, professor of medicine and global health at emory university:\n\nat the current pace it will take a really long time. … i think if we can get our act together and start vaccinating 1 million people a day like president-elect biden is promising, then we can get to 260 million people getting at least one dose … more or less or by late august or early september. if we really scale up and get to 3 million per day, then we can get to 260 million people in [less than] 100 days or three months. can we do it? yes! but it will require coordination, leadership and funding. so, as you see, my answer is: it depends.\n\nad\n\nad\n\neric topol, director and founder of scripps research translational institute:\n\ni think by july, if we get 2 to 3 million people vaccinated per day, and even sooner, if we have a rapid neutralization antibody assay to be able to defer those who have had a prior infection and mounted a durable immune response. yes, that is optimistic, but it can be done.\n\njay bhattacharya, professor of medicine at stanford university:\n\nthere is a lot of disagreement in the scientific literature about the herd immunity threshold, which is certain to vary from place to place. i don't think anyone responsible would confidently say what it is, and would never put forward a single number for the u.s. as a whole. rather, the key question is how rapidly we inoculate people who have a high risk of mortality conditional on infection — most older folks and some late middle-aged folks with severe chronic conditions. prioritizing them for vaccination will yield the greatest benefit in reducing covid-19-related mortality, regardless of when herd immunity is hit.\n\nad\n\nad\n\njesse goodman, professor of medicine and infectious diseases at georgetown university:\n\ni am not sure that in the near future we will reach a level of population immunity where the virus will be virtually shut down, as we are accustomed to with measles. through immunity due to vaccination, combined, unfortunately, with infections in the unvaccinated, we should reach a state where the risk of exposure is reduced due to a mostly immune population. while cases will still occur, our health system will no longer be stressed and large outbreaks should be less common.\n\ni am hopeful we can get to such a situation in the last quarter of this year, provided vaccine production, access and acceptance go well and no mutant viruses arise that gain the ability to escape current vaccines.\n\nad\n\nkimberly powers, associate professor of epidemiology at the university of north carolina at chapel hill:\n\nad\n\nthat question is difficult to answer, as there is considerable uncertainty around the level of immunity we would need in the population to achieve herd immunity, along with the speed with which we can expect widespread vaccine uptake to occur.\n\nleana wen, public health professor at george washington university and former baltimore health commissioner:\n\nright now, vaccine distribution is progressing at an unacceptably slow speed, and at this current rate, it will take years to reach herd immunity — if ever. if we are able to pick up speed by many times in january, there is still a chance we could substantially slow down the infection and perhaps approach herd immunity in 2021.\n\nad\n\nmarc lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at harvard university:\n\ni think you mean 'will enough americans be vaccinated to reach the herd immunity threshold?' my answer is possibly not because we don't know if the vaccines protect enough against transmission for the threshold to be achievable, and because the new variant may increase that threshold substantially.\n\nad\n\nmichael osterholm, chairman of the center for infectious disease research and policy at the university of minnesota:\n\nthere are three factors that will independently determine when enough americans will either be protected from covid-19 via vaccination or development of antibody following actual infection.\n\nad\n\nfirst, when will there be sufficient vaccine produced and distributed so everyone can receive their two doses? this includes vaccinating those who may have immune protection from actual infection but are vaccinated anyway to increase durable protection. second, will enough people agree to be vaccinated? and finally, what is the durability of vaccine-induced protection over time?\n\neach of these factors will play a role in achieving local, regional or national herd immunity protection. i feel confident we can achieve the first factor of sufficient vaccine by the late summer or early fall. but ultimately, the second two factors, how many will be vaccinated and how durable is immune protection will determine the answer to this question. i hope, when considering all three factors, it will be late summer or early fall, but we all realize hope is not a strategy.\n\nwhen do you expect your own daily life to feel similar to pre-pandemic times?\n\nad\n\nad\n\ncarlos del rio:\n\ni am hoping to be 'close to normal' by december 2021 more or less. however, as a physician seeing patients, i will probably continue to wearing a face mask and goggles for much longer.\n\neric topol:\n\nin 2022.\n\njay bhattacharya:\n\ngiven the changes that the previous year has had on my professional and personal life, i do not expect my daily life to ever feel similar to pre-pandemic times. more broadly though and given the disappointingly slow roll out of the vaccine to the vulnerable in many states, i anticipate that american society will start to feel more like normal by april 2021.\n\njesse goodman:\n\nhopefully late this year, life should begin to feel similar to pre-pandemic times. however, it is likely that both great vigilance and some social distancing will still be needed, particularly if the population is not nearly all vaccinated. in addition, we may well require periodic immunization against the current and, possibly, other emerging coronavirus variants.\n\nad\n\nkimberly powers:\n\ni expect daily life to feel more normal by sometime this summer, but i think it will be 2022 before some mitigation measures can be fully relaxed. and i expect that our society will feel ongoing consequences of this pandemic — physical, mental, emotional, and economic — for years to come.\n\nleana wen:\n\ni don't know. i was much more optimistic a few weeks ago. but given the lag in vaccine rollout thus far and how under-resourced our public health systems are, i am concerned things for much of 2021 will feel more like 2020 than 2019.\n\nmarc lipsitch:\n\ni think that sometime in the second half of the year there will be enough vaccination in the u.s. and some other countries that we will begin to treat covid-19 more like seasonal flu, which is deadly to large numbers of people but does not overwhelm health care and does not cause us to curtail normal social contact. this is because with enough vaccine in those at high risk of death and hospitalization, transmission may continue (at a reduced level thanks to some immunity in the population from prior infection and vaccine) but the outcomes will be less severe.\n\nad\n\nmichael osterholm:\n\ni'm not sure it ever will. we will not go back to a pre-covid-19 normal. we will instead exist in world with a new normal. and even that will in part be determined by the availability of adequate vaccine supply to cover everyone in high, middle and low income countries. i look forward to the day when my office hours are as they were pre-covid-19.\n\nahh, oof and ouch\n\nahh: federal official says the u.s. may cut its moderna doses in half to stretch the shots further.\n\noperation warp speed chief adviser moncef slaoui said sunday the administration was in talks with moderna and the food and drug administration about giving people two half-doses of moderna's vaccine.\n\nslaoui told cbs's face the nation that giving half-doses to people between the ages of 18 and 55 triggers the same immune response as two full shots of the recommended 100 microgram dose and would allow officials to immunize twice as many people with the vaccine currently available. any changes to the vaccine doses would ultimately require fda approval.\n\nslaoui described two half-doses as a more responsible approach compared with stretching out the time between shots. health officials in the united kingdom have said that they are aiming to get a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine to as many people as possible, even if it means delaying the second shot in the two-dose regimen.\n\nthe impetus to rethink recommendations comes as vaccine distribution falls far short of the trump administration's prediction that 20 million people would be vaccinated by the end of december.\n\nanthony fauci, the government's top infectious-disease expert, has cautioned against changing vaccine protocols, arguing that the emphasis should be on improving distribution.\n\noof: top health advisers are pushing back against trump's claim the coronavirus death toll is exaggerated.\n\nyesterday, trump tweeted that the u.s. numbers on coronavirus cases and deaths are far exaggerated compared with other countries.\n\nthe numbers are real, fauci said during an interview with nbc's meet the press. go into the trenches, go into the hospitals, go into the intensive care units and see what is happening. those are real numbers, real people and real deaths.\n\nmore than 350,000 people have died of the coronavirus in the united states this year and more than 20 million cases have been recorded.\n\nsurgeon general jerome m. adams also defended the numbers, although he declined to comment directly on trump's statement. from a health perspective, i have no reason to doubt those numbers, adams said on cnn's state of the union.\n\ntrump has repeatedly made baseless claims aimed at shedding doubt about the severity of the coronavirus, but health experts say the official coronavirus statistics match closely with excess mortality data showing many more people dying in 2020 than would be expected in a normal year.\n\nouch: a new variant of the coronavirus is more transmissible.\n\na new variant of the coronavirus, originally identified in the united kingdom, has been spreading around the globe, and a growing body of evidence suggests that genetic mutations have made it more transmissible. the united states has reported infections from the new variant in california, colorado and florida.\n\npublic health officials have reassured the public that the new variant does not appear to be more deadly or cause people to get sicker, and they say the leading vaccines will still be effective against it. but the atlantic's zeynep tufekci argues that a more transmissible virus may be far more dangerous than a more deadly strain due to the mathematics of exponential growth, as each new infected person infects more people. with vaccinations lagging, a new variant could be potentially catastrophic.\n\ntake a virus reproduction rate of about 1.1 and an infection fatality risk of 0.8 percent and imagine 10,000 active infections — a plausible scenario for many european cities, zeynep writes, based on an analysis conducted by adam kucharski, a professor at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine. as things stand, with those numbers, we'd expect 129 deaths in a month. if the fatality rate increased by 50 percent, that would lead to 193 deaths. in contrast, a 50 percent increase in transmissibility would lead to a whopping 978 deaths in just one month — assuming, in both scenarios, a six-day infection-generation time.\n\ninitial estimates suggest that the virus could be 50 to 70 percent more transmissible, although there's still much that we don't know about the new variant. it could turn out that the transmissibility has been overstated and that the dominance of the virus in the u.k. is due to chance or changed behavior among people.\n\nbut the united states may not have time to wait for better data before it acts. it appears that the new variant is still rare in the united states, but that could change quickly. for exponential processes, small initial differences can mean gargantuan differences in the long run, zeynep writes. we are in a race against time, and the virus appears to be gaining an unfortunate ability to sprint just as we get closer to the finish line.\n\nsome experts fear vaccines may be less effective against strains of the coronavirus that were first found in the united kingdom, south africa and brazil. (the washington post)\n\ncoronavirus latest\n\nchicken plants where the trump administration approved faster line speeds were more likely to have virus cases.\n\na washington post analysis found that poultry plants that received waivers to increase the speed of their slaughter lines were 10 times more likely to have coronavirus cases than plants without waivers. since 2018, the trump administration has issued waivers to 54 poultry plants allowing them to increase the line speeds by 25 percent. fifteen waivers were approved during the pandemic.\n\nworkers say the fast line speeds make it difficult, sometimes impossible, for them to socially distance during their eight-hour shifts as they struggle to work faster. most of these plants are also large, employing thousands of workers who work in tight quarters, creating conditions that can fuel the spread of the virus, the post's kimberly kindy, ted mellnik and aurelis r. hernández report.\n\nthe analysis is based on data from the nonprofit food and environment reporting network, which has documented more than 51,000 coronavirus infections among workers in beef, hog and poultry plants and 347 deaths.\n\nthe usda is working to finalize a new rule that would make the increased line speeds permanent and expand them to other poultry plants, although it is unclear if the administration will be able to push the change through before joe biden takes office. critics worry that such a rule change could harm worker safety even beyond the coronavirus. carpal tunnel syndrome, tendinitis and other illnesses are common among people who work in meatpacking plants.\n\nmismanagement by the d.c. mayor and the intransigence of teachers' unions have kept schools closed in the district.\n\nd.c. mayor muriel e. bowser (d) was determined to reopen schools this fall. but changing plans and communication shortcomings on the part of the city, and shifting, hard-line demands on the part of the union, kept schools closed for months, squandering the chance to return the most vulnerable students to the classroom while infection rates were low, city officials, union leaders, educators and activists told the post.\n\nas urban school districts across the country struggled with classroom reopening plans, a close look at the district's experience shows how hard it has been to develop workable strategies — and how much power teachers wield, particularly when they have a strong union behind them, our colleagues perry stein and laura meckler report.\n\nthe district's impasse meant it squandered the chance to give its most vulnerable children classroom time while infection rates were low, they write. now the earliest any students will have face-to-face instruction will be february. meanwhile, children are falling behind.\n\ncolorado discarded its recommendation to vaccinate prisoners early.\n\na revised version of colorado's vaccination plan no longer lists incarcerated people for priority vaccinations after an earlier plan, which put them ahead of the elderly and those with chronic conditions, sparked a political backlash, the post's isaac stanley-becker reports. accusations that politicians were coddling convicted murderers while the law-abiding elderly went without vaccines caught fire on social media and made their way into newspaper editorials and on fox news.\n\na spokesman for gov. jared polis declined to make the governor available for an interview but issued a statement defending the state's plan, stressing the moral obligation to prioritize elderly people most at risk of dying from the virus and front-line health-care heroes caring for the sick.\n\ninmate status will not make a difference in terms of timing of receipt of the vaccine, the spokesman said. someone who falls into a category for early priority of the vaccine and is in custody will receive the vaccine at the same time as someone in the same category who is outside our correctional facilities.\n\ncolorado's new vaccination plan also no longer lists people living in homeless shelters. some experts say they are troubled by the decision to no longer prioritize vaccinations in congregate care settings. more than 40 of the 50 largest clustered outbreaks have occurred in jails or prisons, according to an article in the lancet.\n\nmore on the coronavirus vaccine\n\n\n\neven as millions of vaccines finally flow into hospitals and health departments, many americans are confronting overwhelmed health systems. some counties and hospital systems launched websites for vaccine reservations, only to find them immediately booked or crashed. a florida health department that offered vaccines to older residents on a first-come, first-serve basis found people lined up in lawn chairs, the post's brittany shammas and lori rozsa report.\n\n\n\npregnant women are agonizing over whether to get coronavirus vaccines. while health experts anticipate that the coronavirus vaccines, like most other vaccines, are probably safe for pregnant women and less dangerous than contracting the virus, they have not been tested and there is no safety data available. the centers for disease control and prevention, and the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists, said that vaccines should not be withheld from pregnant or lactating women, leaving the decision up to patients and their doctors, the post's frances stead sellers reports\n\n\n\nindia approved two vaccines — the oxford-astrazeneca vaccine and the homegrown covaxin — in preparation for a mass vaccination campaign. the country aims to

according to the american psychological association, only 4 percent of psychologists are black. yet, black people report experiencing psychological distress at higher rates than white and hispanic people. this is a particularly urgent issue among black children. since 1993, the suicide rate of black children from 5 to 11 years old has increased to about twice the rate of white children, and black teenagers are more likely than white teens to attempt suicide.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhenson, who in addition to being a mother, was also a teacher before becoming a household name, felt like she should do something to help change the landscape so other black children did not have to search as much as she did in order to find the right care.\n\nwhen the statistics of black children who've died by suicide have continued to rise, we cannot ignore that, henson says. i have a platform. i have a mic. i have resources. i am compelled to do something.\n\nso she founded the boris lawrence henson foundation, named in honor of her father who served in the vietnam war. the foundation is working to bring more mental health support to schools in black communities as well as to increase the number of black therapists. recently, the foundation offered free virtual therapy to african americans affected by the racial unrest and the covid-19 pandemic, which disproportionately affected people of color.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nperhaps most of all, she's shining a spotlight on the fact that too many black children go without mental health assistance when they so desperately need it.\n\nthe need for culturally competent mental health care\n\na lot of black youth are struggling with complex trauma, which means that on a daily basis they're experiencing environmental traumas, or what is now known as racial trauma, says jennifer mullan, emotional wellness coach and founder of decolonizing therapy. considering the race-based traumatic stress black patients are suffering with, psychologists and therapists should provide culturally competent care, she says, which is not something only health professionals of color should provide.\n\nad\n\ncultural competence training guides help providers understand the unique communication and social needs of underserved groups while teaching them to avoid perpetuating stigmas or increasing barriers to care.\n\nad\n\nthere are many factors that create complex trauma in black children, teens and adults: race-based traumatic stress has been heightened in the aftermath of the murders of george floyd, ahmaud arbery and breonna taylor, mullan says, particularly by black youth, who have taken on so much of the effort to protest their killings. add to that the fact that black children are often not seen as youth, but are treated as adults, (like tamir rice, who was just 12 when he was killed by police for playing with a toy gun in a park), their stress and need for therapy is compounded.\n\nmeanwhile, black children make up just 14 percent of the total youth population in the united states, but they make up 47 percent of the youth transferred from juvenile to adult courts. to add, a 2016 study in economics of education review found that non-black teachers have lower expectations of black students — an attitude that perpetuates low self-esteem.\n\nthe school-to-prison pipeline\n\nhenson understood the need for more mental health care not just because she's parent, but because she was a substitute teacher before landing her breakout role in the film baby boy in 2001. she worked in a special education classroom full of black boys, she said. one day, one of the boys simply said to her i can't learn this. i can't do this, she says.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nshe worked with the boys in that classroom to build their confidence and let them know she believed they were capable of learning. that student went on to be able to do the math problems by the time she left.\n\nmost black children, however, do not have a teacher who understands where they are coming from, or what their mental health needs may be. only 7 percent of public k-12 teachers are black. and most schools don't have the resources to help the students who need counseling.\n\nif you have a child or young adult facing issues with mental health, they should feel that they have access to talk to someone, says jay ruderman, president of disability inclusion organization the ruderman family foundation, who recently honored henson with its award recognizing mental health advocacy. there should be counseling that allows them to talk either individually to a psychologist or in peer groups.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe reality, however, is that almost no state meets the minimum student-to-mental-health expert ratio recommended by the u.s. department of education. instead, black students with mental health disorders are suspended, expelled and otherwise punished at twice the rate of white students in schools. a study in the journal emotion found that teachers incorrectly judge the emotions of black students as angry more often than white students. the criminalization of mental illness in black children combined with teacher biases push black children who need help and mental health care into the criminal justice system through school referrals instead.\n\nending the cycle\n\nthe need to present as a strong black woman initially kept henson from facing her own traumas. then, instead of simply continuing to just cope, she found strength in saying, i'm not okay. now, she's a believer in the power of therapy to start the cycle of healing for the sake of black children.\n\nad\n\nad\n\naccording to statistics by mental health america in 2018, only about 50 percent of black adults with mental illness received treatment. mullan says therapy that takes historical factors and cultural needs, while focusing on healing rather than just diagnosis, can make the difference for black people and ultimately black youth. she explains that intergenerational trauma is not only about passing down behaviors and beliefs. research supports that trauma can leave a chemical mark on a person's genes, she says. our environment changes our genes, our dna expression, and that is passed down to subsequent generations.\n\nresearch also shows that epigenetic changes can be reversed with trauma-focused therapy, stopping the cycle of passing down old generational wounds to children. cultural parenting norms that have been passed down also feed into the cycle of trauma.\n\nhistorically, the black american woman, the enslaved african woman, actually felt the need to give stern boundaries to their children, says mullan. the fear was if i, as a parent, don't stop you from acting a certain way, master, officer, or whatever authority figure is going to kill you, hang you, or keep you in line.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthis dynamic of tough love parenting and even physical punishment, she says, is passed down through generations. the result is a generation of black children without the proper tools and resources to stay aware of their mental health. without widespread access to culturally competent mental health care plus systemic racism and exposure to the constant police killings of black people, which studies show have an adverse mental health impact on black people, a mental health crisis among black youth is seemingly inevitable.\n\nwhile mullan believes in the power of therapy to reverse this course, she acknowledges its current limits. you can't separate someone's culture and race and how they're treated out in the world from who they are, their treatment, and their healing work within therapy, she says. [therapists] must take a more environmental and social perspective, something like social workers have been doing for some time.\n\nhenson is a big proponent of family therapy and normalizing therapy starting at a young age to help black children avoid resorting to coping mechanisms in the form of bad habits. don't wait until problems happen, she says. give them the confidence now to say what they need and to get to the root of how they're feeling.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwhen her son was a teenager, she was thankful he had someone to talk to about the things he was embarrassed or didn't want to talk about with her. in the current social climate and with the presence of racism in their daily lives, black young people are faced with an overwhelming amount of stress.\n\nwhat i see as a psychologist when i look at black youth are these young little beings already affected and carrying the load of their parents, their great grandparents, and lineages of being kidnapped and displaced from their homeland, says mullan.\n\nwithout a concerted effort to prioritize black mental health and reverse the downward trends in mental health in the black community, henson says the future of a generation of black children is at stake. our children are bearing the burden, says henson. how can they dream for the future when the future is so unsure?\n\nkelly glass is a journalist. she's on twitter @kellygwriter.\n\njoin our discussion group here to talk about parenting and balancing a career, or sign up here for our newsletter.
sixty-six percent of all oxycodone sold in florida came from this company. but the dea's case against it faltered.\n\nto combat an escalating opioid epidemic, the drug enforcement administration trained its sights in 2011 on mallinckrodt pharmaceuticals, one of the nation's largest manufacturers of the highly addictive generic painkiller oxycodone.\n\nit was the first time the dea had targeted a manufacturer of opioids for alleged violations of laws designed to prevent diversion of legal narcotics to the black market. and it would become the largest prescription-drug case the agency has pursued.\n\nultimately, the dea and federal prosecutors would contend that the company ignored its responsibility to report suspicious orders as 500 million of its pills ended up in florida between 2008 and 2012 — 66 percent of all oxycodone sold in the state. government investigators alleged in internal documents that the company's lack of due diligence could have resulted in nearly 44,000 federal violations and exposed it to $2.3 billion in fines, according to confidential government records and emails obtained by the washington post.\n\nbut six years later, after four investigations that spanned five states, the government has taken no legal action against mallinckrodt. instead, the company has reached a tentative settlement with federal prosecutors, according to sources familiar with the discussions. under the proposal, which remains confidential, mallinckrodt would agree to pay a $35 million fine and admit no wrongdoing.\n\nmallinckrodt's response was that ­'everyone knew what was going on in florida but they had no duty to report it,'  according to an internal summary of the case prepared by federal prosecutors and obtained by the post.\n\nthe case shows how difficult it is for the government to hold a drug manufacturer responsible for the damage done by its product. dea investigators appalled by rising overdose deaths said they worked for years to build the biggest case of their careers only to watch it falter on uncertain legal territory and in the face of stiff resistance from the company.\n\nthey just weren't taking this seriously, and people were dying, said a former law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case is pending. people were dying all over the place. it wasn't their kids, their wives, their husbands, their brothers. it was some hillbilly in central florida, so who cares?\n\nin a statement, a mallinckrodt spokesman said the company has worked hard to fight drug diversion.\n\nmallinckrodt has long been a recognized leader in developing and sharing best practices related to the prevention of opioid diversion and misuse, and has continuously invested significant resources to address this serious drug epidemic, the statement said. we are proud of the programs and initiatives we've developed to ensure appropriate use of pain medication and, most importantly, to deter such medications from ending up in the wrong hands.\n\nofficials at the dea declined to comment for this article. the u.s. attorney's office in detroit, which is handling the case, issued a statement. our office works diligently to use all the legal tools available to us to hold corporations responsible for their actions, acting u.s. attorney daniel lemisch said. this is particularly true in a highly regulated industry such as the manufacture of opioids. as this case is still in settlement negotiations, we cannot comment on the specifics of the matter.\n\nthe path of

illustrations by peter and maria hoey for the washington post\n\nunder federal law and dea policy, pharmaceutical companies such as mallinckrodt are required to know their customers and monitor the pattern, frequency and amounts of drug orders. when suspicious orders occur, companies must immediately notify the agency or risk losing their dea licenses to sell or manufacture controlled substances, as well as face civil and criminal penalties.\n\naccording to the documents and sources familiar with the settlement talks, mallinckrodt was willing to acknowledge its responsibility to report suspiciously large orders placed by its customers, a network of wholesale distributors. but the company said that it should not be held responsible for what happens to its drugs once the distributors send them to their customers, such as doctors and pharmacies. mallinckrodt contended that the dea has never required manufacturers to know their customers' customers and that the agency provided the company with conflicting advice about its responsibilities under the law.\n\nmallinckrodt took unprecedented steps beyond the legal obligations of a manufacturer. mallinckrodt began monitoring downstream sales between wholesalers and pharmacies, and proactively informed both its customers and the dea of its findings, said brien t. o'connor, a lawyer for the company. the company continues to enhance its anti-diversion programs to this day.\n\nthe proposed $35 million settlement comes as the nation's prescription opioid epidemic continues to worsen, with nearly 180,000 lives lost to overdoses since 2000.\n\ndeaths from prescription opioid overdose continue to rise in us 15,281 15,000 the highest year on record, prescription opioids killed an average of 42 people a day.

efforts against the mammoth wholesale distributors that deliver painkillers to pharmacies stalled in the face of a stepped-up lobbying campaign by the drug industry.\n\nthe mallinckrodt case was something different: an aggressive attempt to hold a drug manufacturer accountable.\n\nmallinckrodt was founded 150 years ago in st. louis and became the leading supplier of chemicals for the emerging photography industry. now based in the united kingdom after corporate acquisitions, mallinckrodt is one of the nation's largest manufacturers of oxycodone, a powerful opioid made from the natural painkiller found in poppies.\n\nwhen you get to the manufacturing level, it's hard to prove that they knew what was happening, another law enforcement official familiar with the investigation said. but they were making the product, they were selling it to the country's largest distributors, and they had a responsibility under the law to detect and report orders that were suspicious. these orders were beyond suspicious.\n\nthe dea and federal prosecutors contended that mallinckrodt manufactured 500 million pills that ended up in florida between 2008 and 2012 — 66 percent of all oxycodone sold in the state.\n\nthe investigation begins\n\nthe first hint that mallinckrodt might pose a problem for the dea came not from florida but from tennessee.\n\non july 7, 2009, members of a tennessee drug task force in a sting operation seized several 100-tablet bottles of ­mallinckrodt-made oxycodone. task force agents alerted mallinckrodt. the company's lot numbers were printed on the labels, allowing for easy tracking of the pills.\n\nthree days later, mallinckrodt responded that the oxycodone had been prescribed by barry schultz, a doctor who ran a medical clinic in delray beach, fla. the company said that one of its distributors, sunrise wholesale of broward county, fla., had sent 20,400 tablets of oxycodone to schultz in the previous year.\n\nthe florida department of health had just issued an administrative complaint against schultz for prescribing oxycodone outside the course of his professional practice. his medical office had become a thoroughfare for those seeking easy access to drugs, records show.\n\non july 27, a mallinckrodt security director told dea supervisor paul pete kleissle in st. louis about the tennessee connection. kleissle recommended that mallinckrodt conduct an audit of sunrise and the company agreed, government documents show.\n\nthe investigation seemed to stall there, but the events in tennessee would later prove significant.\n\nat the time, the dea's diversion control division was ramping up enforcement efforts against the nation's wholesale drug distributors — including sunrise — warning them and drug manufacturers that they would be held accountable if they failed to report suspicious orders. under the dea's distributor initiative, the agency had begun to make cases against large and small wholesalers.\n\nin 2010 and 2011, dea investigators in several states started to see large amounts of mallinckrodt's oxycodone being sent to florida.\n\nby then, mallinckrodt's blue ­30-milligram oxycodone tablets had become so popular among drug users and dealers that they had a street name — m's, for the company's distinctive block-letter logo.\n\nkeysource medical, based in cincinnati, sent 41 million tablets of mallinckrodt-made oxycodone to florida in 2010, documents show. one of the pharmacies keysource supplied was tru-valu drugs in lake worth. with lines out the door and security measures such as a guard dog, left, and guns, tru-valu came under investigation by the dea.

dea gabriel florit/the washington post\n\non aug. 23, 2011, dea supervisors met with mallinckrodt executives at the agency's headquarters in arlington, va., the day a rare 5.8-magnitude earthquake hit the washington region. people involved in the case still call the gathering the earthquake meeting.\n\ndea officials showed the company the remarkable amounts of its oxycodone going to distributors and the number of arrests being made for oxycodone possession and distribution on the street, according to one participant in the meeting who also spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case is pending.\n\nthere were a lot of follow-ups, and they said they would adjust their practices, the participant said.\n\nthe next day, the dea's chief regulatory officer wrote to the agency's investigators and a federal prosecutor assigned to the case, leslie wizner, an assistant u.s. attorney in detroit.\n\ni think we can all agree that yesterday's meeting was an eye opener for the company, and very successful, on so many levels, from dea's perspective, barbara j. boockholdt wrote in an email obtained by the post. she noted that there were pending and proposed investigations of mallinckrodt.\n\nboockholdt declined to comment. wizner did not return calls requesting an interview.\n\nthree weeks after the aug. 23 meeting, mallinckrodt notified 43 of its distributors that they would no longer receive rebates from the company if they continued to supply certain pharmacies whose orders appeared to be suspicious.\n\nbut by then, the dea and federal prosecutors had decided to take the investigation of the company to another level.\n\non nov. 30, 2011, the dea served a subpoena on mallinckrodt, demanding documents related to its suspicious-order-monitoring program, according to the company's filings with the securities and exchange commission.\n\nprosecutors said that the mallinckrodt drugs that sunrise sent to schultz in the six weeks after mallinckrodt was notified of the tennessee sting were worth nearly $2.8 million on the street.\n\nconfidence grows\n\nthe subpoena brought a windfall of information. the dea gained access to data from mallinckrodt's rebate or chargeback program, an industry-wide practice that provides reimbursements to wholesale distributors. that information and other records showed where mallinckrodt's oxycodone was going — from the company to its network of distributors to retailers down the chain.\n\nthe significance of the tennessee case started to become clear.\n\nthe dea learned that in the six weeks after the tennessee task force alerted mallinckrodt to the drugs found in the 2009 sting operation, the company had shipped another 2.1 million tablets of oxycodone to sunrise, the florida distributor.\n\nthe dea also discovered that sunrise, over an 11-month period, had sent at least 92,400 tablets to schultz, the delray beach doctor who prescribed the pills found in tennessee. in one day, he had prescribed 1,000 tablets to one patient.\n\nat the time, the street value of oxycodone was $30 a tablet. the mallinckrodt drugs that sunrise sent to schultz after mallinckrodt was notified of the tennessee sting were worth nearly $2.8 million on the street, prosecutors said.\n\nbarry schultz, a doctor who ran a medical clinic in delray beach, fla., was sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2016. he was charged with drug trafficking and manslaughter after one of his patients died of an overdose. (bruce r. bennett/palm beach post)\n\nprosecutors were becoming increasingly confident in their case. under pressure from the dea, sunrise had surrendered its license to distribute narcotics. the palm beach county sheriff's office had arrested schultz, charging him with drug trafficking and manslaughter because one of his patients died of a drug overdose. schultz was later convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison.\n\nmallinckrodt knew through law enforcement reports that barry schultz was diverting controlled substances, and that the diverted oxycodone was supplied by mallinckrodt through sunrise, prosecutors later wrote in an internal document sent to the company. when mallinckrodt continued to distribute oxycodone to sunrise for such purposes, and continued to pay incentives in the form of chargebacks for the product sales to barry schultz, mallinckrodt was diverting oxycodone.\n\nin oct. 22, 2012, the dea served mallinckrodt with another subpoena for records relating to its suspicious-order-monitoring program, the company disclosed in sec filings.\n\nthose filings also showed that the dea was examining mallinckrodt's plant in hobart, n.y., about 70 miles southwest of albany. investigators documented scores of alleged violations, including the failure to secure narcotics, to keep accurate records or to document transfers of drugs, according to a confidential memo obtained by the post.\n\nprosecutors said they considered 43,991 orders from distributors and retailers to be suspicious — orders that mallinckrodt should have reported to the dea. but the company said it was impossible to monitor all of the 55,000 retail outlets where its drugs are delivered.\n\nconflicting rules guidance\n\nin 2014, mallinckrodt, which is publicly traded and maintains its u.s. headquarters in st. louis, notified its shareholders that it was under investigation by the federal government and had received subpoenas for documents.\n\nbut with no sign of civil action by the dea, the company said it believed that the ultimate resolution will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. in fiscal 2016, the company posted $3.4 billion in revenue and a $489 million profit.\n\nbehind the scenes, however, the case against mallinckrodt was growing more serious.\n\nprosecutors said in internal documents that they found the company's behavior so egregious that they initially considered framing it as a civil conspiracy.\n\nmallinckrodt did knowingly, intentionally and unlawfully combine, conspire, confederate and agree with sunrise and barry schultz to commit offenses against the united states, prosecutors wrote in a draft complaint against the company that was never filed. that is, to knowingly, intentionally and unlawfully distribute, dispense or prescribe controlled substances, including but not limited to the schedule ii drug oxycodone 30 mg.\n\no'connor, the mallinckrodt lawyer, said that the draft document reflects discredited allegations made in the heat of negotiations in 2015 and that the government and the company moved past those accusations.\n\nin particular, it is wrong to suggest mallinckrodt was involved in any conspiracy related to dr. barry schultz and sunrise wholesale, o'connor said. in reality, mallinckrodt worked with law enforcement to investigate potential diversion by the physician and to audit sunrise, and, importantly, the dea praised the company's handling of the investigation.\n\nprosecutors weighed the strengths and weaknesses of their case in an internal summary they prepared aug. 7, 2014.\n\nwe will argue that thousands of orders from the distributors as well as tens of thousands of orders from these down-stream customers were suspicious because of the pattern of distribution to florida, prosecutors wrote. in all, they said they considered 43,991 orders from distributors and retailers to be suspicious — orders that mallinckrodt should have reported to the dea.\n\na dea agent walks out of the cabana pharmacy in miami after raiding it along with police and the florida department of health in october 2011. the owner and two of his employees were arrested after a six-month investigation by law enforcement in connection with the sale of oxycodone to those without a prescription. (joe raedle/getty images)\n\nprosecutors also acknowledged the weaknesses of their case in the summary. they noted that the dea had provided conflicting guidance to mallinckrodt about its responsibilities to report suspicious orders from retailers such as schultz.\n\nfor example, kleissle, the dea supervisor in st. louis, had told the company in 2010 after the tennessee sting that it had a responsibility to keep close tabs on its customers, the distributors, as well as the distributor's customers, the pharmacies and doctors.\n\nbut that same year, a dea investigator in new york, heather white, told ­mallinckrodt that no one in her region, including her supervisor, had heard anything about know your customer's customer and that the regulations do not reflect such a requirement, according to the prosecutor's summary. white declined to comment for this article.\n\nmallinckrodt pushed back against the government's contention that it was responsible for the acts of downstream retail customers such as schultz.\n\nthe company said during discussions with prosecutors that it was impossible to monitor all of the 55,000 retail outlets where its drugs are delivered. mal­linckrodt also said that the dea was aware of the company's increased sales of oxycodone and could have acted by reducing the amount of narcotics the company is permitted to sell. the dea sets quotas for the quantities of controlled substances that can be manufactured. the company also complained that the dea has not provided guidance on how to track suspicious orders.\n\nmallinckrodt has agreed to pay a settlement amount relating to orders from its distributors, prosecutors wrote in the summary. however, it refuses to negotiate any settlement relating to the downstream customers orders.\n\nthe company put together a ­high-powered legal team to fight on its behalf. it included o'connor, a former federal prosecutor who specialized in fraud and corruption cases, and d. linden barber, a former associate chief counsel for the dea's diversion division who was one of the architects of the agency's crackdown on the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nfollowing negotiations between mallinckrodt's legal team and the u.s. attorney's office in detroit, prosecutors dropped the civil conspiracy allegation, according to sources close to the talks. the negotiations then focused on the relationship between mallinckrodt and its distributors, their customers and the amount of drugs that were going to florida.\n\nprosecutors noted that the dea had twice placed the industry on notice about its responsibility to report suspicious orders. they also said mallinckrodt was aware of enforcement actions the agency had taken against distributors for failing to report the inordinate amounts of painkillers they were shipping to retail customers in states such as florida.\n\nwith respect to distributor orders, prosecutors wrote in a document, ­mallinckrodt's obligations to monitor and notify of suspicious sales were known to the company.\n\nfor a company the size of mallinckrodt, a $35 million fine is chump change, one government official said. in fiscal 2016, the company posted $3.4 billion in revenue and a $489 million profit .\n\nabout more than money\n\non july 10, 2015, the u.s. attorney's office sent a proposed settlement offer to lawyers for mallinckrodt.\n\nprosecutors said that they could fine the company as much as $2.3 billion because 222,107 orders to florida were excessive and should have been reported as suspicious. or they could fine the company up to $1.3 billion based on an analysis of the 217,022,834 mallinckrodt 30 mg oxycodone tablets that were sold for cash in florida in 2009 and 2010.\n\nas you are aware, significant cash sales are an indication of diversion, prosecutors wrote in their offer.\n\nbut the big buildup resulted in a much smaller proposed fine. despite the billion-dollar figures bandied about, the prosecutors proposed settling the case for $70 million. they cited the litigation risk they faced if the case went to trial, mallinckrodt's previous legal arguments and the size of other recent settlements with drug distributors.\n\nthis year, on feb. 7, mallinckrodt told its shareholders in an sec filing that the investigation will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition because it has set aside the money.\n\nsources close to the negotiations said that the two sides had recently reached a tentative agreement to settle the case for $35 million. with final approval pending from the justice department, some of those who worked on the case said they are deeply disappointed by the dollar amount of the proposed fine.\n\ndrug manufacturers have paid much larger fines for other misdeeds. glaxo­smithkline was fined $3 billion, and pfizer was fined $2.3 billion for illegally promoting off-label drug use and paying kickbacks to doctors. purdue pharma paid a $600 million fine, and three of its executives pleaded guilty to charges that they misled regulators, doctors and patients about the risks of the painkiller that is widely blamed for setting off the nation's opioid crisis: oxycontin. all of those cases were initiated by the food and drug administration.\n\nthe largest fine the dea has levied against a drug distributor was the $150 million that mckesson, the nation's largest drug wholesaler, recently agreed to pay following allegations that it failed to report suspicious orders of painkillers.\n\nfor a company the size of mallinckrodt, a $35 million fine is chump change, one government official said.\n\nthe problem you have is this was new ground, and it had never been done before, said another former law enforcement official with knowledge of the case. there was a lot of back and forth over whether we could pull this off. is it ideal? no. is this a number that everyone wants to see? no. people would probably like to see more. but this is about more than money. it's about holding a manufacturer accountable, and it will put the industry on notice.\n\nalice crites contributed to this report.

while epa administrator andrew wheeler signed the final rule last week, he announced it tuesday at a virtual session hosted by the competitive enterprise institute, a think tank that advocates fewer federal regulations and disputes the idea that climate change poses a major threat to the united states.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe american public deserves to know which studies we are using to craft our regulations, wheeler said. we want to make all this information available to the public and shine some light on it.\n\nmany of the nation's leading researchers and academic organizations, however, argue that the criteria will actually restrict the epa from using some of the most consequential research on human subjects because it often includes confidential medical records and other proprietary data that cannot be released because of privacy concerns.\n\nthe people pushing it are claiming it's in the interest of science, but the entire independent science world says it's not, said chris zarba, a former director of the epa's science advisory board who retired in 2018 after nearly four decades at the agency. it sounds good on the surface. but this is a bold attempt to get science out of the way so special interests can do what they want.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe new standards affect not just significant regulatory actions, according to the new rule, but also influential scientific information that the epa shares with the public, on its websites and elsewhere.\n\nthe rule reflects the trump administration's dogged push to lock in as many policies as possible before president-elect joe biden takes office on jan. 20. although the new administration will probably seek to overturn it, such an effort will take months, if not longer. the epa administrator is allowed to waive the requirement on a case-by-case basis, but it is possible that outside groups could challenge those waivers in court.\n\nforcing researchers to disclose their raw data has for years been a top priority for conservative republicans — including some now working in the epa's upper ranks. the new rule was modeled on a bill championed by former house science committee chairman lamar smith (r-tex.). one of the panel's former staffers, richard yamada, helped write an early version of the regulation while serving at the epa.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nconservatives have been particularly critical of two studies that have spurred increased regulation: a 1993 harvard university six cities project that linked air pollution to premature deaths and a columbia university analysis of a widely used pesticide, chlorpyrifos, that suggested the chemical causes neurological damage in babies.\n\naccording to a document obtained under the freedom of information act, trump officials discussed how to block such research in a jan. 25, 2018, briefing on the proposed rule. referring to harvard's six cities study and another pollution study conducted by the american cancer society, the notes read, the scientific community has identified major shortcomings in the methodologies and findings of these studies, all of which could be addressed if epa provided the underlying data for independent review.\n\nin the wake of protests from public health experts and congressional democrats, the epa revised the proposal so that it would not apply retroactively to past assessments of studies like the ones cited in the 2018 meeting.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbut environmental defense fund general counsel vickie patton, whose group obtained the document, said in an email that it reveals the trump epa is focused on attacking the peer-reviewed health science that has saved tens of thousands of lives each year from deadly air pollution and protected america's children from pesticides.\n\nandrew rosenberg, who directs the union of concerned scientists' center for science and democracy and regularly reviews scientific studies before they are published in academic journals, said that the agency's emphasis on the need for raw data is misplaced.\n\nas a well-experienced peer reviewer, i very rarely scrutinize raw data, he said. rather, i look at data collection and analysis methods, summary and other statistics and graphics and results and conclusions to determine the validity of a study and the strength of its scientific evidence.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe epa has not published estimates on how much it will cost to implement the rule and what effect it will have on public health.\n\nbecause researchers are particularly reluctant to release individual medical records used in human studies, rosenberg said, the rule disproportionately affects epidemiological studies, which is ironic in the midst of a pandemic. because these data can't be made public, epa will ignore epidemiological evidence of population-level effects of contaminants, pollution and other environmental threats.\n\nwheeler said critics of the rule had distorted both its intent and its impact. he said that a pivotal study like the harvard one, which has influenced key federal pollution standards that have saved thousands of lives and been economically beneficial, might still be able to inform future policies if the next administrator determines it is justified and publishes the reasoning behind that decision.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthere is no study that will automatically be cut out from review by the agency, he said. what this new rule would undoubtedly do is provide transparency needed to allow the public the opportunity needed to check our work.\n\nthe american chemistry council, the primary trade association for u.s. chemical companies, was among the supporters who welcomed the new rule.\n\nit will strengthen epa's regulatory process by helping ensure that it is relying on the best available science — science that is reliable and unbiased — and by making the underlying research and data publicly available in ways that protect personal privacy, confidential business information, proprietary interests and intellectual property rights, acc spokesman jon corley said in a statement.\n\nad\n\nthomas sinks, who previously led the office of the science advisor at the epa and oversaw its rules on research involving human subjects, is among numerous scientists who note that the epa already has a robust scientific integrity policy and a long-standing peer-review process for any data upon which it relies.\n\nad\n\nit is based on a conspiracy theory, which is that epa practices secret science, sinks, who wrote a forceful rebuke of the new rule before his retirement in september, said of the effort. but there's no evidence epa practices secret science. i'm unaware of an example where epa hasn't clearly stated what science it is using in its rulemaking.\n\nsinks said he also worries that tuesday's final rule deepens the broader attack on science by the trump administration, and that it could have a lasting impact that goes beyond any single regulation.
dear amy: my wife of 20 years surrendered her daughter, betsy, for adoption 30 years ago.\n\nmy wife and i were reunited with betsy 10 years ago and have become very close, although betsy lives in a different state.\n\nbetsy and her adoptive parents have become estranged over the past few years.\n\nso now betsy wants to divorce her current adoptive parents because of what she feels are irreconcilable differences and for (future) legal reasons that also involve her daughter (who is 8 years old). the adoptive parents considered her their granddaughter, of course.\n\nnow betsy is asking my wife and her biological father, who has been out of the picture for 30 years, to become her new adoptive parents.\n\ni'm very open-minded, but something doesn't feel quite right.\n\nat first, i thought this recognition was a nice idea, but now i feel that to go before a judge and make a public statement that she and betsy's biological father are now adoptive parents, puts me in an uncomfortable position.\n\ni really have no idea what the legal ramifications might be for me and my wife, but really, the fact that a public statement is being made between the daughter's biological parents is what makes me most uncomfortable.\n\nto complicate the matter further, my wife and i have children together, and we each have children from a previous marriage.\n\ndo you think i am being an oversensitive territorial man?\n\nno prior precedent\n\nno prior precedent: you are not being oversensitive. betsy is not being sensitive enough. as your wife's longtime husband and father to the children, you two have together (and the children you had before your marriage), you detect a challenge to these relationships.\n\ni agree that this puts you in a vulnerable spot, and you should be very honest about your reaction to it.\n\ncheck your state laws regarding adult adoption. some states require a spouse to sign a form approving the adoption. you and your wife should see an attorney regarding all of the legal ramifications to this adoption, for you and your entire family circle (including all of your collective children, as well as her child).\n\nadditionally, you and your wife should see a family counselor to discuss the impact on you and your children. if betsy manipulates your wife or pressures her for the adoption to be done very quickly, you should be skeptical about her motives. do not agree to this in haste.\n\ndear amy: i have been married for 34 years. my husband has a thing about being interrupted when he's talking. he gets very angry and will say, i'm talking! in a very rude manner.\n\ni never intend to interrupt him, but sometimes in a conversation, it just happens.\n\nhis response, and the way he delivers it, is embarrassing and hurtful.\n\nhe has also said, stifle! to me in the past, although i think i have gotten the message across to him that this is unacceptable.\n\nwhat should i do?\n\nembarrassed\n\nembarrassed: you are not responsible for your husband's rudeness. you are responsible for your own rudeness. and so — the very first thing you should do is to make a more concerted effort not to interrupt people. it is a very tough habit to break, but tackling this will make you a better listener and will change the dynamic in many of your relationships.\n\nthe next time you are aware that you are interrupting him, you should put your hand on his arm, make eye contact, and say, i'm sorry for interrupting; i realize you didn't finish your thought. this is meant to model respectful behavior, which your husband needs to adopt.\n\nwhen you two discuss this issue, you should let him know that he is not archie bunker, and you are not edith. nobody needs to be told to stifle. when he embarrasses you, he really embarrasses himself.\n\nhoney, you're interrupting, or hang on and let me finish what i was saying are sufficient corrections.\n\ndear amy: concerned mom described her challenging relationship with her daughter. both mother and daughter are bipolar.\n\ni learned a lot and was helped by the good people at the national alliance on mental illness. i found a local support group, and now i don't feel so alone.\n\nbeen there\n\nbeen there: i applaud the work of nami in advocating for people with mental illness. they have launched an app called nami air, which is a social network to help people connect with one another.
dating after a divorce is pretty comparable to dating as a teenager. you still have to be home before midnight, no one spends the night until you're practically married, and nobody has the first clue what they want out of the relationship. the only difference is that now you both have more baggage and significantly less elasticity. and if you're a parent, you're now dragging defenseless little mini-humans on the rickety emotional roller coaster along with you.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nit's terrifying, which is probably why so many single parents choose to shelter their kids from their dating life until they're ready to remarry. frankly, i'd shelter myself from it, too, if it weren't for those cats.\n\ni understand the desire to offer children stability, especially while they adjust to new living arrangements. however, i also feel that by denying them the opportunity to witness loss and heartache as a normal and survivable part of life, we could be obstructing their ability to develop the skills they will need to endure their own breakups as they grow up and enter the world. it's an example of short-term versus long-term benefit.\n\nlet's face it, no one is prepared to talk to their children about divorce and dating. it doesn't matter how many books and articles you read on the subject, how long you wait, how many psychologists you consult, the force of the blow will inevitably knock the wind out of you. because, like it or not, your romantic life — your ups and your downs, your excitement and your heartbreak — is now a communal experience. even if your children never meet your new partners, they will still feel the emotional upheaval with each new scar on your heart. it's a lot of pressure.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nfrom the moment my children were born, i believed that my purpose was to keep them safe and happy, to teach them about the world and to guide them through life with as little pain as possible. but life involves pain. dealing with pain requires skills, and mastering the skills necessary to withstand pain takes practice. and there are few other experiences as universally painful as a broken heart.\n\nstudies have found that, neurologically, breakups are processed in a very similar way to physical pain and addiction. they are assigned equal urgency and importance to, and can stimulate the same fight-or-flight behaviors as touching your hand to a hot stove. we become addicted to our partners and can experience withdrawal in as corporeal a way as if we were weaning ourselves off alcohol.\n\nbreakups hurt.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthis isn't news to anyone who has recently been dumped, but it turns out that after being in a relationship for 12 years, i was not prepared. my world imploded around me, my hopes crumbled, and it hit me like a sucker punch to the gut. i couldn't breathe. not for moments or even days, but for months. i couldn't breathe for months. and the worst part was my kids asking me why we didn't see our friend anymore. i wanted to lie. i wished i'd never introduced him into our lives. i cursed my naivete and my poor judgment.\n\nbut then i noticed my kids were mostly upset because i was hurting. they didn't know about old maids. they didn't know about the 14 cats. all they knew was when mommy cried they searched for a reason. when i said i missed my friend, they understood and related it to their own experiences. they missed him, too. watching their little faces mirror my sadness was humbling. and it made me reflect on how common a thing is loss and grief.\n\npeople we love move away, they grow apart, break up, have fights, and eventually some of them pass away. it's inevitable, yet the experience of loss is intense and filled with unfamiliar emotions. and when we are young, we look to our parents for guidance on how to interpret those feelings. what was i teaching them? that losing a friend or a loved one was earth-shattering. that it was a pain that crumbled even their heroes and protectors to dust.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nso i decided to change the lesson.\n\nstudies show that the stories we tell about breakups have a tangible effect on the pain it causes. when people reminisce about love in a way that is appreciative and grateful for the experience, they tend to suffer less than those who think of the breakup as a betrayal or violation of trust. this is particularly true if the person who was dumped looks for internal reasons for the breakup.\n\ndid i do something wrong?\n\nwas i not good enough?\n\nshould i adopt another cat now?\n\nso the next time i wanted to quit and fall asleep next to my 3-year-old in her bed at 7:30 p.m. because i couldn't face another night alone, i talked to my kids. except this time, i talked about how wonderful it is that special people come in and out of our lives, and just because we miss them doesn't mean it wasn't important or meaningful. each and every person we love leaves a mark on our heart, and all of them together make us who we are. in other words, i faked it. big-time.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nand it worked.\n\nstudies have shown that even insincere positive self-talk in the face of addiction recovery and heartbreak can change the outcome. and the kids jumped on board. they smiled and talked about the things they liked and the things they missed about friends and family who lived far away. and i started to feel better, too. i'd changed the narrative of my breakup to something positive. after i'd told the story a few times, it became my reality.\n\nyes, dating is ugly. it's dangerous and primal and sometimes feels like a suicide mission. it's natural to want to shelter children from the whole nasty cluster bomb. but as it turns out, modeling effective coping strategies for dealing with sadness and loss might be more beneficial in the long run than simply pretending nothing ever hurts.\n\nad\n\nsomeday our babies will grow up. they'll fall in love and make plans. and some wicked person will come along to break their hearts, too. and as parents, the best we can do to comfort them is to hold them when they cry and remind them that grief makes us appreciate the beauty in each moment. it reminds us that we are alive. our goal isn't to protect our children from life. it's to give them the skills to thrive.\n\nad\n\nmight as well start practicing now.\n\nwiddicks is a former cognitive psychologist, freelance writer and novelist. her debut novel, a mutual addiction, will be released in january. read more at marywiddicks.com. you can find her on twitter @marywiddicks.\n\nlike on parenting on facebook for more essays, news and updates and sign up here for our weekly newsletter.

since then, most of the world — the united states being an exception — has banned the production and use of land mines because of their threat to civilians long after wars end.\n\nad\n\nso the trump administration's decision this week to expand the use of land mines has baffled and angered humans rights and arms control groups, which say the decision further imperils anyone who may encounter the weapons.\n\nit's incredibly troubling we're having such a step back in acceptable international norms, rachel stohl, an arms control expert at the stimson center, a nonpartisan policy research center, told the washington post on saturday. this is one of the most inhumane weapons that we know of.\n\nad\n\nit's a potential humanitarian catastrophe to use them again, she added.\n\nin 2018, nearly 20 civilians were killed or injured every day by land mines and other unexploded ordnance remnants, such as cluster munitions, according to the international coalition to ban landmines. that is almost certainly a conservative number. children represented 40 percent of the casualties, the group reported.\n\nwhat are land mines, and what has changed?\n\nthe new policy affects anti-personnel land mines, which are small explosive charges buried in or placed on the ground.\n\nad\n\nthey are designed to kill and injure enemy forces. tactically, they are used to delay enemy troop movement or force combatants to take another path. that makes their movement more predictable and can help u.s. forces target them more easily.\n\nbut they remain where they were placed and often kill, maim and blind civilians years or even decades later.\n\nad\n\nwar surgeons consider [mines] among the worst injuries they have to treat, the international committee of the red cross has said.\n\nland mine use and production are banned by 164 countries. the united states is not one of them, but obama-era restrictions only allowed anti-personnel land mines to be used in defense of the korean peninsula and called for destroying stockpiles that were not meant for that defense. the new trump policy reverses those regulations.\n\nad\n\nmost land mines that menace civilians are dumb or persistent, meaning they are built with mechanical fuses and are triggered by the victim with no other safeguards. they can remain dangerous indefinitely until someone — commonly a child or farmer — encounters one in the dirt. the united states does not have any of these land mines in its inventory, defense officials said.\n\nad\n\nin recent decades, the united states has produced smart or nonpersistent mines that can be set to self-destruct in a certain number of minutes, hours or days after they are deployed.\n\nare land mines really safer now?\n\nthe capability of nonpersistent mines was championed by the pentagon on friday when it defended the policy change, with one official claiming a 6-in-1 million chance of a u.s. land mine being active after a pre-determined period.\n\nad\n\nnonpersistent mines would lead to a lower risk of harm to civilians, the pentagon said, but the agency did not respond to a follow-up question asking how that number was calculated.\n\nexperts second-guessed that confidence and have rejected the notion of a smart mine as risk-free or danger-free to civilians.\n\nlike any microchip-based electronic device, there are going to be failures, said mark hiznay, the associate arms director for humans rights watch. hiznay speculated that the pentagon estimate was conjured by calculating electrical component failure rates, not actual mine deployment studies.\n\nother evidence points to an imperfect weapon that posed a danger to u.s. troops.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nnearly 120,000 smart, nonpersistent mines were used in the gulf war, which was the last time the united states used land mines in warfare outside a single use in afghanistan in 2002. even though the pentagon suggested a low dud rate, anti-personnel and antitank weapons that failed to self-detonate littered kuwait, a 2002 government accountability office report said.\n\nnearly 2,000 duds were uncovered by contractors working in one sector alone out of seven, the gao report concluded.\n\nevery dud is dangerous, hiznay said.\n\nand because of uneven and chaotic battlefield reporting, it is possible some u.s. casualties attributed to enemy land mines and explosives were caused by these munitions, the gao report said.\n\nad\n\nnewer land mines were developed to mitigate future harm to civilians. the spider networked munition, for instance, includes a human in the loop that allows troops to trigger the explosives and show locations on gps.\n\nad\n\nbut it is unclear if the land mines the pentagon has authorized for use will include such an oversight ability. the agency did not address a question about that capability.\n\nwhat does this mean for civilians and the future of war?\n\npentagon officials have said commanders need the option to use anti-personnel mines to take on conventional adversaries such as china and russia.\n\nbut one problem that may arise: all nato partners of the united states have signed onto the ban, potentially creating problems in theoretical coalition missions, said stohl of the stimson center.\n\nad\n\nand future battlefields may be so dynamic that the mines might not disarm in time before they harm whoever is nearby.\n\nwhen it's active, it's not distinguishing between a civilian and a legitimate target, stohl said.\n\nthat alarm has been sounded by commanders for decades.\n\nad\n\n''what the hell is the use of sowing [anti-personnel mines] if you're going to move through it next week or next month? former marine corps commandant gen. alfred m. gray jr. said in 1993.\n\nthe pentagon's embrace of land mines also puts it at odds with a key diplomatic state department program, which has worked to find and destroy remnant explosives in 100 countries since 1993 — a $3.4 billion effort.\n\nad\n\nbut it's clear that civilians worldwide will be haunted by the threat under their feet for decades to come.\n\nin vietnam alone, leftover land mines and other explosives dropped by the united states have killed 40,000 people since the end of the war, and it may take 300 years for all remaining munitions to be cleared.\n\nin other words, the last vietnamese person to be killed by an unexploded u.s. munition probably hasn't even been born.
within hours, pelosi made good on that pledge, as democrats voted for legislation to reopen the government, shuttered for two weeks in a standoff with trump over his demands for funds for a u.s.-mexico border wall.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ntwo months ago, the american people spoke, and demanded a new dawn, she said during an address to the house soon after securing a 220-to-192 vote affirming her speakership. they called upon the beauty of our constitution: our system of checks and balances that protects our democracy.\n\nthe tensions with trump were ever-present. though pelosi (d-calif.) spoke of bipartisan cooperation with republicans, invoking the late gop presidents george h.w. bush and ronald reagan, she did not mention the current president by name.\n\ntrump, for his part, congratulated the speaker during a surprise appearance in the white house briefing room. but he used the event, an appearance with border security guards, as a chance to signal that he was digging in on his position on funding the wall — a stand that pelosi has repeatedly rejected.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nnow that speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) is leading the house for her third term, she faces a tricky political landscape and a big agenda. (jenny starrs/the washington post)\n\namid the impasse, pelosi and her fellow democrats have also signaled in recent weeks that they intend to move aggressively to use their newfound powers to investigate trump and his administration from multiple angles. she even suggested in a television interview that he was not immune to indictment.\n\ncongressional leaders, including pelosi, will meet with trump on friday — the 14th day of the shutdown, which some republicans signaled could last months.\n\non a day of pomp and ceremony, the realities of the spending crisis tempered — if only slightly — the jubilation of the freshman class at being sworn in as lawmakers after months of relentless campaigning and orientation.\n\nad\n\nit's an exciting time, but it's also a time in which — at least members of the freshman class i've spoken to — are eager to get to work, said rep. joseph neguse (d-colo.), the son of refugees from eritrea. no time better than the present to reopen the government and get back to the people's business.\n\nad\n\nsigns of change were on display throughout the day. holy books of the muslim, hindu and buddhist faiths sat alongside bibles set to be used by incoming members taking their ceremonial oaths of office. rep. jim langevin (d-r.i.), a quadriplegic who uses a wheelchair, presided over the first floor business of the new house session — including new rules that, among other things, allowed religious headwear on the house floor for the first time and officially banned discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\non thursday, 102 women took the oath of office in the house and 25 in the senate — nearly a quarter of the overall voting membership of congress. several states have sent african american women to the house for the first time, and texas, 40 percent latino, sent its first hispanic women. ten democrats openly identify as gay, lesbian or bisexual, a new high. in the senate, six states are now represented only by women, a first.\n\nad\n\npelosi's election was itself momentous — not only for the historic import of returning the speakership to the first woman ever to hold the post, but also for the feat of political resilience. not in 64 years has a former speaker regained a gavel, and never has a former speaker done it after eight years in the minority.\n\nad\n\nshe's like toscanini conducting a jazz band, said former congressman steve israel (d-n.y.), who returned to the capitol to greet old friends and savor the return to power. only she can pull it off.\n\npelosi's election followed a tense period after the nov. 6 midterms during which rebellious democrats pressed for her to step aside in favor of a younger leader. instead, she battled for weeks to pick off vote after vote, finally securing her victory in mid-december by agreeing to serve no more than four more years as speaker.\n\nad\n\nin the end, 15 democrats cast votes for an alternative or for no one at all, but pelosi won 220 votes — four more than necessary.\n\nrepublicans, meanwhile, made peace with their dismal new reality as the minority in a body where the majority reigns supreme. leadership offices have been downsized, lofty titles have evaporated, and raw power has given way to ineffective protests.\n\nad\n\nin their first act in the minority, house republicans moved to force a vote on tax cuts — which would have interrupted democrats' plans to hold votes on funding federal agencies, as well as coming bills on health care, ethics and other issues. democrats immediately voted to kill the proposal on a party-line vote.\n\nad\n\nyou don't get your way on anything, said rep. randy weber (r-tex.), who, like three-quarters of incumbent house republicans, has served only with robust gop majorities. we're going to deal with it like anything else — take your lumps as they come, work like hell getting your message out to the american people and getting back the majority.\n\nbesides the tax-cut gambit, republicans threw a few barbs across the aisle. rep. liz cheney (r-wyo.), one of only 13 women in house gop ranks, nominated rep. kevin mccarthy (r-calif.) by praising him as a leader who would stand against the fraud of socialism — a reference to the hard-left lawmakers who have pushed democratic leaders and threatened to oppose them if they resist.\n\nad\n\nwhen the breakout star of that group, rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.), cast her vote for pelosi, several republicans could be heard groaning. sorry, ocasio-cortez mouthed back at them with a smile.\n\nad\n\npelosi will face challenges in balancing the liberal wing and moderates from trump-won districts. she moved quickly to assuage the liberals' concerns with the creation of a special committee on climate change and hearings on a potential medicare-for-all health-care plan but still faced some grumbles this week.\n\nin the senate, meanwhile, republicans solidified a narrow majority while majority leader mitch mcconnell publicly disclaimed responsibility for breaking the spending impasse. hovering over it all was trump, who showed no sign of adapting to the new political environment.\n\nmcconnell (ky.) said he has stepped back in the spending talks because the solution to this is a deal between the president and nancy and chuck, because we need some of chuck's votes and obviously we need nancy's support, referring to pelosi and senate minority leader charles e. schumer (d-n.y.).\n\nad\n\nad\n\nciting trump's opposition, senate republican leaders do not plan to vote on the house democrats' spending bills, even though many republican senators personally support the legislation, which is based on bipartisan compromises reached in the senate.\n\nif we don't get over this, if this goes on for months and months — it could, hope not — then that might be a preview of coming attractions, said sen. richard c. shelby (r-ala.), chairman of the senate appropriations committee.\n\nmeanwhile, the most famous freshman senator, republican mitt romney of utah, rubbed some of his new colleagues the wrong way with an op-ed in the washington post this week arguing that the president had not risen to the mantle of the office.\n\ni think it was just a clumsy way to get started, you know, as a new senator. i disagree with the timing for sure, and a lot of the content, as well, said sen. mike braun (r-ind.), who campaigned closely with trump in the midterms, like a pair of other republican freshmen who unseated democrats.\n\nad\n\nas romney prepared to be sworn in, he brushed aside the blowback he has received the past two days.\n\ni'm not worried about what other people think about what i have to say, he said. i just want to hear what they have to say about their priorities and their perspectives.\n\nrepublicans will hold a 53-to-47 majority over the democratic caucus in the senate. republican rick scott, who is serving out his term as governor of florida, will join the chamber next week.\n\nas vice president pence swore in the new senate, the tension that has roiled the upper chamber of congress in recent weeks gave way to smiles, handshakes, hugs and applause.\n\nbut the reality of the shutdown and other battles to come quickly came back into view.\n\nafter opening the new session on a bipartisan note, declaring that the american people need democrats and republicans to work together, mcconnell quickly dismissed the house democratic plan to end the shutdown as political theater; not productive lawmaking.\n\nschumer, meanwhile, pointed squarely at the white house: only one person is to blame for this predicament: president trump. he called on mcconnell to bring up the house democratic bills, which would fund the department of homeland security at current levels through feb. 8 and ensure money for the rest of the government through the end of september in accordance with previous senate designs.\n\nwhat is the rationale for keeping eight cabinet departments shuttered for an unrelated dispute over the wall? schumer asked. there is none. we can continue to debate the best way to secure our border.
the president's strategy of publicly downplaying the threat that the virus poses to the united states was undermined monday as the dow jones industrial average — a measure he follows closely — shed more than 1,000 points for its largest drop in two years. investors acted on growing fears of a worldwide pandemic as the virus took hold in multiple countries, threatening to disrupt global commerce.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe stock market plunged on feb. 24, as coronavirus concerns continued to grow with new disease clusters reported outside china. (reuters)\n\ntrump, who spent monday visiting the taj mahal and other cultural sites, tried to project a sense of calm after the markets closed.\n\nthe coronavirus is very much under control in the usa, he wrote on twitter. we are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. cdc & world health have been working hard and very smart. stock market starting to look very good to me!\n\nminutes later, the president turned to retweeting posts about fbi surveillance, socialism and republican fundraising.\n\nfor a president who has governed by tweet and circus, a potential global health crisis that blunts economic growth could expose one of trump's main weaknesses as he prepares to face voters in november, said russell riley, a presidential historian at the university of virginia's miller center.\n\nad\n\nhaving hollowed out the senior leadership of so many departments of the government — especially in the scientific community — he is now in desperate need of professional guidance among people he has abused for three years, riley said. if the markets continue to drop and the medical news gets very bad, then this president is singularly ill-prepared to deal with it in a rational manner.\n\nad\n\nbehind the scenes, the trump administration rushed to expand its response to the coronavirus and rebound from missteps that had drawn the president's ire and raised questions about the government's readiness to address the outbreak.\n\nthe white house requested an emergency spending package from congress seeking $1.8 billion to combat the virus, part of a $2.5 billion total government response effort, according to a letter sent monday by the office of management and budget.\n\nad\n\nthis funding would support all aspects of the u.s. response, wrote acting omb director russell vought, mentioning costs for quarantining, vaccine development and preparedness, among others.\n\nbecause this funding arises from an unforeseen, unanticipated event and is necessary for the protection of human life, these supplemental resources should be designated as emergency funding.\n\nad\n\nnational security adviser robert c. o'brien has discussed possible options for global coalitions and outreach with other senior white house officials in recent days, according to a white house official and a veteran republican who have been briefed on the deliberations. one option includes having trump call for a u.n. security council meeting to force china to share more information about the outbreak, which began in december in wuhan and quickly spread from the world's most populous nation.\n\nad\n\nbut those conversations remain preliminary, and no decisions have been made about whether trump will ratchet up his pressure on china or global groups in the coming days, those two people said.\n\nwhen asked if o'brien and others are mulling a push at the u.n., a spokesman for the national security council said in a statement that the situation is dynamic and has the potential to change very quickly, and we are preparing mitigating strategies that could be necessary if the situation does change.\n\nad\n\nlongtime trump associates and observers said the president and his team are not panicked but are aware of the political cost of a sustained market drop.\n\nad\n\nif he gets a real correction, a 10 to 15 percent down draft in the market, it'd take one of the legs off of a very big part of his reelection campaign, said financier anthony scaramucci, the onetime white house communications director who has broken with trump.\n\nmajor republican donors are closely tracking developments and the political consequences not just of the coronavirus but the rise of sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) in the democratic presidential race. those two issues, veteran gop financier spencer zwick said, are now front and center for the party's leading donors.\n\nwe've always said the president has a better shot of being reelected in a good market, but there is talk of whether there could be a black swan event that changes things, zwick, a longtime organizer for former house speaker paul d. ryan and sen. mitt romney (r-utah).\n\nad\n\nad\n\ntrump's allies have followed the president's lead in downplaying talk of a major economic slump resulting from the outbreak.\n\ni don't think he's disturbed by ups and downs in the market, chris ruddy, a trump confidant and chief executive of newsmax media, said. the economy is so strong that even if it weakened a little bit, he'd still have a great record.\n\nstill, ruddy said that a months-long market downturn could be problematic for trump's reelection.\n\nwhite house trade adviser peter navarro insisted in an interview that the administration is working aggressively to coordinate the federal response, including speeding up efforts to find a vaccine for a virus that has spread to more than 25 countries.\n\nad\n\nwe're working in trump time, navarro said monday. that means you go as fast as possible — like seeking to cut vaccine development time in half.\n\nad\n\nnavarro, who appeared on fox business network on monday, was one of the trump allies who tried to calm the markets by arguing that the u.s. economy remains strong and that trump is in command.\n\nnational economic council director larry kudlow encouraged americans to buy more stocks, and trump's reelection campaign released a statement praising the stock market's ongoing bull run.\n\nthe stock market has continually broken records under president trump, boosting 401(k)s across the country, said campaign spokeswoman kayleigh mcenany.\n\nad\n\ntrump's campaign also defended the president's handling of the crisis, pointing to his early steps to block some travel from china.\n\nbut internal tensions have plagued the administration's response, which is being run by a task force with o'brien and health and human services secretary alex azar at the helm.\n\nad\n\ntrump and azar's department have clashed in recent days over hhs's handling of the repatriation of americans with the virus.\n\ntrump grew furious with senior advisers last week over a decision to allow 14 americans who tested positive for coronavirus to return to the united states from japan after being assured that infected patients would remain in quarantine overseas, according to administration officials.\n\nhe again became irate after learning over the weekend that federal officials planned to house some coronavirus patients in an alabama facility despite protests from local officials, said rep. mike d. rogers (r-ala.).\n\ntrump personally stepped in to block the plan, which alabama gov. kay ivey (r) said wasn't fully vetted.\n\nit was really poorly handled, rogers told reporters monday, adding that trump used colorful language to express his displeasure during a call from air force one. the president just told me in our third phone call yesterday, somebody's going to get fired over this. but i don't know who.\n\nad\n\nazar will be facing members of congress this week for hearings about the proposed hhs budget, starting tuesday. he likely will be pressed on the administration's handling of the coronavirus.\n\nwhile the white house is requesting $1.8 billion from congress, there is debate inside the administration about whether the request should be far larger, according to a senior administration official who requested anonymity to discuss internal plans.\n\nit's going to start around $1 billion and we'll go from there, but the numbers are fluid, the official said.\n\nby comparison, the obama administration requested $6 billion in emergency funding during the 2014 ebola crisis.\n\nthe coronavirus outbreak has infected more than 77,000 people, killing at least 2,600. countries including south korea, japan, italy and iran have seen their number of cases rise in recent days, in some cases dramatically.\n\nan additional 18 people in the united states have tested positive for the coronavirus, centers for disease control and prevention officials said monday, bringing the total number of confirmed u.s. cases to 53.\n\ndemocrats have slammed the trump administration's response, calling it haphazard and lax.\n\nthe trump administration has been asleep at the wheel, senate minority leader charles e. schumer (d-n.y.) said monday on the senate floor. president trump, good morning. there is a pandemic of coronavirus. where are you?
but roy didn't just do that; he also decided to make a point.\n\nad\n\njan. 3 is, per the constitution, the swearing-in day for members of congress. and members of congress can't only object to accepting a given state's electoral slate, but they can also object to the seating of fellow members. so if the presidential race was suspect, roy reasoned logically, why not the elections of his fellow members of congress from those same states?\n\nad\n\nso he pushed for a vote. all but two republicans voted to seat the members, bypassing any concerns about the validity of their elections.\n\nthis was a stunt, to be clear but an instructive one.\n\ntrump's allies in congress will mount a final challenge to biden's win during a joint session on jan. 6. but history shows it's destined to fail. (the washington post)\n\none of the most important aspects of the gop attempt to challenge the 2020 election results is that the republicans have virtually no actual evidence behind them. courts have rejected the trump team's claims basically without fail. had courts found some reason for a certain number of votes to at least be suspect, it would have lent credence to such an effort. but that hasn't happened. even most of the big-name republicans objecting say this isn't about proven fraud but rather the overwhelming suspicion of fraud by the gop base. their argument: how can you elect a president with such a thing unsettled? you can't, but apparently you can seat members of congress who ran on the same supposedly suspect ballots.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nnone of the republicans elected to congress in the six states at issue won by as tight a margin as joe biden did. republicans who support objecting to the electors in those states could argue that those races weren't close enough to be in doubt.\n\nthey might also argue that the alleged fraud was focused on urban areas, where the gop isn't competitive. they could say that — but biden actually performed worse in urban areas relative to hillary clinton than he did in the suburbs, which would suggest that the urban areas weren't determinative.\n\nbut if you're gong to suggest widespread fraud that hasn't been substantiated, how can you rule anything out? if there was fraud in detroit but it hasn't been found, why can't there have been fraud in the detroit suburbs or in grand rapids that also had evaded michigan's or judges' notice? if there was fraud in atlanta that likewise hasn't been rooted out, how can you rule out such a thing happening in its suburbs or elsewhere in the state?\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe thing is, despite the gop's congressional wins in these states not being as close as the presidential race, there were close races — races close enough that they fall within the number of votes that trump has suggested might be fraudulent.\n\nat a rally last month in georgia, trump cited claims from former kansas attorney general phill kline (r) that there were, in trump's retelling, over 300,000 fraudulent ballots in arizona, 548,000 in michigan, 204,000 in georgia, and 121,000 in pennsylvania. the claims are dubious at best, but let's take them at face value for the moment.\n\nthere are 14 congressional districts in michigan, meaning that if you assumed an equal number of fraudulent ballots in each of them, that's about 39,000 in each race, give or take. newly elected gop congressman peter meijer won the 3rd district by fewer than 24,000 votes. even if you grant that the alleged fraud was more focused on urban areas — again, charitably, based on the urban-suburban shifts between 2016 and 2020 — that still leads to an open question about whether there could be enough fraudulent ballots in the grand rapids-based district to matter. but gop members apparently have no reason to examine that.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe situation is similar in arizona. there are nine congressional districts in arizona, so trump's claim would mean an average of more than 30,000 fraudulent votes per district. the margin of victory for gop house incumbent david schweikert? just more than 18,000 votes. again, republican members of congress apparently had no reason to question whether fraud might have changed that result.\n\nit all recalls trump's bizarre claims after the 2016 election. despite winning the electoral college and the presidency, he repeatedly tried to explain away his popular-vote loss by claiming that it was because of widespread voter fraud. but the fraud, according to him, somehow happened only in states that clinton had won. what's more, he said literally every one of millions of supposedly fraudulent votes was for her.\n\nthe thing about fraud, though, is that if it's substantiated enough to halt a presidential election, despite the lack of specificity when it comes to where it happened or how large it was, you probably need to make sure it hasn't gone undetected in other places. if michigan has enough fraud to overturn a biden margin of more than 150,000 votes, why not be curious about a congressional race decided by 24,000 votes?\n\nad\n\nad\n\nrepublicans seem to have subscribed to the trumpian belief that fraud benefits only democrats, but how can you say that when no fraud has actually been substantiated? similarly, when no fraud has been proved, how can you draw the line on the amount of fraud being sufficient enough to change the outcome of a presidential election but not a congressional race?
roth then noted one other thing she liked about the neighborhood.\n\ni got to vote for alexandria ocasio-cortez, she said.\n\nare you in her district? a friend asked. that's really cool.\n\na cautious hope is reemerging in this slice of america, and it has come from the most american of traditions: voting. residents clamoring for change in the 14th congressional district last year ousted a 56-year-old white democrat, one of the most powerful men in washington, and replaced him with a 29-year-old latina socialist working as a bartender.\n\nbut they didn't stop there. they voted a formerly undocumented immigrant to the state assembly, and they replaced another long-standing politician in the state senate. the political old guard had been toppled. in its stead were three leftist latinas with no prior experience in government, who echoed their neighborhood's desire for a radical shift in politics.\n\nthough none have much power in the traditional sense, their victories made many residents feel like their lives were newly injected into the american consciousness, along with the rural voters and white conservatives who rejoiced that donald trump's ascent had done the same for them.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nroth's incoming congresswoman was now sitting with stephen colbert and spreading the gospel of the urban working class to audiences across the country. roth said she liked her liberal lifestyle and felt a little bit like it was expanding. if it wasn't expanding, at least the outer shell was thickening enough to shield the other america.\n\nthey say we are living in a bubble, but i like my bubble, said roth, a 30-year-old graphic artist who grew up outside detroit. there are two different realities going on in america, and a part of the country is living in a way that's unfathomable to me.\n\nalejandro osorio, the 39-year-old owner of arepa lady, encountered that other america only through the filter of social media clips his friends posted from fox news and other conservative sites. pundits called ocasio-cortez a hypocrite when the avowed socialist wore expensive clothes, derided her after she flubbed distinguishing the three branches of government, mocked her meager savings account and, last month, questioned her fortitude after she said she needed a week-long break for self-care.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nfor osorio, the idea of feeling misunderstood extended to his outgoing congressman, joseph crowley. osorio had always heard crowley was a power player in washington, but he had no idea what that meant or why that might have been relevant to his life.\n\nin his world, life just kept going on — no matter who the president was or how beloved crowley was in the nation's capital. in jackson heights, osorio said, residents simply dealt with whatever decisions came down from washington. ocasio-cortez's victory gave him hope that his version of america could become part of the national conversation.\n\nback when osorio moved here in the late 1980s, his family was like most families — new to the country, not fluent with the language. since then, those families have learned english and gained citizenship and sent their children to schools where they learned the importance of civic engagement.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthat new generation no longer wanted to feel like they were on the sidelines of american politics — they wanted to believe that they, too, had an ability to shake things up.\n\nthey say looking at your phone is a bad thing, but i'm learning a lot from what the young people in the neighborhood are talking about, osorio said. that's how i learned ocasio-cortez. that's how i learned about intersectional feminism.\n\nocasio-cortez, who defeated republican anthony pappas in november's general election, spoke about the minimum wage and assuring health care and the difficulties of working strange hours for service jobs — which all made sense to osorio. she sounded like she was from the real new york, not the one you see on tv where it's just white people, osorio said. she created a buzz around here, just because it felt like she knew our story.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ngus santana, a 31-year-old son of immigrants from the dominican republic, didn't imagine his concerns as a latino working-class person were much different from a white working-class person: he was concerned about going broke if he got sick, feeling safe in his neighborhood, his parents not losing their social security checks.\n\nyet he never felt that his experience, or those around him, were the image of the working, everyday american. ocasio-cortez could change that thinking, he hoped.\n\nthe best thing she'll be able to teach people is that the voice of the inner city matters, santana said.\n\nsantana recently graduated from a local college and was working at a relative's appliance store while he waited to hear back from the human resource companies where he wanted to work.\n\nad\n\nmy parents already made their american dream come true — coming here, having a family and being able to provide for them, santana said. i guess my american dream is different because i grew up here. when you grow up in this country, you are told to have the picket fence and the front yard and a backyard.\n\nad\n\nstill, the polarization in this country had lessened his desire to achieve the american dream that he had once learned about.\n\noutside his bubble, santana wondered why so many around him were gripped by fear. why be fearful of losing a way of life, he wondered. most around him were foreign-born and had already lost their way of life. why be fearful about having to leave a job and learning a new skill? many of his friends' parents were professionals in other countries and opted to slug it out in america instead.\n\nad\n\nsantana hoped ocasio-cortez, her voice and her popularity, might usher in a broader thinking about the american ideal. he didn't want to have to leave city life to feel like he was in a prized part of the country.\n\nit does suck, though, that you would have go out of new york to get that kind of american dream, he said. like you have to move to north carolina or something. i know that's what i'm supposed to want, but living in a place like that seems kind of corny to me. bland.\n\nad\n\nthe heart of the neighborhood's multicultural ethos is diversity plaza, an outdoor festival space braced by a host of mostly south asian restaurants and shops. one recent weekend on the lower level of a pakistani restaurant there, a majority-white group of residents gathered in a computer repair shop. they met to figure out what they could do to thwart what they felt was the most immediate threat to pierce their bubble: the crackdown on illegal immigration.\n\nad\n\nwe're happy to host you, agha saleh, the owner of the computer repair shop, told members of the jackson heights immigrant solidarity network.\n\nthe group talked about handing out fliers to discuss some of the recent tactics immigration officials were using to identify undocumented migrants in the neighborhood. they figured they would need to print fact sheets in spanish, bangla, urdu, nepalese, punjuabi and more.\n\nad\n\nwe've got our own issues, people are worried about the gentrification and all that; but everything crystallizes the immigration issue, said david stock, 67.\n\nthen, they discussed attending an immigration forum in the new year, and a member of the group started to run down the list of guests. they included jessica ramos, their new state senator. and catalina cruz, the formerly undocumented immigrant whom they elected to the state assembly.\n\nad\n\nand alexandria ocasio-cortez, if she can make it, she said.\n\nthe group smiled and nodded. crowley had pushed legislation mandating that immigrations and customs officers file a report every time they stop someone, rather than every time they make an arrest. ocasio-cortez's push to abolish the immigration and customs enforcement agency altogether seemed more resonant and radical.\n\nad\n\nshe just gives us a little more hope, stock said after the meeting.\n\nnot too much hope because after the 2016 election, i'm not sure i understand the country anymore, said one woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she didn't want to endanger her husband's green card renewal. you never know with politics.\n\nat least she'll fight, another participant said.\n\nsaleh walked outside his restaurant to puff a cigarette. around him were a man with a cart working 12-hour shifts selling shish kebabs and families headed to buy saris from stores in little india. he looked up at the high-rise under construction, casting a new shadow over his restaurant. change, he said, is definitely coming here, as the train continued to rumble. their hope was that ocasio-cortez would help lead it.
woodson's books, including the novel in verse brown girl dreaming, have won top literary prizes, and her goal for her term as ambassador is even more impressive.\n\ni think it would be so great that by the end of the two-year term if people along all lines of economic class really knew the value of libraries and books in their lives, she told kidspost.\n\nworking toward that goal will involve lots of conversations with kids across the country. she hopes to spark those conversations with her platform, reading = hope x change (what's your equation?).\n\nyou go into a book looking for some hope in there, woodson said from her home in brooklyn, new york. it's something that happens to most readers.\n\nreading can encourage kids' hopefulness and their interest in changing the world, she said.\n\nwoodson also would like to steer people away from using labels such as struggling reader or advanced reader. the labels aren't helpful, she said, because they assume there is a normal.\n\nbeing labeled a struggling reader is an issue that woodson, 54, experienced firsthand as a child and included in brown girl dreaming.\n\nher own children, a 9-year-old son and a 15-year-old daughter, started reading at different ages and are very different readers, she said. but woodson said she and her partner have always made books a part of their lives.\n\nwe've always read to both of them. we've always listened to [audiobooks], she said.\n\nand when she and her kids were unsure what to read next, woodson has turned to others in the children's literature community. she said she would like people of all ages to have help from a similar village of readers.
flanked by members of his cabinet and labor leaders, as well as construction industry representatives in hard hats, trump told reporters at the white house that his proposal will allow highways to be built in a small fraction of the time.\n\nwe will not stop until our nation's gleaming new infrastructure has made america the envy of the world again, trump said. it used to be the envy of the world, and now we're like a third-world country. it's really sad.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ninterior secretary david bernhardt said the president was making the most significant regulatory rollback of his term. let me tell you, this is a really, really big proposal, bernhardt said, turning to trump. the proposal affects virtually every significant decision by the federal government that affects the environment.\n\nthe proposed rules would narrow the scope of the national environmental policy act (nepa), which requires federal agencies to assess the impact of a major project before a spade of dirt is turned and to include the public in the process.\n\nthe changes would mean that communities would have less control over some projects built in their neighborhoods. environmental groups, tribal activists and others have used the law to delay or block a slew of infrastructure, mining, logging and drilling projects since it was signed by president richard nixon in 1970.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nscientists say that as global warming nears an irreversible level, the president has been promoting business growth, not climate fixes. (jenny starrs/the washington post)\n\nthe white house proposal will almost certainly face legal challenges.\n\nnotre dame law school professor bruce huber said in an email that because the regulations do not alter the underlying law, agencies are still required to report the environmental impacts of actions they take that significantly affect the quality of the human environment.\n\ntoday's proposal will involve changes to the way the law is implemented, and it will be up to the federal courts to decide whether those changes are faithful to the law, huber said.\n\nthe proposed changes would redefine what constitutes a major federal action to exclude privately financed projects that have minimal government funding or involvement.\n\nad\n\nthat interpretation of the law could make it much easier to build some pipelines, which have become controversial as activists have sought to block projects that extract, transport or burn fossil fuels linked to climate change.\n\nad\n\nfederal environmental reviews of the keystone xl and dakota access pipelines dragged on for years during the obama administration, but trump has pushed to accelerate their construction since taking office.\n\nother aspects of the proposal would set deadlines and page limits for environmental reviews so that, with rare exceptions, agencies would have to finish their most exhaustive reviews within two years. currently, environmental impact statements for major projects can take three times that long to complete and can span hundreds of pages.\n\nad\n\nthe proposal states that groups that fail to weigh in during the public comment period would forfeit any right to raise objections later in litigation.\n\nit would also limit the analysis of a project's full climate impact. effects should not be considered significant if they are remote in time, geographically remote, or the product of a lengthy causal chain, the proposal says.\n\nad\n\nunder that reasoning, according to experts, policymakers vetting a proposed coal mine or oil drilling operation would not have to consider whether burning those fossil fuels later on will contribute to climate change. federal judges have ruled multiple times that the government needs to account for both the construction of those operations and the emissions that later result.\n\nad\n\nbernhardt told reporters thursday that the changes would maintain the core aims of nepa, while ending unnecessary delays for a broad range of infrastructure projects.\n\nthe consequences of the government being stuck in place are far-ranging, bernhardt said, citing the drawn-out process for approving new schools on native american reservations, upgrading visitor centers at national parks and giving ranchers approval for grazing on public lands. the list goes on and on and on. the reality is that the needless red tape has, over time, lowered the expectations of american exceptionalism and excellence. and that is backwards.\n\nad\n\njay timmons, president and chief executive of the national association of manufacturers, said his group had called for exactly the changes proposed by the white house because his members' efforts should be used for building the infrastructure americans desperately need, not wasted on mountains of paperwork and endless delays.\n\ndrew caputo, vice president of litigation for lands, wildlife and oceans for the environmental firm earthjustice, said in an interview that the administration's changes could be legally vulnerable because they would remove so many projects from federal review.\n\nad\n\nthe whole idea of the law is to give better information in advance to decision-makers and the public. it appears that these changes are an effort to undermine both of those purposes of the statute, caputo said. it would basically make the federal government become an ostrich, sticking its head in the ground rather than thinking about the environmental impact of its actions.\n\nad\n\nalthough the 1970 law is not well known outside certain legal and policy circles, nepa compels agencies to analyze thousands of projects across the country each year. these can range from a mining company applying for a permit to drain a wetland to an energy company seeking federal approval to conduct seismic testing offshore or to lay down ice roads to hunt for oil.\n\naccording to the white house, each year agencies weighing projects prepare approximately 170 environmental impact statements — detailed documents that can run as long as 600 pages each — and 10,000 environmental assessments, which are less extensive.\n\nad\n\ntrump has repeatedly railed against federal judges who have delayed projects on the grounds that officials have not conducted a thorough enough review under nepa.\n\ni think it's a disgrace, he said after a federal judge blocked the keystone xl pipeline in the fall of 2018, faulting the federal government for failing to complete a thorough environmental analysis as required by law. i approved it; it's ready to start.\n\nad\n\non thursday, a coalition of business and labor groups launched a new lobbying effort aimed at backing the proposed overhaul.\n\nwe're fully supportive and we look forward to the opportunities to have thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of people go to work in the construction industry once these reforms are fully in place, said sean mcgarvey, president of the north america's building trades unions.\n\nad\n\nbut hilton kelley, an activist in port arthur, tex., who has spent decades combating pollution from the petrochemical industry in his community, said weakening the law would have serious real-world consequences.\n\nthe trump administration is doing a serious injustice to people living in industrial communities, kelley said in an interview of the effort to scale back the bedrock environmental policy. it's a matter of life and death.\n\nkelley said the law has long given residents near industrial facilities, pipelines and other projects the right to have a say in what is built near their homes. he said he fears the changes will take away that important tool and tip the scales in favor of corporations.
there's something quintessentially american — yet also distinctly unsavory — about the origin story of mcdonald's. as told in the new docudrama the founder, it's largely the story of ray kroc (michael keaton), a traveling milkshake-machine salesman who, in 1954, chanced upon a small san bernardino, calif., hamburger stand run by dick and mac mcdonald (nick offerman and john carroll lynch). kroc partnered with the brothers, becoming head of franchise operations, but soon grew impatient with their reluctance to embrace what dick mcdonald calls kroc's crass commercialism. ultimately, the founder also is a story of betrayal, as kroc cuts the mcdonalds out of the business entirely, eventually buying their name and forcing the original store to close on his path to leading what would become a global empire.\n\ndirector john lee hancock (the blind side, saving mr. banks) phoned from pasadena to talk about the film and its love/hate relationship with its antihero.\n\n\n\nmichael keaton plays ray kroc in the founder, a docudrama about the origins of mcdonald's. (daniel mcfadden/the weinstein company)\n\nq: considering the founder's unflattering look at mcdonald's, were you concerned about obtaining legal permission to use the company's intellectual property?\n\na: that was my first question when i walked in the room to interview for the directing job.\n\nq: as i understand it, the principle of fair use would apply to a historical film. is that why no approval was sought from the company?\n\njohn carroll lynch and nick offerman star as the mcdonald brothers. (daniel mcfadden/the weinstein company)\n\na: we thought we were on good legal footing. this is not a contemporary mcdonald's takedown. it's not super size me [morgan spurlock's 2004 documentary about the effects of an all-mcdonald's diet]. on the one hand, i can see how some people might watch the movie and think, i have a different feeling about mcdonald's now, and it's not good. i can also see how some would go, wow, i only saw mcdonald's as this international behemoth, and there are faces behind it now. two of those faces — the mcdonald brothers — are kind of endearing.\n\nq: the website of lisa napoli's 2016 biography of ray kroc and his second wife, joan, takes issue with the film's accuracy, including the scene in which kroc delivers a blank buyout check to the brothers at mac mcdonald's bedside, after he's been hospitalized from stress. nitpicking aside, is the film broadly accurate?\n\na: i think it is. kroc wanted to buy them out and said, come up with a price. the way to dramatize that is: hand them a blank check. as opposed to having a phone call or lawyers talking, which would put everybody to sleep.\n\nq: even some people who know kroc's story may be surprised by details in the film, such as the revelation that he was briefly a professional piano player.\n\na: michael's line was an ad-lib, when he says, i used to sell pianos, and then gets up and plays. it's not a documentary. we don't have any proof that ray sat down with joan [linda cardellini] and played a duet of pennies from heaven. we do know that he met her when she was playing piano at rollie's steakhouse.\n\nq: there are stories about kroc being something of a neat freak, and you show him cleaning his garage to relax. just as he rushes off camera to the garage, the film cuts to a shot of his suit, neatly folded on the bed. what does that suit represent?\n\na: in that particular scene, he was coming in from work, and his first wife [laura dern] was almost ready to go to the club for dinner. she's laid his suit out. i just liked the idea of there being an empty suit there. does that mean he's dying inside? in terms of him being fastidious, we do have the scene with him at night, sweeping like a maniac. there are all these stories about him going through the mcdonald's parking lot at night and picking up gum. it's something that michael and i talked about a lot. do we define his journey — his forward lean — from a behavioral standpoint, from a dialogue-and-delivery standpoint or from a clothing standpoint, as his clothes change? he just becomes more sharklike as the story progresses.\n\nlinda cardellini portrays joan kroc, ray's second wife. (daniel mcfadden/the weinstein company)\n\nq: can you talk about the similarities between this film and saving mr. banks, another true story revolving around an ambitious genius, in that case walt disney?\n\na: i am aware of the similarities. i think the difference is that banks is really about [mary poppins author] p.l. travers. at the start of this movie, kroc is very accessible, if you will. you understand his pain and what he wants. and he is — to me at least — very likable in the first third to half of this movie. in the first third to half of banks, p.l. travers is really not relatable. she is standoffish. she is tough on characters that are doing nothing but trying to please her. and then, little by little, we start to understand the source of her pain. they're flipped journeys, in a way. but i enjoy the parallels in the way both movies are trying to understand people.\n\n\n\njohn carroll lynch and nick offerman play brothers mac and dick mcdonald, whose eponymous california burger stand became the seed of a global fast-food empire. (daniel mcfadden/the weinstein company)\n\nq: what has the reaction to the film been?\n\na: everyone brings their own attitudes to a movie. the way this movie has affected people has been really gratifying to me, like hearing two people argue about it, and one person is saying: hey, you know what? those brothers would have driven me nuts. you can't make an omelet without cracking a few eggs, and ray had to do what he had to do. i get where kroc's coming from. somebody else might be saying: ray's a monster. what are you talking about? i love that. the two most boring versions of this movie would have been (1) a horatio alger story: kroc picks himself up from the bottom to become a global king, and (2) some kind of corporate takedown of kroc and mcdonald's, showing him for the villain that he is. the fact that he's neither good nor bad makes him human.\n\nq: so he's both visionary and villain?\n\na: absolutely. i admire the fact that he took his employees with him. his bookkeeper, june martino, became second-in-command of mcdonald's. fred turner, who became head of mcdonald's, was flipping burgers at one of his restaurants. at the same time, some of the more incendiary quotes come directly from kroc's mouth: if any of my competitors were drowning, i'd stick a hose in their mouth and turn on the water. that's kroc's line.\n\nq: you've spoken in interviews of the film's unintended trumpian overtones. will that help or hurt the movie?\n\na: it's a really good question. i wish i could answer. when we made the movie, it wasn't in the dna of anything we were doing, but the parallels are pretty obvious. it's been said that when you make a period movie, it's always more about the period in which it is made than the period it depicts. watching it the other day for the first time in several months, during the whole montage of kroc taking his hiring pitch to the streets — whether it's the vfw or the shriners or the synagogue — and hitting the hard-working americans out there who want to better themselves, it struck me as a populist message. michael and i talked about that. he said, wow, he's not giving them any details, is he? i said: that's not important. he's trying to talk about things they can easily grasp: opportunity, hard work, the american dream, gold at the end of the arches. it hit me that that's the current state of politics, unfortunately.\n\nq: would you say that kroc was just as much a preacher as a businessman?\n\na: absolutely. you could say the movie is about worshiping money. i'm nobody's socialist, don't get me wrong. it's not intended to be money, bad. profit, bad. not at all.\n\nq: it's an ambivalent little film. will you have people coming out craving a big mac or wanting to organize a boycott?\n\na: both things have happened. one of my favorite hollywood moments was at a screening and q&a hosted by filmmaker william friedkin, whom i don't know. but he loved the movie, saying it's michael's best role. some in the audience were saying, i will never go to mcdonald's again. friedken thought that was funny, not because he loved kroc, but because he saw the middle.\n\nq: you said that the founder is not super size me. but don't the two films bookend the mcdonald's story nicely?\n\na: i could buy into that double feature.\n\nq: perhaps they both have something to say about addiction?\n\na: i think you're right. what happened to america, post-world war ii, was: we won the war. . . . we deserve it. we want it, and we want it now. in effect, it was the original idea of super size. america was bursting its buttons. there's very much a super size me thing going on with regard to business now.\n\nthe founder (pg-13, 115 minutes). at area theaters.
but the broader picture could yet be quite grim. this past week marked the formal start of a new decade. to kick it off, today's worldview spotlights three trendlines that could define the years to come.\n\nchanging demographics\n\naccording to a 2015 u.n. study, the world is expected to have a population of about 8.5 billion people in 2030 — about a 15 percent increase in the size of humanity in just 15 years. india will have surpassed china to become the world's most populous nation, while demographers forecast a pronounced population surge in sub-saharan africa, which will soon be home to the world's most youthful societies. the number of megacities may double by the end of the decade, with close to two-thirds of humanity living in urban centers.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin addition, by 2030, more than a billion people on the planet will be over the age of 65, according to a study funded by the national institutes of health. that's due to longer life expectancies and improving living standards around the world. but the maturing of the world population — not just in the west, but throughout asia and latin america, too — carries real policy conundrums.\n\neuropean governments are already grappling with a future shaped by rising costs for elder care, the consequences of declining populations and a shrinking workforce. the political solutions to these long-term challenges may include encouraging more immigration to fill jobs and weakening social protections to drive worker productivity. demographic anxieties will almost certainly take up greater space in western politics: on both sides of the atlantic, far-right movements increasingly see anti-feminism as a rallying cry at a time of declining birthrates.\n\nchina's authoritarian leadership is all too aware of the need to pivot given its aging population and has set about trying to reorient the chinese economy to cater more to a domestic market after years of export-driven boom. in a decade's time, we may also know whether india's youth glut — more than half of its population is under 25 — has turned into either a demographic boon or a curse. the world's largest democracy is already struggling to support its vast population of young people with adequate education, health care and jobs.\n\nthe deepening toll of climate change\n\n2030 represents a major milestone for the international organizations and climate scientists that have been climate change's doleful town criers. two years ago, the u.n. intergovernmental panel on climate change warned that without huge, unprecedented cuts to carbon emissions over the next decade, the world would place itself on the brink of climate disaster. subsequent studies suggested that, even if the demands of climate activists were met, it would take decades to measure any discernible effects.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthere are reasons for hope. myriad governments have embraced ambitious plans to transition their economies toward being carbon neutral. the incoming biden administration intends to add momentum to global climate efforts abandoned by president trump, while chinese president xi jinping said last month that china plans to decrease its carbon footprint to at least 65 percent of where it was in 2005 by 2030. the world economic forum — a bastion of optimism — foresees a future in 2030 in which urban centers are transformed into zones shaped by pedestrian activity, technology increasingly obviates the need to own cars, fewer people eat meat, people breathe cleaner air and renewable, clean energy dominates the energy sector.\n\nthat's the rosy view. the demands of a rising middle class in the developing world may prove a challenge to decarbonization efforts, while climate skepticism may further drive a host of right-wing movements in the west as their opponents go green. rather than a warning to the world, melting ice caps in the arctic are already opening new trade lanes and avenues for exploration, stoking a new era of geopolitical competition. all the while, scientists predict an increasing number of extreme weather events wracking the world and destabilizing vulnerable communities.\n\nthe mess of global governance\n\nthe past decade shifted our view of global politics. long gone is any certainty in the inexorability of liberal democracy — single-party states still flourish, while demagogic populism and far-right nationalism are powerful forces within many of the world's major democracies. rights groups warn of the erosion of once-healthy democracies and new threats to freedom and privacy posed by government cyber surveillance.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nvisions of a robust liberal world order have given way to white papers on the return of great-power competition. that includes the new race over research and the use of technologies such as artificial intelligence, which is predicted to add some $16 trillion to the global economy by 2030. china has poured vast resources into its tech sector and is arguably the global pacesetter in the development and implementation of ai technologies, an advantage that has huge political implications. whoever leads in artificial intelligence in 2030 will rule the world till 2100, declared a recent policy briefing from the brookings institution.\n\nliberals in the west hope the serious challenges of the next decade — all of which require expanded international cooperation and coordination — will eventually dispel the angry nationalism of the present.
tafti has launched a democratic primary campaign to unseat arlington county commonwealth's attorney theo stamos, a prosecutor for the past 30 years.\n\nthe clash is part of a national criminal justice reform movement that has come to northern virginia and could radically reshape law and order in arlington, fairfax and loudoun. in all three counties, liberal challengers are taking on prosecutors whose views they see as retrograde and excessively punitive.\n\nad\n\ni think there's a lot of frustration with the lack of progress on criminal justice reform both in the country and in the commonwealth, said state sen. scott a. surovell (d-fairfax). a lot of people in the reform community think prosecutors should exercise their discretion in cases more.\n\nad\n\nunlike the incumbents, the challengers are promising to stop prosecuting simple marijuana possession, to refuse to request cash bond for defendants awaiting trial and to not seek the death penalty.\n\nthe american criminal justice system is now a mass incarceration machine set on auto-pilot, tafti said in a statement announcing her run. as a public defender, i know all too well how this machine dismantles communities, destroys families, uses bad science, and wastes money.\n\nad\n\nshe pointed to statistics showing black people make up less than 10 percent of arlington's population but two-thirds of its jail inmates.\n\nin neighboring fairfax county, incumbent top prosecutor raymond f. morrogh (d), who ran unopposed in the past two elections, faces a challenge from a former federal prosecutor and army helicopter pilot. steve descano calls his run a values campaign.\n\nad\n\nthe most important thing is we have to bring fairfax county values to office, descano said. i don't think we have that in fairfax county right now.\n\nlike tafti, he criticized his opponent for signing on to a 2016 brief that denounced the move by then-gov. terry mcauliffe (d) to restore voting rights to more than 200,000 felons as too broad. both challengers want to expand alternatives to prosecution for drug addicts, the mentally ill and teens.\n\nad\n\nmorrogh and stamos say they are reformers — within a complex system where victims also have rights.\n\nit's interesting that she describes herself as an 'innocence protection attorney,' as that is what i've been engaged in for more than thirty years, stamos said of tafti in a statement.\n\nwhile stamos recently announced that she will no longer seek cash bail for most minor misdemeanors, she argued that it is an important tool to ensure people show up for court in more-serious cases. on that and other issues, she argued that state law prevents the kind of dramatic change tafti and other challengers seek.\n\nad\n\nif she wants to decriminalize marijuana, she should go to richmond, stamos said in an interview. unless and until these laws on the books are repealed, i don't think it's the appropriate exercise of prosecutorial discretion to usurp the will of the legislature.\n\nad\n\nmorrogh, who has also been a prosecutor for over 30 years, said he was progressive before progressive was cool. he noted that he worked to help establish a veterans court, drug court and mental-health court in fairfax county, as well as efforts to divert the mentally ill charged with crimes into treatment instead of jail.\n\nhe said he heavily uses a program that places defendants in pretrial supervision rather than asking for bond. but he also said those concerns should be balanced with victims' rights.\n\ni have a vast amount of experience trying the most complicated criminal cases, morrogh said.\n\nad\n\nthe race for commonwealth's attorney in loudoun county will pit incumbent republican jim plowman against a democratic challenger in november. buta biberaj is the only democrat to have entered the race.\n\nad\n\nplowman, who is in his fourth term, swept into office in 2003 promising a traditional tough-on-crime approach. he said crime in loudoun county has dropped each of the past five years, making it one of the safest communities in the area.\n\nduring my tenure we've continued to hold violent and repeat offenders accountable, seeking fair and just resolutions for victims and the community, plowman wrote in an email.\n\nbiberaj, a 25-year trial lawyer and former substitute judge, said on her campaign website that she would take the office in a different direction, focusing on bond reform and pushing treatment for the addicted and mentally ill instead of jail. she did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nlawyers and political watchers are also waiting to hear whether prince william county commonwealth's attorney paul b. ebert (d) runs again. ebert, who has held office for 50 years and has sent more people to death row than any prosecutor in virginia's history, would be seeking his 14th term.\n\nebert is an institution in prince william but has faced criticism in recent years after a federal judge overturned one of his high-profile capital convictions and death-penalty sentences, saying his office had withheld key evidence from the defense.\n\nebert is expected to face a challenger if he runs. he did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nrick conway, ebert's chief deputy, said his boss and other incumbents are open to discussion concerning criminal justice reform and have advocated for some changes. but when you're talking about your head prosecutor of your jurisdiction, he said, you want somebody who believes in law and order and understands that we don't make the laws — we're charged with enforcing them.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nit is too early to say whether the challengers will be competitive, but they may take heart from the surprise november victory of democrat scott miles who beat chesterfield's chief deputy commonwealth's attorney. republican john childrey had been endorsed by the longtime republican incumbent, who retired over the summer.\n\nacross the country, groups associated with george soros, the liberal philanthropist, and members of the black lives matter movement have spent millions in dozens of local races, helping elect progressive prosecutors in philadelphia, chicago, st. louis and other cities.\n\ntafti and descano said they had not received similar funding to date.\n\nad\n\nan earlier version of the story incorrectly identified the position of the republican opponent in the november race for chesterfield county commonwealth's attorney. john childrey was the chief deputy commonwealth's attorney.
1. what changes were taking effect from jan. 1?\n\nthe end of the brexit transition period, which followed the u.k.'s formal departure from the eu on jan. 31, 2020, will affect tourists, business travelers, academics and students. while many of the new rules and guidelines are clear, others are less so and may be subject to change:\n\nad\n\n• u.k. citizens no longer have an automatic right to live in the eu, and eu citizens will face similar restrictions in britain.\n\n• new requirements will affect britons driving in the eu, studying under certain programs or taking their pets into the bloc.\n\nad\n\n• tougher immigration rules mean u.k. citizens wanting to work in the eu, and vice versa, will have to complete more paperwork and will need to make sure their professional qualifications are recognized. eu citizens seeking to move to the u.k. will be treated on the same basis as applicants from outside the eu.\n\n• eu citizens who already hold permanent residency in the u.k. and want to remain after june 30, 2021, will need to apply either for the eu settlement scheme or for british citizenship, unless they already have indefinite leave to enter or remain in the u.k.\n\nad\n\n2. how will travel change?\n\ncovid-19 restrictions have made cross-border travel difficult and sometimes impractical for the time being. once they are no longer necessary, short leisure trips and vacations should be relatively simple, with no tourist visas needed, but longer stays could require paperwork and in some cases may not be possible. u.k. citizens will need a visa if they want to visit the eu for more than 90 days in any 180-day period. they may need a permit for business travel, depending on the rules of the particular country. eu nationals visiting the u.k. will be allowed to visit for up to six months without applying for a visa, for the purposes of tourism, visiting family and friends, short-term study and business activities such as events and conferences. fast-track immigration lanes for eu citizens in europe may no longer be available to u.k. travelers. in the u.k., technology could help. london's heathrow and gatwick airports are among more than a dozen u.k. air and rail terminals that operate speedy electronic passport gates for both u.k. and eu nationals.\n\nad\n\n3. what about insurance and healthcare?\n\nad\n\npeople who have grown used to easy travel within europe will have to plan ahead to make sure they stay on the right side of the regulations, although some existing rights will be preserved:\n\n• where the u.k. or an eu member state is responsible for the healthcare of an individual, they will be entitled to reciprocal healthcare cover, according to a summary of the u.k.-eu trade and cooperation agreement published on the u.k. government website. this includes certain categories of cross-border workers and state pensioners who retire to the u.k. or to the eu, as well as people temporarily staying in another country, for example on vacation.\n\n• british drivers will need to carry a green card proof-of-insurance certificate for most of europe, and while the u.k. government website said in december they may need extra documents and the rules may change, it also indicated they probably won't need an international driving permit for most countries unless they still have an old-style paper license. eu motorists can drive in the u.k. on their licenses but will also need proof of insurance.\n\nad\n\nad\n\n• britons will lose their right to pay the same for mobile calls, texts and data in the eu as at home. most u.k. phone companies have no plans to charge differently for now, but if they do, customers will receive alerts for data usage and won't be billed for more than 45 pounds ($61) a month unless they opt for more expensive services. how much eu visitors to the u.k. pay will depend on their operator.\n\n4. what will happen at ports?\n\nmotorists could get snarled up in traffic around the channel tunnel and ports, which were already being disrupted in december by covid restrictions. truck drivers in the u.k. heading to france and belgium through dover will need to apply in advance for a permit to enter kent, the county between london and the channel coast. similar problems may occur for motorists at holyhead, a port in northwest wales for ferries to dublin.\n\nad\n\nad\n\n5. will food be disrupted?\n\nconsumers run the risk that fresh or perishable foods from continental europe such as fruit, vegetables and cheese will be hard to find if there are delays at ports, or if suppliers decide rules are too complicated to make exporting worthwhile. although prolonged shortages are unlikely, during the u.k.'s first covid lockdown in march 2020 many supermarkets did run out of staples such as flour and pasta, and stockpiling could cause more disruption.\n\n6. what about immigration rules?\n\nu.k. citizens seeking to live and work in the eu after jan. 1 may need a combination of visas, a work permit and a residence permit. eu skilled workers moving to the u.k. will normally need a job offer first. a deal protecting the rights of more than 3 million eu citizens already living in the u.k. and about a million british citizens residing in the bloc came into force earlier in the brexit process. that allows them to stay where they are and continue to enjoy pensions and access to health care where they live. arrangements are also already in place between the u.k. and ireland, giving the citizens of each country reciprocal rights to live and work in both.\n\nad\n\nad\n\n7. who else will feel the impact?\n\n• students: those from the eu may face increases in fees to study at british universities and could lose access to finance. some may still qualify for funding and be subject to local fees for courses starting before jan. 1, 2028, if they meet certain residency requirements. u.k. students may find applying for european universities more expensive and funding more difficult to obtain. u.k. students will also no longer be able to participate in the erasmus program enabling study abroad, although the u.k. government plans to set up its own alternative.\n\n• british people living in europe: several u.k. banks, including barclays, lloyds and nationwide, started closing the accounts of customers resident in various eu countries, including some who could not provide addresses in the u.k., according to which? magazine. this is due to changes in rules governing what services banks will be able to offer following brexit.\n\nad\n\nad\n\n8. has the irish border been resolved?\n\nyes, meaning people will be able to continue to cross from northern ireland, which is part of the u.k., into the republic of ireland without border controls. that's because monitoring of goods arriving in northern ireland will largely take place at ports. avoiding a physical border was a major goal for both sides during brexit talks, because of concerns that customs and security checks could threaten stability and increase political tensions in the region.\n\nfor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com
yeah, yeah, yeah — you know that life is about the journey rather than the destination. but it never quite sinks in. and that's because so often when we want a reset, we want to become something or arrive somewhere, checking a box as finished. but that implies a before/after switch that just isn't compatible, realistically, with human development. focus instead on your continual growth this year, which allows for fluctuations and even setbacks (since they can bring insight). if, on the eve of 2022, you can look back and see a genuine effort that was sustained over time to be open to change and discovery, that is a far bigger success story than checking any given box as completed.
he winds his way through a stump speech with the same inflections and cadences of a southern preacher. the call-and-response includes melodic repetition of the line who are we? imploring the audience to answer we, the people. resting one arm against the lectern while looking off to the side, he delivers rehearsed dad jokes, pleas for voter turnout and broadsides against his political opponent. the preacher sprinkles his calls for affordable health care with biblical allusions, reminding voters that bartimaeus, a blind man healed by jesus in the gospel of mark, suffered from a preexisting condition. to this point, warnock testifies on the need for medicaid expansion and cheaper college tuition. audience members punctuate the applause lines with cries of c'mon, rev!\n\nfor the past 15 years warnock has been the senior pastor at the storied ebenezer baptist church in atlanta, the same church once led by his hero, martin luther king jr. the flamboyant, preacher-pol style that warnock cultivated at ebenezer may be alien to many americans, including many white christians. but it is deeply familiar to those who grew up in and around southern black churches. in those churches, preachers make it their business to tell uncomfortable truths about american life, including the shameful ways the country treats its african american citizens.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwarnock's identity as a black preacher has become central to his bid to reach the higher ground of the u.s. senate. republicans, who tend to perceive less conflict in the relationship between god and country, have cast him as a dangerous departure from the norm. in a recent debate, a conspicuously scripted sen. kelly loeffler, the republican incumbent whom warnock is trying to unseat, called him a radical liberal more than a dozen times. a pro-loeffler attack ad features a video clip of warnock warning members of his congregation that they cannot serve god and money, or god and the military, at the same time (matthew 6:24). the ad is spliced with snippets of warnock yelling during sermons. over action-movie-trailer music and lo-fi lighting, a grim-sounding narrator explains the threat warnock poses to the republic: raphael warnock attacks our soldiers. warnock attacks our police. . . . raphael warnock is radical and dangerous.\n\nwarnock's style also might be his best asset in the runoff, helping him match the emotional pitch of the moment as americans suffer through the hardest stretch of the pandemic and president trump spreads wild conspiracy theories about america's voting system and the officials (including republicans, and especially georgia republicans) who administer it.\n\nthere should be more people being so-called 'radical' for change, says mawuli davis, an attorney who attends ebenezer and represented warnock when he got arrested at the georgia capitol in 2014 for protesting the republican governor's decision not to expand medicaid under the obamacare law.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwhat's truly radical, davis says, is trying to overturn a freaking election.\n\njoe biden's narrow victory in georgia, coupled with two runoff elections that will determine control of the senate, have drawn national attention to the state. (the washington post)\n\non the stage in albany, warnock is dressed in a light blue quarter-zip pullover, looking like a suburban dad returning from home depot with a bag of mulch. to counter the radical label warnock has expressed his support for police and the military (his dad was a veteran). in one ad he walks a dog along the sidewalk in front of suburban homes with picket fences. dogs are more often associated with white ownership.\n\nearly voting numbers indicate high enthusiasm among democratic-leaning voters such as young people and african americans — voting blocs warnock aims to inspire with a vision of change while not alienating moderate voters in the suburbs who helped carry joe biden to victory here in november. to paraphrase the apostle matthew, warnock may have to serve two masters, electorally speaking. and his success may depend on his identity as a man who serves god.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nas the albany event ends, a man who addressed the crowd earlier wanders among the cars.\n\ni think it is important that we have people in politics on the liberal side, on the progressive side, that represent faith, that take back the meaning behind faith, that it is not a conservative ideal, says alex moreschi, a white episcopal minister. at its heart, christianity is a progressive movement. it is a radical movement for the health and security and love of neighbor. and i see rev. warnock representing that.\n\nin georgia, they worship god. in small, red-brick buildings next to cotton fields. in strip malls next to bargain outlets. in large multimillion-dollar complexes with expansive parking lots, they praise his name. but georgians do not always worship together. and they do not always receive god's message in the same way. centuries of racial and social segregation mean that while black and white may be a part of the same body of christ, they aren't necessarily in communion with each other.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nfor hundreds of years the black christian church has been the central religious, social and political institution in black american life. the church has survived racial acts of terror, including bombings, fires and mass shootings. as recently as december a group of neo-facists marching in d.c. vandalized black churches displaying black lives matter signs. the most elaborate and well-planned slave insurrection in the history of the united states was organized by denmark vesey, the co-founder of mother emanuel african methodist episcopal church in charleston, s.c., according to vesey biographer david robertson. richard h. cain, who was elected to the house of representatives during reconstruction, served as emanuel's pastor. and the black church is where a charismatic young preacher from atlanta plotted a nonviolent overthrow of the racial caste system in the south.\n\ni seek to live in a way that honors dr. martin luther king jr., coretta scott king and the entire king family. not just on this special occasion, but every day, kelly loeffler reportedly told a congregation last january when she appeared at ebenezer in honor of king.\n\nit was a thoroughly uncontroversial remark for a modern conservative politician to make — the kind that makes it easy to forget how unpopular king was when he was alive. gallup polling estimated that americans felt more negatively toward him as the 1960s progressed. critics branded king a radical communist hellbent on destroying america, and those accusations continued well after he was killed; president ronald reagan initially opposed the proposal to make king's birthday a national holiday, and more than 100 lawmakers in the house and senate voted against it. in a 1983 debate on the matter, sen. jesse helms (r-n.c.) accused king of harboring radical political views rooted in marxist communism.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nking was not a communist; he criticized communism for denying god. but he was a political radical in his time, promoting peaceful lawbreaking to protest racial injustice — in god's name, no less. and he was unsparing in his criticism of godly men who failed to do the same. writing from a birmingham, ala., jail, in 1963, king expressed his disappointment in white ministers for failing to call out segregation as morally sinful. he also had choice words for white moderates, whom he described as a greater stumbling block to racial justice than even the ku klux klan. (suffice it to say, king never ran for statewide office in georgia.)\n\nwarnock is not martin luther king jr., but he has borrowed a sheet or two from king's playbook. warnock speaks of government-backed health care the same way king spoke of ending segregation: this is what god wants us to do.\n\nwarnock's attempts to claim the moral high ground haven't sat well with everyone in the black church. in december, more than two dozen church leaders politely asked him to reconsider his pro-choice views, saying his rationalizations reflected grave errors of judgment and a lapse in pastoral responsibility.(at the same time, those leaders praised his efforts to share christ while pursuing political solutions to our most pressing problems today.)\n\nbut the fact that warnock has pastoral responsibilities puts him in an unusual strategic position — not just with voters who want to walk a righteous path, but also with respect to the radical liberal attack line from republicans. in december, the new york times reported that a different group of religious leaders wrote an open letter to loeffler, asking her to stop calling warnock a radical, saying that doing so amounted to a broader attack against the black church and faith traditions for which we stand. the pastor's social justice theological and faith traditions, they reportedly wrote, are not only accepted as an authentic prophetic message in the tradition of dr. martin luther king, but also a central message of the gospel of jesus christ.\n\nthe man is not radical, says the rev. ralph huling, senior pastor of st. james missionary baptist church.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nit is a sunday morning in columbus, a city near the georgia-alabama line. covid-19 restrictions have forced the event at st. james into the parking lot, where the amens have been replaced by gratuitous horn-honking.\n\nthe man is just a proponent of change, continues huling. by calling for medicaid expansion warnock is simply asking america to live up to its ideals, he explains. if that is radical, says huling, then we need more radicals.\n\nwarnock is fond of telling crowds that jesus healed the sick, even those with preexisting conditions. he wants college to be cheaper because he went to morehouse on the full faith scholarship which means he didn't have enough money for the first semester. it works on multiple levels. if you are a progressive hoping for the same policy outcomes, warnock is speaking your language. if you want someone who understands your culture because he comes from where you come from, that works, too.\n\nraces between sen. david perdue (r-ga.) and jon ossoff (d) as well as sen. kelly loeffler (r-ga.) and the rev. raphael warnock (d) will be decided on jan. 5. (the washington post)\n\nthe cruel irony of the pandemic is that, in times of social strife, black people have counted on the comforting rhythms of church life. but on this day there is no clapping from the amen corner, no church ladies in decorative hats filing in early to grab their favorite seats, no ushers rushing in with fans to cool parishioners who've been overwhelmed by the holy spirit. no little girls in their finest dresses scrounging through grandma's purse in search of hard peppermint candies, no little boys negotiating with the serving ladies for an extra piece of fried chicken or another dollop of potato salad after the second sermon.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthat is, perhaps, why huling looks particularly excited to be performing in front of a large audience this morning. i didn't come to prolong the time, he says before giving his remarks — a warning to anyone who's spent time in a black church that they'd better get ready to settle in.\n\nwhat follows is a 30-minute stemwinder that starts with o little town of bethlehem and veers to a treatise on the horse trading between president lyndon johnson and republican minority leader everett dirksen over the civil rights act. the sermon reaches a singsong crescendo with huling in an ozzy osbourne rock-star crouch screaming into the microphone.\n\nhe's a bridge (ah) over troubled water. . . . he's a doctor (ah) in a sickroom. . . . he's a lawyer (ah) in a courtroom. . . . ain't he all right . . . ? there oughta be two or three folks here today, don't mind being a witness that the lawwwwd, the lawwwwd, the laawwwwd's been good to you. . . . if you know he's all right and you ain't ashamed then say yeahhhhhh . . . yeahhhhh . . . yeahhhhh!
the democrats are running as moderates to win in the once-deeply red state that president-elect joe biden narrowly nabbed.\n\nbut sens. kelly loeffler and david perdue (r-ga.) are still finding political purchase in tethering them to the climate plan backed by rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.).\n\nad\n\nthey mean socialism, loeffler told a crowd saturday in carrollton, ga., referring to her opponent, warnock, along with senate minority leader charles e. schumer (d-n.y.). the green new deal, she added, would cost every family $75,000. (there was no cost estimate in the actual plan.)\n\nad\n\nperdue says he believes the climate is changing but has stopped short of agreeing with the scientific consensus that human activity is behind global warming. instead, perdue has attacked ossoff over the green new deal, calling it a piece of democrats' leftist, radical, socialist agenda during an appearance last week on fox news.\n\nsimilarly, an ad from the national republican senatorial committee claims ossoff praises aoc's radical green new deal.\n\nad\n\npresident trump similarly needled biden over the green new deal during the presidential election, despite the democratic candidate's rejection of the plan.\n\nossoff has been clear in opposing the resolution.\n\nbut ossoff commended its sponsors for linking environmental policy and infrastructure policy, as he told the new york times in october.\n\nad\n\nthe green new deal is a broad, nonbinding resolution put forward two years ago by ocasio-cortez and other liberal lawmakers to cut u.s. contributions to climate change in just 10 years. biden and top house democrats are instead aiming to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nlike the former vice president, both ossoff and warnock call for reentering the paris climate agreement and undoing the repeal of barack obama-era regulations as part of a clean energy transition. both neither endorses the green new deal by name on their websites, nor have they committed that aggressive 10-year timeline for decarbonization.\n\nthere is a lot at stake in the georgia runoffs.\n\ncontrol of the senate is up for grabs after voting ends tuesday. if both ossoff and warnock win, democrats would force a 50-50 tie in the senate. vice president-elect kamala d. harris would serve as the tiebreaker, handing control to schumer.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe results tuesday will help determine the extent to which biden will be able to enact his $2 trillion plan for reducing emissions from the power and auto sectors. already his administration is preparing to act without much legislative support.\n\nthough climate change has not figured prominently into the senate races, georgia's farms, cities and coastline are vulnerable to sea-level rise, heat waves and other extreme weather linked to rising global warming, according to the national climate assessment.\n\nseveral environmental groups, including the sunrise movement, have lined up in support of warnock and ossoff, even though neither candidate backs the deal, knowing that their success at the polls is the only way democrats can gain full control of congress.\n\nad\n\nit is expected to be a close race. cook political report rates both races as toss-ups.\n\npower plays\n\ntrump vetoed a bill that would have banned a fishing technique harmful to wildlife off the california coast.\n\nthe bill would have phased out use of large-mesh drift gillnets in federal waters off california over a five-year period, the associated press reports. these nets, used to catch thresher sharks and swordfish, often entangle other marine life, including whales, dolphins and sea lions, and are already prohibited in u.s. waters off the atlantic coast and the gulf of mexico. in 2018, california passed a four-year phaseout of the nets in state waters.\n\ntrump claimed in his veto message on friday that the legislation would cause americans to import more foreign seafood and worsen a multibillion-dollar seafood trade deficit.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbut sen. dianne feinstein (d-calif.) said more whales, dolphins, sea turtles and other marine species will be needlessly killed. she pledged to reintroduce the bill during the new congress and push for quick enactment once president biden is in office.\n\na court will consider a request to stop the trump administration's arctic oil lease sale.\n\nu.s. district court judge sharon gleason in anchorage will hear oral arguments today in a case brought by the national audubon society and other environmental groups attempting to halt the sale of oil and gas leases in the arctic national wildlife refuge. the case is one of four lawsuits brought by environmental groups, tribal organizations and 15 state governments challenging the bureau of land management's plan to open bids this week, the anchorage daily news reports.\n\nmany major banks have ruled out financing for arctic oil exploration, and it is unclear how much interest the lease sale will attract. in a highly unusual step, a state of alaska-owned corporation could be among the bidders in an effort to acquire and hold

but the board staff is continuing its probe of the 9th district election, the results of which the board declined to certify in november amid allegations that illegal tampering with absentee ballots may have tainted the outcome.\n\nad\n\nharris, a charlotte-area pastor, leads democrat dan mccready by 905 votes in unofficial returns. in a statement wednesday evening, his campaign said it will go to wake county superior court on thursday to seek certification of those results while still allowing for a full and thorough investigation of any concerns or irregularities.\n\nad\n\nthe campaign cited a lack of public evidence from state election officials that the irregularities were sufficient to change the election's outcome as justification for a judge to act.\n\nharris, meanwhile, is set to meet with board investigators thursday, election officials said — the same day the new congress will be sworn in.\n\nad\n\nharris's campaign confirmed that he will not travel to washington this week, where house democrats had already vowed to block him from taking office.\n\nwe are hopeful that we can get this resolved as soon as possible so the 9th district can be represented in congress, harris campaign manager jason williams said in an email.\n\nat the center of the controversy is a bladen county political operative who worked for the harris campaign and allegedly collected absentee ballots from voters in violation of state law. harris has said he had no knowledge of any illegal activity.\n\nlast week's court decision on the state election board stemmed from a separate lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the panel's makeup. a new board will be formed on jan. 31 under legislation passed last month.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ngov. roy cooper (d) initially announced plans to constitute an interim board in the meantime. the governor has the power to appoint all five of the board's members, with three from a list provided by his party and two from the opposing party.\n\nbut cooper backed away from that move wednesday after state republicans said they would not participate in naming new members — which would have left the panel as an all-democratic board, giving the gop an opening to dismiss its findings as partisan.\n\nquickly rooting out real election fraud should be a bipartisan effort, cooper said in the statement. today in north carolina, we have a board of elections with five empty chairs because republicans are blocking the way.\n\nad\n\nnorth carolina republican party chairman robin hayes said in a statement that the party's unwillingness to support an interim board results from a desire to ensure that any future investigation surrounding the ninth congressional district election is open, fair, and transparent, and not tainted by actions taken by an illegal board.\n\nad\n\nmeanwhile, state board staff appeared to try to head off efforts to block the investigation from continuing, saying in a statement distributed wednesday that all its subpoenas remain legally effective and that the probe will continue.
for much of the american public, only the beginning part of that really mattered. more jobs and higher wages are never unpopular, and, if trump et al. could deliver despite the fact that unemployment was already quite low, who could complain?\n\non friday, the bureau of labor statistics released the last employment report for 2018, giving us a complete look at the first full year after those tax cuts. and, to some extent, the sales pitch held up.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwe can consider this in two contexts: how things looked relative to 2017 and how the first two years of trump's administration looked compared to the last two of president barack obama's.\n\non the unemployment rate, 2018 saw the lowest overall level of any of the four years — but that was certainly in part because the unemployment rate is already so low. in fact, the rate climbed two points in december, in part thanks to people willingly leaving jobs to seek better employment.\n\n(the chart above shows rates of change, month over month.)\n\nlooking at the change in the number of people working nationally, 2018 added 2.6 million new jobs, thanks in part to the 310,000 added last month. that figure, we'll note will be revised over the next two months.\n\nwhat really stands out is the change in hourly earnings. from 2015 to 2017, the change over the course of the year ranged from 63 to 69 cents an hour. in 2018, earnings increased by 84 cents over the year, a 3.2 percent increase.\n\nthat's an increase of nearly $1,750 for a person working 2,080 hours in a year.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthis, too, is probably linked to some degree to the lower unemployment rate. it's expected that, as unemployment drops, wages will rise, since employers will need to compete for employees who have more choices about where to go. that there was a boost in the number of people willingly leaving their jobs in december bolsters this idea: you can more easily leave your job to go somewhere that pays you more if there are more jobs and fewer job candidates.\n\nregardless: good news. but, then, there are those markets. by now, you're aware that things didn't go as trump had hoped on that metric, with the dow jones industrial average and the standard & poor's 500-composite index both dropping over the course of 2018.\n\nshortly before the jobs report was released, trump sought on twitter to downplay the market declines as being the fault of his political opponents.\n\nthe problem with that, as the graph above should make clear, is that the market began to stagnate early in 2018, well before the midterm elections.\n\nit's also not the case that the tax cuts have, over the short term, boosted federal income taxes. as we noted last month, corporate taxes are the only category of taxes where receipts declined in fiscal year 2018 relative to 2017.
but in his forthcoming book, former national security adviser john bolton said trump tied aid to a desired probe of biden and his son hunter, prompting republicans to quickly change their message: on tuesday, they latched on to an argument from trump defense attorney alan dershowitz, that his actions don't rise to the level of impeachment, even if the allegation is true.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nlet's say it's true, okay? dershowitz last night explained that if you're looking at it from a constitutional point of view, that that is not something that is impeachable, sen. mike braun (r-ind.) told reporters tuesday morning.\n\nalan dershowitz said it was not impeachable, said sen. roy blunt (r-mo.), a top ally of senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.). and i don't disagree with that.\n\nthe ramifications are striking and could have long-term implications. the argument suggests senators believe a u.s. president can use taxpayer dollars to pressure an ally to investigate an american citizen who happens to be challenging him for president, without any repercussions. that was the basis of the house's dec. 18 impeachment charges, abuse of power and obstruction of congress.\n\nad\n\non jan. 28, president trump's legal team rested their case in the senate impeachment trial amid uncertainty over whether witnesses will be called. (the washington post)\n\nmost republicans have also refused to say publicly whether they believe trump's actions were appropriate, with some growing angry when reporters press them for an answer.\n\nad\n\nbut the new talking point also stands in stark contrast to a key argument by trump's most ardent defenders in congress and his own legal team: that a quid pro quo never happened. as recently as tuesday, trump's defense team was calling into question the notion that the president pressured ukraine for a probe at all.\n\nthe person that would be on the other end of the quid pro quo, if it existed, would have been president zelensky, said trump's attorney jay sekulow. but president zelensky — and we already laid out the other officials from ukraine — have repeatedly said there was no pressure. . . . we are clear in our position that there was no quid pro quo.\n\nad\n\nthe diverging messages underscore the challenge republicans face as they try to coalesce around an argument for why they don't want to hear from witnesses after the white house stonewalled congress. mcconnell indicated in a closed-door meeting with senate republicans on tuesday that he did not yet have enough votes to defeat an effort, expected later this week, to call additional witnesses and evidence in the trial.\n\nad\n\nsenators on monday had been struggling to come up with an answer for why they don't want to hear from bolton. by tuesday morning, they had found their answer in dershowitz's legal argument: if the allegation at hand isn't impeachable, why ask to hear more?\n\nthe idea of acknowledging a quid pro quo first surfaced in the senate this past fall, as more than a dozen current and former trump administration officials testified to house impeachment investigators that they believed a white house meeting and $391 million in congressionally appropriated money were being withheld to pressure ukraine. sen. ted cruz (r-tex.) told his colleagues in a private late-october meeting that by admitting the act occurred, republicans could then argue that trump did not have criminal intent, or perhaps that he even had a legitimate reason to ask for those probes.\n\nad\n\nbut such a strategy contradicted trump, who said he did nothing wrong, called his july 25 phone call with zelensky perfect and denied that he tried to force a u.s. ally into announcing investigations of the bidens. indeed, trump's top house defenders, including reps. jim jordan (r-ohio) and mark meadows (r-n.c.), pushed back on any attempts by senators to simply acknowledge a quid pro quo happened and explain why.\n\nthe republican argument, instead, was to deny a quid pro quo occurred. house republicans said none of the democrats' witnesses had heard from trump that he was directing the plan; even ambassador to the european union gordon sondland, who testified that it was clear there was a quid pro quo, couldn't say who told him it was occurring.\n\nad\n\nnow, however, news that bolton personally spoke with trump about his intention to freeze military aid until he got an investigation has upended the gop line that no firsthand witnesses have come forward. it sent republicans into a private frenzy monday morning, as some gop lawmakers struggled with a sense of duty to call in bolton to testify.\n\nad\n\nenter dershowitz, a trump lawyer and emeritus harvard law professor who argued monday that nothing in the bolton revelations, even if true, would rise to the level of an abusive power or an impeachable offense.\n\nlawyers and academics strongly disagreed with dershowitz. frank o. bowman, a university of missouri law professor and author of the book high crimes and misdemeanors, said dershowitz's view is out of step with mainstream constitutional scholars and historians.\n\nad\n\nin making this argument, alan is essentially alone, and i mean alone, bowman said tuesday, accusing republicans of seizing on dershowitz's argument because it gives them cover not to convict a president in their own party. what dershowitz did yesterday was stand up and be a guy with harvard attached to his name and spout complete nonsense that's totally unsupported by any scholarship, anywhere.\n\nad\n\nindeed, a statutory crime has never been required for impeachment, dating back to the 14th century, when the british parliament invented the procedure as a mechanism for dealing with abuses of royal power. the american framers wrote high crimes and misdemeanors into the u.s. constitution, he noted, to include noncriminal abuses of power, and since then, federal judges and a u.s. senator have been impeached for noncriminal conduct.\n\njohn mikhail, a georgetown university law professor, agreed. he said dershowitz was able to cobble together statements here and there in our history, but at the end of the day, it's really an outlier position in terms of the scholarly consensus — and substantively very weak.\n\nad\n\nmikhail said it was kind of incoherent and ignored all of the evidence that has led to the scholarly consensus that an underlying crime is not necessary to convict in an impeachment trial.\n\nad\n\nhouse intelligence committee chairman adam b. schiff (d-calif.), the lead impeachment manager, scoffed at the gop's new defense: they fall back on the argument, 'okay, he did it. we all know he did it. but we're going to find a criminal defense lawyer whose expertise is not really constitutional law . . . and make the argument that is effectively, the constitution says so what? . . . you cannot impeach a president for abuse of power because it's too nebulous a concept.' \n\nstill, republicans seized on dershowitz's argument that senators need not hear from additional witnesses because even if the reports were true, trump can't be removed from office for those actions.\n\nad\n\ni actually think what ken starr and what professor dershowitz [said] is true, which undermines the whole concept of carrying this impeachment forward, said sen. thom tillis (r-n.c.). the charges at the extreme don't rise to the level of impeachment.\n\nad\n\nsen. john cornyn (r-tex.) agreed, arguing that dershowitz made a good argument that a crime is required.\n\nthe constitution says 'treason, bribery, other high crimes and misdemeanors,'  he said. it talks all about crimes. so impeaching somebody for a non-crime strikes me as novel. i found it pretty compelling.\n\nelsewhere around the capitol, other republican senators — mike crapo (idaho) and mike rounds (s.d.) — expressed similar opinions about dershowitz's rationale. that argument probably gave a lot more peace of mind to people that were wanting to see how to sort through it, braun said, noting that he approached dershowitz after his argument to ask him again: if bolton's revelation in its full form was true, is that impeachable in your opinion . . . and he said no, because it imputes motives.
intel drops plans for id numbers by robert o'harrow jr. and elizabeth corcoran\n\nwashington post staff writers\n\ntuesday, january 26, 1999; page e1 intel corp. yesterday abruptly backed away from plans for its new silicon chips to automatically issue a unique identification number on the internet, after critics complained that the technology could expose computer users to privacy intrusions. the turnabout by the giant computer chip maker followed an announcement by privacy advocates earlier in the day that they would urge consumers to boycott intel products in protest of the chip's id component. this is a significant victory for privacy, said barry steinhardt, associate director for the american civil liberties union, who praised intel for responding to the criticism so quickly. they did it on internet time. in announcing the id feature of the new pentium iii microprocessor last week, intel officials described it as an important step for internet security. the id number would help verify the identity of people doing business online, company officials said. while each chip still will have a unique number, intel officials said yesterday, software will be configured in such a way that consumers will be required to turn the id function on instead of turning it off, as the company had planned. chuck mulloy, a spokesman for the santa clara, calif., company, acknowledged that intel is reversing course to show consumers it is sensitive to acute concerns about privacy aired last week after the chip's design was announced. we're listening to what the marketplace is telling us, that they would prefer to turn it on as opposed to turning it off, mulloy said. you must account for privacy if you're going to have security. but some privacy advocates believe the change does not go far enough. computer makers will not be able to include the software for turning the identification number off and on when they sell their first batches of the new machines, which are due to hit the market in coming months. instead, users must electronically fetch the program from intel's web site. in addition, the utility program is available only for windows software. -those who use the linux operating system, for instance, must wait until those developers write a similar program. privacy advocates also worry that computer users will be coerced into handing over their identification numbers to get into certain sites on the world wide web – in essence, allowing businesses at those web sites to track precisely what computer users do and to compare that activity with data collected about the individual at other web sites. the default for privacy should be no id number, said david banisar, policy director for the electronic privacy information center, a advocacy group in washington that helped organize the intel boycott. rep. edward j. markey (d-mass.), ranking member of the commerce subcommittee on telecommunications, trade and consumer protection, said he believes consumers need better privacy protections online. i have great concerns about any unique identifier web sites might use without any rules, said markey, who wrote a letter to intel complaining about the chip last week. © copyright the washington post company back to the top
fight fans rallied behind 28-year-old russian khabib nurmagomedov, who's risen to fame thanks to an unbeaten record in 22 fights — including his latest against michael johnson at ufc 205 in november — the same card on which mcgregor beat eddie alvarez for the lightweight strap.\n\nad\n\nnurmagomedov made his case that night, calling mcgregor a chicken and demanding a shot at the title on his home turf.\n\nirish only 6 million [population], he said. russian, 150 million. i want to fight with your chicken.\n\nad\n\nufc executives, however, apparently weren't convinced, mostly because of tony ferguson. the no. 2 ranked lightweight fighter has won his last nine fights and is calling for a shot at the title, too.\n\nto settle the no. 1 contender issue fairly, the ufc attempted to set up an interim title fight between nurmagomedov and ferguson, which both fighters have also been negotiating on twitter, but negotiations hit a roadblock in recent days, according to ufc president dana white.\n\nad\n\ntony said he will not do that fight unless he makes the same exact money that khabib makes, white said (via mma fighting). khabib has a different deal, so that ain't happening. so count that one out.\n\nor maybe not. on monday, nurmagomedov offered to cough up the $200,000 difference himself.\n\nferguson didn't accept nurmagomedov's offer, however.\n\nad\n\nif you've got khabib willing to sacrifice his life and give me $200,000 of his own money, something's wrong with that [crap], he said on monday's edition of the mma hour. i'm not going to take that guy's money. he's got a family too. so do i, and he's got bills to pay. so i'm not going after khabib's.\n\nad\n\nthe ufc has a chance to make the most money out of everyone right now, he added.  let me work for you guys the way that i have been working, but compensate me the way that i need to be compensated.\n\nferguson said he believes he's making less money than nurmagomedov because he hasn't had the same exposure. unlike the russian, who's had three of his last five fights showcased on high-profile pay-per-view cards, ferguson's last four fights have aired on fox sports 1.\n\ni haven't had the opportunities that they have [given nurmagomedov], he said, adding, however, that the ufc has a long history of changing a fighter's compensation for a particular bout.\n\nad\n\nad\n\neverybody wants the fight, he added. everybody wants to see these fireworks.\n\nmcgregor, meanwhile, hasn't commented at all about the back-and-forth. he's been busy picking fights with floyd mayweather jr., posing in front of fancy cars, cutting a rug at his sister's recent wedding and generally enjoying life.\n\nhe did have something to say in november about nurmagomedov following the russian's chicken remarks.
ad\n\nthere have been two prevailing and very polarized reactions to the op-ed.\n\nad\n\none is that romney is setting himself up to lead the anti-trump wing of the republican party (such as it is currently constituted) . ..\n\n. . . and the other is very understandable skepticism that he'll actually put his conduct where his mouth is.\n\nthe argument for the latter is evident. trump's top critics in the senate gop — jeff flake (ariz.), bob corker (tenn.), ben sasse (neb.) and, for a time, lindsey o. graham (s.c.) — talked a big game but did little to impact trump's actions. the first two opted for retirement, with flake waving a white flag in the face of trumpism and really only using his legislative prerogatives toward the end of his tenure. graham, once critical, is now a top trump ally who occasionally criticizes his foreign policy. all have regularly voted with the president's priorities.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nromney's history with trump suggests he could follow a similar path.\n\nromney criticized trump in more severe terms than just about anybody in 2016, even after trump was the de facto gop nominee. but he's also been happy to play ball and accept his help. as the gop presidential nominee in 2012, he flew out to accept an endorsement from trump, then in the throes of birtherism. after trump was elected president, romney interviewed to be trump's secretary of state.\n\nwhen romney decided to run for senate, he accepted trump's endorsement again and backed off his previous criticisms of the leader. at a debate three months ago, romney was asked three times whether he still thought trump was a fraud and a phony. i'm going to talk about the future, he responded.\n\nad\n\nhis op-ed seems, in part, to be an effort to explain his many about-faces. in the piece, romney emphasized twice that he's particularly appalled by this past month of trump's presidency. this may be true, but it's also an extremely convenient line. after all, trump's cabinet has been trending toward less-experienced yes-men for a long time, a phenomenon that accelerated after the 2018 election. trump's character has been pretty consistent throughout. romney's point about trump and the damage to u.s. alliances is also something you could have said for much of the past two years.\n\nad\n\nbut that doesn't mean romney will necessarily fail to act as a check on trump's power. even if romney chose political expediency before, he could feel this is his chance to effect change, now that he's actually got a washington job. it's worth entertaining the idea that romney truly believes his past trump criticisms and now wants to do something about them — or at least try. i do not intend to comment on every tweet or fault, romney writes. but i will speak out against significant statements or actions that are divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions.\n\nromney has a bigger platform than any of the four gop senators mentioned above. he also has more experience as a national voice. he may view this as a chance to right the ship in the gop and the country — or even set himself up for another presidential bid if trump and trumpism falters.\n\nad\n\ni find this so troubling, and i know a lot of folks are saying, 'mitt, just get off your high horse on this and get behind the guy,' romney said back in june 2016. but these things are personal. i love this country. i love the founders. i love what this country is built upon and its values, and seeing this is breaking my heart.
after watching his team commit yet another turnover early in the second half of saturday's game at illinois, maryland coach mark turgeon slammed his fist into his whiteboard on the scorer's table. the terrapins were down by six, with little to suggest that deficit would change, and the whiteboard had a hole in it after feeling turgeon's wrath.\n\nas maryland's players ran to the huddle during a timeout a few moments later, an assistant fetched a new board for turgeon. whatever he diagramed in that moment, whatever he said during that timeout, was less important than the decision he made to substitute reserve guard jaylen brantley into the game. about eight minutes later, as brantley stunned state farm arena with a personal 10-point run, turgeon was jumping for joy and giggling to his assistants on the bench.\n\nhe's balling! he's balling! turgeon screamed, later recounting the moment after maryland's 62-56 win over the fighting illini.\n\njaylen brantley really gave us a huge lift, gave us confidence, because no one could really make a shot except him, it felt like. and he made the run, turgeon said of the junior guard, who finished with 12 points and sparked a crucial 14-0 run midway through the second half that nullified an otherwise sloppy showing.\n\n[maryland's michal cekovsky out of walking boot, unlikely to face illini]\n\nmaryland (16-2, 4-1 big ten) trailed by 11 at one point in the first half and scored just 27 points through the first 20 minutes, and while the starting backcourt tandem of anthony cowan and melo trimble combined for 31 points and 12 rebounds on a night when maryland's frontcourt was plagued by foul trouble, it was brantley who stole the show with the most consequential performance of his career.\n\ni knew if i could hit one shot, i could get it going, said brantley, who hit 5 of 10 shots from the field and scored all of his points within a 7:04 span in the second half. i was just trying to be myself, just play my game how i normally play.\n\njust 18 days after it trounced illinois by 25 in the big ten opener in college park, maryland entered saturday's rematch as a slight underdog after wins over michigan and indiana over the past week. the terrapins were not just looking to keep pace atop the league standings but also had an opportunity to make a statement after being snubbed by national pollsters for much of the past month.\n\na hallmark of maryland's win over the fighting illini (12-6, 2-3) in late december had been attacking the lane on the offensive end — it held a 48-24 advantage on points in the paint in their first meeting — but it largely diverted from that strategy early saturday. trimble nailed a three-pointer on his team's first possession but then went cold from deep, missing his next three attempts. and as illinois crowded the lane, his teammates began to settle as well: maryland took three-point attempts on six of its first nine shots and hit just 1 of 11 from beyond the arc in the first eight minutes.\n\ni wouldn't say we were rattled. i would just say we couldn't really get a shot to fall, said cowan, who finished with 19 points and seven rebounds .\n\nthat low-percentage shot selection was compounded by serious foul trouble in the frontcourt, beginning with senior damonte dodd, who had put together consecutive productive performances in the wins over michigan and indiana largely by avoiding fouls and remaining on the court. but he picked up two fouls by the 11:42 mark of the first half saturday, and freshman power forward justin jackson joined him on the bench for long stretches as illinois built an 11-point lead. the low point came with just under five minutes remaining before halftime, when illinois guards leron black and malcolm hill hit back-to-back three-pointers to make it 27-16.\n\n[maryland football announces home-and-home series with virginia]\n\nwe just kept playing basketball and getting stops, said trimble, who finished with 12 points on 5-for-16 shooting and didn't shoot any free throws.\n\nbut even as foul trouble forced turgeon to shuffle his rotation over the final minutes of the first half — maryland also was without center michal cekovsky (ankle) and guard dion wiley (back) — the terrapins chipped away to climb within striking distance. after cowan hit a pair of free throws, trimble stripped hill on the final possession of the first half and beat the buzzer with a reverse layup to make it 32-27 at the break.\n\nillinois pushed the lead to 43-39 with 13:39 remaining but didn't score again until there was 5:48 left. by that point, maryland had pieced together a 14-0 run, fueled by the energy of brantley. he used a blend of skills to make his run happen.\n\nafter nailing a pair of three pointers to put maryland up one, brantley added a sneaky layup off a baseline drive and later made an acrobatic steal off an inbound that led to another layup. by the time he finished an off-balance runner in the lane despite taking heavy contact with 7:43 remaining, maryland had a 10-point lead and turgeon was celebrating with his assistants on the bench. their work was far from over, but illinois did not get closer than four points after that.\n\nwhile cowan sank five free throws in the final minute to seal a third consecutive win, one of his backups sat patiently on the bench. brantley was ready to check back in if turgeon needed him, but his contribution on this night had already been more than enough.
we are challenged by the paradox of having so many resource riches, but the population is very poor, muyej said.\n\nthe industry should be a boon for a country that the united nations ranks among the least developed. but it hasn't worked out that way.\n\nthis informal army is big business, responsible for an estimated 10 to 25 percent of the world's cobalt production and about 17 to 40 percent of production in congo. artisanal miners alone are responsible for more cobalt than any nation other than congo, ranking behind only congo's industrial mines.\n\nthe worst conditions affect congo's artisanal miners — a too-quaint name for the impoverished workers who mine without pneumatic drills or diesel draglines.\n\nthis issue, i believe, we are not the only ones, he said. we believe there are many companies in similar situations as us.\n\nchen said he expected controversy surrounding how cobalt is mined in congo to ripple far beyond huayou cobalt.\n\ncompanies are unlikely to abandon congo, for a simple reason: the world needs what congo has.\n\nthe government is not a beggar, muyej said. these companies have an obligation to create wealth in the area where they operate.\n\nbut, he said, his government is too poor to tackle these issues alone.\n\nit is true, there are children in these mines, provincial governor richard muyej, the highest-ranking government official in kolwezi, said in an interview. he also acknowledged problems with mining-related deaths and pollution.\n\nbut this comes at an exceptional cost.\n\nsmartphones would not fit in pockets without them. laptops would not fit on laps. electric vehicles would be impractical. in many ways, the current silicon valley gold rush — from mobile devices to driverless cars — is built on the power of lithium-ion batteries.\n\nlithium-ion batteries were supposed to be different from the dirty, toxic technologies of the past. lighter and packing more energy than conventional lead-acid batteries, these cobalt-rich batteries are seen as green. they are essential to plans for one day moving beyond smog-belching gasoline engines. already these batteries have defined the world's tech devices.\n\nin fact, a small piece of cobalt is inside the you may be using to read this story right now.\n\nin fact, a small piece of kolwezi cobalt could be inside the smartphone you may be using to read this article right now.\n\nbut how such serious problems could persist for so long — despite frequent warning signs — illustrates what can happen in hard-to-decipher supply chains when they are mostly unregulated, low price is paramount and the trouble occurs in a distant, tumultuous part of the world.\n\nchen said huayou planned to change how it buys cobalt, had hired an outside company to oversee the process and was working with customers such as apple to create a system for preventing abuse.\n\nthat is our shortcoming, chen said in an interview in seattle, in his first public comments on the topic. we didn't realize.\n\nin september, chen hongliang, the president of congo dongfang parent huayou cobalt, told the post that his company had never questioned how its minerals were obtained, despite operating in congo and cities such as kolwezi for a decade.\n\ndigger sidiki mayamba, left, puts on his shoes in the room he shares with wife ivette mujombo tshatela and their 2-year-old son, harold muhiya mwehu, in kolwezi, congo, in june. creuseurs, or diggers, work in the mine at kawama. the cobalt that is extracted is sold to a chinese company, congo dongfang mining. a man pushes a bicycle laden with charcoal, which is used for cooking and heating, past musompo, a mineral market outside kolwezi. a boy carries a bag used to transport cobalt-laden dirt and rock at the musompo market.\n\nbut the problems remained starkly evident when post journalists visited mining operations in congo this summer.\n\nin the past year, a dutch advocacy group called the center for research on multinational corporations, known as somo , and amnesty international have put out reports alleging improprieties including forced relocations of villages and water pollution. amnesty's report, which accused congo dongfang of buying materials mined by children, prompted a fresh wave of companies to promise that their cobalt connections were being vetted.\n\nconcern about how cobalt is mined comes to the fore every now and again, said guy darby, a veteran cobalt analyst with darton commodities in london. and it's met with much muttering and shaking of the head and tuttering — and goes away again.\n\ncongo's cobalt trade has been the target of criticism for nearly a decade, mostly from advocacy groups. even u.s. trade groups have acknowledged the problem. the electronic industry citizenship coalition — whose members include companies such as apple — raised concerns in 2010 about the potential for human rights abuses in the mining of minerals, including cobalt, and the difficulty in tracking supply chains. the u.s. labor department lists congolese cobalt as a product it has reason to think is produced by child labor.\n\nscrutiny is heightened for a few of these minerals. a 2010 u.s. law requires american companies to attempt to verify that any tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold they use is obtained from mines free of militia control in the congo region. the result is a system widely seen as preventing human rights abuses. some say cobalt should be added to the conflict-minerals list, even if cobalt mines are not thought to be funding war. apple told the post that it now supports including cobalt in the law.\n\nyet 60 percent of the world's cobalt originates in congo — a chaotic country rife with corruption and a long history of foreign exploitation of its natural resources. a century ago, companies plundered congo's rubber sap and elephant tusks while the country was a belgian colony. today, more than five decades after congo gained its independence, it is minerals that attract foreign companies.\n\nfew companies regularly track where their cobalt comes from. following the path from mine to finished product is difficult but possible, the post discovered. armed guards block access to many of congo's mines. the cobalt then passes through several companies and travels thousands of miles.\n\nanother huayou customer, lg chem, one of the world's leading battery makers, told the post it stopped buying congo-sourced minerals late last year. samsung sdi, another large battery maker, said that it is conducting an internal investigation but that to the best of our knowledge, while the company does use cobalt mined in congo, it does not come from huayou.\n\napple, in response to questions from the post, acknowledged that this cobalt has made its way into its batteries. the cupertino, calif.-based tech giant said that an estimated 20 percent of the cobalt it uses comes from huayou cobalt. paula pyers, a senior director at apple in charge of supply-chain social responsibility, said the company plans to increase scrutiny of how all its cobalt is obtained. pyers also said apple is committed to working with huayou cobalt to clean up the supply chain and to addressing the underlying issues, such as extreme poverty, that result in harsh work conditions and child labor.\n\nthe world has grown reliant on lithium-ion batteries that power smartphones, laptops and electric cars. but the desperate search for the ingredients carries a steep cost.\n\nthe post traced this cobalt pipeline and, for the first time, showed how cobalt mined in these harsh conditions ends up in popular consumer products. it moves from small-scale congolese mines to a single chinese company — congo dongfang international mining, part of one of the world's biggest cobalt producers, zhejiang huayou cobalt — that for years has supplied some of the world's largest battery makers. they, in turn, have produced the batteries found inside products such as apple's iphones — a finding that calls into question corporate assertions that they are capable of monitoring their supply chains for human rights abuses or child labor.\n\na creuseur, or digger, climbs through a cobalt and copper mine in kawama, congo, in june.\n\nthe world's soaring demand for cobalt is at times met by workers, including children, who labor in harsh and dangerous conditions. an estimated 100,000 cobalt miners in congo use hand tools to dig hundreds of feet underground with little oversight and few safety measures, according to workers, government officials and evidence found by the washington post during visits to remote mines. deaths and injuries are common. and the mining activity exposes local communities to levels of toxic metals that appear to be linked to ailments that include breathing problems and birth defects, health officials say.\n\nmayamba tried to reassure his wife. he said goodbye to his son. then he slung his shovel over his shoulder. it was time.\n\nshe did. but now a debt collector stood at the door. the family owed money for salt. flour would have to wait.\n\ndo you have enough money to buy flour today? he asked his wife.\n\nbut mayamba, 35, knew nothing about his role in this sprawling global supply chain. he grabbed his metal shovel and broken-headed hammer from a corner of the room he shares with his wife and child. he pulled on a dust-stained jacket. a proud man, he likes to wear a button-down shirt even to mine. and he planned to mine by hand all day and through the night. he would nap in the underground tunnels. no industrial tools. not even a hard hat. the risk of a cave-in is constant.\n\nthis remote landscape in southern africa lies at the heart of the world's mad scramble for cheap cobalt, a mineral essential to the rechargeable lithium-ion batteries that power smartphones, laptops and electric vehicles made by companies such as apple, samsung and major automakers.\n\nmayamba is a cobalt miner. and the red-dirt savanna stretching outside his door contains such an astonishing wealth of cobalt and other minerals that a geologist once described it as a scandale geologique.\n\nthe sun was rising over one of the richest mineral deposits on earth, in one of the poorest countries, as sidiki mayamba got ready for work.\n\nfrom there, most of the cobalt floats by ship to asia, home to the vast majority of the world's lithium-ion battery manufacturing.\n\nthen it's on to seaports in tanzania or south africa.\n\nthe city sits along a two-lane highway best known for carrying tractor-trailers laden with minerals as they hurtle for the border with zambia 250 miles away.\n\nkolwezi is a remote city steeped in cobalt and copper, which are often found together. it is sometimes called the lungs of the congo because of its economic importance.\n\nabout 90 percent of china's cobalt originates in congo, where chinese firms dominate the mining industry.\n\nthe cobalt begins its journey at a mine such as tilwezembe, a former industrial site turned artisanal operation on the outskirts of kolwezi where hundreds of men scour the earth with hand tools.\n\nthese men call themselves creuseurs, french for diggers. they toil inside dozens of holes pockmarking the mine's moonscape-like bottom. the tunnels are dug by hand and burrow deep underground, illuminated only by the toylike plastic lamps strapped to the miners' heads.\n\nduring a visit in june, the scene looked preindustrial. dozens of diggers were at work, but the only sound was the occasional muffled clink of metal on stone.\n\nwe are suffering, said one digger, nathan muyamba, 29. and our suffering is for what?\n\n'la fleur du cobalt'\n\n(twp)\n\ndiggers don't have mining maps or exploratory drills.\n\ninstead, they rely on intuition.\n\nyou travel with the faith believing that one day you can find good production, said digger andre kabwita, 49.\n\nnature is said to be one guide. yellow wildflowers are considered a sign of copper. a plant with tiny green flowers carries the telling name la fleur du cobalt.\n\nwith few formal sites to claim for themselves, artisanal miners dig anywhere they can. along roads. under railroad tracks. in back yards. when a major cobalt deposit was discovered a few years ago in the dense neighborhood of kasulo, diggers tunneled right through their homes' dirt floors, creating a labyrinth of underground caves.\n\nother diggers wait until dark to invade land owned by private mining companies, leading to deadly clashes with security guards and police.\n\nthe diggers are desperate, said papy nsenga, a digger and president of a fledgling diggers union.\n\npay is based on what they find. no minerals, no money. and the money is meager — the equivalent of $2 to $3 on a good day, nsenga said.\n\ndiggers gather at the tilwezembe cobalt mine outside kolwezi. miners make an average of $2 or $3 a day. a fistful of cobalt-laden dirt is held up at the musompo mineral market, where diggers sell their cobalt at small shops known as comptoirs.\n\nwe shouldn't have to live like this, he said.\n\nand when accidents occur, diggers are on their own.\n\nlast year, after one digger's leg was crushed and another suffered a head wound in a mine collapse, nsenga was left to raise the hundreds of dollars for treatment from other diggers. the companies that buy the minerals rarely help, nsenga and other diggers said.\n\ndeaths happen with regularity, too, diggers said. but only mass casualties seem to filter out to the scant local media, such as the u.n.-funded radio okapi. thirteen cobalt miners were killed in september 2015 when a dirt tunnel collapsed in mabaya, near the zambia border. two years ago, 16 diggers were killed by landslides in kawama, followed months later by the deaths of 15 diggers in an underground fire in kolwezi.\n\nin kolwezi, a provincial mine inspector frustrated by a recent run of accidents agreed to talk to the post on the condition that he not be identified, because he was not permitted to talk to the media.\n\nhe met the journalists in a minibus — jumping in, closing the door and taking a seat in the middle, far from the tinted windows so no one on the street could see him.\n\nthat morning, he said, he had helped rescue four artisanal miners nearly overcome by fumes from an underground fire in kolwezi. the day before, two men had died in a mining tunnel collapse, he said.\n\nhe said he had personally pulled 36 bodies from local artisanal mines in the past several years. the post was not able to independently verify his claims, but they echoed stories from diggers about the frequency of mining accidents.\n\nthe inspector blamed companies such as congo dongfang that buy the artisanal cobalt and ship it overseas.\n\nthey don't care, he said. to them, if you bring them minerals and you're sick or hurt, they don't care.\n\ncongo dongfang responded that it had incorrectly assumed that these issues were the concern of its trading partners, who buy the cobalt from the miners and pass it on to the mining company.\n\nchild labor\n\nno one knows exactly how many children work in congo's mining industry. unicef in 2012 estimated that 40,000 boys and girls do so in the country's south. a 2007 study funded by the u.s. agency for international development found 4,000 children worked at mining sites in kolwezi alone.\n\nlocal government officials say they lack the resources to address the problem.\n\nwe have a big challenge with the children, because it is difficult to take them out of the mines when there are no schools for these children to go to, said muyej, the provincial governor. we have to find a solution for this.\n\n(twp)\n\nwhile officials and diggers acknowledge the problem of child labor, it remains a sensitive topic. children work not just in underground mines, in violation of congo's mining code, but also on the fringes of the cobalt trade.\n\nguards prevented post journalists from visiting areas where, according to local diggers, children often can be found working. at one point, the post saw a boy in a red sweatshirt struggling to carry a half-full sack of mineral rocks. another boy in a black soccer jersey ran up to help. kabwita, the digger, watched them.\n\nthey are just 10 or 12, he said.\n\nthe post also gave an iphone to a digger to capture video of how women and children wash cobalt ores together.\n\none of these children is delphin mutela, a quiet boy who looks younger than his 13 years.\n\nwhen he was about 8, his mother began taking delphin with her on her trips to the river to clean cobalt ores. washing minerals is a popular job for women here. at first, delphin was tasked with keeping an eye on his siblings.\n\nbut he learned to distinguish the loose mineral pieces that fell into the water during washing.\n\ncopper carried a hint of green.\n\ncobalt looked like dark chocolate.\n\nif he could collect enough bits, he could get paid, maybe $1.\n\nthe money i get i use to buy notebooks and so i can pay school fees, delphin said.\n\nhis mother, omba kabwiza, said this is normal.\n\nthere are many children there, she said. that's how we live.\n\nskyrocketing demand\n\ncobalt is the most expensive raw material inside a lithium-ion battery.\n\nthat has long presented a challenge for the big battery suppliers — and their customers, the computer and carmakers. engineers have tried for years to craft cobalt-free batteries. but the mineral best known as a blue pigment has a unique ability to boost battery performance.\n\nthe price of refined cobalt has fluctuated in the past year from $20,000 to $26,000 a ton.\n\nvideo: how lithium-ion batteries work lithium-ion batteries work much like other batteries — there's a positive electrode and a negative electrode, and the electrons move from one end to another, creating a charge. the difference is the materials inside, which make them lighter, longer-lasting and rechargeable. watch the video\n\nworldwide, cobalt demand from the battery sector has tripled in the past five years and is projected to at least double again by 2020, according to benchmark mineral intelligence.\n\nthis increase has mostly been driven by electric vehicles. every major automaker is rushing to get its battery-powered car to market. tesla's $5 billion battery factory in nevada, known as the gigafactory, is ramping up production. daimler aims to open a second battery plant in germany soon. lg chem makes batteries for general motors at a plant in holland, mich. chinese company byd is working on huge new battery plants in china and brazil.\n\nwhile a smartphone battery might contain five to 10 grams of refined cobalt, a single electric-car battery can contain up to 15,000 grams.\n\nas demand has grown, so has artisanal cobalt's importance in global markets. that became clear to everyone in the battery world two years ago, said kurt vandeputte, vice president of the rechargeable-battery materials unit at belgium-based umicore, one of the world's largest cobalt refiners.\n\ncobalt demand for lithium-ion batteries is expected to double by 2025 76,525 75,000 tons 50,000 32,657 25,000 2,698 0 2000 2015 2025 76,525 75,000 tons 50,000 32,657 25,000 2,698 0 2000 2015 2025 76,525 75,000 tons 50,000 32,657 25,000 2,698 0 2000 2015 2025 source: christophe pillot, avicenne energy\n\nthe cobalt price was falling, even as battery demand shot up. the price of lithium, another key battery material, was skyrocketing.\n\nit got so clear that artisanal mining was taking a big place in the supply chain, vandeputte said, adding that umicore buys only from industrial mines, including mines in congo.\n\nartisanal cobalt is usually cheaper than product from industrial mines. companies do not have to pay miners' salaries or fund the operations of a large-scale mine.\n\nwith cheap cobalt flooding the market, some international traders canceled contracts for industrial ores, opting to scoop up artisanal ones.\n\neveryone knew something was going on, said christophe pillot, a battery consultant at avicenne energy in france.\n\nat the same time, companies face growing scrutiny of their supply chains.\n\nconsumers demand accountability; companies respond with promises of ethical sourcing and supply chain due diligence.\n\none result of this increased scrutiny can be found in congo.\n\nin 2010, the united states passed a conflict-minerals law to stem the flow of money to congo's murderous militias, focusing on the artisanal mining of four minerals.\n\nbut this same diligence is not required when it comes to cobalt.\n\nchildren gather along the principal highway linking kolwezi and lubumbashi. diggers wait to be paid at the tilwezembe cobalt mine. the prices, based on weight and content, are written on a burlap sign. a digger gets ready to go into a mine shaft in kawama. residents stand outside of their homes in impoverished kawama. living conditions for miners and their families are harsh, with no electricity or running water.\n\nwhile cobalt mining is not thought to be funding wars, many activists and some industry analysts say cobalt miners could benefit from the law's protection from exploitation and human rights abuses. the law forces companies to attempt to trace their supply chains and opens up the entire route to inspection by independent auditors.\n\nbut while congo is a minor supplier of the four designated conflict minerals, the world depends on congo for cobalt.\n\nanalyst simon moores at benchmark said he thinks this is one reason that cobalt has so far been excluded.\n\nany crimp in the cobalt supply chain would devastate companies.\n\n'we sell this to the chinese'\n\nfor most artisanal miners in kolwezi, the global supply chain begins in a marketplace called musompo.\n\nthe 70 or so small shops, known as comptoirs, are stacked cheek by jowl along the highway that leads to the border. shop names are painted on cement walls: maison saha, depot grand tony, depot sarah. each shop has a handwritten board listing the going rate for cobalt and copper.\n\nat a shop named louis 14, the price list offered the equivalent of $881 for a ton of 16 percent cobalt rock. rock with 3 percent cobalt was worth $55.\n\nnearby, minibuses pulled up with white sacks of freshly mined cobalt to sell. more sacks arrived on bicycles loaded down like pack animals.\n\neach load was tested by a radar-gun-like device called a metorex, which detects mineral content. some of the miners said they do not trust the machines, believing them to be rigged, but they have no alternative. muyej, the governor, said he was looking for funds to buy a metorex machine so diggers could independently test their minerals. there are many shops in musompo, but diggers said the shops sold to the same company: congo dongfang mining.\n\nwe sell this to the chinese, and then the chinese take it to cdm, said hubert mukekwa, a shop worker shoveling cobalt.\n\nan asian man working at a comptoir, or counter, shop calculates a payment as creuseurs, or diggers, eagerly look on at the musompo market.\n\nin congo, it is illegal for foreigners to own a comptoir. but not a single shop visited by post journalists appeared to be run by congolese. asian men operated the metorex machines. they punched up the tallies on oversize calculators. they handled the cash — thick wads of congolese francs. and they often could be seen sitting in the back while congolese men carried the 120-pound sacks. none of the comptoir bosses would talk to the post.\n\nmukekwa finished filling up one sack.\n\nonce we have enough stock to take it to cdm, he said, we take it there.\n\nhe pointed at a large blue-walled compound in the distance.\n\nat a comptoir named boss wu, two congolese workers, in jumpsuits with cdm printed in block letters on the back, stood watching other men loading cobalt sacks onto a truck.\n\nlater, the post witnessed an orange truck loaded with cobalt sacks pulling away from musompo and onto the main highway.\n\nc24 was painted in blue on the truck's cab. the post followed c24 two miles up the highway, where it turned onto a dirt road running next to a tall brick wall. the truck continued on the road until it reached an entrance with armed guards and turned inside.\n\nthe facility with big blue walls was clearly marked cdm.\n\nit was at these same gates that cdm says its inspection of its supply chain had stopped, never extending to the mines or marketplace, said chen, the president of huayou cobalt, the parent company of cdm.\n\nwe, in fact, didn't know that much about who they bought cobalt from, chen said. now, we do due diligence.\n\ntracing your battery's cobalt the lithium-ion battery industry has a massively complicated supply chain. each consumer company has dealt with multiple suppliers — and their suppliers have dealt with multiple suppliers. this shows some of the connections within the industry. see companies' responses to washington post's investigation. mining small-scale mining by hand industrial

analysts.\n\nwhat the companies say\n\ncompanies, in response to the post's questions, sounded equally uncertain about their cobalt supply chain, illustrating how little is known about the sources of raw materials.\n\nbut expectations are different today, said lara smith of johannesburg-based core consultants, a firm that helps mining companies with this problem.\n\ncompanies can't claim ignorance, smith said. because if they wanted to understand, they could understand. they don't.\n\nlast year, cdm reported exporting 72,000 tons of industrial and artisanal cobalt from congo, making it no. 3 on the list of the country's largest mining companies, according to congolese mining statistics.\n\nand cdm is by far congo's top exporter of artisanal cobalt, according to analysts and the company.\n\ncdm ships its cobalt to its parent company, huayou, in china, where the ore is refined. among huayou's largest customers are battery cathode makers hunan shanshan, pulead technology industry and l&f material, according to financial documents and interviews.\n\nthese companies — which also buy refined minerals from other companies — make the cobalt-rich battery cathodes that play a critical role in lithium-ion batteries. these cathodes are sold to battery makers, including companies such as amperex technology ltd. (atl), samsung sdi and lg chem.\n\nall of these battery makers supply apple, providing power for iphones, ipads and macs.\n\napple said its investigation revealed that its batteries from lg chem and samsung sdi contain cathodes from umicore, which may contain cobalt from congo but not from cdm. apple said it thought its suspect cobalt was contained in atl batteries with pulead cathodes.\n\ni think the risks can be managed, pulead chief executive yuan gao told the post, adding that he believes the increased awareness is actually working, as everyone is monitoring everyone else along the supply chain.\n\natl also has supplied battery cells found in some amazon kindles, according to analysis by ihs, the global information company. atl declined to comment.\n\namazon.com, the company founded by post owner jeffrey p. bezos, did not directly answer the post's questions about potential connections to suspect cobalt. the company issued a statement, reading in part: we work closely with our suppliers to ensure they meet our standards, and conduct a number of audits every year to ensure our manufacturing partners are in compliance with our policies.\n\nmore from this series cobalt in congo workers, including children, labor in harsh and dangerous conditions to meet the world's soaring demand for cobalt. graphite in china there's a trace of graphite in many of today's consumer devices. in these chinese villages, it's in their water, inside their homes and on their food. lithium in argentina indigenous people are left poor as tech world takes lithium from under their feet.\n\nsamsung sdi, which supplies batteries for samsung, apple and automakers such as bmw, said that its own ongoing investigation has not shown any presence of suspect cobalt, although it does use cobalt from congo.\n\nsamsung, the phonemaker, provided the post with a statement saying that it takes supply-chain issues seriously but not addressing a potential connection to cdm. samsung buys batteries for its phones from samsung sdi and atl, among others, according to industry data.\n\nbmw acknowledged that some of the cobalt in its samsung sdi batteries comes from congo but said the post should ask samsung sdi for more details.\n\nlg chem, the world's largest supplier of electric-car batteries, said the company it buys cathodes from, l&f material, stopped using congo-sourced cobalt from huayou last year. instead, it said, huayou now supplies l&f material with cobalt mined from the south pacific island of new caledonia. as proof, lg chem provided a certificate of origin for a cobalt shipment in december 2015 for 212 tons.\n\nbut two minerals analysts were skeptical that lg chem's cathode supplier could switch from congo cobalt to minerals from new caledonia — or, at least, do so for long. lg chem consumes more cobalt than the entire nation of new caledonia produces, according to analysts and publicly available data. l&f material did not respond to repeated requests for comment. when the post asked lg chem to respond to claims that the numbers don't add up, lg chem did not answer the question directly, responding that it checks certificates of origin on a routine basis.\n\nlg chem also runs a michigan battery plant for one of its biggest customers, gm, which plans to start selling its electric chevrolet bolt later this year. lg chem said the michigan plant has never received congolese cobalt.\n\nanother lg chem customer, ford motor, said it has been told by lg chem that ford batteries have no history of cdm cobalt.\n\nmost tesla models use batteries from panasonic, which buys cobalt from southeast asia and congo. replacement batteries for tesla are manufactured by lg chem. tesla told the post it knows lg chem's tesla batteries do not contain congolese cobalt, but it did not say how it knows this.\n\ntesla, more than any other automaker, has staked its reputation on ethically sourcing every piece of its celebrated vehicles.\n\nit is something we do take very seriously, kurt kelty, tesla's director of battery technology, said in march at a battery conference in fort lauderdale, fla. and we need to take it even more seriously. so we are going to send one of our guys there.\n\nsix months later, tesla told the post it is still working on sending someone to congo.\n\nbirth defects, illness\n\nin lubumbashi, another center of congo's mining industry, 180 miles from kolwezi, doctors have begun to unravel what has long been a mystery behind a range of health problems for local residents.\n\ntheir findings point to the mining industry as the problem.\n\nthese doctors at the university of lubumbashi already know miners and residents are exposed to metals at levels many times higher than what is considered safe.\n\none of their studies found residents who live near mines or smelters in southern congo had urinary concentrations of cobalt that were 43 times as high as that of a control group, lead levels five times as high, and cadmium and uranium levels four times as high. the levels were even higher in children.\n\nanother study, published earlier this year, found elevated levels of metals in the mining region's fish. a study of soil samples around mine-heavy lubumbashi concluded the area was among the ten most polluted areas in the world.\n\nnow the doctors are working to connect the dots.\n\nwe are trying to draw a line between disease and metals, said eddy mbuyu, a university chemist.\n\nbut they are cautious about their task.\n\nthe mining business has the money, and that money means power, said tony kayembe, an epidemiologist at the university's hospital.\n\ncurrent studies are looking at thyroid conditions and breathing problems. but doctors are most concerned by possible connections to birth defects. one study the university doctors published in 2012 found preliminary evidence of an increased risk of a baby being born with a visible birth defect if the father worked in congo's mining industry.\n\nthe lubumbashi doctors also have issued reports on birth defects so rare — one is called mermaid syndrome — that they are the only cases ever known in congo. all occurred in children born in heavy mining regions.\n\nfor kayembe, the study that stood out most looked at babies born with holoprosencephaly, a usually fatal condition that causes severe, distinctive facial deformities. it is almost unheard of. entire medical careers pass without seeing one. but last year, doctors in lubumbashi recorded three cases in three months.\n\nthis is not normal, kayembe said.\n\nthese medical inquiries could bring some relief to residents such as aimerance masengo, 15, who has been blaming herself since giving birth last year to a baby boy with severe, fatal birth defects.\n\nin a voice barely above a whisper, aimerance recalled how she had been so scared when she saw her newborn. the doctor was scared, too, she said.\n\nthe doctor told aimerance it was impossible to know for certain what went wrong. but, he noted, the baby's father worked as a cobalt digger. he told aimerance he had seen many problems in the children born to diggers.\n\naimerance and the baby's father lived in the nearby village of luiswishi, home to 8,000 people. everyone there seemed to be connected to artisanal mining. and in the past three years, according to local activists, four newborns from this tiny village have died of severe birth defects.\n\na child throws a stone into the kapolowe river outside lubumbashi. environmentalists, doctors and activists say that the region's rivers suffer from severe pollution that they think is from the copper and cobalt mining throughout the area. catfish caught in the kapolowe river is offered to prospective customers near the river's banks. a study published this year showed elevated levels of metals in the mining region's fish. a digger works at the mine in kawama. most of the work is done with manual tools and with virtually no environmental or safety precautions. diggers wait for their pay at the musompo market.\n\nthe 'creuseurs' wait\n\nfor diggers such as sidiki mayamba, worried about affording flour for his family, the greatest concern is not safety or potential health problems. it is money. he needs the work. but he doesn't want his 2-year-old son, harold, to follow him into the mines.\n\na digger is a hard job with many risks, mayamba said. i cannot wish for my child to have this kind of job.\n\ncleaning up the cobalt supply chain will not be easy for huayou cobalt, even with the support of a powerful company such as apple.\n\nbut chen, huayou's president, said it is the proper action, not only for the company but also for the congolese miners.\n\nsome companies just want to get away from the problem, chen said. but congo's problem is still there. the poverty is still there.\n\nthe question is whether huayou's other customers, after years of buying cheap cobalt with no questions, will be supportive.\n\npyers, the apple senior director, said the company does not want to take steps aimed at just making the supply chain look pretty.\n\nif we all cut and run from the democratic republic of congo, it would leave the congolese people in a devastating position, pyers said. and we will not be a party to that here.\n\nstarting next year, apple will internally treat cobalt like a conflict mineral, requiring all cobalt refiners to agree to outside supply-chain audits and conduct risk assessments.\n\napple's action could have major repercussions throughout the battery world. but change will be slow. apple spent five years working to certify that its supply chain was free of conflict minerals — and that action was enforced by law.\n\nnone of these efforts change the fate of diggers such as kandolo mboma.\n\nat the tilwezembe mine this summer, mboma sat on a boulder, seemingly catatonic, his blue jeans stained black, his bare feet dangling just above the red dirt. his eyes failed to register the other diggers filing past.\n\nhe was working all night, and he has not eaten, a fellow digger said.\n\nmboma, 35 and a father of three, was waiting for his cobalt to be weighed. then, he hoped, he would get paid.\n\nhe sat next to a series of small food stalls, stout squares of discarded mining sacks stretched over sticks, where a digger could buy a bread roll for 100 congolese francs, equal to about 10 cents. the bread came with a free cup of water.\n\nyou eat what you make, mboma said finally.\n\nand eating would have to wait.\n\na creuseur descends into a tunnel at the mine in kawama. the tunnels are dug with hand tools and burrow deep underground.\n\npeter whoriskey in washington contributed to this report.
on tuesday evening, officials at the national health service in england recommended that hospitals cancel non-urgent appointments and operations in january to free up space for the sickest patients. it's estimated that this could affect 55,000 surgeries, such as hip and knee replacements. cancer surgeries and time-critical procedures should proceed as planned, officials said.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nseveral of britain's national newspapers featured the story on their front pages.\n\nbritons are fiercely proud of their national health service, but it is not uncommon for hospitals to face significant strain during the winter months when they don't have many spare beds and there is greater demand. last year, the british red cross called the situation a humanitarian crisis.\n\nthe latest recommendations extend those made in december that non-urgent operations should be canceled in the first two weeks of january.\n\nthe nhs providers, a trade association, said in a statement that many hospitals are dealing with unprecedented demand, because of an increase in flu and respiratory illness, the impact of norovirus and — in some places — primary care, including gps working at more than full stretch.\n\nad\n\nchris hopson, chief executive of nhs providers, tweeted that hospital leaders are creating extra temporary capacity, calling in staff to work extra shifts, delaying non urgent work. but this still means that, in some places, waiting times and care under real pressure. he also noted that the situation is similar to that of last year. nhs staff giving their all, once again. current approach not sustainable long term . . . but we said that last year! he tweeted.\n\nad\n\nsiva anandaciva, chief analyst at kings fund, an independent health charity, agreed that there was a creeping familiarity to the events. but what's different from previous winters, he said, was the political appetite for a national response. he said this was driven in part by a desire to meet targets for emergency room waiting times and also as a precautionary measure to free up capacity in case there is an outbreak of flu virus infections like there was in australia.\n\nhe said it was encouraging that the government was coordinating its response on a national level but that it was disappointing that they are only looking at how to get through the next few months, rather than addressing the underlying issues — like funding, staffing and social care issues.\n\nwe can't keep putting a sticking plaster on this problem, he said.\n\nsome health professionals also jumped on social media to discuss conditions. one doctor apologized for the 3rd world conditions of the dept due to overcrowding.\n\na nurse asked when it became normal to care for patients in corridors and waiting rooms.

a review of romney's interactions with trump since the beginning of 2011 — a period covering both men's presidential bids and romney's senate race — makes clear that romney's attacks on trump are well attuned to the political thermostat. when he wanted trump's support, for example in 2012, romney refused to criticize trump's birtherism — unlike his strong criticism of trump in summer 2017 after the president waffled on criticizing self-proclaimed white nationalists at a rally in virginia.\n\nin reviewing the past eight years of interactions between the two, we assigned a rough value for how warm or cold relations were between the two (an admittedly subjective analysis). roughly speaking, the periods in which romney has spoken most warmly about trump correlate to moments when romney was seeking political office to which trump might contribute. an exception was shortly after trump took office, when romney offered his support for trump's success.\n\nhere's how romney and trump's relationship has evolved.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmarch 2011\n\nin an interview on good morning america, in which he floated the idea of running for president, trump first raises questions about president barack obama's citizenship.\n\neverybody that even gives any hint of being a birther — a word you didn't use — even a little bit of a hint, like, gee, you know, maybe, just maybe, this much of a chance: they label them as an idiot, donald trump tells the network's ashleigh banfield when she asks whether he thinks obama was born in the united states. after insisting that he was not an idiot, trump explains his purported rationale:\n\nthe reason i have a little doubt — just a little! — is because he grew up, and nobody knew him. when you interview people — if i ever got the nomination, if i ever decide to run — you may go back and interview people from my kindergarten, they'll remember me. nobody ever comes forward. nobody knows who he is until later in his life. very strange. the whole thing is very strange.\n\nad\n\nad\n\napril 12, 2011\n\nthe day after announcing his 2012 candidacy, romney dismisses trump's birtherism in an interview on cnbc.\n\ni think the citizenship test has been passed. i believe the president was born in the united states, romney tells host larry kudlow, now a member of trump's administration. the man needs to be taken out of office, but his citizenship isn't the reason why.\n\napril 19, 2011\n\nmitt romney was a small business guy if you really think about it, trump says in an interview on cnn. he was a hedge fund. he was a funds guy. he walked away with some money from a very good company that he didn't create. … he'd buy companies; he'd close companies; he'd get rid of jobs.\n\nad\n\ni'm much bigger than this man and have a much, much bigger net worth. i mean my net worth is many, many, many times mitt romney, trump adds.\n\nad\n\napril 25, 2011\n\nhe's a terrific guy, and i wish him the very best, romney responds on fox news. i hope he runs. come on in, the water's fine.\n\nmay 2011\n\ntrump's theoretical presidential bid is submarined after gaining little traction in polls and after obama mocks him relentlessly at the white house correspondents' dinner.\n\non may 16, trump announces that he will not run.\n\nseptember 2011\n\ntrump and romney meet in new york. romney describes the meeting on morning joe:\n\nwe didn't eat lunch together, but we did spend time together, he says. i enjoy donald trump; he was colorful.\n\nad\n\nlate 2011\n\ntrump agrees to moderate a debate among the republican candidates hosted by the conservative site newsmax and slated for the end of december.\n\ndec. 6, 2011\n\nromney joins other candidates in declining to participate in trump's debate. unlike jon huntsman — who tells fox news that he was not going to kiss [trump's] ring, and i'm not going to kiss any other part of his anatomy — romney was polite.\n\nad\n\ni spoke with donald trump earlier today and indicated that we just can't make this debate, and we focus on the other two, romney tells fox. and, i will be campaigning. trump, he says, understood my perspective and wished me well.\n\ndec. 12, 2011\n\nad\n\ni'm surprised that mitt romney said no, trump tells msnbc. frankly, i'm surprised, because he really wants my endorsement. i mean, he wants it very badly.\n\nfeb. 2, 2012\n\nat an event in trump's hotel in las vegas, he offers romney that endorsement. the timing was important: the nevada primary was looming, and newt gingrich had surged in national polling. the endorsement itself probably didn't make much of a difference, though: romney won the state by 29 points over gingrich.\n\nthere are some things that you just can't imagine happening in your life, romney says, after trump hands it off to him. this is one of them. he goes on to say that being in trump's hotel and getting his endorsement is a delight.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmay 2012\n\nromney declines to disavow trump's comments about obama.\n\nyou know i don't agree with all the people who support me, and my guess is they don't all agree with everything i believe in, he says. but i need to get 50.1 percent or more, and i'm appreciative to have the help of a lot of good people.\n\n2012\n\nromney wins the nomination. trump endorses him repeatedly on twitter. romney loses the general election.\n\nshortly after the loss, trump blames romney for not using him more.\n\ndec. 27, 2012\n\ntrump criticizes romney's reaction to the loss.\n\nby early february 2013, he begins using romney as a foil to advance his own prospective political ambitions.\n\n2014\n\nad\n\ntrump repeatedly bashes romney on twitter and tells fox news's sean hannity that romney choked. he criticizes the affordable care act by calling it romneycare/obamacare.\n\nad\n\njanuary 2015\n\nas both he and romney flirt with 2016 runs, trump slams romney in iowa.\n\nthe republicans cannot be so stupid as to give him a second crack, because, honestly, he choked, trump says in an interview with fox news after that appearance. he wasn't able to get it done. he should have been able to get it done. there is no excuse for it. and you cannot give that person a second chance, unfortunately.\n\njune 16, 2015\n\ntrump announces his candidacy, immediately focusing on immigration and disparaging migrants from mexico.\n\nad\n\njuly 4, 2015\n\nromney is asked about trump's comments.\n\ni think he made a severe error in saying what he did about mexican americans, romney says.\n\njuly 18, 2015\n\ntrump says that sen. john mccain (r-ariz.) was not a hero because he was captured after being shot down over vietnam.\n\nad\n\nromney replies in a tweet.\n\nfeb. 24, 2016\n\nin an interview on fox news, romney suggests that trump is trying to hide something by not releasing his taxes.\n\ni think we have good reason to believe that there's a bombshell in donald trump's taxes. i think there is something there, romney says. the reason i think there is a bombshell in there is because every time he is asked about his taxes, he dodges and delays.\n\nover the next few days, he reiterates this idea in tweets. trump, on the same platform, mocks him.\n\nfeb. 29, 2016\n\nafter being endorsed by former ku klux klan leader david duke, trump declines to reject duke or the klan in an interview with cnn.\n\ni don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists, he tells the network's jake tapper. so i don't know. i don't know — did he endorse me, or what's going on? because i know nothing about david duke; i know nothing about white supremacists.\n\nad\n\nhe later blames his response on a faulty earpiece.\n\nromney attacks him for it.\n\nmarch 3, 2016\n\nas trump continues to win republican delegates, romney delivers an unusually potent speech attacking his candidacy.\n\n'let me put it very plainly, he says. if we republicans choose donald trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished.\n\nhe also targets trump's main selling point.\n\nlook, his bankruptcies have crushed small businesses and the men and women who work for them. he inherited his business, he didn't create it, romney says. and whatever happened to trump airlines? how about trump university? and then there's trump magazine and trump vodka and trump steaks and trump mortgage. a business genius he is not.\n\nhere's what i know, he says. donald trump is a phony, a fraud. his promises are as worthless as a degree from trump university. he's playing the american public for suckers: he gets a free ride to the white house, and all we get is a lousy hat.\n\ntrump responds.\n\nmarch 18, 2016\n\nromney endorses sen. ted cruz (r-tex.).\n\nnov. 8, 2016\n\ntrump wins the presidency. romney later reports that he wrote in a candidate for the presidency in lieu of voting for trump: his wife, ann romney.\n\nnovember 2016\n\nas trump puts together his cabinet, he meets several times with romney, purportedly to consider him as a candidate for secretary of state. the two are photographed somewhat awkwardly sharing a dinner at a restaurant at a trump hotel in manhattan.\n\nafter the dinner, romney says that the conversation was enlightening and interesting and engaging and that trump's picks for his administration gave him increasing hope that president-elect trump is the very man who can lead us to that better future.\n\nromney reportedly was asked to apologize for his rhetoric about trump during the campaign, an apology he refused to offer. trump gave the job to exxonmobil chief executive rex tillerson.\n\nearly 2017\n\nafter trump takes office, romney offers him his support, saying in a february interview that what people recognize is that he's doing what he said he'd do. i'm sure that's very encouraging to a lot of people. i think all of us, whether we are for him or someone else, have high hopes for our president.\n\nbut he also stands by his critiques: i expressed honestly what my belief was with regards to temperament and character.\n\naug. 19, 2017\n\nafter trump equates anti-racist protesters with self-proclaimed white nationalists and nazis rallying in charlottesville, romney calls for trump to change his tune.\n\nhis apologists strain to explain that he didn't mean what we heard, romney writes on facebook, calling it a defining moment for trump. but what we heard is now the reality, and unless it is addressed by the president as such, with unprecedented candor and strength, there may commence an unraveling of our national fabric.\n\ndecember 2017\n\ntrump visits utah for the first time as president, the red state that saw the most significant erosion for the republican presidential candidate between 2012 and 2016. during the visit, trump goes out of his way to praise utah sen. orrin g. hatch (r), against whom romney was rumored to be planning a primary challenge.\n\nin alabama, republican roy moore hopes to win a special election to serve in the u.s. senate — but his campaign is hobbled by allegations that he'd had inappropriate sexual contact with a teen girl several decades before. trump remains stalwart in his support for moore. romney, on the other hand, says that moore would be a stain on the gop and on the nation.\n\nno vote, no majority is worth losing our honor, our integrity, he writes on twitter.\n\nfeb. 16\n\nafter hatch announces that he plans to retire, romney announces that he will run for the utah seat.\n\ntrump endorses him.\n\njune\n\nafter romney easily wins the primary, trump tweets his praise for romney and his family.\n\nnov. 6\n\nromney wins election.\n\njan. 1\n\nas he prepares to take his position as utah's junior senator, romney writes an opinion essay for the post in which he excoriates trump — personally, if not on policy.\n\nas a nation, we have been blessed with presidents who have called on the greatness of the american spirit, romney writes. with the nation so divided, resentful and angry, presidential leadership in qualities of character is indispensable. and it is in this province where the incumbent's shortfall has been most glaring.\n\njan. 2
(illustration by eddie alvarez/the washington post; photos by jahi chikwendiu/the washington post, u.s. senate, dea and istock)\n\nin april 2016, at the height of the deadliest drug epidemic in u.s. history, congress effectively stripped the drug enforcement administration of its most potent weapon against large drug companies suspected of spilling prescription narcotics onto the nation's streets.\n\nby then, the opioid war had claimed 200,000 lives, more than three times the number of u.s. military deaths in the vietnam war. overdose deaths continue to rise. there is no end in sight.\n\na handful of members of congress, allied with the nation's major drug distributors, prevailed upon the dea and the justice department to agree to a more industry-friendly law, undermining efforts to stanch the flow of pain pills, according to an investigation by the washington post and 60 minutes. the dea had opposed the effort for years.\n\nthe law was the crowning achievement of a multifaceted campaign by the drug industry to weaken aggressive dea enforcement efforts against drug distribution companies that were supplying corrupt doctors and pharmacists who peddled narcotics to the black market. the industry worked behind the scenes with lobbyists and key members of congress, pouring more than a million dollars into their election campaigns.\n\nthe chief advocate of the law that hobbled the dea was rep. tom marino, rep. tom marino (r-pa.) donations received from industry, 2013 – june 2017: $92,500 president trump's nominee to be drug czar sponsored the ensuring patient access and effective drug enforcement act. a pennsylvania republican who is now president trump's nominee to become the nation's next drug czar. marino spent years trying to move the law through congress. it passed after sen. orrin g. hatch sen. orrin hatch (r-utah) donations received from industry, 2013 – june 2017: $177,000 the longest-serving republican senator, considered a staunch ally of the pharmaceutical industry. he sponsored the senate version of the bill.

(alice li/the washington post)\n\nfor years, some drug distributors were fined for repeatedly ignoring warnings from the dea to shut down suspicious sales of hundreds of millions of pills, while they racked up billions of dollars in sales.\n\nthe new law makes it virtually impossible for the dea to freeze suspicious narcotic shipments from the companies, according to internal agency and justice department documents and an independent assessment by the dea's chief administrative law judge in a soon-to-be-published law review article. that powerful tool had allowed the agency to immediately prevent drugs from reaching the street.\n\npolitical action committees representing the industry contributed at least $1.5 million to the 23 lawmakers who sponsored or co-sponsored four versions of the bill, including nearly $100,000 to marino and $177,000 to hatch. overall, the drug industry spent $102 million lobbying congress on the bill and other legislation between 2014 and 2016, according to lobbying reports.\n\n[tuesday update: trump announces drug czar marino will withdraw]\n\nthe drug industry, the manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors and chain drugstores, have an influence over

get congress to pass a bill to protect their interests in the height of an opioid epidemic just shows me how much influence they have.\n\nbesides the sponsors and co-sponsors of the bill, few lawmakers knew the true impact the law would have. it sailed through congress and was passed by unanimous consent, a parliamentary procedure reserved for bills considered to be noncontroversial. the white house was equally unaware of the bill's import when president barack obama signed it into law, according to interviews with former senior administration officials.\n\ntop officials at the white

neither justice nor the dea objected to the bill, removing a major obstacle to the president's approval.\n\nwe deferred to dea, as is common practice, he said.\n\nthe bill also was reviewed by the white house office of management and budget.\n\nneither the dea nor the justice department informed omb about the policy change in the bill, a former senior omb official with knowledge of the issue said recently. the official spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of internal white house deliberations.\n\nthe dea's top official at the time, acting administrator chuck rosenberg, former dea acting administrator chuck rosenbergformer chief of staff for then-fbi director james b. comey and former u.s. attorney in virginia and texas before he was appointed to head the dea in 2015. he resigned oct. 1. declined repeated requests for interviews. a senior dea official said the agency fought the bill for years in the face of growing pressure from key members of congress and industry lobbyists. but the dea lost the battle and eventually was forced to accept a deal it did not want.\n\nthey would have passed this with us or without us, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. our point was that this law was completely unnecessary.\n\nloretta e. lynch, who was attorney general at the time, declined a recent interview request.\n\nobama also declined to discuss the law. his spokeswoman, katie hill, referred reporters to botticelli's statement.\n\nthe dea and justice department have denied or delayed more than a dozen requests filed by the

now suing the justice department in federal court for some of those records.\n\nhatch's spokesman, matt whitlock, said the dea, which had undergone a leadership change, did not oppose the bill in the end.\n\nwe worked collaboratively with dea and doj . . . and they contributed significantly to the language of the bill, whitlock wrote in an email. dea had plenty of opportunities to stop the bill and they did not do so.\n\nmarino declined repeated requests for comment. marino's staff called the u.s. capitol police when the post and 60 minutes tried to interview the congressman at his office on sept. 12. in the past, the congressman has said the dea was too aggressive and needed to work more collaboratively with drug companies.\n\ndea officials redacted the information contained in the document above, which was obtained by the washington post under the freedom of information act, citing an exemption from the law that protects internal agency discussions. read the bill and other documents involved in reporting this story.\n\ndrug industry officials and experts blame the origins of the opioid crisis on the overprescribing of pain pills by doctors. the industry notes that the dea approves the total amount of opioids produced each year.\n\nindustry officials defended the new law as an effort to ensure that legitimate pain patients receive their medication without disruption. the industry had long complained that federal prescription drug laws were too vague about the responsibility of companies to report suspicious orders of narcotics. the industry also complained that the dea communicated poorly with companies — citing a 2015 report by the government accountability office — and was too punitive when narcotics were diverted out of the legal drug distribution chain.\n\nto be clear — this law does not 'decrease' dea's enforcement against distributors, said john parker, a spokesman for the healthcare distribution alliance, which represents drug distributors. it supports real-time communication between all parties in order to counter the constantly evolving methods of drug diversion.\n\nbut dea chief administrative law judge john j. mulrooney iidea chief administrative law judge john j. mulrooney iihead of the dea administrative court that handles pharmaceutical cases, he wrote a law review article sharply critical of the new law. has reached the opposite conclusion.\n\nat a time when, by all accounts, opioid abuse, addiction and deaths were increasing markedly the new law imposed a dramatic diminution of the agency's authority, mulrooney wrote in a draft 115-page article provided by the marquette law review editorial board. he wrote that it is now all but logically impossible for the dea to suspend a drug company's operations for failing to comply with federal law. the agency declined to make mulrooney available for an interview.\n\nlinden barber: a critical connection barber provided a critical connection

linden barberonce a dea lawyer who supervised cases against pharmaceutical companies, he left the agency and is now an executive at cardinal health. while at the dea, he helped design and carry out the early stages of the agency's tough enforcement campaign, which targeted drug companies that were failing to report suspicious orders of narcotics.\n\nwhen barber went to work for the drug industry in 2011, he brought an intimate knowledge of the dea's strategy and how it could be attacked to protect the companies. he was one of dozens of dea officials recruited by the drug industry during the past decade.\n\nbarber played a key role in crafting an early version of the legislation that would eventually curtail the dea's power, according to an internal email written by a justice department official to a colleague. he wrote the marino bill, the official wrote in 2014.\n\nbarber declined repeated requests for an interview.\n\nwith a few words, the new law changed four decades of dea practice. previously, the dea could freeze drug shipments that posed an imminent danger to the community, giving the agency broad authority. now, the dea must demonstrate that a company's actions represent a substantial likelihood of an immediate threat, a much higher bar.\n\nthere's no way that we could meet that burden, the determination that those drugs are going to be an immediate threat, because immediate, by definition, means right now, rannazzisi said.\n\ntoday, rannazzisi is a consultant for a team of lawyers suing the opioid industry. separately, 41 state attorneys general have banded together to investigate the industry. hundreds of counties, cities and towns also are suing.\n\nthis is an industry that's out of control. if they don't follow the law in drug supply, and diversion occurs, people die. that's just it, people die, he said. and what they're saying is, 'the heck with your compliance. we'll just get the law changed.' \n\nillustration by eddie alvarez/the

rannazzisithe former chief of the dea's office of diversion control, he is now a consultant to lawyers suing drug companies. came to dea headquarters as an outsider with an attitude. he worked as an agent in detroit, where he watched prescription drugs flood small towns and cities in the midwest.\n\nhundreds of millions of pain pills, such as vicodin and oxycodone, ended up in the hands of dealers and illegal users.\n\nrogue doctors wrote fraudulent prescriptions for enormous numbers of pills, and complicit pharmacists filled them without question, often for cash. internet pharmacies, supplied by drug distribution companies, allowed users to obtain drugs without seeing a doctor.\n\nthere were just too many bad practitioners, too many bad pharmacies, and too many bad wholesalers and distributors, rannazzisi recalled.\n\nrannazzisi, a burly, tough-talking long islander, was assigned to head the dea's office of diversion control. he had a law degree, a pharmacy degree and had spent years navigating the dea's bureaucracy.\n\nthe office was seen as a backwater operation whose 600 investigators had toiled for years over prescription drug cases with little or none of the recognition that went to those who investigated illegal street drugs like heroin or cocaine.\n\nrannazzisi brought an aggressive approach to the diversion control office.\n\nthe year he took over, linden barber d. linden barberonce a dea lawyer who supervised cases against pharmaceutical companies, he left the agency and is now an executive at cardinal health. was promoted to run diversion control's litigation office, which crafted the legal arguments that supported the team. he was a former army lawyer who served in iraq. the cadre of attorneys who worked for him saw him as a tough litigator unafraid of an influential industry.\n\nbarber and rannazzisi formed a powerful combination that the drug companies would learn to fear. early on he did really good work, rannazzisi said. he jumped into the internet cases when he first came here.\n\nafter shutting down the internet pharmacies, rannazzisi and barber pursued the pain management clinics that replaced them and soon became as ubiquitous in south florida as the golden arches of mcdonald's. to get there, drug dealers and users would take the oxy express down interstate 75.\n\nlines of customers coming in and going out, said

prescription filled, going back to wherever they're from.\n\nback home, each 30-pill vial of oxycodone was worth $900.\n\ndea officials realized they needed a new strategy to confront this new kind of drug dealer.\n\nthey weren't slinging crack on the corner, rannazzisi said. these were professionals who were doing it. they were just drug dealers in lab coats.\n\njoseph t. rannazzisi, seen here in

shows that the dea agreed to the bill with reluctance.\n\ndea felt this wasn't a great solution, but was the best of the options offered to us, even if it did not fully address the concerns we had previously laid out for you, she added, according to the email, which was provided by staff of sen. sheldon whitehouse (d-r.i.), one of the bill's co-sponsors.\n\nthe bill would also give drug

had given up the fight.\n\nthe senior dea official said the agency worked with congress to improve the bill under difficult political circumstances. the agency believed earlier versions of the bill would have forced it to meet a criminal standard before issuing immediate suspension orders. the original version of the bill was unworkable, the official said.\n\nthe congressional affairs office at the justice department told the white house office of national drug control policy that it no longer objected to the bill, according to botticelli, then chief of the office.\n\non april 19, obama

mulrooney,dea chief administrative law judge john j. mulrooney iihead of the dea administrative court that handles pharmaceutical cases, he wrote a law review article sharply critical of the new law. the chief dea administrative law judge, has been documenting the falling number of immediate suspension orders against doctors, pharmacies and drug companies. that number has dropped from 65 in fiscal year 2011 to six so far this fiscal year, according to the dea. not a single order has targeted a distributor or manufacturer since late 2015, according to mulrooney's reports, which were obtained under the freedom of information act.\n\nmulrooney said in his reports that the judges under him were handling so few cases at the dea that they began hearing the cases of other federal agencies.\n\nin his article planned for the winter issue of the marquette law review, mulrooney wrote: if it had been the intent of congress to completely eliminate the dea's ability to ever impose an immediate suspension on distributors or manufacturers, it would be difficult to conceive of a more effective vehicle for achieving that goal.\n\nmulrooney's article also criticized the law for allowing companies to submit corrective action plans before the dea could sanction them.\n\nhe likened that provision to allowing bank robbers to round up and return ink-stained money and agree not to rob any more banks.\n\nthe dea said in a statement last week that it is still pursuing reckless doctors and rogue businesses with a wide variety of tools.\n\nwe will continue fighting the opioid crisis and continue to use all the tools at our disposal to combat this epidemic, the statement said.\n\nsince the dea started to crack down on the opioid industry a decade ago, pharmaceutical companies and the law firms that represent them have hired at least 46 dea officials — 32 of them directly from the division. they include two officials who managed day-to-day operations; the deputy director of the division; the deputy chief of operations; and two chiefs of policy.\n\nafter nearly 30 years with the dea, matthew murphy, matt murphythe former chief of dea pharmaceutical

their two no. 1 hits — sincerely and sugartime — reflected the trio's sweet, earnest image. the sisters, who began singing in church in ohio during the 1930s, had an uncanny sense of timing and close harmony matched by a perky, ever-smiling stage manner.\n\nad\n\nthey were so close that they sometimes held hands as they sang or took their bows. yet the spotlight seemed to shine the brightest on phyllis mcguire, the youngest sister, who always stood in the center and sang the lead.\n\nad\n\nms. mcguire, who was 89 and the last surviving mcguire sister, died dec. 29 at her home in las vegas. her death was announced in a paid notice in the las vegas sun newspaper. the cause was not disclosed.\n\neven as musical tastes began to change, the mcguire sisters kept going strong. by 1960, each of the sisters was earning more than $1 million a year.\n\nafter a final appearance on the ed sullivan show in 1968, they parted ways. christine and dorothy were married and raising families. phyllis, who had been married once in the 1950s, was single and raising eyebrows.\n\nad\n\nrumors began circulating, and then were confirmed without apology by ms. mcguire, that she was the girlfriend of chicago mob boss sam giancana.\n\nthey had met in 1959, when ms. mcguire and her sisters were performing at the desert inn, one of the las vegas casinos run by giancana. who's the one in the middle? he reportedly asked.\n\nad\n\nms. mcguire, who had a weakness for the blackjack tables, ran up a debt of tens of thousands of dollars at the desert inn. giancana, watching from afar, told his casino boss to eat it — or forgive the debt.\n\nthus began one of the most unlikely romances in show business. giancana, who got his start as al capone's driver in chicago, was widowed, bald and in his 50s. he had been arrested dozens of times, linked to crimes from illegal gambling to murder, and had served time in prison.\n\nad\n\nms. mcguire was still in her 20s and had a public image as benign and carefully arranged as one of the mcguire sisters' hit songs. giancana sent her lavish gifts of jewelry and furs and often met her overseas, wherever the sisters were performing. strange as it may seem, everyone who knew them agreed they were in love.\n\nad\n\nit's amazing that it ever took place, william f. roemer jr., an fbi agent who tracked giancana for years, told the los angeles times in 1995. she had everything. she had beauty. she had money. yet, she fell in love with this gangster. i could never figure it out.\n\nin 1961, fbi agents wiretapped their room in a phoenix motel. later, after being questioned about giancana's activities, ms. mcguire pleaded ignorance. federal authorities asked her to cooperate, with the implicit threat that her career would be ruined if her affair with a mafia kingpin were exposed.\n\nad\n\nshe said she would, but she never did, roemer said. she never cooperated with us. she double-crossed us really.\n\nin 1965, ms. mcguire testified before a grand jury investigating giancana for racketeering. she admitted that they had a relationship and that she was aware of his reputation but maintained she knew nothing about his life of crime.\n\nad\n\nthe revelation really hurt our career, ms. mcguire told the chicago tribune in 1989. we were blacklisted for a while on tv. . . . we were america's sweethearts, and for one of america's sweethearts to be with that man . . . \n\ngiancana went to prison for a year in 1965, then lived in mexico and south america, where he was visited by ms. mcguire. he later moved back to suburban chicago and was cooking in his basement in 1975 when an assailant entered and shot him seven times in the head. the murder was never solved.\n\nad\n\ni just knew that i liked the man, ms. mcguire told the los angeles times in 1986. he was very nice to me. and if he had done all those things they said he did, i wondered why in god's name he was on the street and not in jail.\n\nphyllis jean mcguire was born feb. 14, 1931, in middletown, ohio, and grew up in the nearby town of miamisburg.\n\nad\n\nher father was a steelworker, and her mother was a minister. phyllis was 4 when she and her sisters began singing in their mother's church. (christine was five years older than phyllis, dorothy three years older.) before long, they were performing at weddings, revival meetings and the uso. they had a long engagement at a hotel in dayton, ohio, and appeared on radio and television.\n\nad\n\nin 1952, the mcguire sisters moved to new york and landed an eight-week engagement on kate smith's radio show. they later won a talent contest and were featured on arthur godfrey's popular tv show. their first top 10 hits came in 1954, with goodnight, sweetheart, goodnight and muskrat ramble, and sincerely reached no. 1 in 1955.\n\ntwo years later, they recorded sugartime, by charlie phillips and odis echols, which climbed to no. 1 in 1958 and became the sisters' signature tune:\n\nad\n\nsugar in the mornin'\n\nsugar in the evenin'\n\nsugar at suppertime\n\nbe my little sugar\n\nand love me all the time\n\neven before the sisters broke up in 1968, phyllis mcguire began working on her own, including an acting role in the 1963 frank sinatra film come blow your horn.\n\nad\n\nby 1985, the mcguire sisters were ready to launch a comeback, but they struggled to re-create the instinctive harmonies they had in their youth.\n\nwe rehearsed eight hours a day, five days a week for six months, phyllis mcguire told the tribune in 1989. then one day, after perspiring and toiling and worrying, we started rehearsing and all in the same instance we looked at each other and said, 'my god, thank you, that's it.' we had it back.\n\nwearing matching dresses and hairstyles, the sisters performed in nightclubs and concert venues until 2004. dorothy mcguire died in 2012, christine mcguire in 2018.\n\nphyllis mcguire's early marriage to neal van ells ended in divorce. after giancana's death, she was occasionally linked to wealthy men, but she never remarried and had no immediate survivors.\n\nad\n\nad\n\na 1995 hbo film, sugartime, starring mary-louise parker and john turturro, portrayed ms. mcguire's life with giancana. she denounced it as riddled with blatant inaccuracies, exaggerations and distortions.\n\nin 1999, after las vegas police stopped her limousine and questioned her driver, the 68-year-old ms. mcguire emerged from the car screaming, waving and flailing her arms and was arrested for head-butting and kicking a police officer. charges were dropped after a plea deal.\n\nms. mcguire was an astute investor, and it is widely believed that much of giancana's fortune came into her hands. she had a jewelry collection said to rival those of elizabeth taylor and philippine first lady imelda marcos.\n\nshe lived on one of the grandest estates in las vegas, in a house that contained, under its roof, a 40-foot replica of the eiffel tower and another of the arc de triomphe. steel shutters could cover the bulletproof windows with the touch of a button. she had five gardeners and a pond with black swans floating by.\n\nad\n\ni'm not ashamed of my past, she told vanity fair, describing everything from music to the mob. i was doing what i honestly felt.
so many decisive events occurred in late 1845 and 1846 that writer and historian bernard devoto called it the year of decision. countless individuals made innumerable decisions that, when they were all put together, added up to a single national decision: the united states' conquest of the west, and the establishment of a continental empire that would soon dominate the hemisphere and eventually the world.\n\nnow, 175 years later, the united states is the world's strongest military power and boasts the world's largest economy, but its future seems imperiled, with countless seemingly implacable, unsolvable political and social fractures. if the united states was just beginning its global ascent 175 years ago, then 2021 may mark the acceleration of its global demise. the norm-breaking presidency of donald trump and the country's disastrous response to the covid-19 pandemic are the most obvious symptoms of the country's internal rot, both of which in turn have only furthered u.s. divisions. although joe biden will assume the presidency in a few weeks having won seven million more votes than trump, the narrowness of his electoral college victory, coupled with trump's lies about voter fraud and his refusal to admit defeat, do not bode well for the coming year. tens of millions of trump voters do not believe biden won legitimately, and certain republicans have called openly for secession — a stance millions of the most die-hard trump voters probably support.\n\nthousands of people marched in support of president trump two days before the electoral college confirmed the 2020 election. (the washington post)\n\nyet, for would-be secessionists, the best model for their goals is not what we might think: southern secession in the winter and spring of 1861, which led to the creation of the confederacy and ignited the civil war. even most radical trumpian ideologues do not wish for a war that would cause hundreds of thousands of deaths and leave their secessionist dreams in ruins.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nrather, the model is the decade before that year of decision, 1846, when tens of thousands of white americans left u.s. borders to establish their own societies modeled on their own ideals. some went to the republic of texas, where they could legally obtain massive amounts of free land and own countless enslaved people without any northern antislavery opposition. some went to the idyllic climate of mexican california, where they could also claim (albeit illegally) massive amounts of free land, which would be worked by indian peons — in reality, another form of unfree labor. some americans went to the willamette valley in oregon country, where they could obtain a more modest amount of free land and have a local government that entirely prohibited slavery — while also prohibiting all black migration into the region. another group, the mormons, went to the salt lake valley, where they could practice their own version of christianity without harassment from the u.s. government or other americans.\n\nall of these groups and individuals embraced aspects of american history and culture that they celebrated, but they hoped to discard other aspects they abhorred. because they traveled to regions that were not under u.s. control, they were not secessionists but expatriates.\n\nnevertheless, 1830s expatriates and modern secessionists share a common goal: to be left alone, which will allow them to continue american practices they like, and discard those they do not. indeed, like the americans of the 1830s and 1840s, modern secessionists argue they are more american than the anti-american u.s. government. in their logic, it is not they who have betrayed american ideals, but the modern united states.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nyet, the events of 175 years ago also point to the reasons secession remains unfeasible, even if it somehow could occur peacefully and with the federal government's assent (a very big and unlikely if). the republic of texas controlled less than half the territory it claimed, beset from the west by powerful native peoples, particularly the comanche that raided texas with impunity, and from the south by a much larger and more powerful mexican republic. americans in california faced similar problems, battling against local mexican authorities and california's numerous native peoples. they initiated the bear flag revolt as a preemptive strike against what they believed would be mexico's imminent confiscation of their illegally obtained land. americans in oregon were more secure in the moment, outnumbering both natives and british settlers in the willamette valley, but if they tried to expand beyond this region then the threat of oregon's natives and the british empire would become much more acute.\n\nby declaring war against mexico and signing a treaty with britain, the united states essentially made texas, california and oregon much safer for american settlement (and, tragically, much less safe for native and mexican residents already living in these regions). white americans in these regions knew this, and they celebrated. as the governor of oregon proclaimed, we can … congratulate one another that we are again citizens of the united states. they were happy for their experiment in self-government to end.\n\nonly one group of americans disagreed. u.s. expansion caused headaches for the mormons, who had first chosen to go to the salt lake valley because it was an isolated, arid corner of far northern mexico. by the time they arrived in the region, however, it had been conquered by the united states in the u.s.-mexican war, a geopolitical foe they could not hope to challenge. britain, mexico, native people, or, for the, mormons, the united states itself: in 1846, it was impossible to be left alone.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nit is even more impossible in 2021. secession is a fantasy cruise that would invariably crash into the rocks of modern geopolitics.\n\nperhaps, then, the decision of 2021 will come from the center rather than the periphery of u.s. politics. in his book on 1846, devoto discussed one additional decision of that year that shaped the future united states. one hundred seventy-five years ago this coming august, a democratic congressman from pennsylvania named david wilmot took the floor in the house of representatives, where he proposed a bill, the wilmot proviso, that would prohibit slavery in any land acquired from mexico.\n\nwilmot himself was a virulent racist, concerned not that slavery was an atrocity against black americans, but that it would hurt free labor for white americans. yet, the bill nevertheless represented a principled stand against slavery, and it garnered additional support from other northern democrats whose party had long been more proslavery than the opposition whig party.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nsupported by both northern democrats and northern whigs, the wilmot proviso passed the northern-dominated house but died in the senate, where southerners enjoyed equal representation. despite its failure, the proposal nevertheless reopened the politics of slavery and was the first step in events that led the united states down the path toward southern secession, the civil war, the emancipation of enslaved people and the reconstruction amendments that ended slavery, and secured civil and political rights for freedmen. in the end, a better united states emerged, but not until americans endured the bloodiest conflict in their history.
which means these republicans are launching an extraordinary challenge while safe in the knowledge that their actions won't actually change the outcome of the election. in other words, these republicans are trying to have it both ways: appease the outgoing president, but do it in a way that won't actually overturn the results as he wants.\n\nad\n\nhere's a primer on why a historic number of gop challenges to half a dozen or so state results this week won't change biden's win:\n\nad\n\ncongress doesn't have the votes to overturn one state's results, let alone the several states trump would need to win. even with the extraordinary number of republican lawmakers saying they will challenge results, a majority of senators (republicans and democrats) and a majority of house lawmakers (led by democrats) are expected to vote those down. sen. john thune (s.d.), the no. 2 senate republican, has said those challenges are going down like a shot dog. overturning states' free and fair elections is not something a majority of members of congress want to be known for.\n\nthere's also no legal basis for senators to question the electoral college results, since all the states that are in trump's crosshairs met every legal requirement for having their electoral votes recognized by congress. election law says congress has to treat states' results completed by the safe harbor deadline of dec. 8 as conclusive. all states have met that. this 1880s election law that allows lawmakers to challenge a state's electoral results was predicated on a state providing two competing groups of electors. not a single state is offering that.\n\nthis challenge is more reminiscent of a recent supreme court case where texas tried to get the justices to throw out the election results, conveniently, in the swing states that trump lost. instead, the court threw out the case.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbut that was precisely the reason that the majority of house republicans signed onto a brief urging the court to undo those election results. certainly some truly believed there was enough fraud (which the trump campaign has been unable to prove) to get the highest court involved. but the lawsuit garnered so much republican support because it was a relatively low-risk thing to do in this high-stakes effort to deny the winner of a presidential election. the lawsuit was never going to go anywhere, and a number of republicans knew that.\n\njust the same way that many republicans know that this final challenge to biden's win won't succeed.\n\nthat's not to say having it both ways is a win-win for these lawmakers. there are potential political downsides to their gamble that trumpism is here to stay even after trump is gone. in the short-term, it may insulate these lawmakers from a trumpian primary challenger in the next two years. but what happens if trumpism fades, before or after the 2022 elections? these lawmakers are staking out a historically radical position to challenge legitimate election results without any actual evidence of widespread fraud. they're putting their necks out there, and it's not an easy position to take back if the political tide suddenly turns.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nalso unhelpful is the all-out battle this has created in the republican party. other republicans have declared these challenges by their colleagues dangerous, anti-conservative and even undemocratic. i could never have imagined seeing these things in the greatest democracy in the world, sen. mitt romney (r-utah) said of his colleagues in a statement. has ambition so eclipsed principle? an intraparty split may not directly affect some of these republicans, but it doesn't help the party long term, especially in a closely divided senate or even one that democrats manage to control by winning georgia's two senate runoffs this week.\n\nnone of this is to dismiss the weight of what these lawmakers are doing. challenging the electoral results isn't just symbolic, as some have tried to frame it. now that the ball is in their court, a large number of elected lawmakers are taking concrete action to stop biden from being president, without offering any evidence.
considered a pioneer in weathercasting, coleman enjoyed a 60-year career in television. he worked at stations in peoria, omaha, milwaukee and chicago from the 1950s to early 1970s. he was seen as an innovator, the first to broadcast his entire weathercast in front of a green screen.\n\ni remember watching him as a kid in chicago, and was fortunate enough to get to know him as a colleague, tweeted tony pann, broadcast meteorologist at wbal in baltimore. he was the inspiration for me to get into this business.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin the 1970s, coleman became the first weathercaster on abc's morning news program. john revolutionized television weather with his good morning america reports where he creatively used chroma-key and actually gave highly accurate and comprehensive weather, wrote mike smith, senior vice president at accuweather enterprise solutions.\n\ncoleman started the weather channel in 1981, serving as its president and chief executive. he co-founded the network with joseph d'aleo, its first director of meteorology, and media entrepreneur frank batten, sr.\n\nthirty five years ago john coleman and others founded the weather channel to answer a demand for around-the-clock weather information, said the weather channel in a statement. we will forever appreciate his vision that we continue to this day as the demand for severe weather coverage and hyper-local forecasting is at an all-time high.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nafter coleman's stint at the weather channel, he returned to local broadcasting, working at local affiliates in new york and chicago, before moving to affiliate kusi in san diego until his retirement in 2014.\n\ncolleagues and viewers described coleman as a gifted, high-energy and upbeat presenter, who formed a strong bond with his viewers.\n\n#johncoleman had so much charisma, passion about weather that i had no choice but to join @weatherchannel way back in 1982, tweeted chris edwards, now a meteorologist in detroit.\n\nover the past 15 years, coleman became a vocal doubter of human contributions to climate change and opposed actions to address the challenge. as recently as december 2017, he wrote, there is no significant man-made global warming at this time, there has not been any in the past and there is no reason to fear any in the future.\n\ncoleman's stance on climate change was far out of step with mainstream science. in 2014, the weather channel distanced itself from its founder on the issue. [h]e hasn't been with us in 31 years, said then-chief executive david kenny on cnn. so he's not really speaking for the weather channel in any way today.
between the two events, we think the odds of getting at least one inch of snow in the d.c. area has risen to at least 30 percent and we are introducing our snow lover's crystal ball. this probability could rise (or fall) as the forecast comes into better focus.\n\nthe first chance of snow: thursday night\n\nmodels have reached a consensus that light snow will affect portions of the area starting thursday night and lasting into early friday.\n\nad\n\nmoisture will be limited and temperatures, forecast to be near freezing, will be marginal for snow accumulation since the ground won't be that cold.\n\nad\n\nthis event's snow potential is between a coating and an inch or so of snow, with the highest amounts in our colder suburbs, west and north of the beltway. locally higher amounts cannot be ruled out in one of those small-scale bands that are difficult to forecast.\n\nwe will need to watch the event's timing. right now, any snow is most likely to occur in between the thursday evening and friday morning commutes. but any shift in the timing could mean the snow that falls would have a greater effect.\n\nthe second chance of snow: friday night into the weekend\n\nthis event has greater snow potential than the thursday night event but is trickier to forecast and could end up missing the region.\n\nad\n\nthe storm in question is predicted to pass to our south, making its closest approach to the d.c. region saturday.\n\nits forecast has a lot of uncertainty because it is farther out in time and models present different predictions. some keep the precipitation well to our south while others spread snow into the area friday night into saturday.\n\nad\n\nif snow reaches the area, models agree it will be sufficiently cold for the snow to accumulate. arctic air (highs 30 to 35, and lows in the 20s) will have already been in place for about 36 hours.\n\nthe big bone of contention is how far north the storm and its area of precipitation will track and how quickly it will strengthen. the models still are waffling from run to run in their forecasts.\n\nad\n\nthe most we can say now is there still is a chance of snow and the potential for some accumulation especially south and east of the city if the more aggressive models are correct.\n\nthe last several gfs runs have kept the saturday event well to our south. today's model run held forecasting the northern edge of the snow well to our south but forecasting a decent snowstorm for portions of georgia and the southeast.\n\nthe canadian (below) and european models, which kept the storm well to our south jan. 2, nudged it back northward clipping our area with light snow on today's run.\n\nthe european model now suggests several inches could fall in southern maryland (southern calvert and st. mary's counties) with about an inch in d.c.\n\nthe ukmet model's predicted surface and upper pattern suggests even more snow farther north than the european model.
nick mullins is a founder of breaking clean, an environmental communications firm. he blogs at thethoughtfulcoalminer.com.\n\nbefore going to work as an underground coal miner, i worked for a subcontractor installing large mine-ventilation fans throughout the appalachian coal fields. my co-workers were a rough sort. some had worked as underground miners, while others had known only industrial construction or demolition. several of them abused pain medications.\n\ni was not a user, so they would ask me if i'd turn them in. my typical response: do what you want to do, but if i catch you high on the worksite, or operating a piece of equipment, i'll make sure you never work here again.\n\n(monica akhtar,erin patrick o'connor/the washington post)\n\nmy attitude did not change after i began working in a mine closer to home just outside clintwood, va. the company i worked for, one of the largest in the region, had a zero-tolerance drug-abuse policy. but the problem was still apparent. we would lose a few co-workers with each random drug test, and stories abounded about smaller mines in neighboring states losing entire work crews.\n\nsome may judge me for not turning people in. but before i rushed to judgment, i considered the reasons they were addicted, and how they were living.\n\ncoal mining is one of the most dangerous jobs in the united states. according to the u.s. bureau of labor statistics, underground bituminous coal miners are three times more likely to suffer serious injuries and illnesses than workers in any other private industry.\n\nmany of those i worked with who were abusing were not pill heads. they had weighed a difficult choice: take pain medication to be able to continue to work, or risk fighting for disability compensation that's seldom enough to pay the bills. those taking medication on the job were often ashamed of their dependency. in many cases, they avoided working in positions that could get someone hurt.\n\nmine regulatory agencies have made efforts to reduce the problem, encouraging coal companies to work with miners facing addiction and requiring mandatory drug testing. few miners will seek help, however, fearing that admitting a drug problem would ensure a pink slip when layoffs came down the line. even if they decided to risk entering a recovery program offered by the company, good treatment is hard to come by in our area.\n\nin clintwood, there is only one rehabilitation-detox facility around. it is an hour away, accepts only private insurance or direct payment, is perpetually booked, has lengthy waiting periods, and keeps a few beds available for those taken into custody by law enforcement. the only treatment alternative is a methadone clinic a similar distance away, where the addiction is switched over and controlled. again, the patient must have private insurance or pay out of pocket.\n\nif a miner does manage to get clean, he still has to work every day with pain. it is a dire situation based on economic dependency, and sadly, it has spread far beyond the mining industry and deep into our local communities.\n\nwith recent reports showing that many millions of pain pills have been shipped into appalachia by pharmaceutical companies, evidence is building that the abuse epidemic is not entirely the fault of the addicted. not only has wall street benefited from the trillions of dollars of coal reserves that have been mined here, but it is also continuing to exploit us, reaping profits from the poverty and human suffering left in the wake of a century of coal extraction.\n\nover the past three decades, i have seen many lives destroyed by this epidemic, including a relative who committed suicide, multiple classmates who fatally overdosed, and many more broken families dealing with their addicted loved ones. if we are to end this problem, we need not only the regulations and facilities to deal with it, but also hope for a future free from the dominance of coal.
the invitation stated that i would provide wine, beer, mixers, garnishes and desserts, and invited guests to bring one appetizer and any other beverage they might prefer. most brought their own wine, some brought their own desserts, and some brought several things.\n\ntherefore, there was way too much food left over, and most of what i had provided in the way of wine, beer and desserts remained untouched. i can't help but think of the unnecessary expense — something i dislike along with excess. so, am i being too picky and unrealistic expecting people to follow what i thought were clear instructions?\n\nad\n\nad\n\nif you want to assert the host's privilege of controlling the menu, the way to do so is to provide all the refreshments. it is not by ordering takeout from your guests, as if this were a cooperative party that you had all agreed upon giving together.\n\nmiss manners realizes that such demands are often made. it has gotten to where other hosts complain that guests often show up with unrequested food and insist upon it being served, thus sabotaging the host's efforts. (miss manners advises them to accept these offerings as presents for their future use, and whisk them out of sight.)\n\nbut you should realize that to solicit offerings is to cede control. people will then bring what they find easiest or they want to consume themselves. and many of them tell miss manners that they are not thrilled to accept an invitation only to find that it is, as you worded it, an invitation to contribute to the larder.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ndear miss manners: i co-hosted a business function, an appreciation dinner for about 50 of our customers. the invitees wore traditional office attire, as did i. the invitations did not specify dress.\n\nto my dismay, my male co-host arrived in a tuxedo. i know this was obviously improper, but as my co-host is also my superior, i had no idea how to handle the situation. while i realized he looked like a boob, my concern was what to say when asked by several guests, oh, am i underdressed? is this black tie?\n\nin most instances, this was said with a laugh, so i didn't know if they were sharing the joke, or if they were truly uncomfortable in thinking that they had underdressed.\n\nad\n\nis there something i could have said? i know my superior thought himself quite the dandy, so i know it will happen again next year. all i had to offer them was a rather lame, you look just great! can i get you something to drink?\n\nad\n\ntry as she will, miss manners can think of no way you can rescue someone who is determined to dress improperly: oh, it's just that his new year's eve party went on rather long and he didn't have time to change?\n\nso you were right not to address the matter, but to treat the guests' remarks as if they were serious and offer them some offhand reassurance and a change of focus.\n\nnew miss manners columns are posted monday through saturday on washingtonpost.com/advice. you can send questions to miss manners at her website, missmanners.com.
so you take a look at other countries, pakistan is there, they should be fighting. but russia should be fighting, the reason russia was in afghanistan was because terrorists were going into russia, they were right to be there, the problem is it was a tough fight and literally they went bankrupt, they went into being called russia again as opposed to the soviet union.\n\nwell, where to begin? for starters, the syntax is so mangled one could be genuinely skeptical he was saying anything more than, russia. afghanistan. give it to putin.\n\nbeyond the incoherence is the horrifying realization that trump endorsed the soviet invasion of afghanistan, an action regarded for decades as inimical to interests of the united states and the free world. (you'll recall for 45 years we opposed the invasion of independent states by an expansionist communist dictatorship.) former ambassador to russia michael mcfaul reacted with horror, as any informed public figure likely would:\n\nthis strikes me as a typical trumpian word salad that reveals his sketchy and inadequate grasp of the geopolitics of afghanistan, says former ambassador to turkey, eric s. edelman. the soviet union went into afghanistan to prop up one faction of the people's democratic party of afghanistan (pdpa) against another. their invasion catalyzed the existing islamist opposition to the pdpa but i digress. (in other words, trump's claim russia went into afghanistan to stop terrorist attacks is flat-out wrong.) edelman adds, simply put he has no idea what he is talking about.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nif you want to try making sense of the gobbledygook, let's start with the biggest logical inconsistency. if afghanistan brought down the soviet union — and virtually no credible historian or policy expert would deny it played a part nor argue it was the sole cause — why would russian president vladimir putin go back in?\n\ni am glad trump brought up the end of the soviet union, however. the u.s.s.r. didn't magically change its name; the west won the cold war (until this president) through a combination of a sustained military buildup, strategic alliances, coercive diplomacy and moral clarity — all things trump has abandoned with the exception of military funding (although it is far from clear this reflects any coherent national security strategy). putin views the fall of the soviet union as a great calamity and seeks a low-cost means of reestablishing russia as a great power, which trump unfortunately has aided and abetted, most recently by handing syria to russia and its ally iran.\n\nmore to the point, why is trump handing off chunks of the world — syria, afghanistan, the sea of azov — to america's greatest international foe? (some think it's a payoff for 2016 election help; others attribute his moves to protection of personal finances.) and where does this giveaway stop — at the baltics? at berlin? (it's stunning that hawks such as sen. tom cotton (r-ark.), who'd melt down if president barack obama had said any of this, remain dependable sycophants for a president aiming to destroy the world order they too used to defend.)\n\nad\n\nad\n\ntrump's latest blather actually provides insight into his real thinking. his policy is not america first — as in america leads the world and creates conditions to our benefit. rather it is, russia first as long as we can pull up the drawbridge, extinguishing robust trade and legal immigration. if ronald reagan's response when asked how the cold war would end was, we win, they lose, trump's is: putin wins. let's bury our heads in the sand.\n\neliot a. cohen, perhaps the most insightful and tenacious trump critic on foreign policy, wrote recently for foreign affairs, the president has outlined a deeply misguided foreign policy vision that is distrustful of u.s. allies, scornful of international institutions, and indifferent, if not downright hostile, to the liberal international order that the united states has sustained for nearly eight decades. he explains, the real tragedy, however, is not that the president has brought this flawed vision to the fore; it is that his is merely one mangled interpretation of what is rapidly emerging as a new consensus on the left and the right: that the united states should accept a more modest role in world affairs.\n\nin short, at a time when we should fortify alliances, enhance diplomacy, bolster foreign aid, draw clear distinctions between democracies and authoritarians, and expand trade, we are doing the opposite, which merely encourages the go-it-alone voices on the right and the we-can-do-no-good-anyway voices on the left.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwe should be worried, as cohen points out, that trump is not merely incoherent but also choosing decline for america. perhaps his outbursts are an expression of something deeper and more consequential: a permanent shift, among american leaders, away from the dominant postwar conception of u.s. foreign policy. . . . trump's foreign policy vision would amount to a doctrine—one in which the united states is merely one great power among others. in this view, washington should pursue its own interests, stand for freedom chiefly at home and only intermittently abroad, and reject as a matter of principle the international organizations that previous generations of u.s. leaders so carefully built.\n\nthe result of trump's inanities and the world view it represents will be more aggressive foes (both nation states and terrorist groups); the decline of friendly, liberal democracies as belligerent authoritarian regimes emerge; a world economic system dominated by china; a less dynamic american economy; the re-creation of ungovernable havens for terrorists (as was the case before 9/11); nuclear proliferation; and unabated climate change. it's not a world any of us should want to live in.\n\nread more:\n\nad
republicans should end their assault on health care and join us to do the right thing for the american people, house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) said in announcing the jan. 9 vote.\n\nad\n\nthursday's authorization was part of a collection of rules the house adopted to guide its operation in the new congress. it gives pelosi permission to intervene in the texas court case and allows the chamber's counsel to work on the litigation.\n\nad\n\nnow we have the ability of our speaker to stand up for the american people and fight for the health care they so desire, said rep. sheila jackson lee (d-tex.), who called her state the poster child for uninsured americans before the aca.\n\nthe house maneuver came hours after a coalition of democratic attorneys general appealed the ruling by u.s. district judge reed o'connor that the aca is invalid — launching a process thursday that could bring the law before the supreme court for a third time.\n\nad\n\nthe appeal, to the u.s. court of appeals for the 5th circuit, begins the case's path through the judiciary after o'connor agreed last weekend that the law would remain in effect in the meantime.\n\nthe appeal by 16 states and the district of columbia consists of a single paragraph that lays out the legal steps to this stage. but california attorney general xavier becerra, leading the opponents of the decision, and other coalition members heaped barbed words on the ruling, contending it is reckless, ludicrous and based on a flimsy legal theory, as various attorneys general put it.\n\nbecerra, a former house member who voted for the aca in 2010, said the ruling threatens the entire health-care system.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nat a white house cabinet meeting thursday, president trump declared, that case from texas should win in the supreme court.\n\nthe appeal comes nearly three weeks after o'connor issued a friday-night decision concluding that all of the aca is invalid because of a recent change in tax law. his reasoning hinges on the fact that a massive tax bill, passed by congress at the end of 2017, included a provision that eliminates an aca penalty imposed on americans who did not comply with the law's requirement that they have health insurance.\n\nthe case involves a lawsuit filed a year ago by a score of republican attorneys general, who argued that without the penalty the aca's insurance mandate was no longer constitutional, because it no longer grew out of congress's taxing authority. the suit then argued that the insurance requirement could not be legally separated from the rest of the sprawling statute, and thus all of it was invalid.\n\nad\n\nad\n\no'connor agreed, writing in his opinion that the coverage mandate is essential to and inseverable from the remainder of the aca.\n\nin their conference call thursday, the democratic attorneys general disputed that. it is simply verging on ludicrous to suggest that the issue of taxability cannot be severed from the rest of the aca, said oregon attorney general ellen rosenblum.
fifty years after this passenger-train service debuted to connect new york and new orleans, the arrival of the crescent can still stoke a sense of excitement at its 31 stops, including tuscaloosa.\n\nbut the show may be winding down.\n\nthis fall, amtrak halved the crescent's daily service and that of its other long-distance routes to three trips a week, citing the long-term impact of covid-19 on ridership. while the railroad suggests it could resume daily service as soon as next summer, amtrak leaders have been outspoken for more than a year about their desire to remove long-distance trains such as the crescent from the schedule.\n\nironically, despite amtrak's reasoning, i had chosen to ride the crescent from washington to hattiesburg, miss., in september because of the coronavirus. train travel, after all, offered what a plane or a bus could not: the ability to separate myself from other passengers — to create an extreme form of social distancing — as we traveled south.\n\namtrak offers coach seating and sleeper-car accommodations on its trains. i had traveled long distance on amtrak by coach before, and i found the experience echoed all the worst qualities of air travel. in a roomette, by contrast, i hoped that little would distract me from reading, reflecting and writing, and that i would get a good night's sleep. while the price was steep — at $802 round trip, it was double the cost of a coach seat — i felt that, during a pandemic, seclusion was worth it.\n\nbooking the ticket was easy, but on the platform at union station, i discovered that i didn't know where to get on the train. amtrak had assigned me to a specific roomette when i booked the ticket, but the train markings didn't connect with what i held in my hand.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nfortunately, the amtrak employee i asked for help turned out to be the attendant for my car, claude mitchell. i climbed aboard, and he walked me to my roomette.\n\ni dropped my bag and took a look around at my quarters for the coming day. it didn't take long: the roomette is 3½ feet wide by 6½ feet long, and it is amazingly engineered to provide everything one needs: two facing, reclinable chairs that come together to form a bed roughly twin size; a second bed that drops from the ceiling at bedtime; a toilet, sink and mirror; one electrical outlet; a foldout writing or game table; air-conditioning vents; reading lights; and a cubby above the car hallway where luggage may be stashed.\n\namtrak markets the roomette as just enough space for two people to stretch out and sleep. however, i came to believe that a companion would've made the space feel confining during covid times, when stepping into the hallway or walking the train is less inviting.\n\nfor roomier accommodations, one would need to step up to a bedroom with double the width (but the same length); each sleeping car has three of these, one a wheelchair-accessible room. the bedrooms, which cost $1,530 round trip, feature a shower, contained in a separate water closet, both of which the roomette lacks. (there is a shared shower for the roomette at the rear of the car.)\n\nad\n\nad\n\nas i began to settle in and the train left washington, my attention turned to the windows — the roomette has upper and lower panes that run the length of the room, letting in plenty of light and a view. i enjoyed watching alexandria and manassas slide by as we headed toward the shenandoah valley.\n\nsoon, mitchell stopped by to take my dinner order. one adjustment amtrak has made during the pandemic is serving meals in sleeping-car passengers' quarters, rather than having people come to a dining car at mealtime. food and nonalcoholic drinks are included with the cost of the sleeper, a minor factor that also helped sway me into paying the surcharge.\n\ni chose braised beef with polenta and green beans, green salad, a dinner roll, a chocolate brownie for dessert, and a soda. the food was quite tasty, with the entree arriving hot and the salad cool and crisp. still, i did recognize that this was a premade meal heated up on the train, a step down from the dining-car experience available on my previous long-distance trips on amtrak.\n\nthe sun set while i ate, and i realized that the prettiest part of the crescent's trip — going through the shenandoah and blue ridge mountains — would take place in darkness. i was disappointed but not surprised: this is common on long-distance train trips, an unavoidable part of the deal, since amtrak leases the tracks from others and therefore has to operate on their schedules, rather than one of its own that prioritizes passengers.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmitchell came by one last time for the night, this time to make up the bed. automatically he began to set up the lower bunk — flattening the chairs into a seamless mattress and then lowering the upper bunk slightly to grab bedding. i'd stepped into the hallway to give him the space he needed, but when i heard the sound of the upper bunk sliding back up, i realized i'd need to tell him that i had decided to spend this trip sleeping in the top bed.\n\nhe handled the change in direction smoothly, and a few minutes later, he was all done. my using the upper bunk meant that the chairs were still available for me to sit in before bedtime, although the headroom was now significantly limited. i read for about an hour, sipping on the complimentary nightcap beer, before lowering the room temperature and climbing into the upper bunk around 10 p.m.\n\ni awoke around 1 a.m. to realize a couple of things: the room was now colder than amtrak's bedding — a sheet and a blanket — could compensate for, and the ride was pretty bumpy. i wondered if the top bunk felt more of the train's sway than the lower bunk would have — if mitchell was doing me a favor with how he originally set up the bed. (on the return trip, i slept in the lower bunk, and indeed, it was a smoother ride. lesson learned.) i groggily did what i could to adjust the temp, and as i began to fall off again, i watched salisbury, n.c., come and go.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwhen i woke up for good in the morning, i realized that climbing down in a sleepy state is not as easy as climbing up. i had to scoot toward the end of the bunk, reach for a handhold, and then take four steps down. the next-to-last is a big one, and thankfully the handhold helped me avoid a nasty tumble.\n\ni masked up and stepped into the hallway, where mitchell rounded a corner, spied me and offered a hearty good morning. ready for breakfast? he asked, looking far more chipper than i felt before my morning coffee. yes, breakfast would be lovely.\n\nas with dinner the night before, there was no shortage of food: an egg sandwich, oatmeal, yogurt, orange juice and, oh my, yes, coffee. soon after i finished breakfast, the train pulled into atlanta for what would be the longest stop of the trip.\n\nad\n\nthis provided a chance to get fresh air and walk the platform. i noted how amtrak set up the crescent: two engines, followed by three coach cars, the cafe car, two sleeping cars and a combination luggage car and crew quarters in the rear. as i strolled, i saw dozens of passengers step off the train and head for the station. my sleeping car had been about half full before atlanta; afterward, i saw only one other passenger in my car who was still heading south.\n\nad\n\nin the competition to move people around the country, not many passengers, and certainly not enough, are choosing amtrak. of its 15 long-distance routes, the crescent ranked 10th in ridership in the 2019 fiscal year, with 295,000 riders — or roughly 400 per trip per day — costing amtrak $36 million more than it brought in. in fact, each of the long-distance routes, even the beloved auto train to florida, lost money that year.\n\nclearly this is no way to run a railroad, and amtrak has announced a plan that involves doing away with sleeping cars after already changing dining cars to cafe cars. competing with airlines on price and offering shorter trips is how the carrier sees the future of train travel in the united states. congress, which contributes a mighty portion of amtrak's revenue, holds a different view, so the debate continues.\n\nwith the stop in atlanta over, we got underway again, and for the first time, i began to feel the confines of the room. the diversions i had brought — a book, surfing my phone, journaling — were less appealing, and i tried going to the cafe car for a change of perspective. during the pandemic, though, seating in the car was closed to coach passengers, and the sleeper-car side was effectively so, with train staff using the space as a break room.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ni contented myself with collecting another coffee from the car's canteen. there was no option but to return to my room, where the only available change in perspective was to swap seats and ride backward for a while.\n\nthe rest of the way, the crescent slowed noticeably, and at several points, the train stopped on a siding so the track's owner, norfolk southern, could send a freight train slowly past. this is one of the bigger annoyances of train travel: the delays that build up mile by mile through no fault of anyone on the train. the crescent has been described as one of the tardiest trains in the amtrak system, and it certainly appeared from my round trip that this southernmost leg, especially from birmingham, ala., to new orleans, accounted for most of the delays.\n\ni tried to content myself with sightseeing. we passed a historical landmark, sloss furnaces, just outside birmingham, and lovely small towns such as the aforementioned tuscaloosa and laurel, miss., which, i learned from the internet, is the home town for an hgtv show.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe stop after laurel was mine, and i started packing up. we pulled into hattiesburg about 45 minutes behind schedule. before saying goodbye to the crescent, i tracked mitchell down and thanked him for looking after me.\n\nlater i would learn that, a decade ago, amtrak honored claude mitchell for sustained excellence. his commendation read, in part, having greeted thousands of strangers boarding the train, claude makes sure they all leave feeling like a part of the amtrak family.\n\njust so. the crescent had offered more than a way to get from point a to point b. it also lived up to my need for an oasis from the world. its coronavirus precautions kept me safe and healthy, while its crew completely satisfied me with their service.\n\nad\n\ni would gladly ride another long-distance route on amtrak. if, that is, one remains available to ride.\n\nad\n\nbutterworth is a freelance writer based in rockville, md.
we have such a chasm between rhetoric and reality, said martina vandenberg, founder of the human trafficking legal center, a network of attorneys who take on trafficking cases. this administration is undermining protections carefully built for trafficking victims over two decades.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe advocates are especially alarmed by increased scrutiny of t visas, which provide temporary legal status for immigrants who can prove they were trafficked while in the united states.\n\nat least eight organizations declined invitations to the summit because of their opposition to the administration's policies. three of those groups told the washington post they feared backlash over their decision, so they cited conflicts with other events.\n\ni don't think any of us have the desire to be a part of a photo op, vandenberg said.\n\ntrump is scheduled to be joined at the event by vice president pence, attorney general william p. barr and ivanka trump, who has embraced the eradication of human trafficking as one of her causes. earlier this month, the president's daughter visited two residential facilities for trafficking victims in atlanta. she praised her father's dedication to the trafficking issue, calling it a modern form of slavery.\n\ntrump repeatedly brings up human trafficking when discussing immigration policy, and in 2018, he became the first sitting president to attend a meeting of the federal trafficking task force since its creation in 2000.\n\nivanka trump has advocated anti-trafficking legislation, including a law intended to strengthen prosecutors' ability to go after websites that host advertisements for commercial sex. she wrote about these efforts and others in a 2018 op-ed in the washington post, invoking abraham lincoln and the abolitionist movement.\n\nnow, the president's daughter and adviser is the face of the event intended to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the trafficking victims protection act, which established trafficking as a federal crime, and identify new strategies to attack the problem.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ni am honored to stand with the president as we convene federal, state, local and tribal leaders, alongside survivors, employers and advocates to ensure that we see the end of the crisis of human trafficking once and for all, she said in a statement.\n\none of the survivors planning to attend the summit is courtney litvak, who met with ivanka trump at the white house in november.\n\ni told her, 'i wouldn't be sitting here if i didn't think you are a doer. i can't keep having these conversations,'  litvak said. i need action to happen.\n\nthe 21-year-old is among the advocates grateful for the administration's efforts and for the chance to dispel the misconception — sometimes perpetuated by trump himself — that victims of human trafficking are frequently bound, gagged and dragged over borders into the united states.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe reality is much different. advocates who assist foreign-born victims say the majority of them immigrated legally using tourist or work visas and were exploited once in the united states. but most trafficking victims are u.s. citizens, like litvak, whose high school friends in katy, tex., introduced her to the person who became her trafficker.\n\nother groups planning to attend the summit include shared hope international, selah freedom, the national center for missing and exploited children, and house of cherith, one of the facilities ivanka visited in atlanta.\n\ndealing with an issue such as trafficking should always rise above partisan politics and tap into the best of all people as we work together to end this tragic reality, said bruce deel, house of cherith's founder.\n\nthose boycotting the event say partisan politics are already involved. the trafficking victims protection act also established the visa for immigrants who were forced, defrauded or coerced into prostitution (sex trafficked) or physical work (labor trafficked). in 2016, the processing time for a t visa application took an average of nearly eight months. today, u.s. citizenship and immigration services (uscis) estimates applicants must wait 19½ to 26½ months to find out whether they will receive their visa.\n\nduring that time, they are unable to work and unable to get medical care, said suamhirs piraino-guzman, a trafficking survivor who helps victims in washington state apply for the visa. we are talking about years where people are just stuck.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhis program has 130 people from 35 countries waiting to find out whether they will be granted one.\n\npreviously, there was no risk for them to apply for a t visa. but in 2018, uscis announced that applicants who were denied t visas could be summoned to immigration court to begin deportation proceedings.\n\nwe hear time and time again: why would i risk myself? why would i risk my family? said deborah pembrook, a trafficking survivor who helps t visa applicants in california.\n\nafter the change, the number of people applying for the visas, including victims and their immediate family members, dropped 23 percent.\n\nfor those who do apply, the chance of being denied is significantly higher.\n\nad\n\nduring president barack obama's eight years in office, nearly 6,800 people applied for a t visa, and more than 5,000 were approved in that period, uscis figures show. since trump took office in 2017, more than 4,000 people have applied, but just 1,745 have been approved.\n\nad\n\nin fiscal year 2019, when uscis received 1,242 t visa applications, just 500 were granted — the smallest count since 2010, a year in which only 541 people applied.\n\na spokeswoman for the agency said its policies for approving t visas have not changed and that those who meet the criteria for the visa are still granted one.\n\nanti-trafficking advocates say the visa situation exacerbates the fear and uncertainty their clients are already experiencing because of policy changes at the border and raids by immigration and customs enforcement, leaving them more vulnerable to continued exploitation and more hesitant to come forward.\n\nad\n\neach change in isolation is problematic but not destructive, said jean bruggeman, the executive director of freedom network usa. it's when you take them all together that these individual policy shifts add up to a disregard or worse toward immigrant survivors.\n\nad\n\nbruggeman said the administration's approach was on display last year, when the department of housing and urban development was poised to distribute a $13.5 million grant for housing for human-trafficking victims. bruggeman said that when organizations asked for clarification on whether the grant could serve noncitizen victims, hud updated its call for applications to confirm the money could be used for immigrants, too.\n\nfive days later, there was another update: the grant was canceled.\n\nad\n\nfollowing questions from reporters and intervention from lawmakers, the website changed again to reflect that the grant had merely been postponed. administration officials say that it was transferred to the justice department and that the funds, though delayed, are now available.\n\nafter learning that multiple trafficking organizations were declining their invitations, officials defended the president's record and said trump's new budget will propose additional funding for justice department investigations, prosecutions of human-trafficking cases and state and local organizations that aid trafficking victims.\n\nad\n\nadvocates expect the administration to announce more initiatives and funding at the summit. eager to hear what those changes would be, bruggeman said she initially rsvp'd yes to the event.\n\nbut after hearing the president would attend, and that some of her most prominent colleagues would not, she changed her mind.
if that storm develops to our south — say, just off the carolinas' coast — we will likely see snow. if it develops north of the district, we will either get rain or be entirely dry.\n\nthe last couple of model runs have trended toward the former scenario — that the low will form to the south, enhancing the chance of snow. however, even if that happens, snow is not a guarantee; it could actually end up being too far south and east to provide us with any precipitation.\n\nhere's a rundown of what the crystal-ball weather models are telling us today:\n\nlast night and this morning, the european model suggested a wednesday snowstorm with a strong upper-level trough and a surface low that develops just off the carolina coast.\n\ntoday's global forecast system model suggests a period of light snow tuesday but puts the main storm too far east of the north carolina coast to give us meaningful snow. however, the upper-level trough looks strong enough that it needs to be watched closely.\n\nthe differences between the light dusting (or even no snow) gfs solution and the snowy european one is not that great. both models have very similar upper-level patterns, with a strong, deep upper system approaching the coast wednesday. the main difference is the gfs develops the low with the upper system a little later and farther off the coast than the european.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe european also has a much better defined coastal trough that would help spread the precipitation to the north. subtle changes in the position of the low will markedly change the forecast. right now, either solution is possible.\n\njust the fact that we're expecting an east coast low next week means the snow threat has increased. on top of that, we're going to have an arctic air mass in place — the one that's arriving literally overnight and will push lows down into the teens this weekend.
adapted from an online discussion.\n\nhi, carolyn: my husband and i are expecting, and we would really like to keep our baby off social media. we obviously won't post pictures ourselves, and our parents agree with our preference. however, i'm not sure how we deal with other relatives and friends who might post pictures.\n\nif it's only one or two here and there, i don't want to make a big deal about it, but i also don't want to set a precedent of being okay with it. is there a way you suggest telling people our wishes without sounding controlling? i'm sure people will try to be respectful, but it's the first baby in the family so everyone is also excited.\n\nexpecting\n\nexpecting: the best way not to sound controlling is to figure out what you most want and need to control, and to let everything else go — because if you're announcing expectations on facebook exposure, sugary foods, preferred colors, acceptable toys, screen time, music volume and shoes in the house (and you don't have special health circumstances to justify it all), then, well, you get what you get.\n\n(nick galifianakis/for the washington post)\n\npregnancy is a good time to form general priorities, because you have time to think while you await your baby's birth, but expect the reality of your child — and of the number of fronts on which your relatives and friends push back against your preferences — to force adjustments on the fly. some parents end up adopting strategies that don't even resemble their original intent; the goal is to be flexible in setting priorities and focused in living by them.\n\nso. facebook. mention to anyone taking the baby's picture that you don't want the photos online until s/he is old enough to consent to it. for those who don't hear this and post an image, ask kindly for them to take it down or change their privacy settings (assuming that's okay with you, that a just-family, closed group has access).\n\nand, like i said, stay loose on the less meaningful stuff.\n\nre: baby: when we sent an email announcing our baby's birth, we said that baby was feeling a little shy and didn't want to be seen or mentioned for the time being. people have respected the request.\n\nanonymous\n\nre: baby: what we said was, we are not posting pictures of the baby on facebook, but we can invite you to see pictures on (fill in the blank). this can be a dropbox, a blog, a password-protected site . . . we found a service that is specifically designed for that. this will let people know you don't want pictures posted while also allowing them to see your little one, which is what they really care about.\n\nof course, my mother-in-law posted pictures on facebook anyway after we specifically told her not to, and we had to ask her to take them down. some people will truly not care what you feel about it, and you just have to roll with it.\n\nanonymous 2\n\nanonymous 2: the alternate means of sharing is an elegant solution, thanks.
conan currently airs on tbs four nights a week. while at the consumer electronics show in las vegas, turner chief executive john martin told thewrap that tbs is planning to retool the show to a weekly series, though there's no word on when it will change. his reasoning was that there's too much competition in late-night tv, and that while o'brien is holding his own among the many hosts, airing only once a week could benefit the show.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nlater on thursday, reilly and conan executive producer jeff ross both reiterated that there will be no changes for a while — and o'brien isn't going anywhere.\n\nthere is no deal. there is no decision. and nothing is going to happen in '17, ross told vulture, adding that they have talked with the network about multiple ways the show could evolve, since four nights a week is challenging when o'brien does so many remote segments.\n\nreilly echoed similar thoughts to the hollywood reporter, and emphasized how important o'brien is for the network, given that he also executive produces shows for tbs and has become the face of comic con. he also mentioned o'brien's huge online audience with viral videos.\n\nad\n\nthat's the part we're trying to figure out; how does that all work together? reilly said. the media landscape is changing and a guy who can toggle in back and forth between a number of different platforms, how does that all work together and how does that become formalized?\n\nad\n\nthanks to the glut of late-night shows on broadcast and cable, it has become increasingly difficult for hosts to break through. what does it mean that there are literally more talk-show hosts than active jurors in america right now? o'brien joked to the washington post in an interview last year. as a result, o'brien doubled down on the unique aspects of his show, such as remote bits and traveling around the world for special episodes (something that martin told thewrap is o'brien's sweet spot).\n\nwhile the weekly format does help certain late-night shows (hbo's last week tonight with john oliver, tbs's own acclaimed full frontal with samantha bee), it would be a first for o'brien. a former simpsons writer, he was a surprise choice to take over nbc's late night with david letterman in 1991 when letterman went to cbs. o'brien has been one of the most prolific names in late-night tv ever since. he had his brief stint as host of the tonight show in 2009 before that famously ended in controversial fashion with jay leno returning to the program. then it was on to tbs in november 2010, where he has become the longest-reigning host in late-night.\n\nad\n\no'brien — whose contract with tbs expires in late 2018 — has made headlines in recent years for his viral videos, such as one in which ice cube and kevin hart taught his staffer how to drive, as well as his episodes from places around the world, including cuba, armenia and berlin. in the early part of last year, as o'brien averaged about 734,000 viewers a night (as compared with shows like the daily show with 1.4 million viewers and the highest-rated, the tonight show, with 3.6 million), network executives looked for ways to capitalize on o'brien's many online viewers.\n\nad\n\nwhen conan goes out of the country, people quote bits of his — clearly they have not watched at 11 on tbs, network president kevin reilly told the post. we don't know if, ultimately, a show evolves more of that and less of a formatted talk show.\n\n(this post has been updated.)\n\nhe likes to dance. he likes to travel. he likes to make jokes about his hair (and other people's hair, too). these are just three of conan o'brien's favorite things.

the washington post gathered stories of creative teaching from throughout the washington region. the anecdotes collected below do not represent everyone's experience, but they highlight notes of grace — and offer sparks of hope.\n\n'everyone's got laundry!'\n\nas the weeks of online learning stretched into months, art teacher abigail dillingham was struggling.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nshe kept thinking about the projects cut short by the pandemic: the crown-wearing dinosaurs her kindergartners would never finish painting. the cityscapes her second-graders would never finish crafting.\n\ndillingham, who teaches at james k. polk elementary school in alexandria, was also concerned about her students' lack of engagement — so few were completing the assignments she emailed to parents. she couldn't be sure whether her kids were uninterested or whether they lacked the necessary pens, paper and crayons at home.\n\nthat's when she spotted it, shared on an online forum for art teachers: someone had twisted the contents of their laundry basket into an imitation of the mona lisa. dillingham laughed aloud.\n\nad\n\nlaundry art! kids could convert heaps of their family's clothes into whatever fanciful landscapes they desired.\n\nad\n\nnobody should ever be penalized or put at a disadvantage for the supplies they don't have, dillingham thought to herself. but everyone's got laundry!\n\nshe set up a camera in her living room, grabbed her most recent load — all grays, blues and browns, her preferred palette — and sat on the floor for over an hour, shaping the clothes into vincent van gogh's the starry night. after editing the video several times, she crossed her fingers and hit send on yet another email.\n\nmaliah peaches was one of the kids on the other end of that message. maliah's favorite class is art, because she loves to draw and paint: pictures of princesses and inventions, mostly.\n\nbut maliah had been sad since school closed in march, missing her friends and her art teacher. her mother, marie peaches, was worried about the formerly upbeat kindergartner.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nnow, marie bent over the computer screen, confused. laundry art? she read. what is this?\n\nbut when she turned to look at her daughter, she was gone. seconds later, maliah reappeared, tottering down the stairs armed with her father's freshly cleaned clothes and her sister's pants. within minutes, she had arranged the laundry into a large flower, its petals formed from socks — and stuck a favorite barbie, dr. moopsy, alongside it.\n\nthe barbie was smelling the flower, marie remembered later.\n\nno, mommy, she is taking care of the flower, maliah interrupted. she's going to water it.\n\nplaying with her family's laundry marked the first time maliah seemed happy — actually happy — since the start of the pandemic.\n\nad\n\nand she wasn't the only one: dillingham received far more student submissions for laundry art than for any other project. the teacher treasured every one, although she was especially impressed by the boy who turned his pile of clothes into a unicorn.\n\nad\n\nmaliah hopes she can make laundry art again soon. she already knows her next subject: the pyramids of egypt, set against a desert background.\n\nshe has promised herself she'll visit one day, when she's grown up — and when the pandemic is over.\n\n'it was a leap of faith'\n\nwhen schools closed in march, alex clark's students at dunbar high school in northwest washington were just beginning to understand the benefits of their physical education class. clark, who works after-hours as a fitness instructor at a trendy exercise studio in the district, was teaching his music-blaring, high-intensity workout class to his high school students. he took his students on field trips to fitness studios in the city. they loved it.\n\nad\n\nso during a virtual spring semester, he posted workouts to his instagram page so students could participate whenever they wanted.\n\nad\n\nbut it wasn't the same, and he knew some students were starting to lose interest.\n\ni did not want to lose the momentum, clark said.\n\ntwo dunbar students were fatally shot this past summer, and clark wanted to ensure that his students had a way to connect with one another, to boost their mental health. he looked for activities that could keep them away from the often high-crime neighborhoods where many dunbar teenagers reside.\n\nhe decided he would take his students on socially distanced bike rides across the city. it was a leap of faith. i got extremely nervous. i was trying to find a way to connect with kids, clark said.\n\nad\n\nclark started an online fundraiser to pay for bikes. he raised more than $10,000, and neighbors donated dozens of bikes and helmets for the rides. the club became part of clark's nonprofit organization, prime ability, which connects students from low-income families to fitness opportunities outside of sports like football and basketball.\n\nad\n\nand students came for the bike rides. and more students. it became so popular that students brought friends and siblings from other schools. at times, more than 50 students showed up. volunteers from the city also came to help make sure the large group stayed safe on the ride.\n\nevery monday, wednesday and friday afternoon, they biked to a different neighborhood in d.c. they rode trails through the city that many students never knew existed. when clark wanted to teach them about resilience, he took them through the hilly streets of georgetown.\n\nad\n\nif you bring your whole neighborhood and we have enough bikes, that's awesome, clark said. anything that can keep you away from something that can tempt you to do something that can impact the rest of your life.\n\nnow that it's winter and the sun sets early, clark has stopped doing the weekly rides. but he's found other ways to keep his students engaged and cycling the city. he invited students to a weekly entrepreneurship class for which they rode their bikes uptown from dunbar to the gym where clark works, sweat dc. the students met with the owner of the gym and the owners of a nearby bar, hook hall, and the bagel shop call your mother deli to learn what it takes to run a business.\n\nlast month, he helped his students fulfill their required community service hours. a group bicycled from dunbar to pick up food at call your mother deli, which they then transported on their bikes to martha's table, the charity and volunteer center in southeast d.c. during a holiday season in the middle of the pandemic, they distributed food to residents in need.\n\ntop-secret mission\n\nfrom the first day of all-virtual music classes at whitehall elementary school in bowie, md., april shawyer used props. she invented themes. and on the video clips she uses to kick off her class, she cast herself as a detective, wearing dark glasses and peering around corners.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwho's ready for this week's top-secret mission? she asks, as adventure-evoking music pulses in the background.\n\nthe mission changes week to week, but shawyer, 37, keeps up the idea that she and her young students are musical detectives, in search of learning. she teaches most grade levels and the school chorus.\n\nwe have a lot of fun, she said.\n\none recent week, the mission was winter music. shawyer led a first-grade class via zoom — a challenging platform for musicians — as they pretended to pull on hats and boots and bundle up in big coats.\n\nshe introduced vivaldi's winter from the four seasons, and she and her first-graders used scarves and ribbons and towels — whatever they had at home — to move expressively like the wind and sleet of a snowstorm.\n\nthat was the way into the next idea: she wanted them to create their own composition, their own snowy-day song.\n\nad\n\na week or so later, they had uploaded rhythm and pitch compositions inspired by their snowy-day experience to a platform called flipgrid.\n\neach child started with a grand introduction to their piece, as if they were giving a recital.\n\nthey love that part, shawyer laughed, saying she tries to keep it playful and keep her students moving. in lessons for older students, some days there were makeshift drums involved or recorders that students had taken home.\n\nshawyer has been a teacher for 14 years, the last six in prince george's county. she has children of her own, sons ages 2 and 7, and has led sessions on creativity in online learning for other teachers\n\nwe are making it work, she said. i knew it was going to be challenging. i wanted the kids to look at this as a mission we would accomplish together.\n\n'the treehouse teacher'\n\nevery workday around 7:50 a.m., nellie williams slips her computer into a bag, grabs a thermos of coffee and bids her husband goodbye: honey, she says, i'm going to work.\n\nthen williams, a 48-year-old sixth-grade teacher in northern virginia, walks out the door and into her backyard. she plods through grass for 150 feet — followed by her cat stewart and two white and fluffy great pyrenees dogs named pearle and gilligan — before climbing into what passes for her classroom in 2020: her daughters' decade-old treehouse.\n\nnearly halfway through the school year, the novelty really hasn't worn off yet, williams said. this is my 20th year teaching and i absolutely never experienced anything like this.\n\nstill, she has embraced it: williams has taken to calling herself the treehouse teacher, a nickname that caught on immediately among her students.\n\nnowadays, she leads all her social studies and language arts video classes for haycock elementary school from up among the trees, with the animals splayed on the porch. she enters the treehouse at 8 a.m. and, apart from an hour-long break for lunch — which she eats in the house with her husband and daughters, ages 16 and 19 — does not leave until 5:30 p.m., meaning she navigates the short distance home in the dark.\n\nat the start of the year, williams held virtual parent-teacher conferences from the treehouse, prompting amazement from some mothers and fathers. and, early on, she was able to use the treehouse as a key part of her lessons.\n\ni talked about how we're all in a different location than we're used to being in this school year, williams said. i said, 'here's my space, here is how it's unique and different. i want you to tell me about your space and how you can make it your own.' \n\nthe idea emerged over the summer. around the time it became clear that fairfax county public schools would start the year all-virtual, she and her husband invited friends over for a socially distant dinner. one friend pointed up at the treehouse and said, that should be your classroom.\n\nthe next day, williams and her husband drove to home depot for supplies. they had a lot of work to do: the treehouse was unfinished and had grown dilapidated through years of disuse.\n\nthey installed new flooring and added insulation. williams painted the walls ballet-slipper pink, a reminder of childhood ballet lessons. she lugged a bookshelf, desk and heater into the 5-by-7-foot space, and ran an ethernet cable from the house so she'd have internet.\n\nthere have been a few irritants — a chipmunk invasion, a wayward bee, moments when pearle or gilligan wouldn't stop barking — but overall, williams loves teaching in the treehouse, she said.\n\nit is my own little nook in which i can focus, not on what's around me, but on my teaching, she said. plus i need the separation of work and home.\n\nnext semester, williams said, she plans to add a zip line: then i can zip home.\n\nstaying hands-on\n\neven though school is all-\n\nremote in montgomery county, teacher kevin daney tries to get his students away from computer screens. he figures kids at walter johnson high school in bethesda spend enough time that way for other subjects.\n\nbesides, technology education classes are often hands-on. i want to make it as real as i can, he said.\n\nso as one class studied architecture this fall, daney, 54, encouraged them to walk in their neighborhood to take photos of houses of different styles: ranch, colonial, victorian.\n\nkevin daney, a teacher at walter johnson high school in bethesda, md., shared how his students designed their dream houses for a class project. (kevin daney)\n\nas another lesson focused on engineering drawings, he had them working with old-fashioned plastic floppy disks to measure, draw and scale up.\n\nand he stuck with his usual method of helping students learn about the design process, asking them to prepare a meal. they started with ideas and research, made a plan, carried it out and evaluated it. the result: soups and pastas and pastries.\n\ncan you assign this more often? one parent asked him at back-to-school night.\n\nsometimes daney tells his class stories — about his time in the peace corps in zimbabwe, about his tendency to get flat tires, about his wife making bagels from scratch. one day recently, he said, he stopped himself and asked if the class was interested.\n\none student told him it was his favorite part of the day.\n\nkids need connection, he said. i think they're starving for conversation, including with adults.\n\nwith learning all-virtual, he packs a big ziploc bag — for each student, each quarter — with things like fishing line, foam board, pipecleaners, magnets, popsicle sticks and rubber bands. whatever they will need for their projects.\n\ni love designing and building stuff, and i get to teach what i love, he said. people don't realize the cognitive thinking and the problem-solving you have to do when you make something.\n\na teacher for 30 years, daney has worked in montgomery county's public schools for two decades. his wife is a teacher, and they have two children.\n\nas the holidays approached, one of daney's classes was building a geodesic dome house using straws, pipecleaners and foam board.\n\njust before winter break, they displayed their creations.\n\ni was totally happy, he said. everybody had something to show, and they looked really good.\n\ntaking robots home\n\nwhen schools closed in march, catherine moessner's fourth-grade math students had just started a robotics session in partnership with the university of maryland. the students were supposed to use their fourth-grade math skills to program spherical robots, small enough to fit in their hands, to move.\n\nbut students went home, the robots stayed at powell elementary in northwest washington, and the computer programming lesson was canceled.\n\nin the fall, moessner had the same students, but now they were fifth-graders. she didn't want them to completely miss out on the robots lesson that the pandemic took from their fourth-grade year. so she decided to use the robots for fifth-grade math concepts and arranged for families to pick them up.\n\nit was a lot of logistics, moessner said. the kids were so excited to get the robots. they were thrilled to have it at home to play with. one student said his sister was chasing it.\n\nin fifth grade, students are expected to learn how to add, subtract, multiply and divide with whole numbers, decimals and fractions. through a computer application the students have, they can program the robot to move a certain distance, stop, maybe even turn.\n\nthe robot is a fun way to get the kids involved, moessner said. and a lot of the math is a little sneaky. they think they are trying to get the robot to move, when they are actually measuring the angles to get it to move.\n\nmoessner said that teaching math virtually has had its challenges.\n\nsome students do their math with a pencil and paper, and hold their paper up to the screen. others complete their math problems directly on the computer, which can lead to some troubles as they try to show their work. there's been a lot of trial and error, she said.\n\nbut it's been the weekly robot sessions after classes end that have captured her students' attention. the students are manipulating a concrete object in their homes. there's a tangible outcome to the work that they are doing, and they can see it away from their screens.\n\n'a change is gonna come'\n\nwhen kristin gavaza interviewed for the music teacher position at dorothy i. height elementary in the summer, she told the principal she had some ideas for how to create a festive concert while students were scattered and learning from home.\n\nshe wasn't sure exactly what it would look like, and she had never edited video before. but after many weeks of sending recordings to her students and their families and having them send recordings back to her, on christmas eve, gavaza posted to youtube a seven-minute holiday concert featuring about 80 of her music students at the northwest washington school.\n\ngood things come in little packages, little packages, just like me, sang a kindergartner wearing a pink, glittery shirt that read shine like a star.\n\nonce she finished her solo, a piano started playing and other classmates jumped in with their solos, then the whole class came together. some sang in front of christmas trees, others at desks or tables, many with ear buds or headsets, and all had a far-off look of concentration, perhaps imagining being onstage with their classmates.\n\nthey were excited. they liked the idea of being a part of this, and maybe even getting to do a solo, said gavaza, who decided to become a schoolteacher after teaching private piano and voice lessons in the region for the past decade. they were excited to have the opportunity for a spotlight.\n\nstudents from dorothy i. height elementary school sang sam cooke's a change is gonna come during their virtual winter concert. (the washington post)\n\nshe began teaching the songs in the fall to six grade levels during weekly music classes. she recorded herself singing and playing the songs on the piano. she sent the recording to the students, and asked them each to record themselves as they sang along.\n\nmany of the younger students required technical assistance. some of the students and their families are recent immigrants who speak little english, requiring all correspondence to be translated. but they sent recordings back to her, and gavaza went on youtube to learn how to use the d.c. public school system's editing software. she guesses she spent 80 hours putting together the concert of solos and ensembles.\n\ngavaza decided to end the concert with a song that the older students were introduced to when they learned about the civil rights movement: a change is gonna come by sam cooke.\n\nthe song resonated with the students, she said. the students started singing it at home to their families. their parents and grandparents knew the song, and were impressed the children were singing it around the house.
it is, therefore, ordered and adjudged that the said william jefferson clinton be, and he hereby is, acquitted of the charges in the said articles, declared chief justice william h. rehnquist, the presiding officer, marking the conclusion of the first impeachment trial of a president in 131 years.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nclinton emerged from the oval office two hours later to tell the nation that he was profoundly sorry for his actions and the great burden they have imposed on the congress and on the american people. taking care not to give any hint of vindication, he offered a subdued plea to all americans to rededicate ourselves to the work of serving our nation and building our future together.\n\nthis can be and this must be a time of reconciliation and renewal for america, he said in his four-sentence rose garden statement on an unseasonably warm winter day.\n\nthe senate's decision to spare clinton gives him the opportunity to try to repair his battered presidency and find a way to mitigate the legacy of the monica s. lewinsky saga that will mark him in the history books as only the second president impeached by the house of representatives.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthat distinction almost certainly will remain the only official sanction imposed by congress. soon after yesterday's acquittal votes, a bipartisan majority tried and failed to force the senate to pass a nonbinding resolution censuring clinton for shameful, reckless and indefensible conduct. although the senate voted 56 to 43 to consider censure, it fell short of the two-thirds required to suspend the rules.\n\ninstead, sen. dianne feinstein (d-calif.) and her allies collected 38 signatures on the resolution, including those of nine republicans, and filed it as a statement in the congressional record. while not ruling out another attempt to force a formal reprimand after returning from a week-long recess, key senate democrats made clear that the censure movement was effectively dead.\n\nyet they did not want their not-guilty votes to be viewed as exoneration for their president. in language that sometimes rivaled republican rhetoric in its harsh tones, democratic senators excoriated clinton for skirting close to the line of illegal behavior and betraying the trust of his high office.\n\nad\n\nad\n\neven senate minority leader thomas a. daschle (d-s.d.), who spearheaded the democratic effort that ultimately rescued clinton's presidency, described in anguished terms yesterday the sense of betrayal he experienced because of the president.\n\nas deeply disappointed as i am with the process, it pales in comparison to the disappointment i feel toward this president, daschle said in one of the final speeches senators heard in about 20 hours of closed-door deliberations, according to a text released later. maybe it is because i had such high expectations. maybe it is because he holds so many dreams and aspirations that i hold about our country. maybe it is because he is my friend. i have never been, nor ever expect to be, so bitterly disappointed again.\n\nthe constitutional crisis ended 13 months to the day after linda r. tripp started it by telling independent counsel kenneth w. starr's office that she had secret tapes of her friend, lewinsky, suggesting that clinton wanted her to lie under oath in the paula jones case about their affair.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthat phone call led to an unprecedented investigation and a virtual carnival of unseemliness in which tawdry sexual escapades and the deceptions they inspired ultimately set in motion the impeachment formalities. in the end, the 13 house republican managers who relentlessly pressed the case not only failed to force clinton from power but could not even persuade all of their party brethren to endorse their cause.\n\nwith democrats united in opposition, five moderate republicans from the northeast voted against both counts: sens. james m. jeffords (vt.), arlen specter (pa.), john h. chafee (r.i.), olympia j. snowe (maine) and susan collins (maine). another five republicans voted against the perjury count but for conviction on obstruction: sens. slade gorton (wash.), ted stevens (alaska), richard c. shelby (ala.), fred d. thompson (tenn.) and john w. warner (va.).\n\nfor such a momentous occasion, though, the verdict was anticlimactic. the trial began five weeks earlier with no suggestion that conviction was a realistic possibility. and what little suspense there was faded with disclosures about individual senators' intentions earlier this week. by the time the roll was called, the split verdicts by thompson and warner were the only mild surprises.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nindeed, the day's actions were so preordained that senate staff members drafted a script in advance outlining what everyone would say at each stage, including the failed censure consideration. aides included language for rehnquist to read to announce acquittal; the proper words for the president's ouster were left out. the only unanticipated moment was the bomb scare that forced police to clear the chamber shortly after the voting was completed.\n\nthe historic roll calls began shortly after noon, when the senate reopened its doors after a final two hours of secret deliberations. senators, how say you? rehnquist asked after each article was read aloud by the clerk. is the respondent, william jefferson clinton, guilty or not guilty?\n\nwith the galleries packed to capacity, a tense silence fell over the chamber as the senators' names were read in alphabetical order by legislative clerk david j. tinsley and bill clerk kathleen alvarez. one by one, each senator stood at his or her desk and called out guilty or not guilty, some in a resolute baritone, others in a soft whisper.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nsen. barbara a. mikulski (d-md.) emphatically cried out, not guilty, while sen. kay bailey hutchison (r-tex.) could not even be heard from the gallery pronouncing clinton's guilt. specter, who had said he did not want to be counted supporting acquittal even though he opposed conviction, was the only to deviate. not proven, therefore not guilty, he said.\n\nmore than a dozen senators, mostly democrats, kept their own tally of the votes on long senate scorecards, as did several of the house managers, who sat grim-faced at their table. the white house lawyers remained stoic at the defense table as the verdicts were announced.\n\nthe tension finally broke as the trial ended and the dry chief justice issued some words of farewell praising senators on both sides of the aisle for the quality of their deliberations, even as he noted with deadpan wit his introduction to the sometimes chaotic nature of a legislative body.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ni underwent the sort of culture shock that naturally occurs when one moves from the very structured [atmosphere] of the supreme court to what i shall call, for want of a better phrase, the more free-form environment of the senate, rehnquist said, sparking a wave of laughter that finally seemed to release the senators from the solemnity of the day. thanking the chief justice for his service, the senators gave him a golden gavel, which has been awarded to 70 senators in the past three decades for presiding at least 100 hours.\n\nwith the trial adjourned sine die at 12:43 p.m., rehnquist was escorted out by a phalanx of senators. the house managers were to be next, but lead prosecutor, rep. henry j. hyde (r-ill.), had already left through the back of the chamber and had to be summoned back to march down the center aisle and across the capitol. white house lawyers were left to slip out the back.\n\ncongratulating themselves and their leaders for averting the bitter partisanship that consumed the house during its impeachment debate, all 100 senators gave a standing ovation to majority leader trent lott (r-miss.) and daschle, who met halfway across the aisle to shake hands.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwe did it, daschle said he told lott. we sure did, lott replied.\n\nas certified copies of the judgments were being delivered to secretary of state madeleine k. albright, both senate leaders told reporters that clinton should not interpret the outcome as vindication. i believe it would be a mistake to read this as any kind of exoneration, daschle said. it wasn't. in fact, i think this whole process to a certain extent has been a level of punishment that was commensurate with the failures of the president to act appropriately.\n\nlott said the decisions were driven by party-line voting by democrats. i think people felt that clearly the president's conduct was deplorable, indefensible, dishonorable and all of that, but they did not want the senate to fall into a real partisan bickering situation, he said.\n\nclearly disappointed, the managers preached conciliation after the senate votes and some, including hyde, cautioned starr against pursuing new criminal charges against clinton. i think it's time for him to finish any report and move on, said rep. asa hutchinson (r-ark.). i don't think our country needs to be under the continued cloud of investigation after the trial is concluded in the senate.\n\nthe president, added rep. lindsey graham (r-s.c.), has been cleansed.\n\nhouse speaker j. dennis hastert (r-ill.) also indicated a desire to move on, issuing a statement highlighting the party's renewed focus on legislation even as he said republicans can be proud that they stood by the principles that have made this nation strong: a respect for the rule of law and an abiding faith in the strength of our constitution.\n\nstill, for the managers came the inescapable realization that the defeat will indelibly mark their careers perhaps as much as clinton's. to me, there's nothing i'm going to do politically that's going to change the first line in my political obituary, graham said. there's a definite taste of regret in that regard.\n\nhyde was not yet ready to concede his legacy, though. i hope to slay many more dragons which will supersede the events of impeachment, said the 24-year veteran lawmaker.\n\nat the white house, everyone from the president on down did their best to maintain what press secretary joe lockhart has declared a gloat-free zone. while several of the lawyers went to a long lunch, white house officials insisted there was no cause for glee given the damage inflicted on so many. we can be relieved it's over, but there's really nothing to celebrate, lockhart said. there's no great high or low from a day like today, except relief that it's over.\n\nunlike clinton, who did not watch the proceedings and instead received the news by telephone from chief of staff john d. podesta, some of the other principal players were glued to their television sets. lewinsky watched live coverage in new york. paula jones expressed discouragement.\n\ni'm not happy, you know, for sure, she told fox news. i just expected it because he gets away with everything.\n\nbeyond the beltway, much of the country wanted him to, with opinion polls showing that the public overwhelmingly believed clinton lied under oath and obstructed justice yet did not want him removed for office for it. just a handful of protesters held a lonely vigil outside the capitol yesterday with signs such as jail to the chief.\n\nin the year since the story about the president and the intern first broke, the nation has been exposed to a sex scandal that dwarfed any before it, as the most excruciatingly intimate details poured forth through news accounts and the explicit report that starr sent congress in september alleging 11 impeachable offenses by the president. clinton became the first president ever to testify in his own defense before a grand jury. the supreme court wiped away attempts to shield white house aides and secret service officers from testifying. and the house of representatives, on a largely party-line vote, impeached a president for the first time since andrew johnson in 1868.\n\ntripp, in her first extended interviews, defended her role yesterday, saying she went to starr only because criminal behavior was involved. did i want this behavior exposed? she said on nbc. absolutely. i was outraged. and i'm not sure whether fear . . . motivated me more, or outrage, anger at the callous abuse of this girl.\n\nthe trial tripp instigated lasted five weeks and gave the country its first look at lewinsky talking about her relationship with clinton and their actions to hide it from public disclosure, although her debut was limited to videotaped cameo appearances out of senatorial fear of live testimony.\n\nthe trial cast the 13 managers from the house in the unlikely role of prosecutors, arguing that clinton lied under oath when he denied touching lewinsky in a sexual way and that he obstructed justice by encouraging her to deny their affair, helping her to hide subpoenaed gifts, having friend vernon e. jordan jr. find her a job and coaching secretary betty currie to lie to protect his secret.\n\nunlike the house debate over impeachment, which was punctuated by fierce partisanship on both sides, the white house offered the senate a comprehensive and sustained defense of the president's actions based on the facts, rather than relying so heavily on constitutional or political appeals. by poking holes in the evidence assembled largely by starr, defense attorneys led by charles f.c. ruff, gregory b. craig and david e. kendall raised doubts among senators who otherwise might have been open to conviction.\n\namong them was collins, the maine moderate who announced her decision yesterday morning. while she said the president's grand jury testimony was replete with lies, half-truths and evasions, it was not necessarily perjury. as for obstruction, she said the house managers proved their case and added that if she were a juror in a criminal trial she might very well vote to convict.\n\nbut, she added, a president should be removed only when his misconduct so injures the fabric of democracy that the senate is left with no option but to oust the offender from the office the people have entrusted to him.\n\none of the few democrats considered a possible defector when the trial began offered a similar explanation of his votes for acquittal. sen. russell feingold (wis.), the only democrat who voted against a motion to dismiss the case after opening arguments, said the perjury charge relied too much on frivolous allegations, although on obstruction, the president came perilously close to committing an impeachable offense.\n\nthe clinton case, he added, was the first close call on presidential impeachment in the nation's history, falling between the weak case against johnson and the powerful case against richard m. nixon, who resigned rather than face certain impeachment.
how much say would i have? hopefully a lot, gruden said in monday's press conference after washington's 19-10 loss to the new york giants in the regular-season finale that would've clinched a playoff spot. i was the main reason we brought him in here, so ultimately i would think it is my call. our call, bruce [allen] will have some input, dan [snyder] will have some input, scot [mccloughan] will have some input. from a staff standpoint, i like to think i have a lot of pull on that one.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe defense hasn't improved in two seasons under barry, but washington hasn't made significant investments on that side of the ball either. they finished 28th in total defense, allowing 377.9 yards per game, and 19th in points allowed, conceding 23.9 points per contest. washington ranked 28th (380.6) and 17th (23.7) in those categories last season.\n\nthe redskins front office didn't improve the defensive line, nor the safeties during the offseason. washington did have some talent at certain positions, including cornerback and outside linebacker, but it wasn't able to produce a respectable defensive for a 16-game season. washington had the worst third-down defense in the league, allowing opponents to convert on 46.6 percent of their third-down attempts, and tied for 17th in takeaways with 21 – five fewer than the defense forced last year.\n\ni think you have to assess both, and that's what we're going to do here for the next couple of weeks, gruden said. i think we got a lot out of the players that we had. the players played hard. we had some injuries to key players back there, guys fought and battled, but we still have to evaluate everybody – player and coach alike.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nso where exactly does the fault lie, on barry or the front office? and did barry get the most out of the players on the roster, regardless of talent? these are the questions the redskins will need to answer this month as they weigh whether to keep barry for a third season and give him another chance with an improved roster, or to bring in a new defensive coordinator with a new scheme and possibly a learning curve for their young players already on the roster.\n\neither way, something has to change. for the second straight season, the defense couldn't consistently get the job done. and it's a significant reason why washington won't play a 17th game this season.

and everything's hardest in the messy middle. here's why: when the pandemic hit, we were collectively freaked out — and energized. we bought groceries for our neighbors and protested peacefully. we massively changed the way we work, educate our children, shop and socialize.\n\nin the midst of crisis, we saw anew how dire racial injustice is in our country and how little support our society offers those who are struggling, including the unemployed and working parents. it's a lot to tackle at once. for many of us, our surge capacity became depleted. the adrenaline is gone. we need a hug — from someone outside of our household.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthis is what happens with all big change, and the bigger the mountain we're climbing, the more tempted we are to lose focus for something shiny or delicious, to seek short-lived hits of pleasure rather than keep our eyes on long-term goals.\n\nthis messy middle is hard, and 2021 is not going to be anything close to normal. instead of just waiting for it all to be over, we'll do better to reengage with the things that bring us meaning. so put down that cookie (i'm talking to myself here) and use this checklist to set your mid-pandemic course correction on the best possible path.\n\neven if it feels like all you're doing is trying to survive, this checklist may help you gain a sense of control amid the uncertainty.\n\nad\n\n1. what do you want to take with you when this is all over? while i'm sure a lot about 2020 was bad for you, this is the time to reflect on what was good. did you find purpose in peaceful protest? did you shop for someone who is elderly? if you didn't leave the house much, what do you like about being home more? many teenagers are benefiting from increased family time and more sleep. what were the bright spots?\n\nad\n\n2. what are some goals you can set for yourself? not the easy ones. research shows that setting specific, difficult goals consistently leads to higher performance (if that's what you're after). where in your life would you like to step things up? perhaps you'd like to continue donating to a food bank or helping people who can't leave their home. maybe you want to set up a gratitude practice, or spend less time on social media. where can you do better despite the pandemic (and everything else)? the goal is not to add more pressure to an already difficult time, but to identify goals that could help you feel better and feel like you have more time and energy at the end of the day.\n\n3. what new habit have you wanted to try? maybe you want to check in with friends more regularly. perhaps your doctor wants you to be more active. limited travel can make our daily routines more consistent, and that makes this a great time for many people to establish a healthy habit.\n\n4. how can you invest in yourself? what deferred maintenance do you need to take care of? what most of us really need right now is less stress. could you resolve to go to bed earlier a few days per week? or would you have more energy if you improved your diet? remember, when you are depleted, your most valuable asset is damaged. in other words: when we underinvest in our bodies, minds or spirits, we destroy our most essential tools for leading our best lives.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ntalk with your friends and family about these questions. then make a list of your answers, and cross off anything that isn't realistic. unrealistic goals will only bring anxiety.\n\nwhen done correctly, habits can make us happier, healthier and more connected to those around us. these are worthy goals in any year, whether we are in a pandemic or not.\n\na version of this piece was originally published in greater good magazine, published by the greater good science center at uc berkeley. it has been adapted, with permission, for the inspired life blog.\n\nread more:
foxborough, mass. — as the super bowl li matchup was falling into place sunday night — a compelling pairing that pits the new england patriots against the atlanta falcons — the fans in gillette stadium were making clear what the nfl's main subplot would be over the coming two weeks.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nro-ger! ro-ger! they chanted in the third quarter before switching to, where is roger? in the fourth.\n\npatriots quarterback tom brady, who was suspended by commissioner roger goodell for the first four games of this regular season, will take what many have branded as his deflategate revenge tour to the season's final game feb. 5 in houston.\n\nbut late sunday night, brady was not playing along.\n\ni didn't hear that chant, brady said following the patriots' 36-17 victory over the pittsburgh steelers in an afc championship game to forget. i did hear them singing to bon jovi, though. that was pretty cool.\n\na season that began with brady serving his deflategate suspension could conclude with goodell handing the patriots the trophy for what would be their fifth super bowl triumph engineered by brady and coach bill belichick. but brady was not acknowledging sunday that there was any unusual sense of personal accomplishment accompanying this latest trip to the sport's biggest stage, the patriots' seventh super bowl appearance with brady and belichick.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwell, i think that's because of the hard work of a lot of people, you know, from my coaches to my teammates to our families who support us, brady said. it takes a lot of people and a lot of effort, a lot of hard work over the course of many months. this didn't start at 6:40 tonight. this thing started in april. it really started before that. in free agency we were picking up guys like [chris] hogan and drafting guys like malcolm mitchell . . . it's a lot of hard work. it's only two teams left standing and i'm happy we're one of them. that's what our goal is. and it's nice to be able to achieve that.\n\nbelichick wasn't going there, either.\n\nevery year has its own challenges, he said. whatever they are, they are. every team faces them. every team has to deal with them. we dealt with them. other teams have dealt with them . . . it's a special year because it's a special team. it's a special group and they've all worked together. but there are always challenges that we have to overcome.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe challenge now for the patriots will be dealing with quarterback matt ryan and the revved-up atlanta offense. the falcons were every bit as dominant earlier sunday in beating the green bay packers, 44-21, in the nfc title game.\n\nwe ran into a buzz saw, packers coach mike mccarthy said. those guys performed great and we didn't have enough to keep up with them.\n\npackers quarterback aaron rodgers and the green bay offense could not keep pace with the falcons, who led the nfl in scoring offense during the regular season. ryan was the league's top-rated passer and is regarded by many observers as the top candidate for the nfl's mvp award. offensive coordinator kyle shanahan is in line to be named the head coach of the san francisco 49ers, although he cannot officially be hired until the falcons' season is done.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nshanahan's father mike was the coach of the denver broncos the last time the falcons reached the super bowl. the shanahan-led broncos beat the falcons at the conclusion of the 1998 season in john elway's final game as denver's quarterback. dan reeves was the falcons' coach then. chris chandler was their quarterback and jamal anderson was their dirty bird-dancing running back.\n\nthose falcons were undone by a legendary quarterback, in elway, and a super bowl-tested team, as the broncos won their second straight championship. these falcons face a similarly daunting task against brady and the patriots. the atlanta defense is not overpowering, but it has the ability to rush the passer, especially with a lead, and generate turnovers, as it did sunday against the packers.\n\nand the offense is special. it perhaps has carved out a place as one of the league's better offenses in recent memory alongside such units of the st. louis rams' greatest show on turf with kurt warner and marshall faulk, the brady-led patriots in their unbeaten season of 2007 and some of the offenses orchestrated in indianapolis and denver by peyton manning.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nnew england's defense should present more obstacles than the packers for ryan and the atlanta offense. the patriots led the league in scoring defense during the regular season. it is a defense that improved steadily throughout the season after once being regarded as a potential postseason liability.\n\ni think there's a lot of noise, always, brady said. sometimes you don't always have it figured out four games into the year. and there's a lot of moving parts. the second half of the year . . . i practiced against those guys every day and it's hard to complete passes against them. i know if i can complete them against our defense, then we should be fine on sunday because our guys do a great job in the passing game . . . we've got a good defense.\n\npatriots cornerback and former super bowl hero malcolm butler was not quite ready to switch gears in the postgame locker room and begin thinking about defending the falcons' standout wide receiver, julio jones, in the super bowl.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nyou're going too far, butler said. i'm enjoying the moment, man.\n\neven so, butler acknowledged that this victory will not be that satisfying ultimately if the patriots do not finish the task in houston.\n\nit don't mean anything unless you win, he said. we're just enjoying it, man. we're glad to have the opportunity to go. hard work pays off.\n\n… and ten\n\n1. roethlisberger proud: quarterback ben roethlisberger fell short in his bid for a third career super bowl triumph with the steelers. but he said he remained proud of a season in which the steelers reached the afc title game after their record dipped at one point to 4-5.\n\nonly one team is going to end the season the way they want to, roethlisberger said. it's not us this year. but i told the guys afterward i was proud of them. we went from 4-5 to the championship game. if there's going to be any silver lining, it's that. but we'll just have to evaluate this and the offseason and what we have coming back. i'm just really proud of the guys. there's just a lot of love…. it's disappointing that we couldn't get this one for mr. [owner dan] rooney. i really wanted to do it for him. but we'll evaluate.\n\nad\n\nad\n\n2. bad playoffs: home teams went 2-0 sunday and had a record of 8-2 during the playoffs. the only two road wins came on the same day during the conference semifinals, by the packers at dallas and by the steelers at kansas city. those were also the only two competitive games during the playoffs.\n\nother quick thoughts from sunday's games…\n\n• the patriots almost always defer when winning the pregame coin toss. but when they won the toss sunday, they opted for possession of the football.\n\nthat surprised me, too, brady said. i was thinking, 'we won the toss. great.' and i was gonna sit down. and he goes, 'we got the ball.' i said, 'what? i thought we won the toss.' i wasn't sure how it all worked.\n\nad\n\n• goodell wasn't in foxborough on sunday, having attended the game in atlanta earlier in the day instead. but johnny manziel was there, according to a snapchat post, wearing a brady jersey. manziel's ticket was supplied by patriots tight end martellus bennett.\n\nad\n\n• so much for the notion that wide receiver michael floyd, added by the patriots after he was released by the arizona cardinals, would end up being a significant contributor. he was on the inactive list sunday.\n\n• falcons coach dan quinn will be coaching in the super bowl for the third time in four seasons, although for the first time as a head coach. he got there twice as defensive coordinator of the seattle seahawks.\n\n3. irsay's mistake(s): it was apparent to many people within the league after the 2015 season that indianapolis colts owner jim irsay had to move on from ryan grigson as his general manager or chuck pagano as his coach, or both. the strained working relationship between grigson and pagano was well known and well documented publicly. the team was on its way to wasting some of the prime years of quarterback andrew luck's career. so there was widespread surprise when irsay stuck with grigson and pagano.\n\nfast-forward to now. it is a year later and the colts have wasted another year of luck's career with another disappointing season. irsay fired grigson on friday and stuck with pagano. peyton manning is not coming to the rescue, according to irsay, to rejoin the colts as the chief roster architect in their front office.\n\nthere were never any serious negotiations or anything like that for him coming in to be general manager, irsay, speaking at a news conference friday, said of manning. i would welcome the opportunity for him and i to talk about that possibility some day that he would play some role in our organization. i think you have to remember that it hasn't even been a year since the confetti fell from his denver super bowl victory. he is enjoying retirement, enjoying the chance to not be downed in a schedule and that sort of thing. right now it's something where he is not in the mix in this process for interviewing general managers.\n\nit is difficult to conclude anything other than irsay made a mistake a year ago when he kept grigson and pagano in place. stability and continuity are important things in the nfl. the success this season of the stay-the-course steelers, patriots and packers underscored that. but the first step is to have the right people in place. after that, you stand by them and stick with them. those people must be able to coexist professionally and interact productively. they don't necessarily need to be friendly. professional friction is fine. but if that exists, it must yield positive results. that wasn't the case with grigson and pagano.\n\nit also is difficult to conclude anything other than irsay is risking another mistake by keeping his coach and bringing in a new gm. he is, in effect, forcing his coach on his new gm. that's probably not a recipe for success, either.\n\nit was a gut, intuitive instinct from looking at where we were and where we are as a franchise, irsay said friday. i think that we needed to make a change. intuitively you get the feeling when the timing is right, where a change will help. whereas continuity is something that i really want and long to have as much as we can have it–but in this case i really felt that the time was right to make a change, that we needed some new direction in the vision of our football program. that is from talking to a lot of people and giving it a lot of thought.\n\n4. niners and shanahan: the 49ers have taken a risk by waiting for the falcons' season to end to hire kyle shanahan.\n\nmost of the most coveted assistants already have landed on coaching staffs league-wide. nfl coaches, scouts and front office executives will be in mobile, ala., this week to evaluate draft-eligible college players at the senior bowl practices. preparations for free agency are under way. the business of the offseason is taking place around the league, and there certainly is much work to be done to rebuild the 49ers.\n\nbut the 49ers have done the right thing.\n\nthey no longer can afford to take a short-term approach after firing their last two head coaches, jim tomsula and chip kelly, after one season each. shanahan will be a first-time head coach. he cannot and should not be judged off his results in year 1 or even year 2. he undoubtedly will make mistakes. but he has demonstrated that he is more than worthy of a head coaching chance. he oversaw the league's highest-scoring offense this season in atlanta and he has done good work for other teams, even if some choose to remember his fractious final year in d.c. with his father and robert griffin iii and his season in cleveland with manziel.\n\nthe niners are yet to choose a gm. there is no franchise quarterback in sight at this point. this certainly does not appear to be setting up for a quick fix.\n\nbut that's not what the 49ers should be after. they should be viewing this as a long, gradual, sensible reconstruction project. the falcons were rewarded when they waited until after the super bowl to hire their second-year head coach, quinn, from the seahawks' staff. the 49ers likewise should be rewarded for waiting for shanahan if they remain patient.\n\n5. ranking the hires: here's how one scorecard of this year's nfl head coaching hires would look…\n\n1. kyle shanahan, 49ers\n\nno one did more this season to earn a head coaching opportunity.\n\n2. anthony lynn, chargers\n\nfew seem enamored right now with the chargers and their move to l.a. so lynn goes into a situation with modest expectations, which always helps. he has philip rivers at quarterback. playing at the cozy stubhub center actually could work in the team's favor. lynn had a rapid ascent in buffalo this season from running backs coach to offensive coordinator to interim head coach. he and his team could surprise some people.\n\n3. sean mcdermott, bills\n\nthe bills actually are close to being a decent team if they stay the course with tyrod taylor at quarterback rather than starting over at the position. mcdermott's relatively low-key approach, compared to predecessor rex ryan's bluster, could be what they need.\n\n4. vance joseph, broncos\n\nhe inherits a super bowl-ready team, perhaps. but he also inherits super bowl expectations. he has an unsettled quarterback situation and defensive coordinator wade phillips is gone. that's a lot for a first-time head coach to handle.\n\n5. sean mcvay, rams\n\nhe is a rising star in coaching. there is no disputing that. but is he ready? that is debatable. the arrival of phillips to run the defense will help. but is that enough? or will this resemble lane kiffin and the raiders?\n\n6. doug marrone, jaguars\n\nnothing against marrone, exactly. he deserved another chance after exercising the exit clause in his contract to leave the bills two years ago. but this whole thing feels kind of thrown together, with tom coughlin coming in to be a key front office decision-maker, and kind of forced, with the apparent approach of sticking with blake bortles at quarterback despite this season's regression.\n\n6. suitors for kirk cousins?: two of quarterback kirk cousins's former offensive coordinators with the washington redskins, shanahan and mcvay, will be nfl head coaches next season. that could create some additional offseason possibilities for cousins, who is eligible for free agency after playing this season on a one-year franchise-player deal, and the redskins.\n\nthe redskins still control the situation. they can use their franchise tag to retain cousins, again, if they're unable to re-sign him to a long-term deal. that could mean the exclusive franchise tag, which would take cousins off the free agent market entirely. or it could mean the non-exclusive franchise tag, which would entitle the redskins to two first-round draft picks if another team signs cousins to an offer sheet and washington chooses not to match it.\n\nbut the redskins could, if they want, agree to take something other than two first-rounders to allow cousins to leave. what if shanahan wants cousins in san francisco? the 49ers have the no. 2 overall selection in this year's nfl draft to offer as part of a package, if they want. what if mcvay wants cousins in los angeles? that seems unlikely, given that the rams have jared goff. but impossible?\n\nthe most likely outcome, by far, is that cousins remains in washington. but there is added intrigue with shanahan and mcvay being elevated to head coaching jobs.\n\n7. redskins' defensive coordinator: the redskins fired joe barry as their defensive coordinator and perused a list of possible replacements that initially included phillips and gus bradley.\n\nbut now phillips is with the rams. bradley, the former jacksonville head coach, is with the chargers. and the redskins promoted greg manusky from outside linebackers coach to defensive coordinator sunday.\n\nmanusky has nine years of coordinator experience in san francisco, san diego and indianapolis. he never has had a top-10 defense, coming the closest when the colts ranked 11th in the nfl in total defense in 2014. (he did have two defenses that ranked in the league's top 10 in scoring defense, with the 49ers in 2009 and the colts in 2013.)\n\nthis clearly was not a highly regarded job. few seem to regard the talent level on the redskins' defense as being anything but suspect. some wonder about the job security of coach jay gruden if the redskins have another non-playoff season.\n\nit all leads to the question: would the redskins have fired barry if they'd known they would end up with manusky as his replacement?\n\n8. super bowl ref: carl cheffers will be the referee for the super bowl.\n\nhe is the referee who called the holding penalty on kansas city left tackle eric fisher that nullified the chiefs' tying two-point conversion in their second-round playoff loss to the steelers.\n\nchiefs tight end travis kelce was fined for sharp postgame criticism of cheffers and that call, saying that cheffers was not qualified even to work at foot locker. chiefs coach andy reid also suggested that he disagreed with the call.\n\nthe controversy undoubtedly will be mentioned during super bowl week. but any suggestion that the call was controversial is simply off target. fisher clearly held the steelers' james harrison on the play, dragging harrison to the ground to keep him away from quarterback alex smith. it was about as blatant as it gets.\n\nthe nfl has had plenty of issues with its officiating. but this was not among them, no matter what kelce and reid think and say.\n\n9. raiders vote: expect the owners to vote on the raiders' proposed move from oakland to las vegas at the annual league meeting in march in phoenix.\n\nand, barring any unexpected developments between now and then, expect the relocation to be ratified.\n\nthe raiders officially filed last week for the relocation, but that was merely a procedural move. the league and owners have known for some time that was coming. owner mark davis never hid his intentions, after all.\n\nsome owners once had concerns about the size of the vegas market and the potential involvement of casino mogul sheldon adelson in the deal. but those concerns seemingly have melted away, particularly in the absence of what the league and owners regard as a viable stadium proposal on oakland. the raiders have been working on contingencies to do the vegas deal with or without adelson's involvement.\n\nthe move must be approved by at least 24 of 32 owners. the outcome has not reached foregone-conclusion status yet. but it's getting closer to that.\n\n10. cowboys' future: the redskins won the nfc east title in the 2012 season with a rookie quarterback, griffin, and a rookie tailback, alfred morris. they suffered a playoff loss to the seahawks but there was every reason to believe the future was bright.\n\nthe dallas cowboys won this season's nfc east title with a rookie quarterback, dak prescott, and a rookie tailback, ezekiel elliott. they lost to the packers in an nfc semifinal and there is every reason to believe the future is bright.\n\ncould these cowboys come undone the way those redskins did?\n\nit's doubtful.\n\ngriffin suffered a devastating knee injury in that playoff defeat to seattle to end his rookie season, and his rush to be back in the lineup by opening day of his second season seemed to do him no favors. those redskins also won with a gimmick-y, college-style offense designed for griffin as a rookie. it was not sustainable. griffin's career in washington came unraveled because of his injuries and his inability to develop as a pocket passer.
the campaign\n\n'bad night' in georgia for gop?: national and georgia republicans are growing increasingly frustrated with president trump's baseless tirades against georgia's presidential election results, fearing the president's attacks may cost them control of the senate.\n\nthey're concerned trump's relentless and baseless broadsides on the voting system — and tomorrow's electoral college challenge further dividing gopers — will deter republicans from trusting the system enough to vote in today's two georgia senate runoffs.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ndueling appearances: trump didn't help matters by holding a rally last night in georgia in which he repeated his assertions he won the state, and said he hopes vice president pence will somehow aid the electoral college challenge when he presides over it. biden also campaigned yesterday in the peach state.\n\ncontrol of the senate in washington depends on the georgia outcome.\n\ntrump's been generally unhelpful throughout this whole process, a gop senate aide told power up. he's managed to split the party at every turn since november and that division could result in lower turnout on our side, the aide added, referring to trump's last-minute demand for $2,000 stimulus checks followed by his veto of a $740 billion defense bill. a gop senate aide told power up. he's managed to split the party at every turn since november and that division could result in lower turnout on our side, the aide added, referring to\n\nrepublicans should be prepared for a bad night,  the aide added.\n\nwithout the trump factor — and all the [expletive] he's done, then we'd probably win by three or five points, a gop strategist working on the runoff races in georgia told us. with the trump factor, if we lose by one or two points, i won't be shocked.\n\nnot only is trump depressing turnout on the right but he's reminding independent voters, 'crap, maybe we do need democrats in the senate as republicans are going along with these absurd efforts to find 11,780 votes ,' the gop strategist added, referring to trump's urging of georgia's secretary of state brad raffensperger (r) during a weekend phone call.\n\nturnout means what?: early reports from georgia show robust early voting and absentee turnout, which favored democrats in the presidential race where georgia went blue for the first time since 1992. public and private polling, according to gop sources, has shown tight races between sens. kelly loeffler and david perdue and their democratic challengers, raphael warnock and jon ossoff.\n\nad\n\nhistorians and political scientists predict tuesday's double-barreled runoff election is unlikely to result in a split outcome. the last time there was a split decision in one of these 'double-barrel' senate elections was 1966, according to fivethirtyeight's nathaniel rakich.\n\nad\n\nthe big questions remain just how much trump's attacks on the state's presidential results – including unfounded charges of voting machine fraud – will depress gop turnout; and if georgia really has gone blue.\n\nwill it ultimately cause some republicans to sit out the election or will it give moderate republicans some pause about perdue and loeffler, who are basically taking trump's side with this?  a lan abramowitz , a political scientist at emory university told power up.\n\nwe can look at what happened in november and say that was just a rejection of trump … but if democrats win these two senate seats, the blue tsunami has hit, charles bullock, a professor of political science at the university of georgia, told us.\n\ntrump's behavior certainly isn't hurting democrats: abramowitz noted over 110,000 voters who did not cast ballots in november's general election voted early or absentee in the georgia runoffs so far — a number that skews toward democrats.\n\nsplit screen: biden returned to atlanta in his closing pitch for a senate majority that could give democrats a narrow trifecta of power as he begins his administration, our colleagues write.\n\nad\n\nthe power is literally in your hands, biden told the crowd. by electing jon and the reverend, you can break the gridlock that has gripped washington.\n\non the road: trump made a final lap through dalton, georgia on monday evening in a last-ditch attempt to inspire voters who did not vote early to turn out on election day and erase democrats's early voting advantage.\n\nad\n\nwhile trump pleaded with the crowd to turn out for loeffler and perdue, he spent a majority of the rally veering off-script, propagating disinformation and false claims of voter fraud. the first words trump uttered: there's no way we lost georgia. that was a rigged election. the outgoing president also lobbed not-so-veiled threats toward fellow republicans for not parroting his unsubstantiated claims.\n\ntrump went on to bash [georgia's gov. brian] kemp and georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger, claim they were not real republicans, and promise to campaign against both men when they stand for reelection in 2022, our colleagues philip rucker, ashley parker, josh dawsey and seung min kim report.\n\nthe president also falsely said he had won reelection 'in a landslide' and suggested that he expects vice president pence to make it so when he fulfills his constitutional duty to preside over wednesday's joint session of congress, even though the vice president does not have the power to overturn the results.\n\ni hope mike pence comes through for us, i have to tell you, trump told the applauding georgia crowd. of course, if he doesn't come through, i won't like him quite as much.\n\ntrump obliquely acknowledged displeasure from republicans who condemned his hour-long conversation with raffensperger, including rep. liz cheney (r-wyo.) and sen. marsha blackburn (r-tenn.).\n\nad\n\nif they win, i'll get no credit. and if they lose, they're gonna blame trump, these people, he told the crowd.\n\nearlier in the day, gabriel sterling, a gop official in raffensperger's office, urged georgians to turn out and vote on tuesday, despite trump's unhelpful comments.\n\ngiven the nature of the president's statements and people with aligned with him … we are specifically asking you and telling you, please turn out and vote tomorrow, georgia's voting systems manager told reporters during a news conference. the secretary wants me to make clear that everybody's vote is going to count and everybody's vote did count, sterling said.\n\ngeorgia election officials, meanwhile, are preparing for the biggest runoff we've ever seen, joe sorenson, the communications director of the gwinnett county government, told our colleague reis thebault.\n\nad\n\nofficials in fulton, gwinnett and dekalb counties — three of the four largest in the state — told the washington post that more than 900,000 people in their counties have voted early, between absentee ballots and in-person locations. they said they hope to finish counting all but the last of the mailed ballots by late tuesday, according to reis.\n\ntrump's rhetoric is bound to have longer lasting consequences than today's result. if his party loses both races in a previously deep red state and control of the senate, it will not be a quick and painless process to uniting a fractured republican party in a post-trump world, a gop source working on the runoffs told us.\n\nad\n\nthe biggest challenge for the republican party will be bridging the information crisis, the source told us. [trump] was right about 1 thing: it's not social media, its trump media. there's an ecosystem out there peddling crack.\n\ngeorgia election official gabriel sterling said on jan. 4 that the state's electors would be counted by congress. (reuters)\n\non the hill\n\nwhere senators stand: after the publication of trump's call to raffensberger, georgia's loeffler is the only senator to have added her name to efforts to oppose certifying biden's victory in tomorrow's joint session of congress, per our colleagues' tracker.\n\nabout wednesday: the new york times's maggie haberman and annie karni report that trump has directly pressed mr. pence to find an alternative to certifying mr. biden's win, such as preventing him from having 270 electoral votes and letting the election be thrown to the house to decide.\n\nad\n\n members of the vice president's circle expect that mr. pence will follow the rules while on the senate floor and play his ceremonial role as scripted, aides said. but after that, he will have to compensate by showing his fealty to mr. trump.\n\na tentative final foreign trip by mr. pence to visit israel, bahrain and belgium was scrapped, while more events to talk up mr. trump's legacy at home are being considered, according to a person familiar with the plans. aides would not say whether mr. pence would attend mr. biden's inauguration.\n\nshot: the president himself is trying to mobilize a show of strength that could intimidate lawmakers who certify the result, exhorting his supporters to travel to washington for mass protests wednesday. he is planning to speak to the crowd on the ellipse around midday wednesday, two officials familiar with the planning said, according to our colleagues.\n\nad\n\nchaser:  still, trump is not entirely blind to reality. he has asked several advisers in

the instant pot. (deb lindsey/for the washington post)\n\nit's winter: we've nested inside, we're ready for stews and braises, but we're still strapped to that infernal invention, the clock. there are rarely enough minutes, at least not when we want them. that's why some of us cooks want comfort food fast from the latest countertop pressure cooker; some depend on the all-day, no-fuss convenience of a slow cooker; and some prefer the stove-top dutch oven, which requires a bit of finesse. (is that sauce too thin?)\n\nin the end, most of us want all three: fast for busy nights, all-day slow when we have enough energy (and forethought) to get the meal going in the morning, and perhaps a more organic and hands-on approach for a quiet weekend at home.\n\nmodern electric multi-cookers get us closer to one-pot convenience. they offer both slow-cooker and pressure-cooker settings (as well as rice-cooker and even yogurt-maker settings).\n\nin fact, some of these multi-cookers have become culinary celebrities. the official instant pot group on facebook has a roster of almost 300,000 members. those and other pots come with lots of presets for chicken, risotto and more. dump things inside, cover, and dinner's almost done.\n\nmanufacturers are going all in. next-generation models will even be wirelessly connected to your phone. patricio barriga, chief executive of fagor america, cites these multi-cookers as the major area of growth for his company. the pots provide peace of mind with no fear factor, he says.\n\nif you want to follow recipes in the provided booklets, your problems are solved. or almost solved. what if you want to take one of those recipes for the pressure cooker and turn it into a slow-cooker meal? or what if you find a dutch oven recipe you like and want to convert it for a pressure cooker? unfortunately, recipes don't translate well among the applications.\n\n\n\nwhite bean, chickpea and tomato stew. (deb lindsey /for the washington post)\n\n[make the recipe: white bean, chickpea and tomato stew]\n\nusing a single recipe among the various methods often yields poor results. j. kenji lópez-alt, managing culinary editor of serious eats and author of the food lab, has demonstrated that when he used the same recipe (but adjusted the timing), slow cookers produced inferior food compared with dutch ovens or pressure cookers. clearly, the methods aren't instantly interchangeable. and good recipes are written for the specific device in hand.\n\nthankfully, recipes can be translated across devices — and across functions on a multi-cooker. here are five general rules for doing it:\n\n1. timing\n\nuse the timing for a traditional braise as your base. as a very general rule, an electric pressure cooker on high will need about 60 percent of the original timing of a dutch oven recipe (not counting the time the pot comes up to pressure or any time for the pressure release). a stovetop pressure cooker will need around 50 percent of the original timing, maybe even just 40 percent, depending on the cut of meat or the amount of root vegetables (see sidebar). a slow cooker on low multiplies the time by a factor of 2.5, sometimes 3.\n\n[the difference between stove-top and electric pressure cookers]\n\n2. liquid\n\nfor most braises, stews and soups, traditional stove top cooking requires the greatest amount of liquid because of the constant reduction, even under the tightest lid. in a slow cooker, by contrast, the liquids from vegetables and even proteins never come to a boil, so they never reduce and can swamp the dish. thus, a slow cooker requires the least amount of liquid: sometimes half, even a third, of that required for a stovetop braise.\n\na pressure cooker usually splits the difference, requiring about three-quarters of the liquid of a dutch oven braise, a little more if it's a stove-top pressure cooker. there's also no reduction in an electric pressure cooker, but the fast cooking time doesn't leach as much liquid from the ingredients.\n\n\n\ncannoli cream rice pudding. (deb lindsey /for the washington post)\n\n[make the recipe: cannoli cream rice pudding]\n\n3. herbs and spices\n\nbecause of the long cooking and the high-moisture environment, slow cookers compromise the efficacy of seasonings, particularly dried herbs. that teaspoon of dried thyme in a stove top braise will be almost lost after eight hours in a slow cooker.\n\na successful slow-cooker dish requires a big punch of flavors for the long haul, sometimes twice or even three times what a stove-top recipe requires. we once tested a chicken stew in an eight-quart slow cooker and couldn't get any basil flavor until we upped the dried herb to ¼ cup!\n\nthat said, a successful pressure-cooker adaptation again falls somewhere between the two, although it's still harder on dried herbs than on dried spices. as a very general rule and starting from a dutch oven recipe, double the dried herbs for a slow cooker and increase dried spices by 50 percent. for a pressure cooker, keep dried spices the same but increase dried herbs by 50 percent. for large-batch slow cooking (more than seven quarts), you may even need to triple dried herbs and double dried spices. what's more, the taste of fresh herbs is muted and dull in a slow cooker (although relatively intact in a pressure cooker). it's best to stir in the stated amount of fresh herbs during the last hour of slow cooking.\n\n\n\nchuck roast braised in tea with ginger and orange. (deb lindsey /for the washington post)\n\n[make the recipe: chuck roast braised in tea with ginger and orange ]\n\n4. browning\n\nstove-top and pressure-cooker recipes almost always advocate good browning. it's simple. you're already there. the pot is on the stove top, or the electric pressure cooker has a browning setting.\n\nbut a slow cooker can make browning a hassle. you have to pull out a skillet, dirty it at the stove, and then scrape everything into the pot. slow-cooker mavens often resent that extra step.\n\nfortunately, the new multi-cookers change the game. they have a browning setting (as do a few newer, high-end slow cookers). it's now easier and faster to brown first, so there can be more flavor in the final dish.\n\n5. finishing accents\n\nin general, stove-top braises accent natural sugars, intensifying the sweetness all around. slow-cooker recipes, by contrast, lop the highs (and lows) off the flavor register, rendering a somewhat bland sameness to the dish. both applications can often benefit from a small acid spark just before serving: lemon juice, vinegar or even chili sauce.\n\npressure cookers tend to keep sour accents intact. however, capsaicin, the hot stuff in chilies, is almost destroyed during pressure cooking. if you want heat in a pressure-cooker dish, you'll most likely have to add it at the table.\n\nwith a little knowledge and patience, recipes are indeed adaptable among these applications. even if that infernal clock is now confined to flashing digital lights on the stove, our phones or even our electric pressure cookers, we can figure out a way to beat the minutes and cook dinner on our own schedules.\n\nweinstein and scarbrough are the authors of dozens of cookbooks, including the great big pressure cooker book and the great american slow cooker book. their website is bruceandmark.com and their podcast is cooking with bruce and mark on itunes. they'll join wednesday's free range chat at noon: live.washingtonpost.com.
on thursday, united learned the full severity of its lopsided calendar.\n\nafter moderate demands over almost two months, a period interrupted by two home games at alternative venues in the metro area, united will accumulate frequent-flier miles in bulk across seven unforgiving weeks. road trips are one thing; a bus ride to philadelphia or a train to new york barely register. road trips to distant locations are quite another.\n\nand so away they'll go . . .\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmay 12: salt lake city, 3,730 round trip miles and two time zones.\n\nmay 19: san jose, 4,870 and three time zones.\n\nmay 28: los angeles, 4,602 and three time zones.\n\njune 9: seattle, 4,708 and three time zones.\n\njune 30: boston, 840 and no time change.\n\njuly 4: los angeles, 4,602 and three time zones.\n\ntotal: 23,352, almost the circumference of earth.\n\ni was expecting worse, coach ben olsen said. look, we all knew this was coming. when i first looked at the schedule, it was 'whoa!' but when you start putting it down on the calendar, those west coast games are pretty spread out. we'll get through it.\n\nthe matches are far enough apart that united will probably come home after each one, except for the last stretch, which would probably entail a flight from boston to l.a.\n\nad\n\nof note: mls rarely bundles away games for the purpose of easing travel demands.\n\nad\n\nof insane note: mls requires teams to almost always fly commercial. there are four exceptions per year. the antiquated aim is to prevent a competitive imbalance between team investors willing to pay for charters and those who aren't.\n\nunited, a thrifty organization while taking a financial hit at rfk stadium, has never arranged charters. sorry, rookie, you've got the middle seat again.\n\nit could've been worse: for stadium revenue purposes, club management wanted mls to schedule all 17 home games in a four-month stretch, leaving united with about a dozen away matches between early march and late june.\n\nad\n\nthe 2018 haul contrasts with united's 2017 slate: d.c. left the eastern time zone once in the first four months. not that it helped from a competitive standpoint — united was 5-9-3 at the midway mark and finished 9-20-5, last in the eastern conference and tied for last with the los angeles galaxy in the overall standings.\n\nad\n\nwith a cohesive unit returning from a successful season, this year's schedule would not seem as imposing. but united was a bust last year — it never had a winning record, never rose above seventh place after the first week and finished on a 1-5-1 skid — and is in the process of renovating the roster. four potential starters have arrived, another could join soon and the club remains in the market for additional help, particularly at striker.\n\nwith the newcomers needing to integrate and mls's schedule-maker offering no favors, olsen will aim to survive the road adventures and pick up most, if not all, available points in the two early home matches — maryland soccerplex and navy are close to being finalized — before settling into the new digs. in 2017, united was 3-12-2 on the road with a minus-25 goal differential.\n\nad\n\nalthough d.c. doesn't have any taxing trips for the first two months, many of the matchups are imposing: high-powered atlanta, eastern conference finalist columbus, u.s. open cup champion kansas city and mls cup champion toronto.\n\nad\n\nboth spring home games are against 2017 playoff teams: houston and columbus. united received byes on april 21 and may 5. after a short trip to chester, pa., to start a seven-game road swing, united will grow weary of airport terminals in a hurry. it will make its first appearance at banc of california stadium on memorial day to play expansion los angeles fc and, 12 days later, go to seattle for the second straight year. last summer, united blew a three-goal lead at centurylink field and lost to the sounders, 4-3.\n\nd.c. will then play 15 of its final 20 matches at audi field (10 on weekends and five on wednesdays). over the last three months, the only time it will leave the eastern time zone is for the finale at chicago.\n\nnine of the last 11 games are at home — a nice setup if the early-season rigors haven't already exacted a terrible toll.
the town didn't think it was. residents already were unnerved by strange stories posted on facebook and shared via text messages about helicopters secretly flying in sick patients, that the virus was grown in a chinese lab, that someone — either the media or the government — was lying to them about what was really going on.\n\nad\n\nthe quarantine plan hastily hatched by the federal department of health and human services was soon scrapped by president trump, who faced intense pushback from alabama's congressional delegation, led by republican rep. mike d. rogers. americans evacuated after falling ill aboard the diamond princess cruise ship in japan would not be coming to anniston, a town of 22,000 people in north-central alabama, after all. they would remain in the same texas and california sites where they were taken after leaving the cruise ship.\n\nad\n\nwhat happened here over the past week illustrates how poor planning by federal health officials and a rumor mill fueled by social media, polarized politics and a lack of clear communication can undermine public confidence in the response to the novel coronavirus, which causes the disease named covid-19. the rapidly spreading virus has rattled economies worldwide in recent weeks and caused the deaths of more than 2,900 people, mostly in china.\n\nthe panic and problems that burned through anniston also provided a preview of what could unfold in other communities, as the spread of the virus is considered by health experts to be inevitable.\n\nad\n\ntheir little plan sketched out in d.c. was not thought out, said michael barton, director of the emergency management agency in calhoun county, where anniston is located.\n\nad\n\nas local officials learned more, barton added, we knew then —\n\nwe were in trouble, said tim hodges, chairman of the county commission.\n\nin anniston, local leaders were stunned to discover serious problems with the federal government's plan for dealing with patients infected with the virus — starting with how the patients would get to alabama, according to interviews with county and city officials, along with business leaders who dealt with the federal response.\n\ni was shocked, anniston mayor jack draper said. i was shocked by the lack of planning. i was shocked by the manner in which it was presented to us.\n\nad\n\ntwo hhs officials — darcie johnston, director of intergovernmental affairs, and kevin yeskey, principal deputy assistant secretary for preparedness and response — said in a feb. 23 meeting with local officials that the patients would be flown from california to the fort mcclellan army airfield in anniston, according to multiple local officials.\n\nad\n\nthe airfield was closed when the army base was shuttered in 1999. local officials said they told the hhs officials during the meeting the runway was in bad shape.\n\nthe more we talked, hodges said, the more holes we found.\n\nthe hhs plan also called for housing coronavirus patients at the center for domestic preparedness, a fema facility on the old army base and one of several redevelopment projects at the sprawling outpost.\n\nvice president pence and the hhs secretary panned criticism of the trump administration's actions on the coronavirus march 1, but warned it will keep spreading. (the washington post)\n\nthe center has several brick dormitory buildings — behind tall black fencing — where federal officials planned for the patients to live. federal officials even picked out the building they wanted to use for the first arrivals: dorm no. 28, local officials said. a team of federal health workers would care for the patients and u.s. marshals would keep them from leaving the quarantine, local officials said they were told.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe dorms normally house emergency responders from around the country.\n\nbut the center doesn't have any special capabilities for handling infectious diseases, local officials said. the center is used for training. it has isolation hospital rooms — located in a former army hospital building — but they are mostly just props, with fake equipment and light switches that exist only as paint on walls.\n\nmeanwhile, federal officials never contacted the town's hospital, regional medical center, about handling covid-19 patients, said louis bass, the hospital's chief executive.\n\nyet hhs officials said in a statement released to the public feb. 22 that patients who become seriously ill would be sent to pre-identified hospitals for medical care.\n\nad\n\nwe were surprised, bass said.\n\nthe hospital does have eight negative-pressure isolation rooms, but patients with serious complications would need to be sent to a larger institution, such as emory university hospital in atlanta, 90 miles away, bass said.\n\nemory university hospital did not respond to a question about whether it was told about the hhs plan.\n\nad\n\na federal contract for a local ambulance service was secured at the last moment, after hhs had already issued a statement about its plan for anniston. details on how to handle other tasks — including patients' laundry and food — seemed unfinished.\n\nthe preparations for bringing patients to anniston were handled partly by caliburn international, a government contractor that previously provided emergency medical services to federal agencies, according to interviews and documents reviewed by the washington post.\n\nad\n\nformer trump chief of staff john f. kelly joined the firm based in reston, va., as a board member last year. caliburn is the parent company of comprehensive health services, which has come under scrutiny for its operation of medical services at a detention site for migrant children.\n\na caliburn spokeswoman referred questions about the anniston operations to the centers for disease control and prevention, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nad\n\nhhs, through its office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response, responded to the post's questions about its anniston operations with a statement noting the office's staff members have a long-standing relationship with the disaster preparedness center and were familiar with its capabilities. the statement also said the federal agency was considering the facility as a contingency location and decided during discussions with local officials that the site would not actually be needed.\n\nad\n\nit was trump who finally canceled the planned quarantine in anniston on feb. 23, according to tweets from rogers and sen. richard c. shelby (r-ala.) that referred to their conversations with the president.\n\nthe news arrived as people attended an emergency meeting of the calhoun county commission. cheers broke out.\n\nad\n\ni guess in our culture today a tweet is considered official, barton said.\n\nanniston has plenty of experience dealing with unwelcome threats — and learning to live with them.\n\nit was for years home to the nation's chemical weapons stockpile, including sarin and mustard gas. later, it was the location of a chemical weapons incinerator, where those munitions were carefully destroyed.\n\nad\n\nthe town also deals with the toxic legacy of a former monsanto plant that for decades polluted the soil and water with pcbs, which were banned in the 1970s amid health concerns. the pollution resulted in a $700 million settlement for 20,000 residents in 2003.\n\nbut the novel coronavirus posed a different kind of challenge.\n\nfear that the hhs plan was flawed gave new energy to already circulating rumors and wild theories about the virus.\n\nad\n\nresidents didn't know whom to believe. trump had said without evidence that cnn and msnbc were exaggerating the threat. rush limbaugh was on the radio saying it was no worse than the regular flu. facebook posts claimed the outbreak had been foreshadowed by a 1981 dean koontz book. and the idea the virus could have been created in a chinese biochemical lab was floated widely, including by sen. tom cotton (r-ark.).\n\nthe whirlwind caught the attention of michael kline, a urologist in anniston.\n\ni don't think anyone knows what's going on, he said.\n\nso on the weekend of feb. 22-23, kline dressed up in a blue biohazard suit with his the virus has arrived sign. he stood along the highway and waved to passing vehicles. he wanted to drum up opposition to allowing infected patients in anniston. but even after the plan was abandoned, kline said he still wasn't certain patients weren't being housed at the old army base.\n\nrumors of black helicopters ferrying infected patients to the training center at night were rampant. the local home depot sold out of painting and sanding face masks. hodges, the commissioner, said he heard often from worried residents. but helicopters were common in the area because of a nearby army depot and national guard training center. only now they were nefarious. other people talked about mysterious vans driving along county roads.\n\nhodges and draper held emergency news conferences and meetings to try to lessen the panic. but those meetings also allowed for additional rumors to flourish during public comment periods. a commission meeting included one resident tying the coronavirus to a 1992 united nations document about climate change.\n\nthat's how long this has been going on, he said.\n\nthe public is going crazy, said bobby foster, a business owner who spoke at the meeting and asked the commissioners to try harder to distribute accurate information.\n\nglen ray, president of the local naacp, talked about the virus at a sunday service at rising star united methodist church on feb. 23 to try to calm people's worries. but he was also dismayed that one of the county commissioners wore a red make america great again hat to an emergency meeting about the virus.\n\nit's not about donald trump, ray said later. a virus is not going to just jump on a democrat. so at times like this, we need to be coming together. no time for politics.\n\nanniston's flirtation with the dreaded virus did have one positive effect, officials said. it made them realize they need to prepare — that the virus could come without warning and they shouldn't rely on outsiders alone for expertise.\n\nbarton, the emergency management director, helped create a county infectious disease task force. it has already had its first meeting. the focus is not solely on the coronavirus. it will handle the flu and whatever other viruses pop up in the future.\n\nthe public's interest in the virus hasn't faded, either.\n\nbarton gave a talk thursday to a lunchtime meeting of a civic organization, the exchange club. it had been planned months ago but he decided to talk about the aborted plan to bring infected patients to town.\n\npeople peppered barton with questions about why federal health officials had ever considered the disaster training facility and how much emergency food they should keep at home. they wanted to know how to avoid getting sick.\n\nbarton suggested hand-washing and keeping a safe distance from sick people.\n\nas he talked, a lady reached into her purse, squeezed some alcohol sanitizer on her hands and passed the bottle around the table.
this year, the parent-teacher conferences were more about me than him. more about how his success or failure would reflect upon us, as his parents. it was about the work my wife and i had been putting in to make him a better brother and son; a more caring, proactive participant in our household; and a better student, friend and citizen at school. the parent-teacher conferences were our report card.\n\nhis fifth-grade year marked a turning point, a milestone of sorts in our journey as his parents. it was the result of six years of hard work on our part, as well as his.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhis report card came home in late october, and before it did, the parent-teacher conferences had been scheduled. when i arrived home from work and saw the envelope lying on our dining room table, i felt a pit in my stomach. i was worried as i picked up the envelope and slowly pulled out the report card. my mouth dropped open, and i let out a proud-mommy squeal. jonathan, i screamed. i ran up to his room, jumped on his lego-covered bed and said i am so proud of you!\n\nour child had a's, a few a-pluses and one b-plus. this report card that i held in my hand was proof of his hard work, but also of our efforts. some of his a's were our a's, too. we had invested in him as much as he had invested in school. he had actually been listening to us during those homework arguments. the reading we made him do over the weekends had also paid off, as he was above grade-level in that area.\n\nwe now knew, based on his report card, that this parent-teacher conference would go well. and in fact, it was the best conference we've had in his short academic career.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthere was a time, however, when we had found ourselves feeling the opposite of ecstatic. when he had been in kindergarten for two months, long before conferences were scheduled, his very experienced, very traditional teacher called us. she wanted to tell us that socially, she thought he was behind his peers. and that he was struggling with showing age-appropriate self-control and listening skills. i was in denial, and shrugged it off as the teacher being too old-school. my wife, though, pushed for a psychological and academic evaluation. the school conducted one and determined our son didn't have any issues that hindered his academic performance. so we moved on.\n\nby second grade, he'd had countless unofficial parent-teacher conferences to discuss his behavior and academics, so we had him evaluated, both by the school and independently. we finally had some answers. he was diagnosed with adhd and anxiety disorder and possibly autism. by third grade, we had changed schools, towns and teachers, meaning our son went through more transitions. his diagnosis moved with him. those labels would be his — and ours — forever.\n\nhis diagnosis has been our introduction to each of his teachers since kindergarten, with something is different about him to fourth grade, with we know socially he needs a little extra help while academically, he seems to 'get it.' by fifth grade, at least academically, he'd exceeded even his own expectations. his fifth-grade teacher, whom he also had for fourth grade, said she'd chosen him to be in her fifth-grade class. why? my wife asked. she replied, because i love working with him; he is such a great student. she wanted him in her class, not because she thought she could better support him, but because she genuinely enjoyed him as a student and looked forward to see more of his growth.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nto my surprise, the arguing and the battles we face at home during every transition (morning routine, night routine, change of weekend plans) are not an issue at school, in her class or any other. he loves school and he pushes himself when he is there. he has used the strategies we've taught him to get himself organized in school. we launched a system in first grade in which we rewarded him each day for a good day in school, for kind acts wherever he went, for helping with chores, for listening to instructions. he gained a stone for each of these things and collected them in a jar that, at the end of the month, he cashed in for a toy or book or candy. each year we modified the reward system to cater to his growing maturity, and combined it with medication and the necessary evaluations.\n\nwe were exhausted and no day was easy, but we have succeeded as parents. and when the hard days come again, when he gets frustrated because he cannot get his way, when he has a run-in with his neighborhood friends, or when homework arguments come up, we will think back to this parent-teacher conference. we will remember that we must also be proud of ourselves and the work we put in every day to make sure our son is the best he can be. at a certain point, and probably sooner rather than later, he will be the best he can be and he will value what he can give to the world. that's our reward.\n\nnikkya hargrove is a wife, mother and writer based in connecticut. find her on twitter @nikkya1128.
though i was a huge godfather fan, i hated movies that poked fun at italian americans — my blue heaven and even moonstruck, which i did come to love in time. italian americans aren't all morons existing for your comic pleasure. i had a chip on my shoulder as thick as a slice of sicilian pizza.\n\nbut out of curiosity, i tuned in to the sopranos. from the opening credits, with tony's drive out of the lincoln tunnel through the urban wasteland where i grew up and into the safety of the suburbs, i was hooked. because of my own life and my family's hilarious and alarming story, i identified with tony when he told his therapist, i find i have to be the sad clown. laughing on the outside, crying on the inside.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ni wasn't the only one who identified.\n\nthe sopranos was a huge hit with both critics and viewers — here was a family comedy and drama that didn't insult our intelligence, that told a layered story, punctuated with a smart and varied playlist. its characters were sometimes dumb, but they were always complex and genuine with an incredible cast led by james gandolfini, who walked the line between brutal and sensitive every week and made the sopranos, well, sing.\n\nthe landscape of television — and american culture — was changing right before our eyes. television was generally a vast wasteland of laugh tracks and the occasional happy-ending dramedy. but the sopranos raised the bar for narrative storytelling. tony murdering a mafia turncoat between stops on a college tour with his daughter, meadow, shifted our standards on television violence. it paved the road for smart but graphic shows such as game of thrones, boardwalk empire and even international hits such as berlin babylon.\n\nbefore social media and online video services, the sopranos succeeded on old-fashioned word of mouth and marketing. viral was still a word associated with the flu. streaming and binge-watching hadn't entered our vocabulary. but because of the revolution that the sopranos started, tv would displace film as our main conduit for entertainment.\n\nlike most family milestones, it's hard to believe that 20 years have passed since the first episode of the sopranos aired. to celebrate the anniversary, festivals and other events are being planned, as is a prequel feature film. a dense, all-encompassing book about the show — the sopranos sessions — has just been released, a psychological and philosophical deep dive written by two former star-ledger writers who were there on the ground floor. (the ledger is the paper tony memorably picked up in his driveway.)\n\nad\n\nad\n\ni approached the book as i did the show: with trepidation. but like chase and gandolfini, these guys — matt zoller seitz, tv critic for new york magazine, and alan sepinwall, chief tv critic for rolling stone — are the real deal. their analysis of that opening-credits drive — which compares the ride to the evolution of immigrants in american society — is enough reason for any fan to buy this book.\n\nthen there are the exclusive interviews with chase, who doesn't talk to many reporters. brilliantly, they start with the question: tell us about your mother. (chase admits he based tony's mother, livia, on her and says actress nancy marchand ­eerily channeled her. my mother was nuts, says chase, and she obviously did not have a happy childhood.) there's also lengthy discussion of that controversial, ambiguous last episode, filmed at holsten's, where i have enjoyed the occasional onion ring since the screen went black in 2007. (chase tries to keep his responses ambiguous.)\n\nthe authors explain, in extended infinite jest-like annotations, the actors' ties to the godfather, goodfellas and the rest of the world that came before and after, and reintroduce us to livia, silvio and carmela and uncle junior and christopher and all the characters who have been standing there all these years in the shadows of our subconscious, waiting to whack us once again. they hit, head on, the italian american community's hatred of the show, glorifying gangsters at the expense of all the hard-working italian americans. (i think it did a lot to raise the profile of italians, says chase. i know they were gangsters and killers, but i think for the right audience, they were very innocent. . . . they were human beings.) they call out episodes that alienated viewers, such as the one in season 3 when a stripper is violently killed.\n\nthey discuss chase's use of symbolism — eggs as a harbinger of death and the number seven — as well as literary and cinematic allusions, making the show seem even more of a dark masterpiece than we thought. the writers pick apart and analyze, in exhaustive and exhausting detail, each hilarious and disturbing episode of the seven seasons, making you want to go back and watch them all over again.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbut i'm not sure i can bring myself to see them again. it would be like going through childbirth again or reliving the pain of adolescence or going through that bad breakup twice. there was beauty there, yeah, but mostly pain and darkness. could i handle it all again?\n\ntony is like an old lover you hold dear in your memories but never really see again. the book ends with chase's eulogy of gandolfini, a letter to his dead friend. when i heard gandolfini died in 2013, i felt the shock that usually comes when a family member passes. for me, it was up there with john lennon being shot. because of what he put out there, because of his vulnerability and power, we thought we knew gandolfini. and tony.\n\nmaybe i'm afraid to re-watch the show because i'm worried his performance and the series won't hold up, even though the authors say here that they do.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ntelevision, and storytelling in general, is better because of the sopranos. but so much, too much, has changed for the worse since those days, which we thought — silly us — were so complicated and grave.\n\nhelene stapinski is the author of five-finger discount: a crooked family history, baby plays around: a love affair, with music and murder in matera: a true story of passion, family, and forgiveness in southern italy.\n\nthe sopranos sessions\n\nby matt zoller seitz and alan sepinwall
omar celebrated the change on twitter:\n\nthe ban on head coverings has been in place since 1837, the washington post history blog retropolis reported friday.\n\naccording to the web page of the house historian, the 1837 measure passed with weirdly little debate, considering that efforts to keep heads bare had been going down in flames for years. some opponents of the ban before 1837 argued that there was nowhere for men (no women in office then, obviously) to put their hats. others said wearing hats showed a connection to the british house of commons, where lawmakers wore hats during debates to reflect their independence from the king of england.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nregarding then this usage as merely 'the outward and visible sign of the inward and spiritual' freedom of this body from all executive control or interference, let us preserve it, john m. patton of virginia argued on the floor of the house. and whenever, if ever, our executive magistrates shall attempt to employ any improper influence on this body, let us be found with our hats on.\n\nhouse historians told retropolis that french diplomat alexis de tocqueville noted the general lack of decorum in the house in the early 1800s. one is struck by the vulgar demeanor of that great assembly, de tocqueville wrote. members used chewing tobacco and spat, smoked cigars, carried weapons, swilled liquor, and propped their feet on their desks.\n\nthis week, the argument in favor of lifting the ban was different. it was proposed last month by rep. nancy pelosi (d-calif.), then the house minority leader; rep. jim mcgovern (mass.), the house rules committee's ranking democrat; and omar, of minnesota. it was proposed to accommodate omar. the rule change reads:\n\nad\n\nad\n\nduring the session of the house, a member, delegate, or resident commissioner may not wear nonreligious headdress or a hat or remain by the clerk's desk during the call of the roll or the counting of ballots. a person on the floor of the house may not smoke or use a mobile electronic device that impairs decorum.\n\nnathan diament, executive director of the orthodox union advocacy center, which represents the interests of orthodox jews, said when the rule change was recently proposed that no jewish house member had made the ban an issue in the past. however, he said there have been special house sessions when jewish men wore head coverings — including when israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu addressed congress, and israeli officials wore yarmulkes — called kippot in hebrew.\n\nthe orthodox union has long supported laws and policies that foster the accommodation of religious practices in the workplace. religious practices — such as wearing religious garb, whether a kippot or a hijab, should be accommodated in all workplaces — including in the halls of congress, he said.
christina kerby was corralled aboard a massive luxury cruise ship, charting a meandering course somewhere in the south china sea, when she began thinking about the apocalypse.\n\nluckily, the wifi on holland america's ms westerdam was plentiful. she tapped out a tweet.\n\nhere's a science fiction plot line for ya, she wrote. amidst a global epidemic that wipes out the earth's population, it's up to the people aboard one cruise ship — the only safe place on earth — to repopulate the planet. **passengers onboard the #westerdam begin eyeing each other nervously**\n\nit was an idea befitting her new dystopian reality — but instead of a sci-fi thriller, she was going for lighthearted comedy. the way she saw it, there wasn't much else she could do, as her long-planned vacation was ensnared in a global frenzy over a fast-spreading disease and the story of her cruise ship had spiraled into international news.\n\nkerby boarded the ship in hong kong on feb. 1, but hundreds of other passengers had been cruising since jan. 21, riding a route that was supposed to ferry them north, from cambodia to japan. soon after kerby got on, plans began to change.\n\nfour times the westerdam tried to dock at ports across east and southeast asia, and four times it was turned away, rebuffed by governments frantically trying to protect their countries from the spread of coronavirus, now known as covid-19. authorities are wary of cruise ships after infections rose aboard the diamond princess, which is quarantined at a port in yokohama, japan. strict new measures have also banned from cruise ships anyone who has recently traveled in china.\n\neven after the cruise line decided to cancel the rest of the trip, it struggled to find a country nearby that would allow its legions of passengers and crew to disembark and catch flights home.\n\nholland america tried to reassure officials in japan, taiwan, the philippines and thailand: the ship is virus-free, the company said again and again, with no known or suspected cases on board. on monday, the crew told passengers they'd be able to get off in bangkok, the cruise aborted but fully refunded.\n\nbut by the next day, they'd been told once more they were unwelcome. they'd have to keep floating, with no end in sight.\n\nthat's about when kerby, a 41-year-old who works in health-care communications, decided to start tweeting.\n\nupdate from the #westerdam: it's sunday mid-morning over here. the ship still has a good supply of peanut butter so we're doing ok. still heading southwesterly towards vietnam, thailand or singapore. cont. #coronavirus #cruise — christina kerby (@christinakerby) february 9, 2020\n\ntomorrow's schedule aboard the #westerdam. i can't wait to find out what the chocolate surprise is. cruise life is anything but boring. pic.twitter.com/wkdz42y3xi — christina kerby (@christinakerby) february 11, 2020\n\ni felt like it was really important to dispel some of the fears and misconceptions about what was going on in the ships, kerby told the washington post in an interview from the ship. i was reading a lot of really scary and negative media reports, and i thought, this is not giving an accurate picture of what's going on, so i wanted to bring some truths and some positivity to the mix.\n\nbecause life aboard the ship bore little resemblance to the dire plot kerby outlined in one of her tweets — at least for the passengers who paid a premium to ride the stately westerdam, recently remodeled with a new bar and something called the music walk, which includes a lincoln center stage and a b.b. king's blues club.\n\n\n\nchristina kerby with her husband, tony martin-vegue, in 2019.

but this time, she was hopeful it was for real. the cambodian government had agreed to allow the westerdam to dock at a port on the country's southwestern coast. all approvals have been received and we are extremely grateful to the cambodian authorities for their support, holland america said in a statement.\n\nthe u.s. ambassador to cambodia also tweeted his thanks. kerby posted a video of passengers bopping to a cover of bill haley's rock around the clock in celebration. when she woke up thursday, local time, kerby could see land. the ship was anchored near sihanoukville, and the crew said they'd be off soon, after a health check.\n\nas the ship made its way into port on thursday, kerby diligently live-tweeted its progress. she wondered whether her husband would agree to buying a waterbed once she returned home, writing, not sure i'll be able to sleep on dry land.\n\nshe reported that the passengers remained upbeat — even though the muesli had run out at the buffet. around dinner time on the ship, she noted that she was feeling rebellious and had decided to wear sneakers in the dining room.\n\nthe captain had said the clearance process was going smoothly, she wrote, but taking longer than expected. not that she minded.\n\npeople seem relieved to have time for more swimming and ice cream onboard, she wrote.\n\nand then, early friday, kerby signed on to share another series of updates: the westerdam had been given the all clear.\n\nthe cruise to nowhere had arrived, and its passengers were finally coming ashore.\n\nbusses have arrived to transport the first group of passengers off the #westerdam. they're carrying flowers. i don't think the captain has slept for days. — christina kerby (@christinakerby) february 14, 2020\n\nread more:\n\nhow cruise ships are handling mass onboard quarantines as the new coronavirus spreads\n\nten passengers infected with coronavirus on quarantined cruise ship with thousands aboard\n\ncruise lines ban anyone who has recently been to china as coronavirus fears spread
that includes rail riders who don't have the $2.25 peak, and $1.75 off-peak minimum fares loaded to their smartrip cards.\n\nmeanwhile, customers who meet the minimum fare but whose trips costs exceed their balance will be directed to exit fare machines, which only accept cash and coins. the agency said, however, that station managers will be at the ready to walk customers around to credit and debit card-accessible machines if needed.\n\nbus riders who don't have the $2 fare loaded on their cards will be met with a buzz at the farebox, metro said. and those with passes pre-loaded to their smartrip cards need to have a positive stored value to ride the system, metro said — even if their trips are covered by their pass products.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nit's the first day of a policy that the cash-strapped agency says underscores how every dollar counts. the agency said negative balances have added up to $25 million in losses over the past 17 years.\n\nbut some riders and advocacy groups are pushing back. monday afternoon, a union-backed group known as the save our system coalition plans to protest the move, holding a 4 p.m. rally and smartrip giveaway at the anacostia metro station, in opposition to what it calls the negative impact of the move and heightened fare enforcement policies that disproportionately target low-income communities, specifically black residents, according to the group.\n\nmetro general manager paul j. wiedefeld has previously defended the agency's heightened focus on fare evasion, while noting individuals' concerns about unfair targeting. metro transit police chief ron pavlik, jr. has said the agency doesn't keep demographic data on fare evasion citations.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nit's a fairness issue, across the entire community, wiedefeld said when the question was raised previously. you have people in those same communities that they're concerned about being targeted, who are paying their fares. and i think it's right that everybody pay their fare.\n\ndespite the aggressive push to enforce its fares, metro said the negative balance policy is distinct from the police crackdown on fare evasion.\n\nthe agency noted in a news release that fewer than 1 percent of passengers had a negative balance on their smartrip cards last week.
every winter, we ask washington post beat reporters and columnists to think about the big ideas, arguments, questions and problems that the new year will bring. of course, if there's one thing we learned over the last 12 months, it's that what we don't expect can matter even more than what we do: the first cases of the unexplained pneumonia that would become the coronavirus pandemic, after all, were announced quietly on dec. 30, 2019. what will be on our minds when we remember 2021 a year from now? here is outlook's fifth annual year in preview.\n\n— mike madden\n\nthe white house by annie linskey\n\n(for the washington post)\n\nbiden beat trump. now what?\n\ndemocratic voters could agree on the main goal through a messy primary race and a quarantined general election: they would put aside differences to defeat president trump.\n\nannie linskey is a national political reporter @annielinskey\n\nbut now that president-elect joe biden has delivered on that central promise, there's less left to bind together the coalition that spanned from socialists who backed bernie sanders to suburban republican women who once supported mitt romney. keeping democrats on the same page would help biden enormously — if he can do it.\n\nan early test will come tuesday, when voters in georgia go to the polls for two runoff elections. biden carried the state in november, and if democrats win both races — a difficult feat — his party will control the senate by the narrowest of margins, giving him far more ability to drive the agenda in congress than if republicans hold the chamber.\n\neven then, democrats wouldn't have the votes to make structural changes to government, like ending the senate filibuster, that would pave the way for more ambitious ideas. that means biden probably won't be able to achieve big, transformational goals.\n\nso far, he's setting out an early agenda focused on the twin health and economic crises, hoping that he can create bipartisan habits early by offering solutions to meet immediate needs for officials from both parties. red and blue states want a vaccine, and biden has promised to deliver it. red and blue states need stimulus funds. he's promised more of that, too.\n\nbut biden also ran on confronting climate change, reforming the immigration system, strengthening labor unions, addressing income inequality and overhauling the criminal justice system — all ideas that will be met with significant republican resistance. all will test the decades-long dealmaking relationship that biden has touted with senate republican leader mitch mcconnell.\n\nfinally, though he was defeated at the ballot box and is leaving the white house, trump still will have a place on the national stage. that leaves biden with perhaps his most difficult task: overpowering trumpism again.\n\nthe economy by heather long\n\n(for the washington post)\n\none nation, two recoveries\n\nthe u.s. economy is expected to come roaring back in 2021 as

should come on like a light switch once you have a vaccine, says tim duy, an economics professor at the university of oregon. on top of the boom caused by businesses reopening, wealthier americans will be looking to spend some of the substantial savings — more than $1 trillion — that they accumulated in 2020 as they worked from home and spent less on commuting, travel and nights out. that should also boost the economy.\n\nyet the recovery will continue to be k-shaped, as economists say, with already-well-off professionals heading steadily up as others struggle. indeed, the split could get worse if additional government aid doesn't materialize or if even more jobs and small businesses don't return because consumer habits shift. analysts at goldman sachs, for instance, think that economic growth will probably recover fully in 2021 but that employment won't return to precrisis levels until 2024.\n\nnearly 10 million jobs lost during the spring still have not returned — especially in restaurants, travel and education — a higher number than at the worst point of the great recession. in the post-vaccine world, millions of americans will have to find new jobs (or entirely new careers), a process that takes time. and that burden is likely to fall disproportionately on black workers. so far, black americans have recovered only 53 percent of the jobs they lost, compared with 66 percent for whites (and 69 percent for hispanics).\n\neven as much of the economy bounces back, evictions could easily spike as protections fade away; millions of unemployed workers are severely behind on rent. and many services on which the poor and middle class depend could take a significant hit: public education and public transportation, in particular, could face drastic cuts as cities and towns search for ways to close budget gaps caused by reduced tax revenue and the high costs of fighting the coronavirus. the pain will linger for low-wage workers even as many economic headlines turn rosy again.\n\nsports by jerry brewer\n\n(for the washington post)\n\nhow to make games fun without fans\n\nour obsession with sports seemed unstoppable until it was pitted against an intractable pandemic. then everything halted in 2020 for several months, and when the games returned, they were sterile, inspiring uneasy feelings and poor television ratings. like everything else infected by the novel coronavirus, athletics were literally sickening.\n\njerry brewer is a sports columnist @jerrybrewer\n\nthe hope of a new year and an effective vaccine provides a spiritual jolt but not an immediate elixir. professional and major college sports will remain in survival mode throughout 2021, desperate to reinvent how they engage with fans and eager to see the day when tens of thousands can gather in their venues once again.\n\ndespite some incredible athletic performances amid the duress, it has been difficult to present sports on television without large numbers of fans. the tv tricks — fresh camera angles, manufactured crowd noise, dabbling with greater interactivity — couldn't prevent the product from being a glorified scrimmage. for die-hard fans, the outcomes carried emotional value, but it was hard to get past the practical reality: these weren't events as much as they were staged replicas to satisfy lucrative tv contracts.\n\nwhile awaiting normalcy, sports executives must be more creative in doing something that will seem novel to them: finding a dependable audience. and they must do so with limited resources. nba commissioner adam silver said 40 percent of the league's revenue comes from game nights at arenas. other sports are similar — and some are even more dependent on live events. vaccines notwithstanding, teams don't expect a fast return to regular times. all are concerned about how long they can hold on while experiencing extreme revenue shortfalls.\n\ntheir business models are built on the endurance of the sports obsession, which normally provides even when teams don't have a good on-field product. adjusting to life without a financial autopilot will only grow more challenging.\n\nmost will survive. some will crumble. the way sports operate won't fundamentally change; executives will view this as a once-a-century predicament. but as technology alters viewing habits and younger generations consider how much money they're willing to commit to fandom, the pandemic has exposed an urgent need to diversify. experimentation should begin in earnest.\n\nclimate by sarah kaplan\n\n(for the washington post)\n\na 2020 repeat — but this time, on purpose\n\na year ago, united nations scientists issued a dire warning to humanity: to keep global warming within tolerable limits, we need to cut greenhouse gas emissions by an unheard-of 7.6 percent annually. twelve months later, though, the world just about hit that target — unintentionally, and at the terrible cost of more than 1.5 million lives. the coronavirus shutdowns and resulting economic devastation led to the biggest decline in planet-warming emissions in human history: about 7 percent.\n\nsarah kaplan is a climate reporter @sarahkaplan48\n\nin 2021, the world will need to reduce emissions on the same scale while simultaneously controlling the coronavirus and rebuilding the economy.\n\nthere are reasons to be optimistic, said surabi menon, vice president of global intelligence at climateworks foundation and a member of the steering committee for the u.n.'s emissions gap reports. the european union, south korea and japan have committed to reducing their carbon emissions to zero by 2050. china says it will do so by 2060. meanwhile, joe biden's election signals the united states' return to international climate diplomacy. with history's biggest emitter back in the paris agreement, climate experts hope countries will be motivated to pledge deeper emissions reductions at the u.n. climate conference in november.\n\ngovernments are expected to spend nearly $13 trillion to help their countries recover from the pandemic, offering an unprecedented chance to fund research on green technology and transition away from fossil fuels. if stimulus packages are invested the right way, the international energy agency has found, they could trim expected 2030 emissions by as much as 25 percent. not since the end of world war ii has society seen such an opportunity to reinvent itself.\n\nbut if humanity does not reverse course on climate change in the coming year, we will find ourselves locked into escalating warming for decades to come. this is the one chance we have, german climatologist niklas höhne told the post. governments will not spend this much money again in 10 years.\n\nrestaurants by tim carman\n\n(for the washington post)\n\nditch the kitchen 'concept,' chefs\n\nconcept has always been king for restaurants. the concept, or business plan, informs everything: what food is served and how, the decor and tableware, the marketing and target customers, the selection of employees, the location, even the name of the place. the success of a restaurant, the thinking went, flowed directly from the originality of its concept and its owners' ability to stick to it. straying from the plan was an indication of weakness, and a sure warning sign to customers and investors that the business was doomed.\n\ntim carman is a food reporter and restaurant critic @timcarman\n\nbut if the pandemic has proved anything, it's that restaurant business plans are meant to be scrapped, or at least adapted. white-tablecloth restaurateurs have simplified menus to pivot into carryout and third-party delivery. chefs have carved out spaces in the back of the house for ghost kitchens selling comfort foods far removed from their original concepts, available just for takeaway or delivery. operators have opened small retail markets, subleased spaces for pop-ups or developed branded products to sell in retail stores. flexibility and adaptability have become keys to survival, and no one bats an eye when, say, a refined seafood restaurant now sells chicken parm, meatloaf, and mac and cheese.\n\nwith labor and overhead costs rising for years, the restaurant industry was obviously ripe for reinvention. in the fall, chef, restaurateur and media darling david chang told fortune magazine that, even before the pandemic, he had set a long-term goal to generate 50 percent of his revenue from consumer goods, not from the four walls of a restaurant. the momofuku group had a five-year plan, and now we've tried to accelerate that into six months, chang said.\n\nchefs and restaurateurs will continue to blow up their concepts in 2021. no one knows for sure when diners will feel comfortable sitting inside restaurants again, which means operators at all levels will continue to devote resources to takeout, ghost kitchens and other solutions. but the pandemic has also forced countless owners to go into debt, including back rent, and restaurateurs who survive this mess will need to diversify their revenue streams to help settle those accounts.\n\nthe good news, if you want to call it that, is that older restaurants (the ones whose owners complain about never getting media coverage) can reinvent and reinvigorate themselves, and no one will call them desperate. diversification is now just baked into the business plan.\n\npandemic by leonard bernstein\n\njordy van den nieuwendijk for the washington post (for the washington post)\n\nvaccines will help, but normal is still elusive\n\nwhen will life return to normal?\n\nchances are, no single question will be asked more often as the new year begins and 2020, one of the darkest periods in u.s. history, comes to a merciful end.\n\nleonard bernstein is a health and medicine reporter @leonard bernstein\n\nwith the delivery of the first doses of vaccine to hospitals in mid-december, the light at the end of the pandemic tunnel grew a bit brighter. the initial shipment of 2.9 million doses was enough only to start inoculating health-care workers and nursing-home residents. but it portended the beginning of the end — the hope that by the middle of 2021, perhaps, anyone who wanted to be vaccinated against the coronavirus could be.\n\nas always, there are questions: are the vaccines safe? will they have side effects? will the difficult task of transporting and delivering them be accomplished? and most important, will enough americans be willing to take them?\n\nscientists say 70 to 80 percent of us must, in order for all to be protected against the virus. polls showed acceptance of the idea edging into that range as 2020 ended. and that was before a campaign to persuade the reluctant began in earnest. so when will life return to normal?\n\nmasks, social distancing and frequent hand-washing still will be features of the first half of the year. gathering with loved ones, working together without fear and sending children to school campuses full-time may have to wait until the fall.\n\nbut if all goes well — a plausible if difficult-to-reach outcome — the latter part of 2021 could look more like 2019, before the pandemic altered life as we knew it.\n\nspace by christian davenport\n\n(for the washington post)\n\nspace force is here to stay\n\nbetween his over-the-top salesmanship — one tweet read, simply, space force. vote! — and the star trek-esque branding, the u.s. space force will forever be associated with president trump. but while some are urging president-elect joe biden to eliminate his predecessor's prized program, that's not likely to happen.\n\nchristian davenport is a defense and space industries reporter @wapodavenport\n\nin 2020, the space force became the first new military branch since the air force was established in 1947, in part because of bipartisan support in congress, which concluded that space — like the land, sea and air — is a warfighting domain that needs to be defended. it's here to stay, said rep. kendra horn (d-okla.), who lost her reelection bid but served on the house armed services committee and as chair of a subcommittee on space. it was not about this administration — this was a long-term, thoughtful and bipartisan effort looking at the current and future needs of our national security.\n\nwith american military satellites guiding precision munitions and everyday traffic — yes, that blue gps dot on your phone comes courtesy of the pentagon — there is a lot at stake in space. and it isn't just superpowers competing for the high ground.\n\nspace has also become a new front in corporate battles funded by billionaire entrepreneurs. there's a race to flood earth's orbit with satellites that would beam the internet to billions of people without access to broadband. and there's the human race: having flown nasa astronauts to the international space station for the first time in 2020, elon musk's spacex is ahead of rival boeing, which stumbled in the development of its new capsule. both companies plan to fly astronauts in 2021, and spacex is even planning a launch that could ferry private space tourists.\n\nrichard branson's virgin galactic and jeff bezos's blue origin are also looking toward space tourism, starting with flights for wealthy travelers that would not reach orbit, grazing the edge of space before returning to earth. (bezos owns the washington post.) both companies expect to start flights in 2021.\n\nthose tourists won't run into any uniformed military up there, however. eventually, the space force may train a corps of guardians as astronauts — after all, its motto is semper supra, always above. but that day is a long way off. for now, the newest military branch is just trying to determine where on earth its headquarters will be located.\n\nsupreme court by robert barnes\n\n(for the washington post)\n\nit's amy coney barrett's court now\n\nfor a while now, the supreme court's essential question has been, what does chief justice john roberts want? starting in 2021, the central question might become, what does justice amy coney barrett think?\n\ncourt commentators struggled at the end of the term last july to find words to describe roberts's influence. he was a part of every majority as the court decided cases involving some of the nation's most controversial issues: abortion, gun control, religious liberty, legal protections for lgbt workers and president trump's sweeping claims of executive autonomy.\n\nrobert barnes is a reporter covering the u.s. supreme court @scotusreporter\n\nbut there already are signs that barrett's replacement of liberal icon ruth bader ginsburg could diminish roberts's pivotal role. barrett provided the fifth and decisive vote to do away with the court's general deference to local officials regarding pandemic restrictions — the position roberts had championed. she joined fellow conservative justices clarence thomas, samuel alito, neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh to strike a blow for religious organizations that had chafed at what they said were unconstitutional boundaries on their right to worship.\n\nthe right is looking at barrett's judicial record and daring to dream big again. as a judge on the u.s. court of appeals for the 7th circuit, barrett abided by the court's precedents on restricting protesters from the doors of abortion clinics and health centers. but she and fellow judges criticized the jurisprudence as incoherent. conservative lawyers are hoping that a case from pittsburgh will allow barrett and like-minded colleagues to ease or eliminate the limitations.\n\none of her most important opinions as a circuit court judge was an against-the-grain dissent that said felons should not necessarily be forbidden from gun ownership. such a deprivation of second amendment rights should depend on whether a person is dangerous, she wrote, not the classification of his crime. the firearms policy coalition has filed a petition on behalf of a pennsylvania man similarly barred from gun ownership, which could provide the chance for the court's new conservative majority to consider the issue anew.\n\nroberts is a conservative, of course, but one who has been wary of advancing the court's movement on gun control and abortion too far and too fast. on these and other issues, barrett might not be so reluctant.\n\ntheater by peter marks\n\n(for the washington post)\n\nblack lives matter comes to broadway\n\ntheater blooms in the fertile ground of political turmoil. it's one of the form's most resilient characteristics. revolt sometimes springs directly from the stage; a dissident czech playwright, the late vaclav havel, after all, rose out of revolution to lead a country away from soviet domination.\n\npeter marks is a theater critic @petermarksdrama\n\nso if the pandemic-driven shutdown of 2020 imposed an existential crisis on theater in this country, a simultaneous upheaval — the widespread protests over white supremacy, spurred by a reinvigorated black lives matter movement — has created the conditions for a revolution on the stage in 2021.\n\nlook, then, for a renaissance, on broadway and other stages, in plays by black artists and other people of color. the groundwork is being laid — if the coronavirus vaccines are distributed fast enough — for a return to live performance with far more input from generations of black playwrights, directors and administrators. as a result, the theater world will find itself connected in a profound way to the world evolving just outside the playhouse doors.\n\nthe seeds of a new order are already apparent: in october, the tony awards belatedly announced the nominees for broadway's truncated 2019-20 season, which ended in early march. the searing seriocomedy slave play, by a young black dramatist making his broadway debut, jeremy o. harris, garnered an astonishing 12 nominations — the most ever for a nonmusical.\n\neven before vaccines were authorized, thoughts of a colored man, by keenan scott ii, the stories set in brooklyn of seven black men, was scheduled for a reopened broadway. and the long, long-awaited broadway debut of alice childress's trouble in mind — a brilliant 1955 backstage comedy-drama about racism in the rehearsal room — will come via new york's roundabout theatre company.\n\nblack playmaking, of course, has been a vibrant aspect of the american theater for decades; lynn nottage, suzan-lori parks and jackie sibblies drury are among the black writers who have won pulitzer prizes for drama over the past two decades. in the wings now, an accelerated recognition of the creative power of theater artists of color is waiting for us all.\n\npop culture by emily yahr\n\n(for the washington post)\n\ncelebrity in the palm of your hand\n\nthe love affair between celebrities and instagram live is poised to grow in 2021. not only have direct broadcasts over the internet become an easy pandemic-era way for stars to endear themselves to fans with near-guaranteed publicity, but the celebrities have complete control over what they say. they don't need to write a witty caption or agonize over the perfect filter; viewers crave — and expect — authenticity in a spontaneous real-time chat.\n\nemily yahr is an entertainment reporter @emilyyahr\n\nin 2020, selena gomez revealed her bipolar diagnosis on miley cyrus's instagram live series and said she felt comfortable sharing the news there because she liked the rawness of the show. stars chatted with their co-stars, interviewed politicians, held cocktail hours, patched up old feuds, spilled details on future projects and even streamed their daughter's stuffed-animal wedding (that was chrissy teigen and john legend).\n\none unfortunate side effect is that the trend of celebrities preferring to interview each other rather than face questions from journalists will endure. there's no doubt that this new model will remain popular — especially because fans feel even more connected to their favorite stars in such casual settings. of course, some stars will feel so at home, they will basically forget that they're speaking to millions, leading to controversies. just look at actress vanessa hudgens, who went live to shrug off the pandemic in march, noting that people are going to die, which is terrible — but inevitable? (she later apologized.)\n\nmusicians have been some of the most frequent users of the streaming platform, keeping their performance muscles strong while tours have been shut down. that development may fade as life slowly returns to normal, but instagram did recently announce that it's expanding live streams to a maximum of four hours instead of just one — so as we start the new year, much of our entertainment will still be found in the instagram app, just as it was for much of 2020.\n\neducation by laura meckler\n\n(for the washington post)\n\nthe great academic catch-up\n\nchildren are likely to return en masse to school buildings in 2021, wrapping up our involuntary national experiment with home schooling. but the effects of the pandemic on american education will extend long beyond the end of zoom school. and even before the fights over reopening campuses have ended, attention is turning to the next challenge: how to help children make up the ground they've lost. one answer, experts say, could be an unprecedented large-scale tutoring program.\n\nlaura meckler is a national education writer @laurameckler\n\nsignificant academic damage to children has already been recorded, particularly in math, as students have struggled to connect and teachers have struggled to teach remotely. students of color and those in low-income families are seeing the steepest losses — exacerbating existing inequities. in a december report, the consulting firm mckinsey & co. predicted that white students could lose the equivalent of eight months of math if schools stayed closed through june, while students of color could lose as much as 12 months. mckinsey estimates that high-intensity tutoring to cover half of u.s. students would cost $66 billion (at $2,500 per student), and advocates hope the federal government and private foundations will pay the bill.\n\nit's a big tab, and it's far from a sure thing that there will be any money. still, research — including a recent meta-analysis of 96 tutoring programs by j-pal north america, an mit lab focused on poverty issues — suggests that well-executed tutoring programs are effective at helping students catch up quickly, even more than other large-scale interventions (including reducing class sizes, providing additional training for teachers or purchasing new curriculums).\n\nto be effective, experts say, tutoring needs to be consistent — at least two or three hours a week, for at least several months. the best programs are embedded within schools so that learning aligns with the local curriculum (and so students show up). tutors don't necessarily have to be teachers, however: lower-paid paraprofessionals have nearly as much success, the research shows.\n\nschools are already strapped for cash, tax collections are down, and it's been hard to pry funding out of washington. if districts are left on their own, there's little doubt that wealthy ones will be far better positioned to help kids catch up than their higher-need, higher-poverty counterparts. schools appear eager to ramp up tutoring in 2021, but who will pay for the project — if anyone — is far less clear.\n\nforeign by ishaan tharoor\n\n(for the washington post)\n\nreversing trump's havoc on the world stage\n\npresident-elect joe biden promises a grand restoration of american leadership on the world stage. as soon as he enters the white house, he will try to reverse some of the havoc wreaked by president trump abroad. he'll rescind the u.s. withdrawal from the world health organization, return to the paris climate accords and start salvaging the nuclear deal with iran.\n\nishaan tharoor is a columnist covering foreign affairs, geopolitics and history @ishaantharoor\n\nbut biden and the myriad obama-era veterans in his administration also have grander ambitions, beyond setting the clock back to 2016: he says he aims to counter the global tide of rising authoritarianism. his aides have floated new geopolitical groupings that would prioritize human rights and liberal values, an alliance of democracies that could serve as a counterweight to autocrats and elected illiberal strongmen. biden also says he'll put the world's kleptocrats on notice and bring greater transparency to the global financial system. targeting corruption and illicit tax havens, the thinking goes, would chip away at the inequities that fuel nationalist populism.\n\non all those fronts, the new administration will have its work cut out. on climate, any collaboration with china — the world's biggest carbon emitter but also an emerging green-tech giant — will be met with republican fury at home. on iran, the landscape has markedly changed after four years of trumpist maximum pressure; trust between all parties is low. on challenging authoritarianism and upholding liberal values, the mixed record of biden's own time in office as vice president — which saw the sputtering of democratic revolutions in the arab world and unchecked military adventurism by russia — suggests that a liberal renaissance may not be around the corner.\n\nultimately, no foreign policy priority in 2021 will matter as much as biden's ability to lift the country out of the pandemic. other nations are hoping that washington can help lead efforts to distribute vaccines in the developing world, but the united states still has a long struggle ahead to heal itself. no matter biden's avowed internationalism, the era of america first may not be over just yet.\n\nfilm by stephen zeitchik\n\n(for the washington post)\n\nthe movies come home\n\nin theory, 2021 should be the year of massive movies. after all, a slew of films that didn't come out during a pandemic-stricken 2020 were pushed to 2021 — a list that includes the james bond installment no time to die, marvel's black widow, the quiet place sequel, a new fast & furious film and even steven spielberg's west side story.\n\nstephen zeitchik is a reporter covering the business of entertainment in the u.s. @zeitchikwapo\n\nwhat reality will look like is another question. we know that at least a few movies will be coming — warner bros. says it will make available all 17 of its scheduled films, including dune and in the heights, on hbo max, no matter how many theaters it can put them in. but that still leaves four other major studios, including every big movie from disney, in limbo.\n\nthere are two likely scenarios. in one, the virus quiets down, thanks to the vaccine, a few months into the year. people quickly feel comfortable returning to theaters (and enough of those theaters hang on until then), and the rest of 2021 is a bonanza, a cinematic splashdown the likes of which the world has never seen.\n\nin the second scenario, the vaccine doesn't bring us to herd immunity as quickly, keeping cities — and theaters — closed. you might assume that studios would then move many films to streaming, as warner bros. has already done.\n\nnot necessarily. a number of these titles cost $200 million or more to make. studios can earn that back fast in theaters if a movie does well. on streaming only? not so much. while studios often take upward of 60 percent of theatrical ticket sales in the united states, streaming dollars can be measured only in subscribers acquired or retained — and, given that one title rarely compels a subscription, sometimes not even that. most studios would rather relax and recoup than rush and lose.\n\nthat's especially true for disney, which doesn't need these films to supercharge its already-robust disney plus service. executives know that billions await if they just hold out. in fact, it's not even clear that all of warner bros.' films will really be on hbo max. a few of them, such as dune, have deals or financial backers that may not give the studio the final say.\n\nso 2021 probably won't be the year of big movies on your small screen. it will either be the year of cinema or the year of waiting — two futures battling it out as fiercely, and uncertainly, as the sharks and the jets.
ad\n\nthe first visit to a primary state by a top-tier democratic presidential candidate found a candidate still honing her stump speech, with a well-oiled campaign infrastructure and audiences that were still in the tire-kicking phase. it revealed plenty about how warren, who has been urged to run for president since at least 2013, would approach a real campaign. the caricature of warren — by mid-december, she was being covered as a flawed and stumbling liberal who had missed her best shot to run for president — did not survive intact. here's what replaced it.\n\nad\n\nshe's not focused on donald trump. in 2016, as the primaries were winding down, warren began attacking trump on twitter, branding him a xenophobic bully as he fired back with attacks on her claim of native american heritage. at the time, democrats insisted the senator was cracking a code. she's showing that the best way to respond is to punch back hard and to call him out, former obama spokesman tommy vietor told the new york times.\n\nbut trump won the election, and ever since his insults have been perceived, by the press, as masterful distractions that no democrat can effectively rebut. since her dna test, warren has simply stopped responding to trump's insults; over four iowa events, she mentioned the president's name only once, when asked about the aforementioned test, saying that she simply could not stop him from hurling racial slurs.\n\nad\n\ntrump has become the silence between the notes of warren's speeches, which portray an economic system that has been rigged, for decades, to favor the wealthy. when warren talks about the fights she's been through, she focuses on the million dollars a day that bank lobbyists spent, unsuccessfully, to stop the creation of the financial-industry regulatory agency she proposed and initially ran, and on her evisceration of former wells fargo chief executive john stumpf, which was a factor in his resignation. it's a return to the rhetoric that worked so well for her in 2012, affirming her status as an icon of the left.\n\nad\n\nwarren also emphasized her lower-profile senate work to demonstrate that she was more than a left-wing candidate. in sioux city, she talked about her effort to pass legislation lowering the price of hearing aids.\n\ni talked to a lot of people about what would it take to do this, and then i called chuck grassley, she said. after some boos at the name of iowa's senior republican senator subsided, warren said she'd called another republican and another republican and another republican, done all this all under the radar screen, put no hard lines on it, and [wrote] a bill. it's not the most dramatic story, but it tells iowan more about warren than they knew before she flew in\n\nad\n\nshe is not bernie sanders. plenty of the democrats who wanted to draft warren into the 2016 race went on to support the vermont senator; a good number of those strategists, activists and voters now support him even with warren in the race. but warren's approach to campaigning could not be more different. the sanders approach, which has not changed in decades, is to sketch out a social democratic vision of america — universal health care, free public college tuition, a $15 minimum wage — in sentences punctuated by applause. he mentions his biography only to talk about how he proved skeptics wrong as mayor of burlington. voters who show up to hear sanders hear the message, and then they decide whether they're in.\n\nad\n\nwarren's stump speech begins with a little bit about who i am, with a story that quiets down the crowd: about the night she heard her mother muttering, we will not lose this house as she contemplated how to deal with her father's medical bills. she moves on to a vision of changing the rules of three sectors of society: the economy, government and politics.\n\nin that litany, anti-corruption legislation is filed under government; voting rights, including a constitutional amendment to enshrine the right to vote, is filed under politics. it's more incremental than the sanders approach, but it grows out of a rationale for running, the sort of thing democrats believe hillary clinton never was able to do. warren, who has been accused of elitism (by republicans) since entering politics, connects every policy position to her identity and the years she spent (to use a phrase she's dropped) on the ragged edge of the middle class.\n\nad\n\nwarren is one of five senators with presidential ambitions who has co-sponsored the medicare for all act; she is also the first of them to announce a campaign or exploratory committee. yet at her first four events, the massachusetts senator did not mention the legislation at all. only in des moines did she say something that emphasized her support for universal care: health care is a human right.\n\nad\n\nafter the sioux city event, i asked warren if there was a reason she wasn't mentioning medicare-for-all in the stump speech. no, no special reason, she said. no one's raised it. but i have had a chance to talk about medicaid. partly because i think we've had a national conversation about health care, and i think it's been enormously valuable. it's obviously about how we protect ourselves and each other. but it's also about our values. i hope we continue to have that conversation. i will continue to talk about health care every chance i get.\n\ncontrast that with sanders, who never lets a speech end without talking up medicare-for-all. contrast it with what the bill's other sponsors might do when they get to iowa and work to distinguish themselves.\n\nad\n\nshe has a fan base, and she takes care of it. at every warren stop, but especially in des moines, it was easy to spot merchandise and tokens of support that predated her trip to iowa. shirts reading nevertheless, she persisted, references to the 2017 moment when senate majority leader mitch mcconnell prevented warren from negatively referring to attorney general-designate jeff sessions, were everywhere.\n\nad\n\na 2014 run, warren, run, sign, printed by moveon, was unfolded in storm lake. a shirt from the progressive change campaign committee's 2012 ad campaign, i'm from the elizabeth warren wing of the democratic party, was visible at three of the stops. in council bluffs, a teamster named bob payne briefly pulled warren aside to ask if she'd gotten a shirt he'd sent her office, to advertise a pension reform bill the union supported.\n\ni got it and i wore it! warren said, hugging payne — who called her my hero for working on pensions.\n\nad\n\nit was also easy to find democrats who had wanted warren to run before and were still shopping for a candidate but had an emotional connection to her.\n\nfrom the moment of 'nevertheless, she persisted,' i got the mug on my desk, said julie brown, a 55-year-old businesswoman who brought her daughter to see warren in des moines. i've got a pen that says it. it was a rallying call for women, in particular. when you live that, when this happens to you on a daily basis, and you have a strong wonderful woman who shuts it down — it's very inspiring.\n\nad\n\na lot of that could change as candidates pile into the race, but warren's campaign, at the moment, is taking full advantage of the pent-up interest. at every stop, she has stopped to take pictures with anyone willing to wait for one; her team has grabbed copies of her books (or even photographs and baseballs, which sometimes are passed around by autograph hunters) and returned them to voters, signed. it's more like the approach clinton's campaign took in 2016, and sen. cory booker's pre-campaign is taking now, than what fans of sanders found last cycle.\n\nad\n\nboth booker and sanders, of course, had been to iowa more recently than warren had. both, if they run, will get their chance to introduce themselves to voters who don't see a clear favorite right now. but warren's visit, coming after a long stretch of skeptical coverage, set a higher bar than many expected.\n\nad watch\n\nthe president's reelection campaign is running new digital ads on immigration; i saw one of them as a youtube pre-roll while in iowa this weekend. in it, footage of crime — and of the white house meeting where the president said he'd own any shutdown — play over a number that voters can text to get campaign updates.\n\nad\n\nnancy pelosi and chuck schumer care more about the radical left than keeping us safe, a narrator says. the consequences? drug deaths. violent murder. gang violence. we must not allow it. that's followed by trump himself saying that liberals care more about illegal immigrants than americans.\n\nad\n\n2020\n\njay inslee. the governor of washington has created a special expedited process to clear the records of people convicted of marijuana possession before voters legalized it. he's also being pilloried by ray buckley, the chairman of new hampshire's democratic party, for not helping new hampshire's 2018 gubernatorial nominee more; inslee was last cycle's chairman of the democratic governors association.\n\njulián castro. he's in iowa this week, ahead of an expected presidential announcement; after that, he'll head back out. he appeared on abc's this week on sunday, pitching himself as a candidate for the 21st century who'd run one of united states' most diverse cities.\n\nad\n\njohn delaney. he's opening the first 2020 campaign offices of any democratic candidate for president — one in des moines, one in cedar rapids, both on saturday.\n\neverybody is wrong\n\nthe controversy over remarks by rep. rashida tlaib (d-mich.) at a moveon reception this week seems to be winding down, but not before inspiring head-scratching theories about the political impact.\n\ntlaib, one of the first muslim women elected to congress, ran as an implacable opponent of the president who had once been hauled out of an event for protesting him. her district, which for a half-century was represented by john conyers, gave trump just 18.1 percent of the vote. for tlaib herself, the political impact of saying that she wants the president impeached and removed from office was at worst a wash; at best, it's going to earn her votes.\n\nwhat's confusing is the speculation that tlaib will hurt her party politically. true, the house democratic majority, and the leaders of the relevant committees, have no plan to impeach the president until and unless republicans believe it's necessary. they've said it many times. to the extent tlaib forced them to say it again, they had a bad news cycle.\n\nbut how will any of this cost them votes? the tlaib controversy is what i like to call a red hen event — a brief source of outrage that is pored over for political impact but it too far from an election to have any. think of the moments in 2017 and 2018 that were, according to republicans (and some neutral analysts), going to focus the electorate on the new radicalism of the democratic party.\n\nprotests of trump administration officials as they ate dinner.\n\nclashes between antifa and right-wing protesters.\n\nmichelle wolf's routine at the white house correspondents' dinner.\n\nkathy griffin's photo shoot with a decapitated trump.\n\nand the most relevant example was the rhetoric of rep. maxine waters (d-calif.). in early 2017, she said democrats needed to impeach the president and stop his a--. in the summer of 2018, she was filmed encouraging protesters to push back on trump cabinet officials and tell them they're not welcome. that kicked off a multi-day news cycle, with speculation about waters, whom the president personally attacks on twitter and at rallies, disrupting the democratic message.\n\nsome events, and some gaffes, do change the national conversation. but few do so while affecting the individual fortunes of politicians. nearly every democrat asked about tlaib this week had the same response: they did not like the language, and they would prefer that any impeachment talk be shelved until after investigations did or didn't turn up impeachable offenses.\n\ni think it is absolutely essentially that we protect the mueller investigation, sen. elizabeth warren said in iowa this weekend after being asked about tlaib. the special prosecutor has already produced more than two dozen indictments or guilty pleas. our job right now in congress is to protect that investigation, and we need bipartisan legislation to do that. mueller needs to complete his investigation and make a full report to the american people.\n\nrepublicans have been predicting a democratic crack-up on impeachment for nearly the entirety of the trump presidency, and it simply hasn't happened. in 2018, as the president of the house gop's super pac, strategist corry bliss repeatedly speculated that the angry democratic base would nominate impeachment-obsessed candidates, who would alienate swing voters.\n\nthe crowded, nasty, divisive primaries going on around the country [are] going to produce nominees who are to the left of bernie sanders and want to do nothing but impeach the president, bliss said confidently in a may 2018 interview.\n\nbut with the exception of beto o'rourke, democrats in swing races evaded the impeachment issue; they gave the sort of wait for mueller' answers that warren gave this weekend in iowa. and the impeachment issue was more potentially potent in the midterms than it can possibly be in 2020. either the house will impeach the president, or it won't; if it does, it will be as the first step in a process that republicans get behind, in the sort of drama that is unthinkable right now. if it doesn't, the president will be on the ballot in 22 months, making the question completely irrelevant.\n\nwhat i'm watching\n\neating the rich. an under-noticed moment from julián castro's abc news interview came when he was asked if he agreed with rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.) on taxes. she suggested, in a 60 minutes interview, that high marginal tax rates were not so radical, as they'd been well above 50 percent in the past. did castro agree?\n\n(marginal tax rates are simple — currently if you fall into the top bracket, you pay that top 35 percent rate only on income over $416,000.)\n\ni can support folks at the top paying for fair share, said castro, former san antonio mayor and hud secretary. as you know, george, there was a time in this country where the top marginal tax rate was over 90 percent; even during reagan's era in the 1980s it was around 50 percent.\n\nso do i support, in order to have something like medicare-for-all, that we ask folks that are in the top 0.05 percent or 0.5 percent or top 1 percent to pay more? he asked rhetorically.\n\nsince 1992, democrats have run elections on a twin promise of cutting middle class taxes while making the rich pay their fair share. but since the passage of the 2017 tax cuts, there's a palpable willingness among democrats to talk about restoring higher taxes on the very wealthy, and perhaps even returning to rates abandoned decades ago. in iowa, warren suggested restoring the 50 percent estate tax on the very highest incomes, so that it would affect perhaps only the 10,000 wealthiest families in the country.\n\nthere are democrats looking at 2020 who will utterly reject that. but keep an eye on the democrats who see this as a starting point for a new debate.\n\nreading list\n\na look at some of the same warren rhetoric mentioned above, and how the senator harks back to a pre-reagan regulatory era as a time when the country was, while not perfect, a little greater.\n\nan origin story about warren's first connections with the online left, and liberals. she's not kidding when she suggests that the presidency was not in her sights until very recently.\n\ni came forward after ruben kihuen harassed me: here's what it cost me, by samantha register\n\n\n\none of the first-person essays on what it is actually like to blow the whistle on political sexual harassment.\n\ncountdown
but here near the developing complex on the banks of the ohio river, local democratic official earl butch shamp looks downstream at peduto and sees the kind of politician he says is killing the democratic party in large swaths of southwestern pennsylvania.\n\nad\n\nwhen people here hear the mayor, they hear someone who's just totally out of touch about where the jobs are, said shamp, the lone democrat on the potter township board of supervisors in beaver county, where the plant is located. the mayor should just stay out of it and stay in pittsburgh.\n\nad\n\nroyal dutch shell's giant petrochemical facility, which will crack natural gas molecules to produce a component for plastics, is also exposing a crack in pennsylvania's democratic party. for some, like peduto, the project is an environmental menace that undercuts the party's climate change agenda.\n\nfor others, like shamp, it is a catalyst for a region's economic revival and an opportunity to win over a white working class that believes democrats have prioritized social issues over their financial prosperity.\n\nwith pennsylvania expected to be a crucial battleground in the 2020 presidential contest, the local fissure is highlighting a national dilemma for the democratic party as it tries to address the environmental demands of liberal urban activists while reaching out to voters who rely on the manufacturing industry for jobs.\n\nthe party's failure to find that balance proved fateful in 2016, when blue-collar voters in the counties that surround pittsburgh abandoned democrats in droves, and donald trump carried the state by about 44,000 votes.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin pennsylvania, everything matters right now politically, said christopher p. borick, the director of the muhlenberg college institute of public opinion. this is certainly not where democrats want to be, in terms of finding a unified voice in a key swing state ahead of 2020.\n\nthe petrochemical plant has become a political crucible. president trump visited the shell site in august, speaking for more than an hour while surrounded by construction workers and touting the complex as one of the single biggest construction projects in the nation . . . made possible by clean, affordable, all-american natural gas.\n\nfor trump's political rivals, peduto has upped the ante by tying his potential endorsement to where the candidates stand on environmental matters. he has reached out to the campaigns of former new york mayor mike bloomberg and former south bend, ind., mayor pete buttigieg, hoping that they back his vision for more government funding for green industries.\n\npeduto said he is leaning toward bloomberg and buttigieg because the energy policy positions of sens. bernie sanders (i-vt.) and elizabeth warren (d-mass.) — who support a ban on fracking — would be devastating to the rust belt. conversely, biden's positions, he said, are more like donald trump's than they are a pragmatic approach toward the middle.\n\nshell's 400-acre facility relies on pennsylvania's vast reserves of natural gas, obtained by fracking shaleto produce ethylene, a component of plastic that is used for various consumer products, from food containers to furniture.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nits construction has generated 6,000 jobs already, and it is slated to employ 600 permanent workers when it opens in the early 2020s, according to the company. industry leaders and state officials say the area around the plant could turn into a hub for the petrochemical industry, producing more jobs, with tentative discussions about a half-dozen additional petrochemical facilities in nearby communities in pennsylvania, ohio and west virginia.\n\nworried about western pennsylvania becoming the next chemical alley, peduto shocked many observers in october when he called for a moratorium on cracker plants, against the wishes of corporate and labor leaders.\n\nthe shell plant is licensed to produce up to 1.6 million tons of polyethylene annually, a process that could involve emitting up to 522 tons of volatile organic compounds and 348 tons of nitrogen oxides annually. peduto said those emissions are equal to adding 450,000 vehicles to ­pittsburgh-area highways, severely undercutting the city's goal of being carbon neutral by 2030.\n\nad\n\nad\n\npeduto, who is in his second term, also worries that the plant will make it harder for him to attract and retain the medical and technology jobs that power pittsburgh's economy.\n\nwe have to be able to recognize that there is a new industry that has been built out in southwestern pennsylvania, and it is contingent upon clean air and clean water, peduto said, citing uber's and microsoft's recent investments in the region. and that industry is much more important than the legacy and industry of fossil fuel.\n\nthe blowback from other democrats has been intense. pennsylvania gov. tom wolf publicly broke with peduto on the issue, saying that the region cannot flourish economically without capitalizing on its natural resources, which he thinks can be done in an environmentally responsible way.\n\nad\n\nwe have to do it right, but we have to do it, or we are not going to have the future that we deserve, wolf said in an interview. i think you need the jobs of technology, which pittsburgh has, but i think you need to take advantage of your natural attributes, one of which is natural gas.\n\nad\n\nshell said it has taken steps to minimize the complex's environmental impact.\n\nwe designed our pennsylvania facility to obtain the lowest achievable emissions. that includes deployment of the best emissions control technologies available and one of the nation's most stringent leak detection and repair programs, the company said in an emailed statement.\n\npeduto's position is in line with his constituents' evolving politics. since trump's election, allegheny county, which includes pittsburgh and its immediate suburbs, has moved to the left politically, with democrats flipping two state senate seats and one seat on the county council.\n\nad\n\ntwo democratic socialists, sara innamorato and summer lee, also unseated incumbent democrats in state legislative races in allegheny county after they campaigned on environmental issues, including opposition to fracking.\n\nad\n\ncitizens are finally saying, 'we've had enough climate change, and we've had enough air pollution, and the last thing we want is the region to be inundated with even more bad air,'  said matt dixon, a pittsburgh environmental activist.\n\ndespite those recent democratic gains in allegheny county, the rest of southwestern pennsylvania has continued to move to the right. last year, republicans seized control of four county boards in historically democratic areas.\n\nad\n\npennsylvania republicans predict peduto's environmental views will drive even more voters away from democrats this year.\n\nthis is a guy who put together a $9 billion tax credit plan to try to lure amazon, but yet he wants to toss these jobs away? said allegheny county councilman sam demarco iii (r), referring to pittsburgh's unsuccessful effort to lure amazon's planned east coast headquarters. (amazon founder and ceo jeff bezos owns the washington post.)\n\nad\n\nin beaver county, shamp said democratic residents feel peduto cares more about building bike lanes than workers' ability to feed their families.\n\ndemocrats have just gone way, way too far to the left, said shamp, 61, who voted for trump in 2016 and probably will again. i don't believe in global warming. . . . i believe the earth goes in cycles, and we just happen to be in a warming cycle right now.\n\nresidents who live in the river towns near the plant say the local economy has dramatically improved since construction of the plant began in late 2017.\n\nad\n\nunemployment has fallen to about 5 percent, approximately half of what it was a decade ago. residents have seen the construction of several new motels and are eagerly awaiting the opening of a popular pittsburgh dining staple, primanti brothers, which is known for heaping french fries onto thickly sliced sandwiches.\n\nad\n\nafter all of these years of people talking about the steel mills closing and crying about that, there are now 'help wanted' signs everywhere, said ed becker, owner of bowser's restaurant, where customers can get a pound of spaghetti and two meatballs for $6 on thursdays. actually, they have to put 'help wanted' banners up — it's not even a sign anymore.\n\nin vanport, a small town that sits across the river from the plant, margo collins said her neighbor's house is on the market for $220,000 — more than double what she bought her similarly sized house for five years ago.\n\ncollins, 54, who described herself as a lifelong democrat who now supports trump, said that kind of economic benefit makes it hard to consider the plant's effect on her health and the environment.
dear miss manners: do you have a suitable answer to those who say to me, an older woman, you must have been attractive when you were young'' or, after looking at an earlier photo, is that you?''\n\nand you must have been charming.''\n\ni seem to recall that it was.''\n\ndear miss manners: some contractors came to my home to do work in my backyard. they were there for just one day.\n\nabout halfway through the day, i thought to bring them out some water, as that seemed only decent, especially on a warm day. is the water enough? should i have offered the water right away when they arrived? should i have brought them something else or a bit of light food? i thought of giving them some muffins, but i had made the baked goods several days prior and was afraid they would be stale.\n\nshould contractors who are not working indoors be automatically given leave to use the restrooms of the home? i was at home alone with a young baby, so i admit i was wary about letting unfamiliar men inside the house.\n\nmy grandfather was a contractor before he retired, and he told us that often such workers are treated poorly, or like they don't exist. i want to be better than that, and i should think offering a bit of water is the bare minimum of common courtesy. please let me know if there is anything else i am missing.\n\nwhile not absolutely denying that there may be rare situations in which a homeowner would be unable to provide on-site bathroom access, miss manners nevertheless considers it unkind, if not rude — as well as highly impractical. she would understand if the resulting lost productivity due to workers having to leave the site and return was included in the bill.\n\nwater on a warm day is an equally basic requirement. however, she is ambivalent about more extensive food service. the contractor and his cohorts are employees. this relieves you of any technical etiquette requirement to provide food as if they were guests. but you may wish to consider whether doing the bare minimum required is a behavior you wish to model for people working on your home.\n\ndear miss manners: when you write a sympathy card to someone relating that you were sad to learn that they lost their mother, is it proper to capitalize mother? even though it is not a grammar requirement, i have always thought to do this. we are wondering about this at my work.\n\ngiven the context, miss manners infers that you believe capitalizing increases the deference, importance or respect being accorded to the deceased.\n\nthe problem is that she, like the addressee, can only guess at your intention. to be intelligible, conventions must be generally understood. they do change: in an email-driven world, everyone now understands that full capitalization means a raised voice, usually in anger. but if you and your co-workers cannot decide the difference between mother and mother, it is unlikely that the bereaved will understand.\n\nnew miss manners columns are posted sundays, tuesdays and thursdays on washingtonpost.com/advice. you can send questions to miss manners at her website, missmanners.com.
it seems so surreal, you're so used to it not being this way, said joe darger, a utah polygamist who has three wives.\n\nutah gov. gary r. herbert (r) has indicated he will probably sign the proposal that makes polygamy between consenting adults an infraction, like a traffic offense, that carries no jail time.\n\nad\n\nthis one has overwhelming support, though it's not without some controversy, herbert said during his monthly news conference at pbs utah on thursday. eliminating it from being a felony to a lesser offense is probably warranted.\n\nad\n\nsome former members of polygamous groups have said that essentially decriminalizing the practice could embolden abusers.\n\nthe legislature is jumping off a ledge without looking at the landing, said ryan fisher, a spokesman for the anti-polygamy group sound choices coalition. the bill got approval from the full legislature after a final procedural vote in the senate on friday.\n\nthe belief that plural marriage brings exaltation in heaven is a legacy of the early church of jesus christ of latter-day saints. the mainstream faith abandoned the practice in 1890 under pressure from the u.s. government and now strictly forbids it, but it has persisted.\n\nad\n\nthose who practice it have one legal marriage and multiple spiritual wives. the tv show sister wives chronicles the lives of one man and his four wives.\n\nad\n\nthe utah attorney general has publicly declined to prosecute otherwise law-abiding polygamists for years, but the sister wives family left the state shortly after going public, saying they were afraid of prosecution. they later lost an attempt to overturn the polygamy law in court.\n\nthe republican sponsoring the proposed change, sen. deidre henderson, has argued that notorious polygamous leaders such as warren jeffs have weaponized state law to keep followers from interacting with the outside world or going to police. henderson's proposal still includes harsher punishments for crimes linked to polygamy, such as coerced marriage and sexual abuse.\n\nad\n\njeffs is serving a life sentence in texas for sexually assaulting girls he considered plural wives.\n\nfears of the outside world were real for alina darger, one of joe darger's wives. as a teenager, she was afraid to tell police about a stranger who exposed himself to her and a friend.\n\nad\n\ni was afraid if i did they'd come to the house and see my dad had two wives and take us away, she said. now the head of a nonprofit outreach group called cherish families, alina darger said the legal change will help her connect polygamous communities to services ranging from child welfare to student loans.\n\ni deserve to be able to call on law enforcement, she said. i deserve the same rights as other people.
the 3,600-word letter was largely prescriptive and spiritually oriented. it did not call for new measures to punish high-ranking clerics or hold them accountable — steps recommended by victim advocacy groups.\n\nad\n\ninstead, francis made a case that the problem required more than stern decrees or improving flow charts, as if we were in charge of a department of human resources. he also referenced divisions within the u.s. ranks.\n\npope francis's 17-ton vehicle was flown to panama city from colombia on dec. 28, as panama prepared to host him for the catholic church's world day of youth. (reuters)\n\nad\n\nlet us try to break the vicious circle of recrimination, undercutting and discrediting, by avoiding gossip and slander in the pursuit of a path of prayerful and contrite acceptance of our limitations and sins, francis wrote.\n\nfrancis's letter came as the u.s. bishops were gathering for a week-long retreat focused on prayer and spiritual reflection at a seminary outside chicago. that retreat, which is closed to the media, was suggested by francis after he met in september with several u.s. catholic leaders.\n\nad\n\nfor some vatican watchers, the letter provided signals about how francis is trying to guide the church through the most turbulent period of his papacy, while dealing with fractures — in the united states and beyond — over the reasons for the clerical abuse scourge. francis has repeatedly connected the issue to abuses of power and clerics who have lost sight of their mission. but some church traditionalists say he has overlooked a problem of homosexuality in the priesthood.\n\nad\n\ntensions have grown between rome and the u.s. church after a year of abuse-related scandals. when the pope was accused by a former diplomat of knowing about some of the alleged abuses of former cardinal theodore mccarrick, a handful of u.s. higher-ups said the accusations were credible. subsequently, francis did not green-light an investigation into mccarrick requested by the head of the u.s. bishops conference, houston's cardinal daniel dinardo. and the vatican intervened to halt the u.s. bishops at their annual meeting in november from voting on new measures for handling abuse-related complaints.\n\nnext month, bishops from around the world will meet in rome for a summit on sexual abuse and the protection of minors. francis in his letter did not mention that gathering but called for a collegial and paternal response, rather than one in which some emerge as 'winners' and others not.\n\nad\n\nthe pope urged the church leaders to acknowledge our hurt before the present situation and [let] ourselves together be summoned anew by god's word.\n\nad\n\nlook, i can understand the catholics who might scoff and say, 'we don't need more discernment. we need action,'  said john gehring, the catholic program director at faith in public life, an advocacy group in washington. i think what the pope is saying is we need the deep discernment and the change of heart before we get to the policy.\n\nscandals in multiple countries over the past year have highlighted the church's struggle to deal with both abusive clerics and higher-ups who failed to stop them.\n\nad
ahead of a cold front moving from southwest to northeast, strong, dry winds out of the northwest helped instigate new blazes, vaulting embers from fire lines into areas not already ablaze. the fires knocked out power and water in some communities and forced the government to call up the military to assist in firefighting efforts.\n\nas of saturday evening, the rural fire service of new south wales still had emergency warnings, the most severe level, in effect. these warnings were communicated using dire language: the fire is spreading quickly. if you are in tallong, werai, exeter, manchester square, avoca, fitzroy falls, barrengary or surrounding areas it is too late to leave. seek shelter as fire approaches, read one such warning for the morton fire.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nparticularly hard-hit on saturday were the southern highlands, a wine-growing region about 70 miles southwest of sydney, where high winds caused flames to surge northward into populated areas.\n\nit's unusual for bush fires to rage throughout the night, given that temperatures tend to drop overnight, but during saturday night local time a sustained period of high winds caused flames to continue to spread rapidly.\n\nbecause the cold front is still making its way through the area of most intense fire activity, the hottest part of the day came and went with little to no relief. this allowed temperatures to soar to what appears to be a record-high temperature for sydney, with penrith, located in the far western reaches of the metropolitan area, hitting 120 degrees (48.9 celsius). in addition, canberra, the nation's capital, hit a record high of 110 degrees (43.6 celsius), breaking the previous record of 109 degrees set in 1939.\n\nmany of the fires that intensified saturday developed smoke plumes that were vaulted high into the atmosphere. some turned into what are known as pyrocumulonimbus clouds, which are thunderstorms birthed by the combination of rising heat, smoke particles and water vapor from a major fire. at one point on saturday, australia's bureau of meteorology issued a thunderstorm warning for storms generated by smoke plumes.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthese pyrocb clouds, as they are known in the meteorology community, typically indicate that a fire is exhibiting extreme behavior, since they help a blaze draw in more surrounding air and can shift surface winds while also giving rise to fire tornadoes. a young firefighter in australia died when a fire tornado overturned his vehicle.\n\non friday into saturday, fires also erupted in other parts of australia, including a destructive blaze on kangaroo island in south australia. that island is home to a nature preserve that contains numerous unique species. fires have devastated habitat for iconic animals that are only found in australia, including koalas and rare birds, though the toll on wildlife will not be fully known for some time.\n\none week of imagery from the himawari satellite shows smoke from fires in australia drifting over new zealand. (john muyskens)\n\nbush fires are expected to continue burning through the weekend and in the weeks and months to come as australia enters its dry season in a precariously hot and desiccated position. however, the fire weather forecast for the next few days features cooler weather, which could help weary firefighters hold flames back behind containment lines.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nlast year was the hottest and driest year on record in the country, and december turned out to be one of the top two hottest months ever recorded. december featured the country's hottest day on record as well. no significant rain is expected in the hardest-hit areas of new south wales and victoria for months.\n\nwhile bush fires are a regular occurrence during the australian dry season, a combination of long-term climate change and natural variability is making the situation far worse.\n\nthe combustible climate mix\n\nhuman-caused global warming is raising the odds of and severity of extreme-heat events and also adding to the severity of wildfires by speeding the drying of the landscape, among other influences. one of the most robust conclusions of climate studies has been that human-caused warming would increase the frequency and severity of heat waves and also boost the occurrence of days with extreme fire danger.\n\nboth trends are playing out in australia, a country that has recently seen other severe climate impacts in the form of marine heat waves that devastated parts of the great barrier reef.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe southern part of australia has warmed by 2.7 degrees since 1950, according to climate researcher zeke hausfather, climate and energy director at the breakthrough institute. this is consistent with the period of faster human-caused warming worldwide.\n\nthe unusually warm and dry year in australia is also due, in part, to a weather pattern that has set up across the indian ocean. it's known as the indian ocean dipole, or iod, which is an air circulation pattern in the indian ocean. when the iod is in its positive phase, the water is cooler than average off the coast of sumatra, leading to reduced atmospheric lift there and reduced rainfall over australia, and there are warmer-than-average waters off the coast of africa.\n\na positive iod the past two years has meant drier-than-average conditions in much of australia. the bureau of meteorology found that it is unusual to have back-to-back years with a positive dipole, which helps influence precipitation patterns across south asia and oceania.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthis natural climate cycle is changing over time as ocean and air temperatures rise in response to increased amounts of greenhouse gases from human activities, namely the burning of fossil fuels for energy. this is expected to make back-to-back positive iod events more common and make australia even more prone to drought conditions accompanied by extreme heat.\n\nwhile the iod is a natural mode of variability, its behavior is changing in response to climate change. research suggests that the frequency of positive iod events, and particularly the occurrence of consecutive events will increase as global temperatures rise, the bureau stated.\n\nthe scale of the ongoing disaster in australia is difficult to fathom even for those on the ground. at least 12 million acres have gone up in smoke so far in victoria and new south wales alone, which dwarfs the amount of land that burned in california's worst fire season in 2018. it is equivalent to the burning of the entire state of west virginia.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nsmoke from the blazes has made it to south america, a journey of 9,000 miles, and some may stay aloft for months, having a small effect on the planet's climate.\n\non the ground, though, residents in affected areas feel helpless and scared, and increasingly weary.\n\nrebecca butterworth, a house painter and journalist in albury, a city in southern new south wales, says it has been surreal to hear the small towns in the picturesque murray-darling basin, some of which have populations under 100, mentioned on national newscasts.
also announcing her retirement, on their shared website, was eaton's wife, brianne theisen-eaton, who won a heptathlon bronze for canada at rio and is the reigning indoor pentathlon champion. the pair met while competing at oregon and were married in 2013.\n\nnoting that it has been 10 years since his first experience in the decathlon, eaton said, it's my time to depart from athletics; to do something new. frankly there isn't much more i want to do in sport.\n\nad\n\nad\n\neaton has done more than most, considering that, at rio, he became just the third decathlete ever to repeat as olympic champion, joining fellow american bob mathias (1948, 1952) and great britain's daley thompson (1980, 1984). since coming in second at the 2011 world championships in daegu, south korea, eaton has triumphed in every major international competition, including two world championships and three indoor heptathlon championships.\n\nat the 2015 outdoor championships in beijing, eaton set the mark at decathlon with 9,045 points, breaking the world record of 9,039 points he set at the 2012 u.s. olympic trials in eugene, ore. eaton is just the second man to surpass 9,000 points, joining roman sebrle of the czech republic, and the first to do it twice.\n\neaton paid tribute to sebrle on wednesday as a childhood inspiration, recalling seeing the czech champion on the cover of a newspaper with a suggestion that he would be earth's representative in an interstellar olympics. a few years later, someone asked whether eaton, an oregon native, wanted to try the decathlon, and the result was a competitor that trey hardee, the 2011 world champion, described wednesday as the goat [greatest of all time].\n\ni gave the most physically robust years of my life to the discovery and pursuit of my limits in this domain, eaton said on his website. did i reach them? truthfully i'm not sure anyone really does. it seems like we tend to run out of time or will before we run out of potential. that makes humanity limitless then, as far as i'm concerned. and i think that's inspiring.\n\nas the start of the 2017 season drew nearer, i felt more and more resistant to begin training, theisen-eaton said. i gave the last 4 years everything i could. i put my life on hold. track and field was the priority before everything else: my family, my friends, my marriage, my future. this is something i chose to do and i don't regret it for a second. it made me happy to pursue something i was so passionate about.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbut i've done it. i went after what i set out to do and whether i achieved it or fell short is not the point. the point is that i know deep down that i gave it every ounce of energy i had and that if i went back and did it all over again, i would not change a thing; i could not have done anything better.\n\nin the multi-events, where there are so many pitfalls, they have avoided those pitfalls, harry marra, the eatons' longtime coach, who also officiated their wedding, told the oregonian. but how long could they go on like that? at some point, something will bite you.\n\nhow many athletes have you seen who were the best in the world who hang on for the extra money or the notoriety, and they don't do it as well? something goes haywire. ash and brianne can walk away now, satisfied they have done everything they can do to be the best they can be.

how quickly they forget.\n\njust as joe flacco, the quarterback who had once led the ravens to a super bowl victory, had become yesterday's news while jackson was leading the ravens to a 6-1 record and the afc north title during the past two months, jackson had lost the faith of the fans. many of those same people who had pilloried flacco early in the season were asking to get him back on the field.\n\nad\n\nthe ravens were trailing the los angeles chargers by 17 at that moment, and there was no doubting that jackson's day had been a nightmare. his passer rating through three quarters was 0.0. that's not a typo. he had completed 3 of 10 passes for 25 yards and had been sacked five times.\n\nin the third quarter, the ravens had blocked a field goal, blocked a punt and recovered a fumble. all of that had produced only a 33-yard justin tucker field goal and a 50-yard tucker miss when coach john harbaugh decided against going for a first down on a fourth and two at the los angeles 32-yard-line.\n\nad\n\nwe just played like we didn't want to be here, jackson said of those first three quarters. i did, not my team. i feel like i played poorly. there were a lot of things we could have done — i could have done — to put us in a better situation. we have to get a move on to get ready for next year.\n\nad\n\nthis year is over for the ravens, even though they managed to rally — without flacco ever seeing the field — to close the gap to 23-17, getting the ball with less than a minute remaining and the chance to take the lead. they did so in large part because the chargers, who had played so well for three quarters, went to a prevent defense that finally allowed jackson time to throw and made critical errors on both sides of the ball.\n\nit was just too little, too late, and the game ended with jackson being strip-sacked by the chargers' uchenna nwosu on a snap from the baltimore 47 with 26 seconds left. melvin ingram fell on the ball, ending the ravens' season.\n\nad\n\nthey played winning football, ravens coach john harbaugh said. playoff football is complementary football. need all three phases to play well. all three phases competed, but we just didn't play our best game.\n\nad\n\nplayoff football is different. the ravens had beaten the chargers in los angeles two weeks earlier, their defense dominating while the jackson-led run-first offense did enough to win the game with relative ease.\n\nbut facing a good team twice in three weeks — even playing at home — is never easy. and in the playoffs, everyone knows at the start of every game that it's win or go home. from the start, the chargers had extra safeties on the field in place of linebackers to account for jackson's speed and elusiveness. on the game's opening play, jackson took off on one of the run-pass option runs he had had so much success with and was tackled for a one-yard loss by chargers rookie safety derwin james.\n\nad\n\nthat turned out to be a harbinger. the extra speed added to the chargers' defense helped them attack and contain jackson for most of the afternoon.\n\njackson, playing his first postseason game, and the ravens, playing their first since 2014, were clearly tight in the early going. during one stretch, they fumbled the ball on three straight plays, recovering the first two by jackson but losing the third, from running back kenneth dixon. the chargers took over at the baltimore 15-yard line, which led to the first of michael badgley's five field goals and a 3-0 lead.\n\nad\n\nbadgley's leg and the los angeles defense controlled the first half. the ravens had six possessions: punt, fumble, punt, punt, interception, punt. only the fact that the ravens' defense kept the chargers out of the end zone allowed them to be within striking distance, down 12-0 at the break.\n\nad\n\nthat was when the flacco questions began. clearly, los angeles had adjusted its defense to force jackson to throw more — often with little time. should the ravens force the chargers to change their defense again by going back to flacco, a dropback passer with a stronger arm, who might be able to open things up in the l.a. secondary?\n\nharbaugh admitted he thought about it. he could even be seen talking to flacco on the bench early in the third quarter, leading to speculation he was going to make a change.\n\nad\n\nbut he never did, even as the offense sputtered through the third quarter. it was after the chargers had stretched their lead to 20-3 on the second play of the fourth quarter that the booing reached a crescendo when harbaugh stuck with jackson.\n\nwe certainly thought about it, certainly talked about it with everybody, harbaugh said. i can tell you this, everybody was on the same page with what we did. everybody, including joe. that's where it was at.\n\nad\n\nhelped by the chargers backing off their defense with a 23-3 lead, jackson was able to engineer two touchdown drives that cut the score to 23-17 with 1:59 left. by then, the boos had stopped and those who hadn't headed for the parking lots early were back on the jackson bandwagon. when the ravens got a three-and-out, helped by a foolish and controversial holding penalty by chargers tackle russell okung that wiped out what would have been a game-clinching first-down run by melvin gordon, the building was electric. a miracle seemed possible.\n\nad\n\nall the ravens had to do was go 66 yards in 45 seconds with no timeouts left. difficult, certainly, but not impossible.\n\nexcept it wasn't to be. the ravens came up 57 yards shy of a miracle finish after jackson's fumble.\n\nthe chargers are on to new england, the ravens to the offseason. harbaugh left no doubt that, sunday's performance aside, jackson is now the ravens' starting quarterback. flacco — after 11 seasons — will be traded.\n\nad\n\nit's not in my hands, flacco, who turns 34 later this month, said of his future, which is true because he's still under contract next season. he added that he had never expected to play sunday, then dressed quickly and headed for the exit of the locker room.\n\nad\n\nlamar's our quarterback going forward, harbaugh said. joe flacco is going to play really well in this league. . . . joe is going to have a market. a lot of teams are going to want joe.\n\nfor a while this afternoon, the fans who cheered flacco so often in the past wanted him, too.\n\njackson's time in baltimore is just beginning, even though it is over for this season. flacco's time — after six postseason trips as the starting quarterback — is over. the building where he was a hero for so long now belongs to jackson.\n\nfor more by john feinstein, visit washingtonpost.com/feinstein.
most of the justices appeared to think the some benefit standard was less than what congress envisioned. but they also seemed to be struggling to come up with language for a higher standard that would be grounded in the law and clear enough to be meaningful and enforceable, but flexible enough to apply to children with widely varying levels and types of disabilities.\n\nduring the hour-long oral argument, they grappled with the differences between various levels of educational benefit: some, barely more than de minimis, significant, meaningful, appropriate in light of the child's circumstances.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwhat is frustrating about this case and this statute, said justice samuel a. alito jr., is we have a blizzard of words.\n\nthe plaintiff in the case, endrew f. v. douglas county school district, is an autistic boy whose parents pulled him out of public school after his behavior deteriorated dramatically and he made what they said was almost no academic progress. they placed their son in private school, where he made rapid progress, and they sought reimbursement for tuition. they are entitled to that reimbursement if they can prove that the public school failed to provide a free appropriate public education under federal law.\n\nthe child and his parents lost their case before the u.s. court of appeals for the 10th circuit, which is among the majority of circuit courts of appeals that subscribe to the some benefit standard. a minority of circuit courts have set higher expectations for schools, and the supreme court now has a chance to set a uniform standard for the nation.\n\nad\n\nad\n\njeffrey fisher, a stanford university law professor representing the family, suggested several different formulations for a new and higher standard, including that schools be required to provide services that are reasonably calculated to provide substantially equal educational opportunities. irv gornstein, a lawyer for the obama administration, supported the plaintiff's position that the some educational benefit bar is too low and suggested wording that the services be reasonably calculated to make progress that is appropriate in light of the child's circumstances.\n\nneal k. katyal, representing the colorado school district, argued that the some benefit standard is what federal law requires. he said that standard has worked well, and that courts don't know enough about educational approaches to determine whether schools are meeting a more ambiguous standard of significant progress. revising the standard that currently applies to most of the country now is unfair to states that have accepted federal funding for children with disabilities based on their understanding of current law, he said.\n\nto change it … is to invite massive amounts of litigation, katyal said.\n\nad\n\nad
in this litigation, the city seeks to shift the costs of protecting the city from climate change impacts back onto the companies that have done nearly all they could to create this existential threat, reads the lawsuit, brought by new york corporation counsel zachary carter and filed in u.s. district court for the southern district of new york.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe legal strategy has already been embraced by several california cities and counties, but prior lawsuits seeking to blame companies for their role in causing climate change have foundered.\n\nit remains unclear whether a new wave of litigation — propelled by stronger climate science, reports about how much some companies knew about climate change decades ago, and somewhat divergent legal strategies — will succeed where those efforts failed.\n\nin california last year, marin county, san mateo county and the city of imperial beach similarly sued a group of fossil fuel companies over damage related to climate change — citing a theory called public nuisance, which basically argues that companies are causing an injury to the localities under common law. the cities of san francisco and oakland and the city and county of santa cruz have also filed suit.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ni think the significant development here is that this is the first of these cases in this last year that's filed outside of california, said michael burger, who directs the sabin center for climate change law at columbia university. if more and more localities sue, we might be able to see adequate pressure applied to these companies to inspire action on climate change, he said.\n\nso far, that has not been the response. exxonmobil has instead reacted strongly to the claims, seeking in texas court to depose california state officials and others involved in bringing the cases for potential claims of abuse of process, civil conspiracy, and violation of exxonmobil's civil rights.\n\nclimate change is a complex societal challenge that should be addressed through sound government policy and cultural change to drive low-carbon choices for businesses and consumers, curtis smith, head of u.s. media relations for shell, wrote by email, not by the courts.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbp and conocophillips, two other defendants named in the lawsuit, declined to comment.\n\nexxon responded to new york's lawsuit on its blog, where the firm has also challenged investigative reports from insideclimate news and the los angeles times that showed the company was an early pioneer in climate-change science in the 1980s, reports that were cited in the suit.\n\nexxonmobil welcomes any well-meaning and good faith attempt to address the risks of climate change, wrote suzanne mccarron, exxon's vice president of public and government affairs. reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue and requires global participation and actions. lawsuits of this kind — filed by trial attorneys against an industry that provides products we all rely upon to power the economy and enable our domestic life — simply do not do that.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nchevron spokesman braden reddall said in an email: this lawsuit is factually and legally meritless, and will do nothing to address the serious issue of climate change. reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue that requires global engagement. should this litigation proceed, it will only serve special interests at the expense of broader policy, regulatory and economic priorities.\n\nseveral prior cases challenging individual companies based on a public-nuisance theory have failed — including at the supreme court, which ruled in 2011 that climate action by the environmental protection agency in effect removed the ability to use the courts as a remedy.\n\nbut the difference now, burger said, is that the claims are being brought under state, rather than federal, common law — and that strategy remains to be tested.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nnew york charges in the lawsuit that it is spending billions of dollars to protect its coastlines, its infrastructure and its citizens from climate warming.\n\nto deal with what the future will inevitably bring, the city must build sea walls, levees, dunes, and other coastal armament, and elevate and harden a vast array of city-owned structures, properties, and parks along its coastline, the lawsuit says. the costs of these largely unfunded projects run to many billions of dollars and far exceed the city's resources.\n\nthe suit does not specify precisely how much money it is asking for from the oil companies in what it calls compensatory damages, saying that should be established in the case.\n\nad\n\nat a news conference wednesday afternoon, new york city mayor bill de blasio focused on the devastation caused by hurricane sandy in 2012, calling it a tragedy wrought by the actions of the fossil fuel companies. he detailed the 44 people who died in new york as a result of sandy, as well as the estimated $19 billion in damage it caused. that is the face of climate change, de blasio said. that is what it means in human and real terms.\n\nad\n\nde blasio claimed fossil fuel companies were complicit in worsening climate change, because they knew of the problem decades ago but continued to sell a product to americans that contributed to only more greenhouse-gas emissions.\n\nthe city of new york is taking on these five giants because they are the central actors, they are the first ones responsible for this crisis and they should not get away with it anymore, he said, adding: we're going after those who have profited. and what a horrible, disgusting way to profit — the way it puts so many people's lives in danger.\n\nad\n\nit's time that they are held accountable, de blasio said. it's time that things change in the way we do business.\n\nin addition to the litigation, officials said they expect to divest up to $5 billion in investments from as many as 190 companies with fossil fuel ties, even as they promised to maintain their fiduciary duty to new york's pensioners.\n\nad\n\nwe're using this moment to send a message to the world, said new york city comptroller scott stringer. we believe a green economy is a thriving economy.\n\nbill mckibben, an author and co-founder of the climate advocacy group 350.org, praised the city's actions wednesday.\n\ni've been watching the climate fight for the last 30 years, mckibben told reporters. this is one of the handful of most important moments in that 30-year fight.\n\nad\n\nbut the oil and gas lobby said that by not investing in their industry, new york was doing city workers a disservice.\n\ntoday mayor de blasio turned his back on millions of first responders, police officers and public employees who depend on their pensions to provide for themselves and their families in retirement, said karen moreau, new york executive director for the american petroleum institute, the largest u.s. oil and gas lobbying group. government pension managers have a responsibility by law to seek the greatest return for their investors and pensions that invest in oil and natural gas companies have historically delivered a stronger return than other investments.

outside the united states or coming in contact with another patient known to have the infection, the first sign that the disease may be spreading within a local community, the centers for disease control and prevention reported wednesday night. how the person acquired the respiratory disease is unknown. it's possible this could be an instance of community spread of covid-19, which would be the first time this has happened in the united states, the cdc said in a statement. the health agency left open the possibility, however that the patient may have been exposed to a returned traveler who was infected. the state of california, however, called the case its first instance of community transmission. the case was first reported by the washington post. community spread would represent a significant turn for the worse in the battle against the virus. to date, the united states has 60 known cases of the infection, with 59 among people who traveled to asia or were spouses of people who went there. the vast majority, 42, picked up the virus while quarantined on the diamond princess cruise ship off japan. the cdc said the case was detected through the u.s. public health system — picked up by astute clinicians. the agency said only that the person lived in california. if the infection is confirmed to be a case of community spread, said jennifer nuzzo, epidemiologist and senior scholar at the johns hopkins center for health security, it would confirm what we have long suspected — that there is a good chance there already are people infected in this country and that the virus is circulating undetected. it points to the need for expanded surveillance so we know how many more are out there and how to respond. the individual is a resident of solano county, according to the california department of public health. the patient is being treated at uc davis medical center, according to a person familiar with the case who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the

it would not meet the fiscal third-quarter guidance it offered in january for the unit that includes its windows operating system sales. at the time, microsoft said it expected $10.75 billion to $11.15 billion in quarterly revenue for its more personal computing segment. while demand from personal computer makers for windows remains strong, the company said the supply chain for the business is returning to normal operations at a slower pace than anticipated because of the coronavirus outbreak. as a result, the company believes it will not meet its earlier guidance for the segment. microsoft did not provide an updated forecast. but stifel nicolaus & co. analyst brad reback, who had expected microsoft to generate between $3 billion and $4 billion in sales of windows to pc makers in the quarter, said it is not absurd to think half of that could be impacted. and several hundred million dollars of sales from microsoft's surface pc business also could be at risk, he said. but

the white house has sought to tamp down criticism from democrats in recent days by projecting an air of confidence and competence, with trump presiding late wednesday over an interagency briefing in the situation room. he also announced a new task force of senior aides to lead the government's response, including screenings at 20 u.s. airports, the repatriation of u.s. citizens from china and efforts to develop a potential vaccine to treat the novel virus.\n\nthe disease, dubbed a public health emergency by the world health organization, has left more than 200 dead and infected more than 9,000 people in china and taiwan, along with about 100 confirmed cases outside that country, including six people in the united states.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthis is no cause for urgent panic in any way in the united states, adm. brett giroir, assistant secretary of health, told reporters at the white house on thursday. this is currently under control. but really, this is a dynamic and rapidly changing event, and the news can change at any moment. but the resources are deployed, the government is mobilized and we feel confident — we know the right steps to take to contain it.\n\nyet the vast uncertainty over the contagiousness and lethality of the coronavirus, which originated in the chinese city of wuhan, and the complicated geopolitics given beijing's poor record of transparency in handling infectious diseases, have increased the stakes for the trump administration. so has the president's interest in an election year of restoring more normal trade relations with china after years of tariff battles.\n\ndemocrats, including 2020 presidential candidates joe biden, the former vice president, and sen. elizabeth warren (mass.), have warned that the president's policies have made the united states more vulnerable to an infectious disease crisis.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthey pointed to the dismantling of a global health security team in 2018 during a reorganization of the white house's national security council. and in an op-ed published in usa today on monday, biden called trump the worst possible leader to oversee the government's response, citing his call for then-president barack obama to implement a travel ban on west african countries during the ebola crisis even though public health experts opposed such a move.\n\ni remember how trump sought to stoke fear and stigma. . . . he called president barack obama a 'dope' and 'incompetent' and railed against the evidence-based response our administration put in place, biden wrote.\n\ntrump has been uncharacteristically muted on the coronavirus. on wednesday, he tweeted out photos of his situation room briefing and professed that his administration is working closely with china. we have the best experts anywhere in the world, and they are on top of it 24/7! he wrote.\n\nad\n\nad\n\none senior administration official said trump has been hesitant to speak out because some aides have cautioned that he could unnecessarily cause public alarm — and assured him that china is working hard to keep the virus under control. but increasingly, there is a feeling among aides that the president must say more, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.\n\nheath and human services secretary alex azar, who is leading the new task force, provided trump with a briefing on china's response that prompted the president to issue a more positive tweet last week about beijing's performance than other officials, believed was warranted, the senior aide said.\n\nthis week, acting chief of staff mick mulvaney began holding daily meetings focused on the issue, officials said, and aides have begun discussing how they could safely evacuate people from china, along with where they could be placed in the united states.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nsome administration officials and members of congress have expressed concern over how transparent beijing has been in accounting for the breadth of the virus and its failure so far to share full data with the united states and other countries.\n\nmeanwhile, some u.s. lawmakers have pressed for a targeted travel ban from china, which sen. tom cotton (r-okla.), a close white house ally, said in a letter to the administration was warranted to protect americans until we know more about the virus and the outbreak is under control.\n\ntrump's 2020 campaign countered biden's criticism by pointing to remarks he made in april 2009 during an outbreak of swine flu that he would counsel his own family not to ride the subway or airplanes, which a white house spokesman later said might have caused people to be unduly alarmed.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthis is another attempt by a failing candidate to gain credibility on an issue where he has almost none, trump campaign spokeswoman sarah matthews said of biden.\n\nexperts said the new coronavirus appears to be more contagious but far less deadly than ebola, which is thought to have infected more than 28,000 people and killed more than 11,000 during the 2014 outbreak. but china already has confirmed more cases of coronavirus than of sars, a more deadly coronavirus, during an outbreak that spread through asia in 2002 and 2003.\n\nas the midterm elections approached in fall 2014, trump and numerous gop leaders faulted obama for his response to ebola. obama appointed ron klain, who has worked in multiple democratic administrations in several roles, as the administration's ebola czar.\n\nad\n\nall told, four people in the united states were found to have contracted the disease, including a liberian national who died while visiting dallas. the other three recovered, and obama declared a qualified victory in early 2015 during an event at the white house with public health professionals.\n\nad\n\nin an essay in the atlantic on thursday, klain said trump's 2014 criticism amounted to a virulent, xenophobic, fearmongering outburst. he cited a study from the obama white house's office of digital strategy that concluded trump's tweets were a driving factor in instilling a sense of unfounded fear over ebola among the american public.\n\ntrump will have to trust the kind of government experts he has disdained to date, set aside his own terrible instincts, lead from the white house, and work closely with foreign leaders and global institutions — all things he has failed to do in his first 1,200 days in office, wrote klain, who is advising biden's campaign.\n\nad\n\nsome global health security experts said that a more senior white house official should be in charge of the trump administration's response given that azar has little authority over other agencies. critics pointed to the 2018 restructuring at the nsc that led to the departure of rear adm. timothy ziemer, who had overseen a team dedicated to the u.s. response to a deadly pandemic, as weakening the senior-level attention.\n\nad\n\nthis is much bigger than hhs, said j. stephen morrison, senior vice president at the center for strategic and international studies. there's a sluggishness built into the system by the way they have structured themselves.\n\nbut tim morrison, who served on the nsc from 2018-2019, said ziemer's team was merged with another nsc department and experts remain on the white house staff. he cited the administration's handling of an ebola outbreak in the congo in 2018 as evidence that the white house remains capable of coordinating an effective response to an international threat.\n\nad\n\nwhite house national security adviser robert o'brien and his deputy, matthew pottinger, a fluent mandarin speaker, are also on the president's task force. vice president pence has been involved in interagency meetings.\n\ni think the administration is actually running a very effective process, said morrison, now a senior fellow at the conservative hudson institute. they don't need an ebola czar the way the obama administration needed one. they've got the apparatus in place.\n\nad\n\non capitol hill, lawmakers have been in touch with azar and other senior administration officials, and democrats have mostly refrained from overt criticism of trump, even as they pressed the administration to devote sufficient resources to managing the situation.\n\na global pandemic is like a meteor coming out of the sky, said a

i didn't react much, grubauer said. it was a sinker. we talked about it after the period; i've never seen a puck change direction so much.\n\nthe puck found the back of the net but was immediately waved off, the play whistled dead for offside. even when you think you've scored an even-strength goal on the capitals, you haven't. philipp grubauer's 24-save shutout against the philadelphia flyers on sunday afternoon extended the washington's streak of not allowing an even-strength goal that began with a jan. 3 game against toronto. it's been nearly 299 minutes of even-strength ice time.\n\nin his past five starts, braden holtby is undefeated with a 0.60 goals-against average and a 0.978 save percentage. grubauer didn't allow for any drop off on sunday, especially in the first two periods when the rest of his teammates were sleepwalking through the game.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nour goalie seemed to be not letting anything in, justin williams said. it's always nice.\n\nsaid andre burakovsky: i think goalies have been really, really good lately. we have probably two of the best goalies in the league. i mean, grubauer has been phenomenal this year for us. i mean, they get a lot of help from the [defensemen], too. they're boxing out and make it easier for the goalies, but i just think the whole team is doing a really good job in the d-zone and all over the ice on the defensive side.\n\nthe capitals have now had four shutouts in their past six games, a key to their nine-game winning streak. holtby's run has rightfully been garnering a lot of attention, but grubauer has quietly put together an impressive season. he's 8-1-1 with .935 save percentage and 1.74 goals-against average this season. he'll be a restricted free agent at the end of the season and due for a pay raise.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nsunday was his first appearance in net in nearly two weeks, but he won't have to wait so long for a start again. while holtby is scheduled to start in pittsburgh on monday night, coach barry trotz said grubauer will get one of the two games on the upcoming dad's trip, likely washington's game in dallas. in the same way trotz has said that balanced minutes has helped keep his lineup fresh, the improved play of grubauer could have the same effect for holtby.
the moment that turned mikey baldinger into one of the area's most fearsome wrestlers transpired on the evening of dec. 3, somewhere along the baltimore beltway. baldinger was heading back to alexandria from the ray oliver invitational at mcdonogh school, where the hayfield senior had just taken fifth place in his 160-pound weight class after succumbing to an opponent he had beaten the previous day.\n\nit was hardly the tone setter baldinger was aiming for in the first wrestling tournament of his senior year. finishing fifth left him feeling deflated, the same feeling that hit him after he finished sixth at last year's 6a north region meet, and the same feeling that came with watching the state tournament from the bleachers.\n\nbaldinger realized he was putting too much pressure on himself. if he could release that pressure and free his mind of expectations, his body would be free to dominate.\n\ni kind of stopped worrying about winning, baldinger said. i'm not going to wrestle after high school, so i thought i might as well just go out there and wrestle as hard as i can because in the end it's not really going to matter whether i won by this much or i lost the whole thing.\n\n[individual, team wrestling rankings for jan. 11]\n\nhayfield senior mikey baldinger, center, celebrates his 100th career victory earlier this season. (photo courtesy of roy hill)\n\nbaldinger has been dominant ever since. a week after that letdown outside baltimore, he won his weight class at a tournament in south carolina, then beat a handful of state placers at a national tournament in kansas city the following week. he has registered eight tech falls and six pins en route to a 26-7 record for hayfield this season.\n\nat a tournament in pennsylvania last weekend, baldinger at one point found himself clinging to an 11-8 lead in the third period. a scramble ensued, and baldinger put the kid on his back to end the match.\n\nafterward, hayfield coach roy hill informed his resurgent grappler that he had just beaten a private school state champion from new york. baldinger all but shrugged.\n\nno matter who i faced, i didn't really care, baldinger said. i just went out there and wrestled hard.\n\nmikey isn't the only baldinger propelling hayfield toward region title contention this winter. his little brother, billy, took fifth place as a freshman in the 113-pound class at states last year and has been excelling at 126 pounds this season.\n\nbut while their dominance draws parallels, the baldinger brothers could hardly be more different on the mat. billy wears his heart on his sleeve, at times getting into dust-ups with sparring partners at practice. mikey rarely shows emotion of any kind, eliciting the nickname mr. spock from his coach.\n\nwhen he walks off the mat you can't tell if he won or lost, hill said.\n\nnext year mikey baldinger hopes to enroll at air force, where he won't have time to add wrestling to his duties as a cadet. with the window closing on his wrestling career, baldinger has resolved to enjoy whatever time he has left. stay in the present, have fun and success will take care of itself.\n\ni know if i go in there wrestling the way i've been wrestling, baldinger said, no one can stop me.\n\nthe big number: 73\n\ncombined wins this season for st. mary's ryken juniors king sandoval and ernest sigmon. sandoval (120 pounds) and sigmon (182) sit at the top of their weight class rankings heading into this weekend's war on the shore tournament at stephen decatur high in berlin, md.\n\nwrestler of the week\n\nchris spano, marriotts ridge, sr.\n\nthe 120-pounder earned lightweight outstanding wrestler at the falcon invitational, going 8-0 and earning victories by fall in both the tournament semifinals and finals. spano (21-0) was trailing hereford's jimmy cavin by a 6-4 count with 30 seconds left but executed a reverse for the pin. the win helped marriotts ridge earn first place in the team points.\n\nthe latest in the kraisser line\n\ncliff kraisser has collected a decade's worth of family memories with the centennial wrestling team, a program that helped three of his sons grow up and is now guiding another young kraisser's maturation on the mat.\n\nbut for the eagles' coach, one memory stands above the rest. it came in the moments after then-freshman jason kraisser won the 2016 maryland 4a/3a state title at 132 pounds last march.\n\njason walked off the mat and right into the outstretched arms of brother austin kraisser, then a senior.\n\nhow many dads get to spend two hours a day with their high school-aged kids? said cliff kraisser, who wrestled at and graduated from centennial in 1983. i'll have these memories forever and so will they.\n\nwith austin joining brother nathan, a 2012 centennial graduate, on campbell university's team this season, the family legacy has fallen solely on jason this season. he's taken it in stride, amassing a 23-1 record and earning the post's top ranking at 138 pounds to date.\n\nevery time i wasn't at practice myself, i'd always be coming up and watching them wrestle their matches, jason said of his brothers.\n\nsoon, that observation turned to action. growing up, an impromptu match between brothers on the kitchen floor could break out at a moment's notice.\n\nwhen they wanted more precision and the centennial gym was closed, they'd head to the wrestling mat in the basement and hone their skills against one another.\n\nbut after jason's first loss of the season, a 14-2 major decision to blair academy's malcolm robinson at mount mat madness, there wasn't a training partner to be found at home.\n\nhe had work to do, though. during the match, he'd gone in for shots with his head low, so low that he couldn't see robinson's feet. so when he got home, he went straight to work on the basement mat on which sibling battles were staged. he didn't call on his father for help.\n\ni wanted to be independent about it and do it on my own, jason said. i realized that if you want to get better you have to start working on stuff on you own without anyone telling you.\n\nkraisser placed third at mount mat madness and hasn't lost since. in a couple months he'll turn his focus to the state championships, where he hopes to earn the family's 10th title.\n\ncliff won the first. nathan is responsible for four of them; austin has three. oldest brother brian never won it all, but the 2010 graduate was the first to wrestle for cliff at centennial.\n\nthe coach, who was an eagles assistant for six years before taking over the program, said he would not have minded if one of his sons hadn't taken to the sport that's bonded his family.\n\nit's a situation he hasn't really had to worry about. though his youngest son, fourth-grader calvin, seems to prefer soccer.\n\ni have a feeling that'll change, cliff said.
but they kept going — down the steps, into the street, past the washington monument and, eventually, into lafayette square across from the white house — along with thousands of others who gathered for the fourth annual women's march on washington.\n\nwomen across the country sent a final rebuke to president trump before the 2020 presidential election. though organizers have for weeks tried to put three main issues at the center of the march — climate change, immigration and reproductive rights — saturday's protest remained very much about the man in the white house.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbut many women said this year's march took on a new tone. instead of feeling angry, fearful or devastated by trump's ascent to the presidency, demonstrators said they felt something new: hope.\n\nprotesters gathered in the nation's capital on jan. 18 for the fourth annual women's march, as part of the nationwide demonstrations. (wjla/associated press)\n\ni remember being at the first women's march and i started crying while we were chanting, said emily anderson, 24, a district resident who brought her dog, yogi. but today feels really different. it's more hopeful. i think that tells you a lot about how far we've come.\n\nthe women's march burst into the national consciousness in 2017, when it inspired millions to take to the streets in washington and across the globe. on saturday, the annual feminist demonstration drew thousands to the nation's capital, as well as to hundreds of cities around the country, including new york, los angeles and denver in demonstrations that organizers said was the beginning of the group's 2020 efforts.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmore than 70 buses from states such as alabama, nebraska and pennsylvania brought activists to the rally, women's march officials said. many said the upcoming election compelled them to come to washington this year.\n\nthis is the last women's march we're going to need because trump is going to be gone by this time next year, said joann edmunds, 69, a roanoke resident who attended the march with three friends. once he's out of office, there won't be the same need for it.\n\ndespite organizers insisting saturday's rally would feature neither speakers nor a stage, the march kicked off with both.\n\nas flakes of snow began to fall and temperatures hovered near 30 degrees, martin luther king iii took the stage to introduce his wife, humanitarian and activist arndrea waters king. she reminded the crowd that 2020 marks 100 years since women earned the right to vote. and this weekend is one that also honors the legacy of her late father-in-law and civil rights leader, the rev. martin luther king jr.\n\nremembering is not enough, she said. we must see this march as a time of rededication and renewal. . . . this can be the decade that ushers in new freedom.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthrongs carried signs that read ratify the era now or see you at the voting booth, while others held up images of house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.), supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg and teenage climate activist greta thunberg.\n\nthe right to vote was top of mind for many in the crowd who honored the centennial anniversary of women's suffrage with signs, suffragist costumes and sashes.\n\nit's been 100 years and we're still fighting — we don't have equal rights, said nancy railey, 59, of garrett county, md., who dressed as a suffragist for the occasion and carried a sign that read another 100 years?\n\na pair of sisters, paula beaty, 55, and elizabeth beaty, 61, of arizona and north carolina, respectively, said they spent two hours friday standing in front of the white house in suffragist regalia as men shouted questions at them.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthey asked us why we were out there and said things like, 'women here have it better than anywhere else in the world, be grateful,'  elizabeth beaty said. it made me think how the women who fought for the right to vote stood out there for two years — we did it for two hours and that was tough.\n\nwaves of women from virginia cheered lawmakers' vote earlier in the week to ratify the equal rights amendment.\n\nit's really cool to be able to come here and say, 'look, we're making progress; we got this done,' said theresa quitto-dickerson, 37, who attended the march with her wife of 16 years, gin-i dickerson, 43. the couple, from loudoun county, helped to lobby for the era.\n\nother issues, including environmental protection, international conflict and transgender rights, were on display at rallies around the country.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin new york, pink hats dotted columbus circle as marchers carried signs with pro-woman and anti-trump slogans.\n\nthe demonstrations, though smaller in some cities than in previous years, brought together longtime marchers and new demonstrators, including student activists who said the upcoming election inspired them to participate.\n\nlinda salzer, 56, of cambridge, n.y., traveled more than two hours to new york city to participate.\n\nthe movement that started in 2017 got me riled up, she said, adding that she had since joined the league of women voters and other women's activist groups.\n\nin los angeles, thousands of women demonstrated at pershing square and grand park. organizers, who coined the theme women rising, for years have sought to separate themselves from the national women's march organization, but they collaborated on saturday.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhundreds of participants carried wire hangers wrapped in pink paper with the #noban hashtag on one side and warning: this is not a surgical instrument on the other.\n\ngraphic designer robin mccar­thy said she felt motivated to design the hangers after antiabortion heartbeat bills were passed around the country. she and two friends brought thousands to hand to demonstrators.\n\nthey're an awful but visceral reminder, she said, and that's what we want.\n\nat rallies in the district and new york, small groups of antiabortion activists lined the march route and shouted at demonstrators. protesters blocked them with their signs and chanted, my body, my choice.\n\nactivists said one of the march's most powerful moments came outside the white house, as chilean feminist collective las tesis led a performance of un violador en tu camino (a rapist in your path), a feminist protest anthem that excoriates patriarchal rule, rape culture and violence against women.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nchanting in english and spanish, the women pumped their fists and tapped their feet as they moved to the beat of drums. many wore blindfolds, a symbol used by feminist movements around the globe.\n\ni just yelled at the top of my lungs in front of the white house, shouted yara travieso, 33. in spanish!\n\ntrump, however, wasn't in washington to hear the protesters. the president departed friday for his florida resort, mar-a-lago, where he was spending the weekend.\n\nprotesters marched past freedom plaza, their scheduled dispersal point, and toward the trump international hotel on pennsylvania avenue nw, where the group broke into another round of the feminist chant.\n\nad\n\nthough the group had thinned, an all-female drum line at the front of the march kept those present dancing through the street.\n\nthe decision to have drummers — instead of celebrities or board members — lead the march was one of several changes made to rebuild relationships with disaffected activists.\n\nad\n\nsome jewish women remained wary of the organization because of delays in removing former board members accused of anti-semitism. but others said they felt compelled to give the group another chance.\n\noutside the trump international hotel, marchers broke into song and dance, beating drums and clapping hands to the beat of the chilean protest chant. the rain had lifted, and the snow had stopped.\n\nas police cars blocked traffic, the group said in unison: it's the cops, it's the judges, it's the system, it's the president.\n\nthe crowd burst into cheers, women pointing at trump's gold-plated name as they shouted together, the rapist is you!
a big ocean storm will spray snow over the region, but the d.c. area is right along its edge. that makes the snow amount forecast tough, and trying to figure out how officials will apply this forecast in their decision-making even tougher.\n\nschoolcast\n\nad\n\na major complication is that the snow may be moving just when officials need to make a call very early thursday. they'll want to closely monitor the radar and consult the best available weather information to make the best decision. it will be an easier decision if the snow breaks out on the early side, closer to 1 a.m. or 2 a.m., rather than 4 a.m.\n\nin a nutshell, we think schools east of interstate 95 have at least a 50-50 chance to have a snow day. there will be more snow there, and it will start earlier. but chances of a snow day drop quickly to the west, where snow will come in later, last a shorter amount of time and may not amount to much.\n\nwe realize some schools have yet to use any snow days this year, so maybe they'll be generous in their decision-making thursday morning. in that case, these percentages may be conservative.\n\nfedcast\n\nwe think the prospect of snow falling on frozen roads during the morning commute may motivate opm to issue an unscheduled leave policy to reduce traffic congestion. we would also not be surprised if it allows late arrivals, but that's far from a given.
the white house debated various options to punish russia, but facing obstacles and potential risks, it ultimately failed to exact a heavy toll on the kremlin for its election meddling.\n\nearly last august, an envelope with extraordinary handling restrictions arrived at the white house. sent by courier from the cia, it carried eyes only instructions that its contents be shown to just four people: president barack obama and three senior aides.\n\ninside was an intelligence bombshell, a report drawn from sourcing deep inside the russian government that detailed russian president vladi­mir putin's direct involvement in a cyber campaign to disrupt and discredit the u.s. presidential race.\n\nbut it went further. the intelligence captured putin's specific instructions on the operation's audacious objectives — defeat or at least damage the democratic nominee, hillary clinton, and help elect her opponent, donald trump.\n\nat that point, the outlines of the russian assault on the u.s. election were increasingly apparent. hackers with ties to russian intelligence services had been rummaging through democratic party computer networks, as well as some republican systems, for more than a year. in july, the fbi had opened an investigation of contacts between russian officials and trump associates. and on july 22, nearly 20,000 emails stolen from the democratic national committee were dumped online by wikileaks.\n\nsecret cia report arrives at the white house cia director john brennan first alerts the white house in early august that russian president vladimir putin had ordered an operation to defeat or at least damage hillary clinton and help elect her opponent, donald trump. the president instructs aides to assess vulnerabilities in the election system and get agencies to

those responsible for managing the crisis, the first moment of true foreboding about russia's intentions arrived with that cia intelligence.\n\nthe material was so sensitive that cia director john o. brennan kept it out of the president's daily brief, concerned that even that restricted report's distribution was too broad. the cia package came with instructions that it be returned immediately after it was read. to guard against leaks, subsequent meetings in the situation room followed the same protocols as planning sessions for the osama bin laden raid.\n\nit took time for other parts of the intelligence community to endorse the cia's view. only in the administration's final weeks in office did it tell the public, in a declassified report, what officials had learned from brennan in august — that putin was working to elect trump.\n\n[putin 'ordered' effort to undermine faith in u.s. election and help trump, report says]\n\nover that five-month interval, the obama administration secretly debated dozens of options for deterring or punishing russia, including cyberattacks on russian infrastructure, the release of cia-gathered material that might embarrass putin and sanctions that officials said could crater the russian economy.\n\n(whitney leaming,osman malik/the washington post)\n\nbut in the end, in late december, obama approved a modest package combining measures that had been drawn up to punish russia for other issues — expulsions of 35 diplomats and the closure of two russian compounds — with economic sanctions so narrowly targeted that even those who helped design them describe their impact as largely symbolic.\n\nobama also approved a previously undisclosed covert measure that authorized planting cyberweapons in russia's infrastructure, the digital equivalent of bombs that could be detonated if the united states found itself in an escalating exchange with moscow. the project, which obama approved in a covert-action finding, was still in its planning stages when obama left office. it would be up to president trump to decide whether to use the capability.\n\nin political terms, russia's interference was the crime of the century, an unprecedented and largely successful destabilizing attack on american democracy. it was a case that took almost no time to solve, traced to the kremlin through cyber-forensics and intelligence on putin's involvement. and yet, because of the divergent ways obama and trump have handled the matter, moscow appears unlikely to face proportionate consequences.\n\nthose closest to obama defend the administration's response to russia's meddling. they note that by august it was too late to prevent the transfer to wikileaks and other groups of the troves of emails that would spill out in the ensuing months. they believe that a series of warnings — including one that obama delivered to putin in september — prompted moscow to abandon any plans of further aggression, such as sabotage of u.s. voting systems.\n\ndenis mcdonough denis mcdonough white house chief of staff. mcdonough was one of the first few officials to discuss details of the intelligence. , who served as obama's chief of staff, said that the administration regarded russia's interference as an attack on the heart of our system.\n\nwe set out from a first-order principle that required us to defend the integrity of the vote, mcdonough said in an interview. importantly, we did that. it's also important to establish what happened and what they attempted to do so as to ensure that we take the steps necessary to stop it from happening again.\n\nbut other administration officials look back on the russia period with remorse.\n\nit is the hardest thing about my entire time in government to defend, said a former senior obama administration official involved in white house deliberations on russia. i feel like we sort of choked.\n\nthe post-election period has been dominated by the overlapping investigations into whether trump associates colluded with russia before the election and whether the president sought to obstruct the fbi probe afterward. that spectacle has obscured the magnitude of moscow's attempt to hijack a precious and now vulnerable-seeming american democratic process.\n\nbeset by allegations of hidden ties between his campaign and russia, trump has shown no inclination to revisit the matter and has denied any collusion or obstruction on his part. as a result, the expulsions and modest sanctions announced by obama on dec. 29 continue to stand as the united states' most forceful response.\n\nthe punishment did not fit the crime, said michael mcfaul, who served as u.s. ambassador to russia for the obama administration from 2012 to 2014. russia violated our sovereignty, meddling in one of our most sacred acts as a democracy — electing our president. the kremlin should have paid a much higher price for that attack. and u.s. policymakers now — both in the white house and congress — should consider new actions to deter future russian interventions.\n\nthe senate this month passed a bill that would impose additional election- and ukraine-related sanctions on moscow and limit trump's ability to lift them. the measure requires house approval, however, and trump's signature.\n\nthis account of the obama administration's response to russia's interference is based on interviews with more than three dozen current and former u.s. officials in senior positions in government, including at the white house, the state, defense and homeland security departments, and u.s. intelligence services. most agreed to speak only on the condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the issue.\n\nthe white house, the cia, the fbi, the national security agency and the office of the director of national intelligence declined to comment.\n\n'deeply concerned'\n\nthe cia breakthrough came at a stage of the presidential campaign when trump had secured the gop nomination but was still regarded as a distant long shot. clinton held comfortable leads in major polls, and obama expected that he would be transferring power to someone who had served in his cabinet.\n\nthe intelligence on putin was extraordinary on multiple levels, including as a feat of espionage.\n\nfor spy agencies, gaining insights into the intentions of foreign leaders is among the highest priorities. but putin is a remarkably elusive target. a former kgb officer, he takes extreme precautions to guard against surveillance, rarely communicating by phone or computer, always running sensitive state business from deep within the confines of the kremlin.\n\n[vladimir putin: from the kgb to president of russia]\n\nthe washington post is withholding some details of the intelligence

(photo by j. scott applewhite/ap; photo illustration by nick kirkpatrick/the washington post)\n\nconcerns about russian interference had gathered throughout the summer.\n\nrussia experts had begun to see a troubling pattern of propaganda in which fictitious news stories, assumed to be generated by moscow, proliferated across social-media platforms.\n\nofficials at the state department and fbi became alarmed by an unusual spike in requests from russia for temporary visas for officials with technical skills seeking permission to enter the united states for short-term assignments at russian facilities. at the fbi's behest, the state department delayed approving the visas until after the election.\n\nmeanwhile, the fbi was tracking a flurry of hacking activity against u.s. political parties, think tanks and other targets. russia had gained entry to dnc systems in the summer of 2015 and spring of 2016, but the breaches did not become public until they were disclosed in a june 2016 report by the post.\n\n[russian government hackers penetrated dnc]\n\neven after the late-july wikileaks dump, which came on the eve of the democratic convention and led to the resignation of rep. debbie wasserman schultz (d-fla.) as the dnc's chairwoman, u.s. intelligence officials continued to express uncertainty about who was behind the hacks or why they were carried out.\n\nat a public security conference in aspen, colo., in late july, director of national intelligence james r. clapper jr. noted that russia had a long history of meddling in american elections but that u.s. spy agencies were not ready to make the call on attribution for what was happening in 2016.\n\nwe don't know enough . . . to ascribe motivation, clapper said. was this just to stir up trouble or was this

community. those brought in signed new non-disclosure agreements to be granted access to intelligence from all three participating agencies.\n\nthey worked exclusively for two groups of customers, officials said. the first was obama and fewer than 14 senior officials in government. the second was a team of operations specialists at the cia, nsa and fbi who took direction from the task force on

comey. aides ordinarily allowed entry as plus-ones were barred.\n\ngradually, the circle widened to include vice president biden and others. agendas sent to cabinet secretaries — including john f. kerry at the state department and ashton b. carter at the pentagon — arrived in envelopes that subordinates were not supposed to open. sometimes the agendas were withheld until participants had taken their seats in the situation room.\n\nthroughout his presidency, obama's approach to national security challenges was deliberate and cautious. he came into office seeking to end wars in iraq and afghanistan. he was loath to act without support from allies overseas and firm political footing at home. he was drawn only reluctantly into foreign crises, such as the civil war in syria, that presented no clear exit for the united states.\n\nobama's approach often seemed reducible to a single imperative: don't make things worse. as brazen as the russian attacks on the election seemed, obama and his top advisers feared that things could get far worse.\n\nthey were concerned that any pre-election response could provoke an escalation from putin. moscow's meddling to that point was seen as deeply concerning but unlikely to materially affect the outcome of the election. far more worrisome to the obama team was the prospect of a cyber-assault on voting systems before and on election day.\n\nthey also worried that any action they took would be perceived as political interference in an already volatile campaign. by august, trump was predicting that the election would be rigged. obama officials feared providing fuel to such claims, playing into russia's efforts to discredit the outcome and potentially contaminating the expected clinton triumph.\n\nbefore departing for an august vacation to martha's vineyard, obama instructed aides to pursue ways to deter moscow and proceed along three main paths: get a high-confidence assessment from u.s. intelligence agencies on russia's role and intent; shore up any vulnerabilities in state-run election systems; and seek bipartisan support from congressional leaders for a statement condemning moscow and urging states to accept federal help.\n\npresident barack obama speaks during a news conference at the white house in december. (photo by andrew harnik/ap; photo illustration by nick kirkpatrick/the washington post)\n\nthe administration encountered obstacles at every turn.\n\ndespite the intelligence the cia had produced, other agencies were slower to endorse a conclusion that putin was personally directing the operation and wanted to help trump. it was definitely compelling, but it was not definitive, said one senior administration official. we needed more.\n\nsome of the most critical technical intelligence on russia came from another country, officials said. because of the source of the material, the nsa was reluctant to view it with high confidence.\n\nbrennan john brennan cia director. brennan first alerts the white house to the putin intelligence and later briefs obama in the oval office. moved swiftly to schedule private briefings with congressional leaders. but getting appointments with certain republicans proved difficult, officials said, and it was not until after labor day that brennan had reached all members of the gang of eight — the majority and minority leaders of both houses and the chairmen and ranking democrats on the senate and house intelligence committees.\n\njeh johnson, the homeland-security secretary, was responsible for finding out whether the government could quickly shore up the security of the nation's archaic patchwork of voting systems. he floated the idea of designating state mechanisms critical infrastructure, a label that would have entitled states to receive priority in federal cybersecurity assistance, putting them on a par with u.s. defense contractors and financial networks.\n\non aug. 15, johnson arranged a conference call with dozens of state officials, hoping to enlist their support. he ran into a wall of resistance.\n\nthe reaction ranged from neutral to negative, johnson said in congressional testimony wednesday.\n\nbrian kemp, the republican secretary of state of georgia, used the call to denounce johnson's proposal as an assault on state rights. i think it was a politically calculated move by the previous administration, kemp said in a recent interview, adding that he remains unconvinced that russia waged a campaign to disrupt the 2016 race. i don't necessarily believe that, he said.\n\nstung by the reaction, the white house turned to congress for help, hoping that a bipartisan appeal to states would be more effective.\n\nin early september, johnson jeh johnson homeland security secretary. johnson is tasked with securing voting systems and arranges meetings with dozens of state officials. , comey james b.

squabble.\n\nthe dems were, 'hey, we have to tell the public,'  recalled one participant. but republicans resisted, arguing that to warn the public that the election was under attack would further russia's aim of sapping confidence in the system.\n\nsenate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) went further, officials said, voicing skepticism that the underlying intelligence truly supported the white house's claims. through a spokeswoman, mcconnell declined to comment, citing the secrecy of that meeting.\n\nkey democrats were stunned by the gop response and exasperated that the white house seemed willing to let republican opposition block any pre-election move.\n\non sept. 22, two california democrats — sen. dianne feinstein and rep. adam b. schiff — did what they couldn't get the white house to do. they issued a statement making clear that they had learned from intelligence briefings that russia was directing a campaign to undermine the election, but they stopped short of saying to what end.\n\na week later, mcconnell and other congressional leaders issued a cautious statement that encouraged state election officials to ensure their networks were secure from attack. the release made no mention of russia and emphasized that the lawmakers would oppose any effort by the federal government to encroach on the states' authorities.\n\nwhen u.s. spy agencies reached unanimous agreement in late september that the interference was a russian operation directed by putin, obama directed spy chiefs to prepare a public statement summarizing the intelligence in broad strokes.\n\nwith obama still determined to avoid any appearance of politics, the statement would not carry his signature.\n\non oct. 7, the administration offered its first public comment on russia's active measures, in a three-paragraph statement issued by johnson jeh johnson homeland security secretary. johnson is tasked with securing voting systems and arranges meetings with dozens of state

the election for the bureau to be involved.\n\nthe u.s. intelligence community is confident that the russian government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from u.s. persons and institutions, including from u.s. political organizations, the statement said. we believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.\n\nearly drafts accused putin by name, but the reference was removed out of concern that it might endanger intelligence sources and methods.\n\nthe statement was issued around 3:30 p.m., timed for maximum media coverage. instead, it was quickly drowned out. at 4 p.m., the post published a story about crude comments trump had made about women that were captured on an access hollywood tape. half an hour later, wikileaks published its first batch of emails stolen from clinton campaign chairman john podesta.\n\nto some, obama's determination to avoid politicizing the russia issue had the opposite effect: it meant that he allowed politics to shape his administration's response to what some believed should have been treated purely as a national security threat.\n\nschiff said that the administration's justifications for inaction often left him with a sense of cognitive dissonance.\n\nthe administration doesn't need congressional support to issue a statement of attribution or impose sanctions, schiff said in a recent interview. he said many groups inadvertently abetted russia's campaign, including republicans who refused to confront moscow and media organizations that eagerly mined the troves of hacked emails.\n\nwhere democrats need to take responsibility, schiff said, is that we failed to persuade the country why they should care that a foreign power is meddling in our affairs.\n\n'ample time' after election\n\nthe situation room is actually a complex of secure spaces in the basement level of the west wing. a video feed from the main room courses through some national security council offices, allowing senior aides sitting at their desks to see — but not hear — when meetings are underway.\n\nas the russia-related sessions with cabinet members began in august, the video feed was shut off. the last time that had happened on a sustained basis, officials said, was in the spring of 2011 during the run-up to the u.s. special operations raid on bin laden's compound in pakistan.\n\nthe blacked-out screens were seen as an ominous sign among lower-level white house officials who were largely kept in the dark about the russia deliberations even as they were tasked with generating options for retaliation against moscow.\n\nmuch of that work was led by the cyber response group, an nsc unit with representatives from the cia, nsa, state department and pentagon.\n\nthe early options they discussed were ambitious. they looked at sectorwide economic sanctions and cyberattacks that would take russian networks temporarily offline. one official informally suggested — though never formally proposed — moving a u.s. naval carrier group into the baltic sea as a symbol of resolve.\n\nwhat those lower-level officials did not know was that the principals and their deputies had by late september all but ruled out any pre-election retaliation against moscow. they feared that any action would be seen as political and that putin, motivated by a seething resentment of clinton, was prepared to go beyond fake news and email dumps.\n\n[the roots of the hostility between putin and clinton]\n\nthe fbi had detected suspected russian attempts to penetrate election systems in 21 states, and at least one senior white house official assumed that moscow would try all 50, officials said. some officials believed the attempts were meant to be detected to unnerve the americans. the patchwork nature of the united states' 3,000 or so voting jurisdictions would make it hard for russia to swing the outcome, but moscow could still sow chaos.\n\nwe turned to other scenarios the russians might attempt, said michael daniel, who was cybersecurity coordinator at the white house, such as disrupting the voter rolls, deleting every 10th voter [from registries] or flipping two digits in everybody's address.\n\nthe moscow international business center in moscow.

(photo by susan walsh/ap; photo illustration by nick kirkpatrick/the washington post)\n\n'demoralized'\n\nseveral officials described the post-election atmosphere at the white house as somber. it was like a funeral parlor, according to one official who said that work on russia and other subjects slowed as officials began to anticipate the damage to obama's policies and legacy.\n\nothers disputed that characterization, saying that the nsc carried on with no interruption or diminution of focus. nobody got paralyzed by grief, a high-ranking official said. we all did our jobs.\n\nrice susan rice national security adviser. rice orders the national security council to finalize a list of options to use against moscow. declined to comment on white house deliberations or other sensitive matters but said that the administration always planned to respond to russia, regardless of the outcome of the election. we felt it was on our watch and that we had to do something about it. it was our responsibility, rice said.\n\nwhatever the case, work on russia did not resume in earnest until after thanksgiving, in part because obama made his last foreign trip.\n\nrice again ordered nsc staffers to finalize a menu of punitive measures to use against moscow. the list that took shape was a distillation of ideas that had been circulating for months across three main categories: cyber, economic and diplomatic.\n\nagain, the discussion ran into roadblocks.\n\nspy agencies wanted to maintain their penetrations of russian networks, not expose them in a cyber-fusillade.\n\ntreasury department officials devised plans that would hit entire sectors of russia's economy. one preliminary suggestion called for targeting technology companies including kaspersky lab, the moscow-based cybersecurity firm. but skeptics worried that the harm could spill into europe and pointed out that u.s. companies used kaspersky systems and software.\n\nseveral senior administration officials called for imposing sanctions on putin personally or releasing financial records or other information that would embarrass him. some objected that the latter proposal would send the wrong message — the united states would be engaging in the same behavior it was condemning. in any case, it was not clear how long it would take u.s. spy agencies to assemble such a putin dossier.\n\nby december, those of us working on this for a long time were demoralized, said an administration official involved in the developing punitive options.\n\nthen the tenor began to shift.\n\non dec. 9, obama ordered a comprehensive review by u.s. intelligence agencies of russian interference in u.s. elections going back to 2008, with a plan to make some of the findings public.\n\na week later, in one of obama's final news briefings, he expressed irritation that such a consequential election came to be dominated by a bunch of these leaks. he scolded news organizations for an obsession with titillating material about the democrats that had dominated coverage.\n\nthen he unloaded on moscow. the russians can't change us or significantly weaken us, he said. they are a smaller country. they are a weaker country. their economy doesn't produce anything that anybody wants to buy, except oil and gas and arms.\n\nit was a rare outburst for obama, one that came amid a wave of internal second-guessing, finger-pointing from members of the defeated clinton campaign, and the post-election posturing of putin and trump.\n\nthere was another factor at work, however.\n\nobama's decision to order a comprehensive report on moscow's interference from u.s. spy agencies had prompted analysts to go back through their agencies' files, scouring for previously overlooked clues.\n\nthe effort led to a flurry of new, disturbing reports — many of them presented in the president's daily brief — about russia's subversion of the 2016 race. the emerging picture enabled policymakers to begin seeing the russian campaign in broader terms, as a comprehensive plot sweeping in its scope.\n\nben rhodes, former deputy national security adviser, said that the dnc email penetrations were initially thought to be in the same vein as previous russian hacking efforts against targets including the state department and white house.\n\nin many ways . . . we dealt with this as a cyberthreat and focused on protecting our cyber infrastructure, rhodes said in an interview. meanwhile, the russians were playing this much bigger game, which included elements like released hacked materials, political propaganda and propagating fake news, which they'd pursued in other countries.\n\nwe weren't able to put all of those pieces together in real time, rhodes said, and in many ways that complete picture is still being filled in. rhodes declined to discuss any sensitive information.\n\nnational security adviser susan e. rice looks over documents in the oval office in october. (photo by chip somodevilla/getty images; photo illustration by nick kirkpatrick/the washington post)\n\nobama's darkened mood, the intelligence findings and the approaching transfer of power gave new urgency to nsc deliberations. in mid-december, as cabinet members took turns citing drawbacks to various proposals for retaliating against russia, rice susan rice national security adviser. rice orders the national security council to finalize a list of options to use against moscow. grew impatient and began cutting them off.\n\nwe're not talking anymore. we're acting, she said, according to one participant.\n\nrice moved swiftly through a list of proposals that had survived months of debate, a menu that allowed principals to vote for what one participant described as heavy, medium and light options.\n\namong those in the situation room were clapper james r. clapper director of national intelligence and one of four senior administration officials to participate in meetings in of the situation room on how to retaliate against russia. clapper would eventually release the obama administration's first statement concluding russia interfered in the election. , brennan john brennan cia

confront russia several times. and deputy fbi director andrew mccabe. rice challenged them go to the max of their comfort zones, a second participant said.\n\neconomic sanctions, originally aimed only at russia's military intelligence service, were expanded to include the fsb, a domestic successor to the kgb. four russian intelligence officials and three companies with links to those services were also named as targets.\n\nthe fbi had long lobbied to close two russian compounds in the united states — one in maryland and another in new york — on the grounds that both were used for espionage and placed an enormous surveillance burden on the bureau.\n\n[on the eastern shore, a 45-acre russian compound kept its secrets close]\n\nthe fbi was also responsible for generating the list of russian operatives working under diplomatic cover to expel, drawn from a roster the bureau maintains of suspected russian intelligence agents in the united states.\n\ncabinet officials were prompted to vote on whether to close one russian compound or two, whether to kick out around 10 suspected russian agents, 20 or 35.\n\nkerry laid out his department's concerns. the u.s. ambassador to russia, john tefft, had sent a cable warning that moscow would inevitably expel the same number of americans from moscow and that departures of that magnitude would impair the embassy's ability to function.\n\nthe objections were dismissed, and rice susan rice national security adviser. rice orders the national security council to finalize a list of options to use against moscow. submitted a plan to obama calling for the seizure of both russian facilities and the expulsion of 35 suspected spies. obama signed off on the package and announced the punitive measures on dec. 29, while on vacation in hawaii.\n\nby then, the still-forming trump administration was becoming entangled by questions about contacts with moscow. on or around that same day that obama imposed sanctions, trump's designated national security adviser, retired lt. gen. michael flynn, told the russian ambassador by phone that the sanctions would soon be revisited. flynn's false statements about that conversation later cost him his job.\n\nthe report that obama had commissioned was released a week later, on jan. 6. it was based largely on the work done by the task force brennan john brennan cia director. brennan first alerts the white house to the putin intelligence and later briefs obama in the oval office. had established and made public what the cia had concluded in august, that putin and the russian government aspired to help president-elect trump's election chances when possible by discrediting secretary clinton.\n\nit also carried a note of warning: we assess moscow will apply lessons learned from its putin-ordered campaign aimed at the u.s. election to future influence efforts worldwide.\n\nsanctions' 'minimal' impact\n\nthe punitive measures got several days of media attention before the spotlight returned to trump, his still-forming administration and, later, the initial rumblings of the russia crisis that has become a consuming issue for the trump white house.\n\nbut the package of measures approved by obama, and the process by which they were selected and implemented, were more complex than initially understood.\n\nthe expulsions and compound seizures were originally devised as ways to retaliate against moscow not for election interference but for an escalating campaign of harassment of american diplomats and intelligence operatives. u.s. officials often endured hostile treatment, but the episodes had become increasingly menacing and violent.\n\nin one previously undisclosed incident on july 6, a russian military helicopter dropped from the sky to make multiple passes just feet over the hood of a vehicle being driven by the u.s. defense attache, who was accompanied by colleagues, on a stretch of road between murmansk and pechenga in northern russia. the attempt at intimidation was captured on photos the americans took through the windshield.\n\nan even more harrowing encounter took place the prior month, when a cia operative returning by taxi to the u.s. embassy in moscow was tackled and thrown to the ground by a uniformed fsb guard. in a video aired on russian television, the u.s. operative can be seen struggling to drag himself across the embassy threshold and onto u.s. sovereign territory. he sustained a broken shoulder in the attack.\n\nthough conceived as retaliation for those incidents, the expulsions were adapted and included in the election-related package. the roster of expelled spies included several operatives who were suspected of playing a role in russia's election interference from within the united states, officials said. they declined to elaborate.\n\nmore broadly, the list of 35 names focused heavily on russians known to have technical skills. their names and bios were laid out on a dossier delivered to senior white house officials and cabinet secretaries, although the list was modified at the last minute to reduce the number of expulsions from russia's u.n. mission in new york and add more names from its facilities in washington and san francisco.\n\na compound near centreville, md., that was being used by russian diplomats is seen in a 2015 satellite photo. the compound was closed in december as part of a u.s. sanctions package. (photo obtained by the washington post; photo illustration by nick kirkpatrick/the washington post)\n\nthe compounds were even higher on the fbi's wish list.\n\nat one point in the white house deliberations, intelligence analysts used aerial images of the facilities to show how they had been modified to enhance their espionage capabilities. slides displayed in the situation room showed new chimneys and other features, all presumed to allow for the installation of more-sophisticated eavesdropping equipment aimed at u.s. naval facilities and the nsa headquarters at fort meade in maryland.\n\nrice susan rice national security adviser. rice orders the national security council to finalize a list of options to use against moscow. pointed to the fbi's ­mccabe andrew mccabe deputy fbi director. mccabe was among others in the situation room challenged by rice to go to the max of their comfort zones in deciding retaliatory measures. and said: you guys have been begging to do this for years. now is your chance.\n\nthe administration gave russia 24 hours to evacuate the sites, and fbi agents watched as fleets of trucks loaded with cargo passed through the compounds' gates.\n\nwhen fbi agents entered the sites, they found them stripped of antennas, electronics, computers, file cabinets and other gear, officials said, their hasty removal leaving visible markings on floors, tables and walls.\n\neconomic sanctions are widely seen as the united states' most potent lever, short of military force. russia's economy is dwarfed by that of the united states, and nearly every major russian institution and oligarch depends to some degree on access to u.s. and western financial institutions, networks and credit.\n\nsanctions that the united states and europe imposed on russia in 2014 for its actions in ukraine were damaging. coinciding with a sharp drop in oil prices, those measures contributed to a 4 percent contraction in the russian economy and sent its reserves plunging.\n\nthe election-related sanctions, by contrast, have had no such impact.\n\nofficials involved in designing them said that the main targets — russia's foreign and military intelligence services, the gru and fsb, and senior officials at those agencies — have few known holdings abroad or vulnerable assets to freeze.\n\ni don't think any of us thought of sanctions as being a primary way of expressing our disapproval for the election interference, said a senior administration official involved in the decision. going after their intelligence services was not about economic impact. it was symbolic.\n\nmore than any other measure, that decision has become a source of regret to senior administration officials directly involved in the russia debate. the outcome has left the impression that obama saw russia's military meddling in ukraine as more deserving of severe punishment than its subversion of a u.s. presidential race.\n\nwhat is the greater threat to our system of government? said a former high-ranking administration official, noting that obama and his advisers knew from projections formulated by the treasury department that the impact of the election-related economic sanctions would be minimal.\n\na u.s. cyberweapon\n\nthe most difficult measure to evaluate is one that obama alluded to in only the most oblique fashion when announcing the u.s. response.\n\nwe will continue to take a variety of actions at a time and place of our choosing, some of which will not be publicized, he said in a statement released by the white house.\n\nhe was referring, in part, to a cyber operation that was designed to be detected by moscow but not cause significant damage, officials said. the operation, which entailed implanting computer code in sensitive computer systems that russia was bound to find, served only as a reminder to moscow of the united states' cyber reach.\n\nbut obama also signed the secret finding, officials said, authorizing a new covert program involving the nsa, cia and u.s. cyber command.\n\nobama declined to comment for this article, but a spokesman issued a statement: this situation was taken extremely seriously, as is evident by president obama raising this issue directly with president putin; 17 intelligence agencies issuing an extraordinary public statement; our homeland security officials working relentlessly to bolster the cyber defenses of voting infrastructure around the country; the president directing a comprehensive intelligence review, and ultimately issuing a robust response including shutting down two russian compounds, sanctioning nine russian entities and individuals, and ejecting 35 russian diplomats from the country.\n\nthe cyber operation is still in its early stages and involves deploying implants in russian networks deemed important to the adversary and that would cause them pain and discomfort if they were disrupted, a former u.s. official said.\n\nthe implants were developed by the nsa and designed so that they could be triggered remotely as part of retaliatory cyber-strike in the face of russian aggression, whether an attack on a power grid or interference in a future presidential race.\n\nofficials familiar with the measures said that there was concern among some in the administration that the damage caused by the implants could be difficult to contain.\n\nas a result, the administration requested a legal review, which concluded that the devices could be controlled well enough that their deployment would be considered proportional in varying scenarios of russian provocation, a requirement under international law.\n\nthe operation was described as long-term, taking months to position the implants and requiring maintenance thereafter. under the rules of covert action, obama's signature was all that was necessary to set the operation in motion.\n\nu.s. intelligence agencies do not need further approval from trump, and officials said that he would have to issue a countermanding order to stop it. the officials said that they have seen no indication that trump has done so.\n\nkaren deyoung and julie tate contributed to this report.
paul ridiculed romney as someone running around saying, 'i'm holier than thou, look at me.' \n\nad\n\ntrump, meanwhile, was somewhat restrained, following counsel from his aides to shrug off romney's salvo.\n\nsome hosts and guests on cable news shows commented on the washington post op-ed written by sen. mitt romney (r-utah) on jan. 2. (allie caren/the washington post)\n\nad\n\ni wish mitt could be more of a team player, trump told reporters at a cabinet meeting.\n\nbut romney's friends and leading anti-trump conservatives were glad to see him herald his arrival in washington by writing a cutting op-ed piece in the washington post that said the president has not risen to the mantle of the office. the move was taken as a gesture of solidarity at a time of mounting anxiety among establishment republicans.\n\nit gives permission for people to consider things and discuss things that were almost taboo before this, in terms of a challenger to trump, said william kristol, a conservative commentator. it's a permission slip to have a real conversation about 2020.\n\nad\n\nsen. mitt romney (r-utah) published an op-ed jan. 1 criticizing president trump. here's a look back at their relationship. (monica akhtar/the washington post)\n\nit begins, former white house chief strategist stephen k. bannon wrote in an email to the post, referring to what he sees as romney allies' efforts to block trump from the 2020 republican nomination.\n\nad\n\nspeaking wednesday afternoon to cnn's jake tapper, romney said he is not planning to run in 2020 but is going to see what the alternatives are.\n\nmany mainstream republicans are increasingly alarmed by trump's behavior and willing to battle with him in ways that would have seemed strained two years ago, when trump had the party tightly in his grip after his stunning victory and its members largely fell into lockstep behind him.\n\ntwo years later, trump's presidency is under siege following republican losses in the 2018 elections. an ongoing government shutdown, volatile financial markets, the special counsel probe, right-wing discontent over trump's failure to secure funding for a border wall, and empowered house democrats all loom before the president, who has been isolated and lashing out at his critics. the collision of threats has frayed the bonds between trump and some top republicans even as the president retains strong support in polls of party voters.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin addition, some republican leaders have been rattled by the departure of jim mattis as secretary of defense in the wake of trump's decision to end the u.s. military operation in syria, along with the exit of white house chief of staff john f. kelly. both former generals were seen as steadying presences.\n\nenter romney, 71, who has decided to lay down a marker underscoring those concerns with far more national political capital on hand than most republicans. while others have spoken out — including some departing senators — they have often struggled to capture the party's attention during crises in trump's first two years in office.\n\nromney, as the party's 2012 presidential nominee, a former massachusetts governor and business executive with a powerful financial network, brings a new stature to the anti-trump bloc of the party that has been missing as republicans in washington have operated in a bargaining fashion with trump, enduring his slights and erratic actions to push through favored policy items.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin matters that relate to the divisiveness of our political environment, i'll speak out if i feel the need to, if there's something significant, and i think it's important as i begin this new job to make it very clear where i stand, romney said on cnn, adding that he backs the president's attempt to secure funding for a border wall but feels compelled to criticize him on issues that include trump's comments on race and women to the abrupt way he believes the president is conducting u.s. foreign policy.\n\nromney, however, was greeted with a burst of skepticism among both republicans and democrats, who pointed to his history of flip-flopping on his view of trump, which has veered from uneasy embrace of his presidential endorsement (2012) to stern rebuke (2016) to accepting his endorsement again for his utah senate race (2018) to this latest rebuke (2019).\n\ni endorsed him and he thanked me profusely, trump reminded reporters on wednesday.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe image of a smiling romney sitting with trump over a dish of frog legs at a white-tablecloth dinner in late 2016 was being widely circulated by romney critics as a reminder of his past ingratiation, in that instance as he considered joining trump's cabinet as secretary of state. trump aides say the president never came close to tapping him.\n\nthose rebuttals are unlikely to quiet romney or similarly minded republicans. the notion of trump's presidency being in deep descent has become a near-daily discussion throughout the broader republican establishment in recent weeks, according to more than a dozen consultants and lawmakers involved in those conversations.\n\nonce-fanciful suggestions about organizing a draft campaign for romney or nikki haley, trump's former u.s. ambassador to the united nations, have suddenly turned more serious, the consultants and lawmakers said.\n\nad\n\nad\n\neveryone is trying to figure out what the party looks like if trump ends the year looking extremely weak or maybe [vice president] pence is president, said one veteran republican financier who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private exchanges.\n\ndespite his past denunciations, romney's move took some of his associates by surprise. for weeks, romney has been tight-lipped as he prepares to be sworn in on thursday, disappointing those who had hoped he would emerge as a new power center for what is left of mainstream republicans in trump's washington.\n\nstill, some romney allies, such as his former adviser mike murphy, have been talking up a 2020 run for months without romney's involvement, hoping to stoke interest and lay the political groundwork for him should trump be impeached or resign.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ntrump seemed like a bumbling incompetent in many ways, so what's the opposite of that — who is a comfortable republican, super-confident, safe, no-drama choice? it's mitt, murphy said last year.\n\nspencer zwick, the political adviser who built romney's donor network for his presidential campaigns, routinely takes calls from donors urging romney to look hard at 2020, according to two people familiar with those discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nregardless of romney's political future, there remains a void in the gop for figures like him to have more of a say over the direction of the party as trump continues to buck dogma on trade and national security, democrats take control of the house and dozens of democratic presidential hopefuls begin traveling to early voting states and tear into trump's character and record.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe absence of the late senator john mccain (r-ariz.), coupled with the retirements of gop senators bob corker (tenn.) and jeff flake (ariz.), has only intensified the angst among republicans who see trump as unbound by criticism from within the party.\n\nunlike romney, the departing senators have not ruled out challenging trump. flake has repeatedly said he is considering a 2020 run. corker said last month, i haven't ruled it out, and suggested that trump might not run for reelection. a 2016 trump foe, outgoing ohio gov. john kasich, already has traveled to early voting states and publicly left his options open.\n\nsomebody does need to challenge the president, flake told cnn last week. i'm a long way from there, but somebody needs to and i think that the country needs to be reminded of what it means to be conservative, certainly on the republican side, and what it means to be decent as well.\n\nbut trump has cultivated intense support among many republican base voters, making any primary run against him difficult, and imperiling romney's own path forward in both the senate and, potentially, the 2020 primaries.\n\nmessrs. romney, flake, and kasich will continue chasing their fantasy of being president, even if that means destroying our party and denying president trump reelection, jevon o.a. williams, an rnc member, wrote in an email late tuesday to fellow party leaders, urging them to change the party's rules to make any primary challenge a burden.\n\nbeyond washington, flickers of data are being passed around by trump critics as manna for their cause, such as a poll last month of iowa republicans by the des moines register and cnn. that poll showed about 63 percent of iowa republicans would welcome the chance to consider challengers to trump in iowa, home to the first contest of the 2020 nominating race.\n\nin that same poll, however, trump holds an 81 percent approval rating among iowa republicans, making clear their continued support for the president.\n\nin new hampshire, the first primary state and where challengers to sitting presidents have historically gained traction, there is a fierce debate about whether the state party should endorse trump and curb the chances of a primary fight. gov. chris sununu (r), a trump ally, has said he sides with the republicans who want to protect the state's tradition of having the party stay away from endorsing.\n\nkasich, who spent months campaigning in new hampshire ahead of the 2016 primary, where he placed second a distant second to trump, has been frank about that political reality and the uphill climb any trump challenger would face.\n\ni don't get into things that i don't think i can win, he said last month at an event in ohio. right now, today, inside the republican party, i can't beat him in a primary.\n\nyet on twitter and in phone calls late tuesday and wednesday across the republican party, romney's op-ed piece sparked new talk of an uprising.\n\nof course, it was an op-ed piece, not a showdown on the senate floor. and romney, an imperfect messenger, was typically careful in his choice of words. but it was something for anti-trump republicans to seize on and hope that months of grousing and discussions could eventually yield a viable challenge to an incumbent they loathe.
the ruling amounts to a rebuke of trump's stated preference for filling top administration jobs with officials serving in an acting capacity. the president has said he prefers having top officials in an acting role because he thinks it makes them easier to remove than those with senate confirmation.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nuscis officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. the trump administration is expected to appeal the decision.\n\nimmigrant advocacy groups sued the administration last year on behalf of five honduran asylum seekers — two adults and three children — who challenged the legality of the new restrictions on multiple grounds. moss's ruling addressed the first of their claims: that cuccinelli lacked the authority to change u.s. asylum policies in the first place.\n\nmoss agreed, writing that the vacancy rules require a federal agency's first assistant to assume leadership when the top job is open.\n\ncuccinelli's appointment fails to comply with the (law) for a more fundamental and clear-cut reason: he never did and never will serve in a subordinate role — that is, as an 'assistant' — to any other uscis official, moss wrote.\n\n\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe administration's move to place cuccinelli in charge was therefore unlawful, he wrote, and the policy memos he signed should be set aside.\n\nthose include measures in july to reduce the amount of time afforded to asylum seekers to seek legal counsel after crossing the border and to restrict the ability of u.s. asylum officers to grant applicants extensions.\n\nthe implications of the judge's ruling were unclear sunday for other policy moves and administrative decisions made by cuccinelli since trump installed him in june. cuccinelli remains in the top job at uscis, and he is serving as the second-ranking official at the department of homeland security, where he has been appointed to the white house's coronavirus task force.\n\nad\n\nsenior staffers at dhs and uscis have repeatedly expressed doubts about the legality of cuccinelli's authority, with several unclear about where he actually works.
it was another huge year for director ryan coogler, a fellow . . . bay area native, samberg said of the black panther director. you know, if you told me as a kid growing up in the bay there'd be a movie called 'black panther' that starts off in oakland, this is not what i would have imagined. ryan, were there, like, a bunch of old members of the actual black panther party saying, 'i can't even get an audition?' just kidding. they were all framed and murdered for wanting justice and equality. the world is and always has been a nightmare. it just seems worse now because of our phones. what else happened this year?\n\nthat was the opening segment's sharpest comment, as samberg and oh kicked things off by deeming themselves the two nicest people in show business, as well as the only two people left in hollywood who haven't gotten in trouble for saying something offensive.\n\nfan favorites like black panther and crazy rich asians were nearly shut out at the 76th annual golden globe awards. here are the highlights.

(at which point lady gaga called out from the audience: it's true!)\n\nsamberg: sandra, i couldn't agree with you more. i was just thinking, totally off the cuff, there could be 100 people in the room, and 99 don't believe in you. and you just need one to believe in you. and that, quite frankly, was bradley cooper.\n\njeff bridges gave an epic, long, winding acceptance speech after receiving the cecil b. demille award at the 2019 golden globes.

thanos, the villain (and protagonist, really) of the $2 billion-grossing megahit, avengers: infinity war, was basically an omni-powered paul ehrlich. whereas the comic book version of thanos sought to kill half of the universe in order to prove his love for an anthropomorphized death, the film version was driven insane by his home planet's self-immolation after a series of resource wars. determined to eliminate suffering over food and land, over clean water and clean air, thanos used the infinity gauntlet not to create abundance of each but to kill half of all living things.\n\nagain, this is ehrlichian in its madness: the author of the population bomb argued for years that the planet is overpopulated and that famines will wipe out a significant portion of humanity. it could still happen, i suppose — global warming could inspire an interstellar-style blight; the skies could go dry — but, frustratingly for the doomsayers, life on earth keeps getting better despite the overpopulation our precious blue orb continues to shoulder.\n\naquaman is the surprise hit of the winter, racking up more than $800 million worldwide so far. and while jason momoa's bro-tastic turn as arthur curry is earning deserved plaudits from male and female audiences alike, it's patrick wilson's king orm who caught my eye. orm hopes to unite the underwater clans of atlantis in order to create an unstoppable army that will destroy life on the planet's landmasses.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbut orm is no madman. his genocidal war is not the result of personal trauma or ideological insanity. it is, rather, a version of self-defense: the surface dwellers dump their trash into the water, strangling the sea life; the surface dwellers spew their smoke into the skies, choking the ocean with particulates; the surface dwellers hunt to extinction the ocean's animals, depriving the atlanteans of conveyances. humanity must die so atlantis might live.\n\nyou saw something similar in kingsman: the secret service a few years back. amongst the most reactionary films of our age, kingsman featured as its villain a tech guru named valentine (samuel l. jackson). this billionaire was so disgusted by humanity's excesses and so riled by the excretions of the masses that he engineered a plot to kill all of us in the most horribly violent manner possible. he invented a device that would cause man to turn against man, mother against child, sister against brother — with bare hands, we would tear each other apart. in so doing, the planet would be cleansed of humanity's foul stench. once free of the riffraff, wealthy swells and fabulous celebrities would reclaim the planet for themselves and rebuild the world in their image. clean. pristine. free of the gauche hordes who have rendered our air travel unbearable and our beaches crowded messes.\n\nenvironmentalists make a useful villain because their malevolence can be obscured by a patina of reasonableness. global warming and other manmade problems are going to end the world if we don't do something — so just about anything is justified! but their villainy resonates with the masses because they actually do want to make life worse for people, for the most part.\n\nad\n\nad
national security 'the intelligence coup of the century' for decades, the cia read the encrypted communications of allies and adversaries. warning: this graphic requires javascript. please enable javascript for the best experience.\n\nfor more than half a century, governments all over the world trusted a single company to keep the communications of their spies, soldiers and diplomats secret.\n\nthe company, crypto ag, got its first break with a contract to build code-making machines for u.s. troops during world war ii. flush with cash, it became a dominant maker of encryption devices for decades, navigating waves of technology from mechanical gears to electronic circuits and, finally, silicon chips and software.\n\nthe swiss firm made millions of dollars selling equipment to more than 120 countries well into the 21st century. its clients included iran, military juntas in latin america, nuclear rivals india and pakistan, and even the vatican.\n\nbut what none of its customers ever knew was that crypto ag was secretly owned by the cia in a highly classified partnership with west german intelligence. these spy agencies rigged the company's devices so they could easily break the codes that countries used to send encrypted messages.\n\nthe decades-long arrangement, among the most closely guarded secrets of the cold war, is laid bare in a classified, comprehensive cia history of the operation obtained by the washington post and zdf, a german public broadcaster, in a joint reporting project.\n\nthe account identifies the cia officers who ran the program and the company executives entrusted to execute it. it traces the origin of the venture as well as the internal conflicts that nearly derailed it. it describes how the united states and its allies exploited other nations' gullibility for years, taking their money and stealing their secrets.\n\nthe operation, known first by the code name thesaurus and later rubicon, ranks among the most audacious in cia history.\n\nit was the intelligence coup of the century, the cia report concludes. foreign governments were paying good money to the u.s. and west germany for the privilege of having their most secret communications read by at least two (and possibly as many as five or six) foreign countries.\n\nfrom 1970 on, the cia and its code-breaking sibling, the national security agency, controlled nearly every aspect of crypto's operations — presiding with their german partners over hiring decisions, designing its technology, sabotaging its algorithms and directing its sales targets.\n\nthen, the u.s. and west german spies sat back and listened.\n\nthey monitored iran's mullahs during the 1979 hostage crisis, fed intelligence about argentina's military to britain during the falklands war, tracked the assassination campaigns of south american dictators and caught libyan officials congratulating themselves on the 1986 bombing of a berlin disco.\n\na royal navy helicopter takes off after transporting royal marines to darwin, falkland islands, in 1982. during the falklands war, u.s. spies fed intelligence about argentina's military to britain.

(kaveh kazemi/getty images)\n\nthe program had limits. america's main adversaries, including the soviet union and china, were never crypto customers. their well-founded suspicions of the company's ties to the west shielded them from exposure, although the cia history suggests that u.s. spies learned a great deal by monitoring other countries' interactions with moscow and beijing.\n\nthere were also security breaches that put crypto under clouds of suspicion. documents released in the 1970s showed extensive — and incriminating — correspondence between an nsa pioneer and crypto's founder. foreign targets were tipped off by the careless statements of public officials including president ronald reagan. and the 1992 arrest of a crypto salesman in iran, who did not realize he was selling rigged equipment, triggered a devastating storm of publicity, according to the cia history.\n\nbut the true extent of the company's relationship with the cia and its german counterpart was until now never revealed.\n\nthe german spy agency, the bnd, came to believe the risk of exposure was too great and left the operation in the early 1990s. but the cia bought the germans' stake and simply kept going, wringing crypto for all its espionage worth until 2018, when the agency sold off the company's assets, according to current and former officials.\n\nthe company's importance to the global security market had fallen by then, squeezed by the spread of online encryption technology. once the province of governments and major corporations, strong encryption is now as ubiquitous as apps on cellphones.\n\neven so, the crypto operation is relevant to modern espionage. its reach and duration help to explain how the united states developed an insatiable appetite for global surveillance that was exposed in 2013 by edward snowden. there are also echoes of crypto in the suspicions swirling around modern companies with alleged links to foreign governments, including the russian anti-virus firm kaspersky, a texting app tied to the united arab emirates and the chinese telecommunications giant huawei.\n\nthis story is based on the cia history and a parallel bnd account, also obtained by the post and zdf, and interviews with current and former western intelligence officials as well as crypto employees. many spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the subject.\n\nit is hard to overstate how extraordinary the cia and bnd histories are. sensitive intelligence files are periodically declassified and released to the public. but it is exceedingly rare, if not unprecedented, to glimpse authoritative internal histories of an entire covert operation. the post was able to read all of the documents, but the source of the material insisted that only excerpts be published.\n\nclick any underlined text in the story to see an excerpt from the cia history.\n\nthe cia and the bnd declined to comment, though u.s. and german officials did not dispute the authenticity of the documents. the first is a 96-page account of the operation completed in 2004 by the cia's center for the study of intelligence, an internal historical branch. the second is an oral history compiled by german intelligence officials in 2008.\n\nthe overlapping accounts expose frictions between the two partners over money, control and ethical limits, with the west germans frequently aghast at the enthusiasm with which u.s. spies often targeted allies.\n\nbut both sides describe the operation as successful beyond their wildest projections. at times, including in the 1980s, crypto accounted for roughly 40 percent of the diplomatic cables and other transmissions by foreign governments that cryptanalysts at the nsa decoded and mined for intelligence, according to the documents.\n\nall the while, crypto generated millions of dollars in profits that the cia and bnd split and plowed into other operations.\n\ncrypto's sign is still visible atop its longtime headquarters near zug, switzerland, though the company was liquidated in 2018. (jahi chikwendiu/the washington post)\n\ncrypto's products are still in use in more than a dozen countries around the world, and its orange-and-white sign still looms atop the company's longtime headquarters building near zug, switzerland. but the company was dismembered in 2018, liquidated by shareholders whose identities have been permanently shielded by the byzantine laws of liechtenstein, a tiny european nation with a cayman islands-like reputation for financial secrecy.\n\ntwo companies purchased most of crypto's assets. the first, cyone security, was created as part of a management buyout and now sells security systems exclusively to the swiss government. the other, crypto international, took over the former company's brand and international business.\n\neach insisted that it has no ongoing connection to any intelligence service, but only one claimed to be unaware of cia ownership. their statements were in response to questions from the post, zdf and swiss broadcaster srf, which also had access to the documents.\n\ncyone has more substantial links to the now-dissolved crypto, including that the new company's chief executive held the same position at crypto for nearly two decades of cia ownership.\n\na cyone spokesman declined to address any aspect of crypto ag's history but said the new firm has no ties to any foreign intelligence services.\n\nandreas linde, the chairman of the company that now holds the rights to crypto's international products and business, said he had no knowledge of the company's relationship to the cia and bnd before being confronted with the facts in this article.\n\nwe at crypto international have never had any relationship with the cia or bnd — and please quote me, he said in an interview. if what you are saying is true, then absolutely i feel betrayed, and my family feels betrayed, and i feel there will be a lot of employees who will feel betrayed as well as customers.\n\nthe swiss government announced on tuesday that it was launching an investigation of crypto ag's ties to the cia and bnd. earlier this month, swiss officials revoked crypto international's export license.\n\nthe timing of the swiss moves was curious. the cia and bnd documents indicate that swiss officials must have known for decades about crypto's ties to the u.s. and german spy services, but intervened only after learning that news organizations were about to expose the arrangement.\n\nthe histories, which do not address when or whether the cia ended its involvement, carry the inevitable biases of documents written from the perspectives of the operation's architects. they depict rubicon as a triumph of espionage, one that helped the united states prevail in the cold war, keep tabs on dozens of authoritarian regimes and protect the interests of the united states and its allies.\n\nthe papers largely avoid more unsettling questions, including what the united states knew — and what it did or didn't do — about countries that used crypto machines while engaged in assassination plots, ethnic cleansing campaigns and human rights abuses.\n\nthe revelations in the documents may provide reason to revisit whether the united states was in position to intervene in, or at least expose, international atrocities, and whether it opted against doing so at times to preserve its access to valuable streams of intelligence.\n\nnor do the files deal with obvious ethical issues at the core of the operation: the deception and exploitation of adversaries, allies and hundreds of unwitting crypto employees. many traveled the world selling or servicing rigged systems with no clue that they were doing so at risk to their own safety.\n\njuerg spoerndli is an electrical engineer who spent 16 years working at crypto. deceived employees said the revelations about the company have deepened a sense of betrayal, of themselves and customers. (jahi chikwendiu/the washington post)\n\nin recent interviews, deceived employees — even ones who came to suspect during their time at crypto that the company was cooperating with western intelligence — said the revelations in the documents have deepened a sense of betrayal, of themselves and customers.\n\nyou think you do good work and you make something secure, said juerg spoerndli, an electrical engineer who spent 16 years at crypto. and then you realize that you cheated these clients.\n\nthose who ran the clandestine program remain unapologetic.\n\ndo i have any qualms? zero, said bobby ray inman, who served as director of the nsa and deputy director of the cia in the late 1970s and early 1980s. it was a very valuable source of communications on significantly large parts of the world important to u.s. policymakers.\n\nboris hagelin, the founder of crypto, and his wife arrive in new york in 1949. hagelin fled to the united states when the nazis occupied norway in 1940. (bettmann archive)\n\na denial operation\n\nthis sprawling, sophisticated operation grew out of the u.s. military's need for a crude but compact encryption device.\n\nboris hagelin, crypto's founder, was an entrepreneur and inventor who was born in russia but fled to sweden as the bolsheviks took power. he fled again to the united states when the nazis occupied norway in 1940.\n\nhe brought with him an encryption machine that looked like a fortified music box, with a sturdy crank on the side and an assembly of metal gears and pinwheels under a hard metal case.\n\nit wasn't nearly as elaborate, or secure, as the enigma machines being used by the nazis. but hagelin's m-209, as it became known, was portable, hand-powered and perfect for troops on the move. photos show soldiers with the eight-pound boxes — about the size of a thick book — strapped to their knees. many of hagelin's devices have been preserved at a private museum in eindhoven, the netherlands.\n\nmarc simons and paul reuvers founded the crypto museum in eindhoven, netherlands. the virtual museum has preserved many of hagelin's devices. (jahi chikwendiu/the washington post) hagelin's m-209 encryption machine had a crank on the side and an assembly of metal gears and pinwheels under a hard metal case. portable and hand-powered, it was used mainly for tactical messages about troop movements.

(jahi chikwendiu/the washington post)\n\nsending a secure message with the device was tedious. the user would rotate a dial, letter by letter, and thrust down the crank. the hidden gears would turn and spit out an enciphered message on a strip of paper. a signals officer then had to transmit that scrambled message by morse code to a recipient who would reverse the sequence.\n\nsecurity was so weak that it was assumed that nearly any adversary could break the code with enough time. but doing so took hours. and since these were used mainly for tactical messages about troop movements, by the time the nazis decoded a signal its value had probably perished.\n\nover the course of the war, about 140,000 m-209s were built at the smith corona typewriter factory in syracuse, n.y., under a u.s. army contract worth $8.6 million to crypto. after the war, hagelin returned to sweden to reopen his factory, bringing with him a personal fortune and a lifelong sense of loyalty to the united states.\n\neven so, american spies kept a wary eye on his postwar operations. in the early 1950s, he developed a more advanced version of his war-era machine with a new, irregular mechanical sequence that briefly stumped american code-breakers.\n\nmarc simons, co-founder of crypto museum, a virtual museum of cipher machines, explains how secret messages were created using the hagelin cx-52. (stanislav dobak/the washington post)\n\nalarmed by the capabilities of the new cx-52 and other devices crypto envisioned, u.s. officials began to discuss what they called the hagelin problem.\n\nthese were the dark ages of american cryptology,  according to the cia history. the soviets, chinese and north koreans were using code-making systems that were all but impenetrable. u.s. spy agencies worried that the rest of the world would also go dark if countries could buy secure machines from hagelin.\n\nthe americans had several points of leverage with hagelin: his ideological affinity for the country, his hope that the united states would remain a major customer and the veiled threat that they could damage his prospects by flooding the market with surplus m-209s from the war.\n\nthe u.s. army's signals intelligence service was headed by william friedman, center, in the mid-1930s. other members, from left: herrick f. bearce, solomon kullback, u.s. army capt. harold g. miller, louise newkirk nelson, seated, abraham sinkov, u.s. coast guard lt. l.t. jones and frank b. rowlett. (fotosearch/getty images)\n\nthe united states also had a more crucial asset: william friedman. widely regarded as the father of american cryptology, friedman had known hagelin since the 1930s. they had forged a lifelong friendship over their shared backgrounds and interests, including their russian heritage and fascination with the complexities of encryption.\n\nthere might never have been an operation rubicon if the two men had not shaken hands on the very first secret agreement between hagelin and u.s. intelligence over dinner at the cosmos club in washington in 1951.\n\nthe deal called for hagelin, who had moved his company to switzerland, to restrict sales of his most sophisticated models to countries approved by the united states. nations not on that list would get older, weaker systems. hagelin would be compensated for his lost sales, as much as $700,000 up front.\n\nit took years for the united states to live up to its end of the deal, as top officials at the cia and the predecessor to the nsa bickered over the terms and wisdom of the scheme. but hagelin abided by the agreement from the outset, and over the next two decades, his secret relationship with u.s. intelligence agencies deepened.\n\nin 1960, the cia and hagelin entered into a licensing agreement  that paid him $855,000 to renew his commitment to the handshake deal. the agency paid him $70,000 a year in retainer and started giving his company cash infusions of $10,000 for marketing expenses to ensure that crypto — and not other upstarts in the encryption business — locked down contracts with most of the world's governments.\n\nit was a classic denial operation in the parlance of intelligence, a scheme designed to prevent adversaries from acquiring weapons or technology that would give them an advantage. but it was only the beginning of crypto's collaboration with u.s. intelligence. within a decade, the whole operation belonged to the cia and bnd.\n\nin 1967, crypto released the h-460, an all-electronic machine whose inner workings were designed by the nsa. (jahi chikwendiu/the washington post)\n\na brave new world\n\nu.s. officials had toyed since the outset with the idea of asking hagelin whether he would be willing to let u.s. cryptologists doctor his machines. but friedman overruled them, convinced that hagelin would see that as a step too far.\n\nthe cia and nsa saw a new opening in the mid-1960s, as the spread of electronic circuits forced hagelin to accept outside help adapting to the new technology, or face extinction clinging to the manufacturing of mechanical machines.\n\nnsa cryptologists were equally concerned about the potential impact of integrated circuits, which seemed poised to enable a new era of unbreakable encryption. but one of the agency's senior analysts, peter jenks, identified a potential vulnerability.\n\nif carefully designed by a clever crypto-mathematician, he said, a circuit-based system could be made to appear that it was producing endless streams of randomly generated characters, while in reality it would repeat itself at short enough intervals for nsa experts — and their powerful computers — to crack the pattern.\n\ntwo years later, in 1967, crypto rolled out a new, all-electronic model, the h-460, whose inner workings were completely designed by the nsa.\n\nthe cia history all but gloats about crossing this threshold. imagine the idea of the american government convincing a foreign manufacturer to jimmy equipment in its favor, the history says. talk about a brave new world.\n\nthe nsa didn't install crude back doors or secretly program the devices to cough up their encryption keys. and the agency still faced the difficult task of intercepting other governments' communications, whether plucking signals out of the air or, in later years, tapping into fiber optic cables.\n\nbut the manipulation of crypto's algorithms streamlined the code-breaking process, at times reducing to seconds a task that might otherwise have taken months. the company always made at least two versions of its products — secure models that would be sold to friendly governments, and rigged systems for the rest of the world.\n\nin so doing, the u.s.-hagelin partnership had evolved from denial to active measures. no longer was crypto merely restricting sales of its best equipment but actively selling devices that were engineered to betray their buyers.\n\nthe payoff went beyond the penetration of the devices. crypto's shift to electronic products buoyed business so much that it became addicted to its dependence on the nsa. foreign governments clamored for systems that seemed clearly superior to the old clunky mechanical devices but in fact were easier for u.s. spies to read.\n\ngerman and american partners\n\nby the end of the 1960s, hagelin was nearing 80 and anxious to secure the future for his company, which had grown to more than 180 employees. cia officials were similarly anxious about what would happen to the operation if hagelin were to suddenly sell or die.\n\nhagelin had once hoped to turn control over to his son, bo. but u.s. intelligence officials regarded him as a wild card and worked to conceal the partnership from him. bo hagelin was killed in a car crash on washington's beltway in 1970. there were no indications of foul play.\n\nu.s. intelligence officials discussed the idea of buying crypto for years, but squabbling between the cia and nsa prevented them from acting until two other spy agencies entered the fray.\n\nthe french, west german and other european intelligence services had either been told about the united states' arrangement with crypto or figured it out on their own. some were understandably jealous and probed for ways to secure a similar deal for themselves.\n\nin 1967, hagelin was approached by the french intelligence service with an offer to buy the company in partnership with german intelligence. hagelin rebuffed the offer and reported it to his cia handlers. but two years later, the germans came back seeking to make a follow-up bid with the blessing of the united states.\n\nin a meeting in early 1969 at the west german embassy in washington, the head of that country's cipher service, wilhelm goeing, outlined the proposal and asked whether the americans were interested in becoming partners too.\n\nmonths later, cia director richard helms approved the idea of buying crypto and dispatched a subordinate to bonn, the west german capital, to negotiate terms with one major caveat: the french, cia officials told goeing, would have to be shut out.\n\nwest germany acquiesced to this american power play, and a deal between the two spy agencies was recorded in a june 1970 memo carrying the shaky signature of a cia case officer in munich who was in the early stages of parkinson's disease and the illegible scrawl of his bnd counterpart.\n\nthe two agencies agreed to chip in equally to buy out hagelin for approximately $5.75 million, but the cia left it largely to the germans to figure out how to prevent any trace of the transaction from ever becoming public.\n\na liechtenstein law firm, marxer and goop, helped hide the identities of the new owners of crypto through a series of shells and bearer shares that required no names in registration documents. the firm was paid an annual salary less for the extensive work but more for their silence and acceptance, the bnd history says. the firm, now named marxer and partner, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\na new board of directors was set up to oversee the company. only one member of the board, sture nyberg, to whom hagelin had turned over day-to-day management, knew of cia involvement. it was through this mechanism, the cia history notes, that bnd and cia controlled the activities of crypto. nyberg left the company in 1976. the post and zdf could not locate him or determine whether he is still alive.\n\nthe two spy agencies held their own regular meetings to discuss what to do with their acquisition. the cia used a secret base in munich, initially on a military installation used by american troops and later in the attic of a building adjacent to the u.s. consulate, as the headquarters for its involvement in the operation.\n\nthe cia and bnd agreed on a series of code names for the program and its various components. crypto was called minerva, which is also the title of the cia history. the operation was at first code-named thesaurus, though in the 1980s it was changed to rubicon.\n\neach year, the cia and bnd split any profits crypto had made, according to the german history, which says the bnd handled the accounting and delivered the cash owed to the cia in an underground parking garage.\n\nfrom the outset, the partnership was beset by petty disagreements and tensions. to cia operatives, the bnd often seemed preoccupied with turning a profit, and the americans constantly reminded the germans that this was an intelligence operation, not a money-making enterprise. the germans were taken aback by the americans' willingness to spy on all but their closest allies, with targets including nato members spain, greece, turkey and italy.\n\nmindful of the limitations to their abilities to run a high-tech company, the two agencies brought in corporate outsiders. the germans enlisted siemens, a munich-based conglomerate, to advise crypto on business and technical issues in exchange for 5 percent of the company's sales. the united states later brought in motorola to fix balky products, making it clear to the company's ceo this was being done for u.s. intelligence. siemens declined to comment. motorola officials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nto its frustration, germany was never admitted to the vaunted five eyes, a long-standing intelligence pact involving the united states, britain, australia, new zealand and canada. but with the crypto partnership, germany moved closer into the american espionage fold than might have seemed possible in world war ii's aftermath. with the secret backing of two of the world's premier intelligence agencies and the support of two of the world's largest corporations, crypto's business flourished.\n\na table in the cia history shows that sales surged from 15 million swiss francs in 1970 to more than 51 million in 1975, or $19 million. the company's payroll expanded to more than 250 employees.\n\nthe minerva purchase had yielded a bonanza, the cia history says of this period. the operation entered a two-decade stretch of unprecedented access to foreign governments' communications.\n\negyptian president anwar sadat and president jimmy carter meet during the egyptian-israeli peace negotiations at camp david in september 1978. during the negotiations, the nsa was secretly monitoring sadat's communications back to cairo. (white house/cnp/getty images)\n\niranian suspicions\n\nthe nsa's eavesdropping empire was for many years organized around three main geographic targets, each with its own alphabetic code: a for the soviets, b for asia and g for virtually everywhere else.\n\nby the early 1980s, more than half of the intelligence gathered by g group was flowing through crypto machines, a capability that u.s. officials relied on in crisis after crisis.\n\nin 1978, as the leaders of egypt, israel and the united states gathered at camp david for negotiations on a peace accord, the nsa was secretly monitoring the communications of egyptian president anwar sadat with cairo.\n\na year later, after iranian militants stormed the u.s. embassy and took 52 american hostages, the carter administration sought their release in back-channel communications through algeria. inman, who served as nsa director at the time, said he routinely got calls from president jimmy carter asking how the ayatollah khomeini regime was reacting to the latest messages.\n\nwe were able to respond to his questions about 85 percent of the time, inman said. that was because the iranians and algerians were using crypto devices.\n\ninman said the operation also put him in one of the trickiest binds he'd encountered in government service. at one point, the nsa intercepted libyan communications indicating that the president's brother, billy carter, was advancing libya's interests in washington and was on leader moammar gaddafi's payroll.\n\ninman referred the matter to the justice department. the fbi launched an investigation of carter, who falsely denied taking payments. in the end, he was not prosecuted but agreed to register as a foreign agent.\n\nthroughout the 1980s, the list of crypto's leading clients read like a catalogue of global trouble spots. in 1981, saudi arabia was crypto's biggest customer, followed by iran, italy, indonesia, iraq, libya, jordan and south korea.\n\nto protect its market position, crypto and its secret owners engaged in subtle smear campaigns against rival companies, according to the documents, and plied government officials with bribes. crypto sent an executive to riyadh, saudi arabia, with 10 rolex watches in his luggage, the bnd history says, and later arranged a training program for the saudis in switzerland where the participants' favorite pastime was to visit the brothels, which the company also financed.\n\nat times, the incentives led to sales to countries ill-equipped to use the complicated systems. nigeria bought a large shipment of crypto machines, but two years later, when there was still no corresponding payoff in intelligence, a company representative was sent to investigate. he found the equipment in a warehouse still in its original packaging, according to the german document.\n\nin 1982, the reagan administration took advantage of argentina's reliance on crypto equipment, funneling intelligence to britain during the two countries' brief war over the falkland islands, according to the cia history, which doesn't provide any detail on what kind of information was passed to london. the documents generally discuss intelligence gleaned from the operation in broad terms and provide few insights into how it was used.\n\nplainclothes u.s. military officers walk around the scene of the bombing at the la belle disco in west berlin, which killed two u.s. soldiers and a turkish woman in 1986. in an address, reagan appears to have jeopardized the crypto operation by citing evidence of libya's complicity in the attack. (andreas schoelzel/associated press)\n\nreagan appears to have jeopardized the crypto operation after libya was implicated in the 1986 bombing of a west berlin disco popular with american troops stationed in west germany. two u.s. soldiers and a turkish woman were killed as a result of the attack.\n\nreagan ordered retaliatory strikes against libya 10 days later. among the reported victims was one of gaddafi's daughters. in an address to the country announcing the strikes, reagan said the united states had evidence of libya's complicity that is direct, it is precise, it is irrefutable.\n\nthe evidence, reagan said, showed that libya's embassy in east berlin received orders to carry out the attack a week before it happened. then, the day after the bombing, they reported back to tripoli on the great success of their mission.\n\nreagan's words made clear that tripoli's communications with its station in east berlin had been intercepted and decrypted. but libya wasn't the only government that took note of the clues reagan had provided.\n\niran, which knew that libya also used crypto machines, became increasingly concerned about the security of its equipment. tehran didn't act on those suspicions until six years later.\n\ncrypto ag united states west germany west germany u.s. 1980 borders documents indicate that more than 120 countries used crypto ag encryption

man\n\nafter the cia and bnd acquisition, one of the most vexing problems for the secret partners was ensuring that crypto's workforce remained compliant and unsuspecting.\n\neven while hidden from view, the agencies went to significant lengths to maintain hagelin's benevolent approach to ownership. employees were well paid and had abundant perks including access to a small sailboat on lake zug near company headquarters.\n\nand yet, those who worked most closely with the encryption designs seemed constantly to be getting closer to uncovering the operation's core secret. the engineers and designers responsible for developing prototype models often questioned the algorithms being foisted on them by a mysterious external entity.\n\ncrypto executives often led employees to believe that the designs were being provided as part of the consulting arrangement with siemens. but even if that were so, why were encryption flaws so easy to spot, and why were crypto's engineers so routinely blocked from fixing them?\n\nin 1977, heinz wagner, the chief executive at crypto who knew the true role of the cia and bnd, abruptly fired a wayward engineer after the nsa complained that diplomatic traffic coming out of syria had suddenly became unreadable. the engineer, peter frutiger, had long suspected crypto was collaborating with german intelligence. he had made multiple trips to damascus to address complaints about their crypto products and apparently, without authority from headquarters, had fixed their vulnerabilities.\n\nfrutiger had figured out the minerva secret and it was not safe with him, according to the cia history. even so, the agency was livid with wagner for firing frutiger rather than finding a way to keep him quiet on the company payroll. frutiger declined to comment for this story.\n\nmengia caflisch, circa 1990s. after she was hired by crypto, caflisch, a gifted electrical engineer, began probing the vulnerabilities of the company's products. (obtained by the washington post)\n\nu.s. officials were even more alarmed when wagner hired a gifted electrical engineer in 1978 named mengia caflisch. she had spent several years in the united states working as a radio-astronomy researcher for the university of maryland before returning to her native switzerland and applying for a job at crypto. wagner jumped at the chance to hire her. but nsa officials immediately raised concerns that she was too bright to remain unwitting.\n\nthe warning proved prescient as caflisch soon began probing the vulnerabilities of the company's products. she and spoerndli, a colleague in the research department, ran various tests and plaintext attacks on devices including a teletype model, the hc-570, that was built using motorola technology, spoerndli said in an interview.\n\nwe looked at the internal operations, and the dependencies with each step, spoerndli said, and became convinced they could crack the code by comparing only 100 characters of enciphered text to an underlying, unencrypted message. it was an astonishingly low level of security, spoerndli said in an interview last month, but far from unusual.\n\nthe algorithms, he said, always looked fishy.\n\nin the ensuing years, caflisch continued to pose problems. at one point, she designed an algorithm so strong that nsa officials worried it would be unreadable. the design made its way into 50 hc-740 machines rolling off the factory floor before company executives discovered the development and stopped it.\n\ni just had an idea that something might be strange, caflisch said in an interview last month, about the origin of her suspicions. but it became clear that her probing wasn't appreciated, she said. not all questions appeared to be welcome.\n\nthe company restored the rigged algorithm to the rest of the production run and sold the 50 secure models to banks to keep them out of the hands of foreign governments. because these and other developments were so hard to defend, wagner at one point told a select group of members of the research and development unit that crypto was not entirely free to do what it wanted.\n\nthe acknowledgment seemed to subdue the engineers, who interpreted it as confirmation that the company's technology faced constraints imposed by the german government. but the cia and bnd became increasingly convinced that their routine, disembodied interference was unsustainable.\n\ncrypto had become an oz-like operation with employees probing to see what was behind the curtain. as the 1970s came to a close, the secret partners decided to find a wizard figure who could help devise more advanced — and less detectable — weaknesses in the algorithms, someone with enough cryptological clout to tame the research department.\n\nthe two agencies turned to other spy services for potential candidates before settling on an individual put forward by sweden's intelligence service. because of hagelin's ties to the country, sweden had been kept apprised of the operation since its outset.\n\nkjell-ove widman, a mathematics professor in stockholm, had made a name for himself in european academic circles with his research on cryptology. widman was also a military reservist who had worked closely with swedish intelligence officials.\n\nto the cia, widman had an even more important attribute: an affinity for the united states that he had formed while spending a year in washington state as an exchange student.\n\nhis host family had such trouble pronouncing his swedish name that they called him henry, a moniker he later used with his cia handlers.\n\nofficials involved in widman's recruitment described it as almost effortless. after being groomed by swedish intelligence officials, he was brought to munich in 1979 for what purported to be a round of interviews with executives from crypto and siemens.\n\nthe fiction was maintained as widman faced questions from a half-dozen men seated around a table in a hotel conference room. as the group broke for lunch, two men asked widman to stay behind for a private conversation.\n\ndo you know what zfch is? asked jelto burmeister, a bnd case officer, using the acronym for the german cipher service. when widman replied that he did, burmeister said, now, do you understand who really owns crypto ag?\n\nat that point, widman was introduced to richard schroeder, a cia officer stationed in munich to manage the agency's involvement in crypto. widman would later claim to agency historians that his world fell apart completely in that moment.\n\nif so, he did not hesitate to enlist in the operation.\n\nwithout even leaving the room, widman sealed his recruitment with a handshake. as the three men joined the rest of the group at lunch, a thumbs up signal transformed the gathering into a celebration.\n\ncrypto installed widman as a scientific advisor reporting directly to wagner. he became the spies' hidden inside agent, departing zug every six weeks for clandestine meetings with representatives of the nsa and zfch. schroeder, the cia officer, would attend but tune out their technical babble.\n\nthey would agree on modifications and work up new encryption schemes. then widman would deliver the blueprints to crypto engineers. the cia history calls him the irreplaceable man, and the most important recruitment in the history of the minerva program.\n\nhis stature cowed subordinates, investing him with a technical prominence that no one in cag could challenge. it also helped deflect the inquiries of foreign governments. as widman settled in, the secret partners adopted a set of principles for rigged algorithms, according to the bnd history. they had to be undetectable by usual statistical tests and, if discovered, be easily masked as implementation or human errors.\n\nin other words, when cornered, crypto executives would blame sloppy employees or clueless users.\n\nin 1982, when argentina became convinced that its crypto equipment had betrayed secret messages and helped british forces in the falklands war, widman was dispatched to buenos aires. widman told them the nsa had probably cracked an outdated speech-scrambling device that argentina was using, but that the main product they bought from crypto, the cag 500, remained unbreakable.\n\nthe bluff worked, the cia history says. the argentines swallowed hard, but kept buying cag equipment.\n\nwidman is long-retired now and living in stockholm. he declined to comment. years after his recruitment, he told u.s. officials that he saw himself as engaged in a critical struggle for the benefit of western intelligence, according to the cia document. it was, he said, the moment in which he felt at home. this was his mission in life.\n\nthat same year, hagelin, then 90 years old, became ill on a trip to sweden and was hospitalized. he recovered well enough to return to switzerland, but cia officials became worried about hagelin's extensive collection of business records and personal papers at his office in zug.\n\nschroeder, with hagelin's permission, arrived with a briefcase and spent several days going through the files. to visitors, he was introduced as a historian interested in tracing hagelin's life. schroeder pulled out the documents that were incriminating, according to the history, and shipped them back to cia headquarters, where they reside to this day.\n\nhagelin remained an invalid until he died in 1983. the post could not locate wagner or determine whether he is still alive. schroeder retired from the cia more than a decade ago and teaches part-time at georgetown university. when contacted by a reporter from the post, he declined to comment.\n\nthe hydra crisis\n\ncrypto endured several money-losing years in the 1980s, but the intelligence flowed in torrents. u.s. spy agencies intercepted more than 19,000 iranian communications sent via crypto machines during that nation's decade-long war with iraq, mining them for reports on subjects such as tehran's terrorist links and attempts to target dissidents.\n\niran's communications were 80 to 90 percent readable to u.s. spies, according to the cia document, a figure that would probably have plunged into the single digits had tehran not used crypto's compromised devices.\n\nin 1989, the vatican's use of crypto devices proved crucial in the u.s. manhunt for panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega. when the dictator sought refuge in the apostolic nunciature — the equivalent of a papal embassy — his whereabouts were exposed by the mission's messages back to vatican city.\n\nin 1992, however, the crypto operation faced its first major crisis: iran, belatedly acting on its long-standing suspicions, detained a company salesman.\n\nhans buehler, then 51, was considered one of the company's best salesmen. iran was one of the company's largest contracts, and buehler had traveled in and out of tehran for years. there were tense moments, including when he was questioned extensively in 1986 by iranian officials after the disco bombing and u.s. missile strikes on libya.\n\nsix years later, he boarded a swissair flight to tehran but failed to return on schedule. when he didn't show, crypto turned for help to swiss authorities and were told he had been arrested by the iranians. swiss consular officials allowed to visit buehler reported that he was in bad shape mentally, according to the cia history.\n\nbuehler was finally released nine months later after crypto agreed to pay the iranians $1 million, a sum that was secretly provided by the bnd, according to the documents. the cia refused to chip in, citing the u.s. policy against succumbing to ransom demands for hostages.\n\nbuehler knew nothing about crypto's relationship to the cia and bnd or the vulnerabilities in its devices. but he returned traumatized and suspicious that iran knew more about the company he worked for than he did. buehler began speaking to swiss news organizations about his ordeal and mounting suspicions.\n\nwilliam friedman in switzerland in 1957 with his wife and fellow cryptanalyst, elizebeth friedman, left, and annie hagelin, boris hagelin's wife.

(george c. marshall foundation)\n\nthe publicity brought new attention to long-forgotten clues, including references to a boris project in friedman's massive collection of personal papers, which were donated to virginia military institute when he died in 1969. among the 72 boxes delivered to lexington, va., were copies of his lifelong correspondence with hagelin.\n\nin 1994, the crisis deepened when buehler appeared on swiss television in a report that also featured frutiger, whose identity was concealed from viewers. buehler died in 2018. frutiger, the engineer who had been fired for fixing syria's encryption systems years earlier, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nmichael grupe, who had succeeded wagner as chief executive, agreed to appear on swiss television and disputed what he knew to be factual charges. grupe's performance was credible, and may have saved the program, the cia history says. grupe did not respond to requests for comment.\n\neven so, it took several years for the controversy to die down. in 1995, the baltimore sun ran a series of investigative stories about the nsa, including one called rigging the game that exposed aspects of the agency's relationship with crypto.\n\nthe article reported nsa officials had traveled to zug in the mid-1970s for secret meetings with crypto executives. the officials were posing as consultants for a front company called intercomm associates but then proceeded to introduce themselves by their real names — which were recorded on notes of the meeting kept by a company employee.\n\namid the publicity onslaught, some employees began to look elsewhere for work. and at least a half-dozen countries — including argentina, italy, saudi arabia, egypt and indonesia — either canceled or suspended their crypto contracts.\n\nastonishingly, iran was not among them, according to the cia file, and resumed its purchase of cag equipment almost immediately.\n\nthe main casualty of the hydra crisis, the code name given to the buehler case, was the cia-bnd partnership.\n\nfor years, bnd officials had recoiled at their american counterpart's refusal to distinguish adversaries from allies. the two partners often fought over which countries deserved to receive the secure versions of crypto's products, with u.s. officials frequently insisting that the rigged equipment be sent to almost anyone — ally or not — who could be deceived into buying it.\n\nin the german history, wolbert smidt, the former director of the bnd, complained that the united states wanted to deal with the allies just like they dealt with the countries of the third world. another bnd official echoed that comment, saying that to americans, in the world of intelligence there were no friends.\n\nthe cold war had ended, the berlin wall was down and the reunified germany had different sensitivities and priorities. they saw themselves as far more directly exposed to the risks of the crypto operation. hydra had rattled the germans, who feared the disclosure of their involvement would trigger european outrage and lead to enormous political and economic fallout.\n\nin 1993, konrad porzner, the chief of the bnd, made clear to cia director james woolsey that support in the upper ranks of the german government was waning and that the germans might want out of the crypto partnership. on sept. 9, the cia station chief in germany, milton bearden, reached an agreement with bnd officials for the cia to purchase germany's shares for $17 million, according to the cia history.\n\ngerman intelligence officials rued the departure from an operation they had largely conceived. in the german history, senior intelligence officials blame political leaders for ending one of the most successful espionage programs the bnd had ever been a part of.\n\nwith their departure, the germans were soon cut off from the intelligence that the united states continued to gather. burmeister is quoted in the german history wondering whether germany still belonged to this small number of nations who are not read by the americans.\n\nthe snowden documents provided what must have been an unsettling answer, showing that u.s. intelligence agencies not only regarded germany as a target but monitored german chancellor angela merkel's cellphone.\n\nalive and well\n\nthe cia history essentially concludes with germany's departure from the program, though it was finished in 2004 and contains clear indications that the operation was still underway.\n\nit notes, for example, that the buehler case was the most serious security breach in the history of the program but wasn't fatal. it did not cause its demise, the history says, and at the turn of the century minerva was still alive and well.\n\nin reality, the operation appears to have entered a protracted period of decline. by the mid-1990s, the days of profit were long past, and crypto would have gone out of business but for infusions from the u.s. government.\n\nas a result, the cia appears to have spent years propping up an operation that was more viable as an intelligence platform than a business enterprise. its product line dwindled and its revenue and customer base shrank.\n\nbut the intelligence kept coming, current and former officials said, in part because of bureaucratic inertia. many governments just never got around to switching to newer encryption systems proliferating in the 1990s and beyond — and unplugging their crypto devices. this was particularly true of less developed nations, according to the documents.\n\nmost of the employees identified in the cia and bnd histories are in their 70s or 80s, and some of them have died. in interviews in switzerland last month, several former crypto workers mentioned in the documents described feelings of unease about their involvement in the company.\n\nthey were never informed of its true relationship to intelligence services. but they had well-founded suspicions and still wrestle with the ethical implications of their decisions to remain at a firm they believed to be engaged in deception.\n\neither you had to leave or you had to accept it in a certain way, said caflisch, now 75, who left the company in 1995 but continues to live on the outskirts of zug in a converted weaving factory where she and her family for many years staged semiprofessional operas in the barn. there were reasons i left, she said, including her discomfort with her doubts at crypto and her desire to be home more for her children. after the latest revelations, she said, it makes me wonder whether i should have left earlier.\n\nspoerndli said he regrets his own rationalizations.\n\ni told myself sometimes it may be better if the good guys in the united states know what is going on between these third world dictators, he said. but it's a cheap self-excuse. in the end, this is not the way.\n\nmost of the executives directly involved in the operation were motivated by ideological purpose and declined any payment beyond their crypto salaries, according to the documents. widman was among several exceptions. as his retirement drew near, his covert compensation was substantially increased, the cia history says. he was also awarded a medal bearing the cia seal.\n\nafter the bnd's departure, the cia expanded its clandestine collection of companies in the encryption sector, according to former western intelligence officials. using cash amassed from the crypto operation, the agency secretly acquired a second firm and propped up a third. the documents do not disclose any details about these entities. but the bnd history notes that one of crypto's longtime rivals — gretag ag, also based in switzerland — was taken over by an 'american' and, after a change of names in 2004, was liquidated.\n\ncrypto itself hobbled along. it had survived the transitions from metal boxes to electronic circuits, going from teletype machines to enciphered voice systems. but it struggled to maintain its footing as the encryption market moved from hardware to software. u.s. intelligence agencies appear to have been content to let the crypto operation play out, even as the nsa's attention shifted to finding ways to exploit the global reach of google, microsoft, verizon and other u.s. tech powers.\n\nin 2017, crypto's longtime headquarters building near zug was sold to a commercial real estate company. in 2018, the company's remaining assets — the core pieces of the encryption business started nearly a century earlier — were split and sold.\n\nthe transactions seemed designed to provide cover for a cia exit.\n\ncyone's purchase of the swiss portion of the business was structured as a management buyout, enabling top crypto employees to move into a new company insulated from the espionage risks and with a reliable source of revenue. the swiss government, which was always sold secure versions of crypto's systems, is now cyone's only customer.\n\ngiuliano otth, who served as ceo of crypto ag from 2001 until its dismemberment, took the same position at cyone after it acquired the swiss assets. given his tenure at crypto, it is likely he was witting to the cia ownership of the company, just as all of his predecessors in the job had been.\n\nneither cyone security ag nor mr. otth have any comments regarding crypto ag's history, the company said in a statement.\n\ncrypto's international accounts and business assets were sold to linde, a swedish entrepreneur, who comes from a wealthy family with commercial real estate holdings.\n\nin a meeting in zurich last month, linde said he had been drawn to the company in part by its heritage and hagelin connection, a past that still resonates in sweden. upon taking over operations, linde even moved some of hagelin's historic equipment from storage into a display at the factory entrance.\n\nwhen confronted with evidence that crypto had been owned by the cia and bnd, linde looked visibly shaken, and said that during negotiations he never learned the identities of the company's shareholders. he asked when the story would be published, saying he had employees overseas and voicing concern for their safety.\n\nin a subsequent interview, linde said his company is investigating all the products it sells to determine whether they have any hidden vulnerabilities. we have to make a cut as soon as possible with everything that has been linked to crypto, he said.\n\nwhen asked why he failed to confront otth and others involved in the transaction about whether there was any truth to the long-standing crypto allegations, linde said he had regarded these as just rumors.\n\nhe said he took assurance from the fact that crypto continued to have substantial contracts with foreign governments, countries he assumed had tested the company's products vigorously and would have abandoned them if they were compromised.\n\ni even acquired the brand name, 'crypto,'  he said, underscoring his confidence in the company's viability. given the information now coming to light, he said, this was probably one of the most stupid decisions i've ever made in my career.\n\nthe company's liquidation was handled by the same liechtenstein law firm that provided cover for hagelin's sale to the cia and bnd 48 years earlier. the terms of the 2018 transactions have not been disclosed, but current and former officials estimated their aggregate value at $50 million to $70 million.\n\nfor the cia, the money would have been one final payoff from

i can't say for sure that they're wrong. there are no certainties here, and no way to account for every variable that could affect the outcome of the election, let alone events that we can't foresee.\n\nbut what we ought to realize is that both sanders and biden represent a huge risk to the democrats — but for completely different reasons.\n\nad\n\nto simplify things a bit, i fear that sanders would do everything right and fall short because he was fated to lose, while i fear that biden would do everything wrong and blow a race he could have won.\n\nad\n\nlet's start with biden. his victory in south carolina does not change the fundamental fact that he is simply terrible at running for president — even worse than in his disastrous runs in 1988 and 2008. those who are on the campaign trail will tell you that he is showing his age — he starts sentences then can't find his way out of them, he's surly when challenged, and he says cringeworthy things on a daily basis. his debate performances have ranged from barely acceptable to abysmal.\n\nso how much confidence do you have that biden wouldn't find a way to screw this up?\n\nad\n\nopinion who could win the democratic primary? use the post opinions simulator to pick a state and see what might happen in upcoming primaries and caucuses.\n\nit's possible that he can win over voters in the middle who are tired of trump and that biden offers the reassurance of an old white guy who talks a lot about how we can all get along if we just wind the clock back four years and pretend trump never happened. but it's also possible, if not likely, that biden will prove to be an uninspiring candidate of the kind democrats have ridden to defeat so many times before, one who will lose more votes through the deadening of turnout than he'll win by converting republicans.\n\nad\n\nyes, he's getting support from african american voters — so far, anyway — but they already vote at relatively high rates, comparable to white voters. the big untapped potential for democrats lies in young people and latinos, neither of whom seems particularly jazzed about a biden nomination.\n\ndespite biden's insistence that he'll beat trump like a drum, it isn't hard to imagine trump gutting him like a fish. republicans in congress are already ramping their investigation of hunter biden back up, and you can bet they'll use that story to cast a pall over joe biden as corrupt or just vaguely untrustworthy.\n\nad\n\nand biden's history on issues like criminal justice and social security gives trump ample ammunition to run against him from the left, a demobilization strategy designed not to convince anyone that trump is better on those issues but to make democrats withdraw in disgust and decide not to vote.\n\nad\n\nand what about sanders? he could be just as problematic a nominee.\n\nthe first reason is the obvious one: he's farther to the left than any nominee we've had in pretty much forever. there's a good potential that his views on policy — especially when run through the ringer of an unsympathetic media and a highly motivated opposition — will come to seem dangerous, even frightening. i might be sympathetic to most (though not all) of his proposals, but there's no denying that he proposes radical change.\n\nad\n\ndepending on what happens with the coronavirus, to many voters the status quo, particularly the economic status quo, may seem pretty good, and even if they don't like trump, they'll take him over a future that they've come to find unsettling. you can see that in the many stories emerging about disgruntled republicans and independents saying they'll vote for a democrat — unless it's sanders. right now those are just anecdotes, but they could begin to pile up into something more threatening to his prospects.\n\nad\n\nsanders says he'll solve all these problems with an unprecedented turnout wave, particularly among those young voters. but so far there isn't much to suggest it's happening. turnout in the primaries has been reasonably strong, but not unprecedented — and not all benefiting him. the fact that many politically involved young people are excited about bernie sanders does not necessarily mean that huge numbers of young people who aren't politically involved will inevitably become excited about bernie sanders.\n\nthat's not the only reason to be skeptical. while sanders might not depress democratic turnout in the way some other candidate might, his ability to bring significant numbers of new voters in — without simultaneously motivating higher turnout among republicans that would cancel it out — is for the moment a proposition without evidence to back it up.\n\nad\n\nup until now, general election trial heats have shown both sanders and biden beating trump pretty much every time. but we should never assume that what people think of the eventual nominee now tells us much about what they'll think of him in october, once the full power of trump's disinformation machine is aimed at him, not to mention a news media that is likely to repeat the but her emails debacle of 2016.\n\nad\n\nyou might find one of these two stories more persuasive than the other; chances are it's the one that matches up with the preference you already have for one or the other candidate. but the fact is that neither of the two men with the best chance of being the democratic nominee looks like a strong general election candidate.\n\nsorry if that fills you with dread; that's certainly how i feel. but it's the truth.
the washington post obtained a copy of a recording of the call. this transcript has been edited to remove the name of an individual about whom trump makes unsubstantiated claims.\n\nmeadows: okay. alright. mr. president, everyone is on the line. this is mark meadows, the chief of staff. just so we all are aware. on the line is secretary of state and two other individuals. jordan and mr. germany with him. you also have the attorneys that represent the president, kurt and alex and cleta mitchell — who is not the attorney of record but has been involved — myself and then the president. so mr. president, i'll turn it over to you.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ntrump: okay, thank you very much. hello brad and ryan and everybody. we appreciate the time and the call. so we've spent a lot of time on this, and if we could just go over some of the numbers, i think it's pretty clear that we won. we won very substantially in georgia. you even see it by rally size, frankly. we'd be getting 25-30,000 people a rally, and the competition would get less than 100 people. and it never made sense.\n\nbut we have a number of things. we have at least 2 or 3 — anywhere from 250 to 300,000 ballots were dropped mysteriously into the rolls. much of that had to do with fulton county, which hasn't been checked. we think that if you check the signatures — a real check of the signatures going back in fulton county — you'll find at least a couple of hundred thousand of forged signatures of people who have been forged. and we are quite sure that's going to happen.\n\nanother tremendous number. we're going to have an accurate number over the next two days with certified accountants. but an accurate number will be given, but it's in the 50s of thousands — and that's people that went to vote and they were told they can't vote because they've already been voted for. and it's a very sad thing. they walked out complaining. but the number's large. we'll have it for you. but it's much more than the number of 11,779 that's — the current margin is only 11,779. brad, i think you agree with that, right? that's something i think everyone — at least that's a number that everyone agrees on.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbut that's the difference in the votes. but we've had hundreds of thousands of ballots that we're able to actually — we'll get you a pretty accurate number. you don't need much of a number because the number that in theory i lost by, the margin would be 11,779. but you also have a substantial numbers of people, thousands and thousands, who went to the voting place on november 3, were told they couldn't vote, were told they couldn't vote because a ballot had been put on their name. and you know that's very, very, very, very sad.\n\nwe had, i believe it's about 4,502 voters who voted but who weren't on the voter registration list, so it's 4,502 who voted, but they weren't on the voter registration roll, which they had to be. you had 18,325 vacant address voters. the address was vacant, and they're not allowed to be counted. that's 18,325.\n\nsmaller number — you had 904 who only voted where they had just a p.o. — a post office box number — and they had a post office box number, and that's not allowed. we had at least 18,000 — that's on tape, we had them counted very painstakingly — 18,000 voters having to do with [name]. she's a vote scammer, a professional vote scammer and hustler [name]. that was the tape that's been shown all over the world that makes everybody look bad, you, me and everybody else.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwhere they got — number one they said very clearly and it's been reported that they said there was a major water main break. everybody fled the area. and then they came back, [name] and her daughter and a few people. there were no republican poll watchers. actually, there were no democrat poll watchers, i guess they were them. but there were no democrats, either, and there was no law enforcement. late in the morning, early in the morning, they went to the table with the black robe and the black shield, and they pulled out the votes. those votes were put there a number of hours before — the table was put there — i think it was, brad, you would know, it was probably eight hours or seven hours before, and then it was stuffed with votes.\n\nthey weren't in an official voter box; they were in what looked to be suitcases or trunks, suitcases, but they weren't in voter boxes. the minimum number it could be because we watched it, and they watched it certified in slow motion instant replay if you can believe it, but slow motion, and it was magnified many times over, and the minimum it was 18,000 ballots, all for biden.\n\nyou had out-of-state voters. they voted in georgia, but they were from out of state, of 4,925. you had absentee ballots sent to vacant, they were absentee ballots sent to vacant addresses. they had nothing on them about addresses, that's 2,326.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nand you had dropboxes, which is very bad. you had dropboxes that were picked up. we have photographs, and we have affidavits from many people.\n\n\n\ni don't know if you saw the hearings, but you have dropboxes where the box was picked up but not delivered for three days. so all sorts of things could have happened to that box, including, you know, putting in the votes that you wanted. so there were many infractions, and the bottom line is, many, many times the 11,779 margin that they said we lost by — we had vast, i mean the state is in turmoil over this.\n\nand i know you would like to get to the bottom of it, although i saw you on television today, and you said that you found nothing wrong. i mean, you know, and i didn't lose the state, brad. people have been saying that it was the highest vote ever. there was no way. a lot of the political people said that there's no way they beat me. and they beat me. they beat me in the . . . as you know, every single state, we won every state. we won every statehouse in the country. we held the senate, which is shocking to people, although we'll see what happens tomorrow or in a few days.\n\n\n\nad\n\nad\n\nand we won the house, but we won every single statehouse, and we won congress, which was supposed to lose 15 seats, and they gained, i think 16 or 17 or something. i think there's a now difference of five. there was supposed to be a difference substantially more. but politicians in every state, but politicians in georgia have given affidavits and are going to that, that there was no way that they beat me in the election, that the people came out, in fact, they were expecting to lose, and then they ended up winning by a lot because of the coattails. and they said there's no way, that they've done many polls prior to the election, that there was no way that they won.\n\nballots were dropped in massive numbers. and we're trying to get to those numbers and we will have them.\n\nthey'll take a period of time. certified. but but they're massive numbers. and far greater than the 11,779.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe other thing, dead people. so dead people voted, and i think the number is close to 5,000 people. and they went to obituaries. they went to all sorts of methods to come up with an accurate number, and a minimum is close to about 5,000 voters.\n\nthe bottom line is, when you add it all up and then you start adding, you know, 300,000 fake ballots. then the other thing they said is in fulton county and other areas. and this may or may not be true . . . this just came up this morning, that they are burning their ballots, that they are shredding, shredding ballots and removing equipment. they're changing the equipment on the dominion machines and, you know, that's not legal.\n\nand they supposedly shredded i think they said 300 pounds of, 3,000 pounds of ballots. and that just came to us as a report today. and it is a very sad situation.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbut brad, if you took the minimum numbers where many, many times above the 11,779, and many of those numbers are certified, or they will be certified, but they are certified. and those are numbers that are there, that exist. and that beat the margin of loss, they beat it, i mean, by a lot, and people should be happy to have an accurate count instead of an election where there's turmoil.\n\ni mean there's turmoil in georgia and other places. you're not the only one, i mean, we have other states that i believe will be flipping to us very shortly. and this is something that — you know, as an example, i think it in detroit, i think there's a section, a good section of your state actually, which we're not sure so we're not going to report it yet. but in detroit, we had, i think it was, 139 percent of the people voted. that's not too good.\n\n\n\nin pennsylvania, they had well over 200,000 more votes than they had people voting. and that doesn't play too well, and the legislature there is, which is republican, is extremely activist and angry. i mean, there were other things also that were almost as bad as that. but they had as an example, in michigan, a tremendous number of dead people that voted. i think it was, i think, mark, it was 18,000. some unbelievably high number, much higher than yours, you were in the 4-5,000 category.\n\n\n\nad\n\nad\n\nand that was checked out laboriously by going through, by going through the obituary columns in the newspapers.\n\nso i guess with all of it being said, brad, the bottom line, and provisional ballots, again, you know, you'll have to tell me about the provisional ballots, but we have a lot of people that were complaining that they weren't able to vote because they were already voted for. these are great people.\n\n\n\nand, you know, they were shellshocked. i don't know if you call that provisional ballots. in some states, we had a lot of provisional ballot situations where people were given a provisional ballot because when they walked in on november 3 and they were already voted for.\n\n\n\nso that's it. i mean, we have many, many times the number of votes necessary to win the state. and we won the state, and we won it very substantially and easily, and we're getting, we have, much of this is a very certified, far more certified than we need. but we're getting additional numbers certified, too. and we're getting pictures of dropboxes being delivered and delivered late. delivered three days later, in some cases, plus we have many affidavits to that effect.\n\nmeadows: so, mr. president, if i might be able to jump in, and i'll give brad a chance. mr. secretary, obviously there is, there are allegations where we believe that not every vote or fair vote and legal vote was counted, and that's at odds with the representation from the secretary of state's office.\n\n\n\nwhat i'm hopeful for is there some way that we can, we can find some kind of agreement to look at this a little bit more fully? you know the president mentioned fulton county.\n\n\n\nbut in some of these areas where there seems to be a difference of where the facts seem to lead, and so mr. secretary, i was hopeful that, you know, in the spirit of cooperation and compromise, is there something that we can at least have a discussion to look at some of these allegations to find a path forward that's less litigious?\n\n\n\nraffensperger: well, i listened to what the president has just said. president trump, we've had several lawsuits, and we've had to respond in court to the lawsuits and the contentions. we don't agree that you have won. and we don't — i didn't agree about the 200,000 number that you'd mentioned. i'll go through that point by point.\n\nwhat we have done is we gave our state senate about one and a half hours of our time going through the election issue by issue and then on the state house, the government affairs committee, we gave them about two and a half hours of our time, going back point by point on all the issues of contention. and then just a few days ago, we met with our u.s. congressmen, republican congressmen, and we gave them about two hours of our time talking about this past election. going back, primarily what you've talked about here focused in on primarily, i believe, is the absentee ballot process. i don't believe that you're really questioning the dominion machines. because we did a hand re-tally, a 100 percent re-tally of all the ballots, and compared them to what the machines said and came up with virtually the same result. then we did the recount, and we got virtually the same result. so i guess we can probably take that off the table.\n\n\n\ni don't think there's an issue about that.\n\ntrump: well, brad. not that there's not an issue, because we have a big issue with dominion in other states and perhaps in yours. but we haven't felt we needed to go there. and just to, you know, maybe put a little different spin on what mark is saying, mark meadows, yeah we'd like to go further, but we don't really need to. we have all the votes we need.\n\n\n\nyou know, we won the state. if you took, these are the most minimal numbers, the numbers that i gave you, those are numbers that are certified, your absentee ballots sent to vacant addresses, your out-of-state voters, 4,925. you know when you add them up, it's many more times, it's many times the 11,779 number. so we could go through, we have not gone through your dominion. so we can't give them blessing. i mean, in other states, we think we found tremendous corruption with dominion machines, but we'll have to see.\n\n\n\nbut we only lost the state by that number, 11,000 votes, and 779. so with that being said, with just what we have, with just what we have, we're giving you minimal, minimal numbers. we're doing the most conservative numbers possible; we're many times, many, many times above the margin. and so we don't really have to, mark, i don't think we have to go through . . .\n\n\n\nmeadows: right\n\ntrump: because what's the difference between winning the election by two votes and winning it by half a million votes. i think i probably did win it by half a million. you know, one of the things that happened, brad, is we have other people coming in now from alabama and from south carolina and from other states, and they're saying it's impossible for you to have lost georgia. we won. you know in alabama, we set a record, got the highest vote ever. in georgia, we set a record with a massive amount of votes. and they say it's not possible to have lost georgia.\n\nand i could tell you by our rallies. i could tell you by the rally i'm having on monday night, the place, they already have lines of people standing out front waiting. it's just not possible to have lost georgia. it's not possible. when i heard it was close, i said there's no way. but they dropped a lot of votes in there late at night. you know that, brad. and that's what we are working on very, very stringently. but regardless of those votes, with all of it being said, we lost by essentially 11,000 votes, and we have many more votes already calculated and certified, too.\n\nand so i just don't know, you know, mark, i don't know what's the purpose. i won't give dominion a pass because we found too many bad things. but we don't need dominion or anything else. we have won this election in georgia based on all of this. and there's nothing wrong with saying that, brad. you know, i mean, having the correct — the people of georgia are angry. and these numbers are going to be repeated on monday night. along with others that we're going to have by that time, which are much more substantial even. and the people of georgia are angry, the people of the country are angry. and there's nothing wrong with saying that, you know, that you've recalculated. because the 2,236 in absentee ballots. i mean, they're all exact numbers that were done by accounting firms, law firms, etc. and even if you cut 'em in half, cut 'em in half and cut 'em in half again, it's more votes than we need.\n\nraffensperger: well, mr. president, the challenge that you have is the data you have is wrong. we talked to the congressmen, and they were surprised.\n\n\n\nbut they — i guess there was a person named mr. braynard who came to these meetings and presented data, and he said that there was dead people, i believe it was upward of 5,000. the actual number were two. two. two people that were dead that voted. so that's wrong.\n\n\n\ntrump: well, cleta, how do you respond to that? maybe you tell me?\n\nmitchell: well, i would say, mr. secretary, one of the things that we have requested and what we said was, if you look, if you read our petition, it said that we took the names and birth years, and we had certain information available to us. we have asked from your office for records that only you have, and so we said there is a universe of people who have the same name and same birth year and died.\n\nbut we don't have the records that you have. and one of the things that we have been suggesting formally and informally for weeks now is for you to make available to us the records that would be necessary —\n\ntrump: but, cleta, even before you do that, and not even including that, that's why i hardly even included that number, although in one state, we have a tremendous amount of dead people. so i don't know — i'm sure we do in georgia, too. i'm sure we do in georgia, too.\n\nbut we're so far ahead. we're so far ahead of these numbers, even the phony ballots of [name] , known scammer. you know the internet? you know what was trending on the internet? where's [name]? because they thought she'd be in jail. where's [name]? it's crazy, it's crazy. that was. the minimum number is 18,000 for [name] , but they think it's probably about 56,000, but the minimum number is 18,000 on the [name] night where she ran back in there when everybody was gone and stuffed, she stuffed the ballot boxes. let's face it, brad, i mean. they did it in slow motion replay magnified, right? she stuffed the ballot boxes. they were stuffed like nobody has ever seen them stuffed before.\n\nso there's a term for it when it's a machine instead of a ballot box, but she stuffed the machine. she stuffed the ballot. each ballot went three times, they were showing: here's ballot no 1. here it is a second time, third time, next ballot.\n\ni mean, look. brad. we have a new tape that we're going to release. it's devastating. and by the way, that one event, that one event is much more than the 11,000 votes that we're talking about. it's, you know, that one event was a disaster. and it's just, you know, but it was, it was something, it can't be disputed. and again, we have a version that you haven't seen, but it's magnified. it's magnified, and you can see everything. for some reason, they put it in three times, each ballot, and i don't know why. i don't know why three times. why not five times, right? go ahead.\n\nraffensperger: you're talking about the state farm video. and i think it's extremely unfortunate that rudy giuliani or his people, they sliced and diced that video and took it out of context. the next day, we brought in wsb-tv, and we let them show, see the full run of tape, and what you'll see, the events that transpired are nowhere near what was projected by, you know —\n\ntrump: but where were the poll watchers, brad? there were no poll watchers there. there were no democrats or republicans. there was no security there.\n\nit was late in the evening, late in the, early in the morning, and there was nobody else in the room. where were the poll watchers, and why did they say a water main broke, which they did and which was reported in the newspapers? they said they left. they ran out because of a water main break, and there was no water main. there was nothing. there was no break. there was no water main break. but we're, if you take out everything, where were the republican poll watchers, even where were the democrat pollwatchers, because there were none.\n\nand then you say, well, they left their station, you know, if you look at the tape, and this was, this was reviewed by professional police and detectives and other people, when they left in a rush, everybody left in a rush because of the water main, but everybody left in a rush. these people left their station.\n\nwhen they came back, they didn't go to their station. they went to the apron, wrapped around the table, under which were thousands and thousands of ballots in a box that was not an official or a sealed box. and then they took those. they went back to a different station. so if they would have come back, they would have walked to their station, and they would have continued to work. but they couldn't do even that because that's illegal, because they had no republican pollwatchers. and remember, her reputation is — she's known all over the internet, brad. she's known all over.\n\ni'm telling you, where's [name]  was one of the hot items . . . [name] they knew her. where's [name]? so brad, there can be no justification for that. and i, you know, i give everybody the benefit of the doubt. but that was — and brad, why did they put the votes in three times? you know, they put 'em in three times.\n\nraffensperger: mr. president, they did not put that. we did an audit of that, and we proved conclusively that they were not scanned three times.\n\ntrump: where was everybody else at that late time in the morning? where was everybody? where were the republicans? where were the security guards? were the people that were there just a little while before when everyone ran out of the room. how come we had no security in the room. why did they run to the bottom of the table? why do they run there and just open the skirt and rip out the votes. i mean, brad. and they were sitting there, i think for five hours or something like that, the votes.\n\nraffensperger: mr. president, we'll send you the link from wsb.\n\ntrump: i don't care about the link. i don't need it. brad, i have a much better —\n\nmitchell: i will tell you. i've seen the tape. the full tape. so has alex. we've watched it. and what we saw and what we've confirmed in the timing is that they made everybody leave — we have sworn affidavits saying that. and then they began to process ballots. and our estimate is that there were roughly 18,000 ballots. we don't know that. if you know that —\n\ntrump: — it was 18,000 ballots, but they used each one three times.\n\nmitchell: well, i don't know about that, but i know —\n\ntrump: — well, i do, because we had ours magnified out —\n\nmitchell: i've watched the entire tape.\n\ntrump: — but nobody can make a case for that, brad. nobody. i mean, look, that's, you'd have to be a child to think anything other than that. just a child. i mean you have your never-trumper u.s. attorney there —\n\nmitchell: — how many ballots, mr. secretary, are you saying were processed then?\n\nraffensperger: we had gbi . . . investigate that.\n\ngermany: we had our — this is ryan germany. we had our law enforcement officers talk to everyone who was, who was there after that event came to light. gbi was with them as well as fbi agents.\n\ntrump: well, there's no way they could — then they're incompetent. they're either dishonest or incompetent, okay?\n\nmitchell: well, what did they find?\n\ntrump: there's only two answers, dishonesty or incompetence. there's just no way. look. there's no way. and on the other thing, i said too, there is no way. i mean, there's no way that these things could have been, you know, you have all these different people that voted, but they don't live in georgia anymore. what was that number, cleta? that was a pretty good number, too.\n\nmitchell: the number who have registered out of state after they moved from georgia. and so they had a date when they moved from georgia, they registered to vote out of state, and then it's like 4,500, i don't have that number right in front of me.\n\ntrump: and then they came back in, and they voted.\n\nmitchell: and voted. yeah.\n\ntrump: i thought that was a large number, though. it was in the 20s.\n\ngermany: we've been going through each of those as well, and those numbers that we got, that ms. mitchell was just saying, they're not accurate. every one we've been through are people that lived in georgia, moved to a different state, but then moved back to georgia legitimately. and in many cases —\n\ntrump: how may people do that? they moved out, and then they said, ah, to hell with it, i'll move back. you know, it doesn't sound like a very normal . . . you mean, they moved out, and what, they missed it so much that they wanted to move back in? it's crazy.\n\n\n\ngermany: they moved back in years ago. this was not like something just before the election. so there's something about that data that, it's just not accurate.\n\ntrump: well, i don't know, all i know is that it is certified. and they moved out of georgia, and they voted. it didn't say they moved back in, cleta, did it?\n\nmitchell: no, but i mean, we're looking at the voter registration. again, if you have additional records, we've been asking for that, but you haven't shared any of that with us. you just keep saying you investigated the allegations.\n\ntrump: cleta, a lot of it you don't need to be shared. i mean, to be honest, they should share it. they should share it because you want to get to an honest election.\n\ni won this election by hundreds of thousands of votes. there's no way i lost georgia. there's no way. we won by hundreds of thousands of votes. i'm just going by small numbers, when you add them up, they're many times the 11,000. but i won that state by hundreds of thousands of votes.\n\n\n\ndo you think it's possible that they shredded ballots in fulton county? because that's what the rumor is. and also that dominion took out machines. that dominion is really moving fast to get rid of their, uh, machinery.\n\n\n\ndo you know anything about that? because that's illegal, right?\n\n\n\ngermany: this is ryan germany. no, dominion has not moved any machinery out of fulton county.\n\ntrump: but have they moved the inner parts of the machines and replaced them with other parts?\n\ngermany: no.\n\ntrump: are you sure, ryan?\n\ngermany: i'm sure. i'm sure, mr. president.\n\ntrump: what about, what about the ballots. the shredding of the ballots. have they been shredding ballots?\n\ngermany: the only investigation that we have into that — they have not been shredding any ballots. there was an issue in cobb county where they were doing normal office shredding, getting rid of old stuff, and we investigated that. but this stuff from, you know, from you know past elections.\n\ntrump: it doesn't pass the smell test because we hear they're shredding thousands and thousands of ballots, and now what they're saying, oh, we're just cleaning up the office. you know.\n\nraffensperger: mr. president, the problem you have with social media, they — people can say anything.\n\ntrump: oh this isn't social media. this is trump media. it's not social media. it's really not; it's not social media. i don't care about social media. i couldn't care less. social media is big tech. big tech is on your side, you know. i don't even know why you have a side because you should want to have an accurate election. and you're a republican.\n\n\n\nraffensperger: we believe that we do have an accurate election.\n\ntrump: no, no you don't. no, no you don't. you don't have. not even close. you're off by hundreds of thousands of votes. and just on the small numbers, you're off on these numbers, and these numbers can't be just — well, why wont? — okay. so you sent us into cobb county for signature verification, right? you sent us into cobb county, which we didn't want to go into. and you said it would be open to the public. so we had our experts there, they weren't allowed into the room. but we didn't want cobb county. we wanted fulton county. and you wouldn't give it to us. now, why aren't we doing signature — and why can't it be open to the public?\n\nand why can't we have professionals do it instead of rank amateurs who will never find anything and don't want to find anything? they don't want to find, you know they don't want to find anything. someday you'll tell me the reason why, because i don't understand your reasoning, but someday you'll tell me the reason why. but why don't you want to find?\n\ngermany: mr. president, we chose cobb county —\n\ntrump: why don't you want to find . . . what?\n\ngermany: sorry, go ahead.\n\ntrump: so why did you do cobb county? we didn't even request — we requested fulton county, not cobb county. go ahead, please. go ahead.\n\ngermany: we chose cobb county because that was the only county where there's been any evidence submitted that the signature verification was not properly done.\n\ntrump: no, but i told you. we're not, we're not saying that.\n\nmitchell: we did say that.\n\ntrump: fulton county. look. stacey, in my opinion, stacey is as dishonest as they come. she has outplayed you . . . at everything. she got you to sign a totally unconstitutional agreement, which is a disastrous agreement. you can't check signatures. i can't imagine you're allowed to do harvesting, i guess, in that agreement. that agreement is a disaster for this country. but she got you somehow to sign that thing, and she has outsmarted you at every step.\n\nand i hate to imagine what's going to happen on monday or tuesday, but it's very scary to people. you know, when the ballots flow in out of nowhere. it's very scary to people. that consent decree is a disaster. it's a disaster. a very good lawyer who examined it said they've never seen anything like it.\n\n\n\nraffensperger: harvesting is still illegal in the state of georgia. and that settlement agreement did not change that one iota.\n\ntrump: it's not a settlement agreement, it's a consent decree. it even says consent decree on it, doesn't it? it uses the term consent decree. it doesn't say settlement agreement. it's a consent decree. it's a disaster.\n\nraffensperger: it's a settlement agreement.\n\ntrump: what's written on top of it?\n\nraffensperger: ryan?\n\ngermany: i don't have it in front of me, but it was not entered by the court, it's not a court order.\n\ntrump: but ryan, it's called a consent decree, is that right? on the paper. is that right?\n\ngermany: i don't. i don't. i don't believe so, but i don't have it in front of me.\n\ntrump: okay, whatever, it's a disaster. it's a disaster. look. here's the problem. we can go through signature verification, and we'll find hundreds of thousands of signatures, if you let us do it. and the only way you can do it, as you know, is to go to the past. but you didn't do that in cobb county. you just looked at one page compared to another. the only way you can do a signature verification is go from the one that signed it on november whatever. recently. and compare it to two years ago, four years ago, six years ago, you know, or even one. and you'll find that you have many different signatures. but in fulton, where they dumped ballots, you will find that you have many that aren't even signed and you have many that are forgeries.\n\nokay, you know that. you know that. you have no doubt about that. and you will find you will be at 11,779 within minutes because fulton county is totally corrupt, and so is she totally corrupt.\n\nand they're going around playing you and laughing at you behind your back, brad, whether you know it or not, they're laughing at you. and you've taken a state that's a republican state, and you've made it almost impossible for a republican to win because of cheating, because they cheated like nobody's ever cheated before. and i don't care how long it takes me, you know, we're going to have other states coming forward — pretty good.\n\n\n\nbut i won't . . . this is never . . . this is . . . we have some incredible talent said they've never seen anything . . . now the problem is they need more time for the big numbers. but they're very substantial numbers. but i think you're going to find that they — by the way, a little information — i think you're going to find that they are shredding ballots because they have to get rid of the ballots because the ballots are unsigned. the ballots are corrupt, and they're brand new, and they don't have seals, and there's a whole thing with the ballots. but the ballots are corrupt.\n\nand you are going to find that they are — which is totally illegal — it is more illegal for you than it is for them because, you know, what they did and you're not reporting it. that's a criminal, that's a criminal offense. and you can't let that happen. that's a big risk to you and to ryan, your lawyer. and that's a big risk. but they are shredding ballots, in my opinion, based on what i've heard. and they are removing machinery, and they're moving it as fast as they can, both of which are criminal finds. and you can't let it happen, and you are letting it happen. you know, i mean, i'm notifying you that you're letting it happen. so look. all i want to do is this. i just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state.\n\nand flipping the state is a great testament to our country because, you know, this is — it's a testament that they can admit to a mistake or whatever you want to call it. if it was a mistake, i don't know. a lot of people think it wasn't a mistake. it was much more criminal than that. but it's a big problem in georgia, and it's not a problem that's going away. i mean, you know, it's not a problem that's going away.\n\n\n\ngermany: this is ryan. we're looking into every one of those things that you mentioned.\n\ntrump: good. but if you find it, you've got to say it, ryan.\n\ngermany: . . . let me tell you what we are seeing. what we're seeing is not at all what you're describing. these are investigators from our office, these are investigators from gbi, and they're looking, and they're good. and that's not what they're seeing. and we'll keep looking, at all these things.\n\ntrump: well, you better check on the ballots because they are shredding ballots, ryan. i'm just telling you, ryan. they're shredding ballots. and you should look at that very carefully. because that's so illegal. you know, you may not even believe it because it's so bad. but they're shredding ballots because they think we're going to eventually get there . . . because we'll eventually get into fulton. in my opinion, it's never too late. . . . so, that's the story. look, we need only 11,000 votes. we have are far more than that as it stands now. we'll have more and more. and . . . do you have provisional ballots at all, brad? provisional ballots?\n\n\n\nraffensperger: provisional ballots are allowed by state law.\n\ntrump: sure, but i mean, are they counted, or did you just hold them back because they, you know, in other words, how many provisional ballots do you have in the state?\n\nraffensperger: we'll get you that number.\n\ntrump: because most of them are made out to the name trump. because these are people that were scammed when they came in. and we have thousands of people that have testified or that want to testify. when they came in, they were proudly going to vote on november 3. and they were told, i'm sorry, you've already been voted for, you've already voted. the women, men started screaming, no. i proudly voted till november 3. they said, i'm sorry, but you've already been voted for, and you have a ballot. and these people are beside themselves. so they went out, and they filled in a provisional ballot, putting the name trump on it.\n\nand what about that batch of military ballots that came in. and even though i won the military by a lot, it was 100 percent trump. i mean 100 percent biden. do you know about that? a large group of ballots came in, i think it was to fulton county, and they just happened to be 100 percent for trump — for biden — even though trump won the military by a lot, you know, a tremendous amount. but these ballots were 100 percent for biden. and do you know about that? a very substantial number came in, all for biden. does anybody know about it?\n\nmitchell: i know about it, but —\n\n\n\ntrump: okay, cleta, i'm not asking you, cleta, honestly. i'm asking brad. do you know about the military ballots that we have confirmed now. do you know about the military ballots that came in that were 100 percent, i mean 100 percent, for biden. do you know about that?\n\ngermany: i don't know about that. i do know that we have, when military ballots come in, it's not just military, it's also military and overseas citizens. the military part of that does generally go republican. the overseas citizen part of it generally goes very democrat. this was a mix of 'em.\n\ntrump: no, but this was. that's okay. but i got like 78 percent of the military. these ballots were all for . . . they didn't tell me overseas. could be overseas, too, but i get votes overseas, too, ryan, in all fairness. no they came in, a large batch came in, and it was, quote, 100 percent for biden. and that is criminal. you know, that's criminal. okay. that's another criminal, that's another of the many criminal events, many criminal events here.\n\ni don't know, look, brad. i got to get . . . i have to find 12,000 votes, and i have them times a lot. and therefore, i won the state. that's before we go to the next step, which is in the process of right now. you know, and i watched you this morning, and you said, well, there was no criminality.\n\n\n\nbut i mean all of this stuff is very dangerous stuff. when you talk about no criminality, i think it's very dangerous for you to say that.\n\n\n\ni just, i just don't know why you don't want to have the votes counted as they are. like even you when you went and did that check. and i was surprised because, you know . . . and we found a few thousand votes that were against me. i was actually surprised because the way that check was done, all you're doing, you know, recertifying existing votes and, you know, and you were given votes and you just counted them up, and you still found 3,000 that were bad. so that was sort of surprising that it came down to three or five, i don't know. still a lot of votes. but you have to go back to check from past years with respect to signatures. and if you check with fulton county, you'll have hundreds of thousands because they dumped ballots into fulton county and the other county next to it.\n\nso what are we going to do here, folks? i only need 11,000 votes. fellas, i need 11,000 votes. give me a break. you know, we have that in spades already. or we can keep it going, but that's not fair to the voters of georgia because they're going to see what happened, and they're going to see what happened. i mean, i'll, i'll take on anybody you want with regard to [name] and her lovely daughter, a very lovely young lady, i'm sure. but, but [name] . . . i will take on anybody you want. and the minimum, there were 18,000 ballots, but they used them three times. so that's, you know, a lot of votes. and they were all to biden, by the way, that's the other thing we didn't say. you know, [name] , the one thing i forgot to say, which was the most important. you know that every single ballot she did went to biden. you know that, right? do you know that, by the way, brad?\n\nevery single ballot that she did through the machines at early, early in the morning went to biden. did you know that, ryan?\n\ngermany: that's not accurate, mr. president.\n\ntrump: huh. what is accurate?\n\ngermany: the numbers that we are showing are accurate.\n\ntrump: no, about [name] . about early in the morning, ryan. where the woman took, you know, when the whole gang took the stuff from under the table, right? do you know, do you know who those ballots, do you know who they were made out to, do you know who they were voting for?\n\ngermany: no, not specifically.\n\n\n\ntrump: did you ever check?\n\ngermany: we did what i described to you earlier —\n\ntrump: no no no — did you ever check the ballots that were scanned by [name] , a known political operative, balloteer? did ever check who those votes were for?\n\ngermany: we looked into that situation that you described.\n\ntrump: no, they were 100 percent for biden. 100 percent. there wasn't a trump vote in the whole group. why don't you want to find this, ryan? what's wrong with you? i heard your lawyer is very difficult, actually, but i'm sure you're a good lawyer. you have a nice last name.\n\nbut, but i'm just curious, why wouldn't, why do you keep fighting this thing? it just doesn't make sense. we're way over the 17,779, right? we're way over that number, and just if you took just [name] , we're over that number by five, five or six times when you multiply that times three.\n\n\n\nand every single ballot went to biden, and you didn't know that, but now you know it. so tell me, brad, what are we going to do? we won the election, and it's not fair to take it away from us like this. and it's going to be very costly in many ways. and i think you have to say that you're going to reexamine it, and you can reexamine it, but reexamine it with people that want to find answers, not people that don't want to find answers. for instance, i'm hearing ryan that he's probably, i'm sure a great lawyer and everything, but he's making statements about those ballots that he doesn't know. but he's making them with such — he did make them with surety. but now i think he's less sure because the answer is, they all went to biden, and that alone wins us the election by a lot. you know, so.\n\n\n\nraffensperger: mr. president, you have people that submit information, and we have our people that submit information. and then it comes before the court, and the court then has to make a determination. we have to stand by our numbers. we believe our numbers are right.\n\ntrump: why do you say that, though? i don't know. i mean, sure, we can play this game with the courts, but why do you say that? first of all, they don't even assign us a judge. they don't even assign us a judge. but why wouldn't you . . . hey brad, why wouldn't you want to check out [name] ? and why wouldn't you want to say, hey, if in fact, president trump is right about that, then he wins the state of georgia, just that one incident alone without going through hundreds of thousands of dropped ballots. you just say, you stick by, i mean i've been watching you, you know, you don't care about anything. your numbers are right. but your numbers aren't right. they're really wrong, and they're really wrong, brad. and i know this phone call is going nowhere other than, other than ultimately, you know — look, ultimately, i win, okay? because you guys are so wrong. and you treated this. you treated the population of georgia so badly. you, between you and your governor, who is down at 21, he was down 21 points. and like a schmuck, i endorsed him, and he got elected, but i will tell you, he is a disaster.\n\nthe people are so angry in georgia, i can't imagine he's ever getting elected again, i'll tell you that much right now. but why wouldn't you want to find the right answer, brad, instead of keep saying that the numbers are right? 'cause those numbers are so wrong?\n\nmitchell: mr. secretary, mr. president, one of the things that we have been, alex can talk about this, we talked about it, and i don't know whether the information has been conveyed to your office, but i think what the president is saying, and what we've been trying to do is to say, look, the court is not acting on our petition. they haven't even assigned a judge. but the people of georgia and the people of america have a right to know the answers. and you have data and records that we don't have access to.\n\nand you can keep telling us and making public statement that you investigated this and nothing to see here. but we don't know about that. all we know is what you tell us. what i don't understand is why wouldn't it be in everyone's best interest to try to get to the bottom, compare the numbers, you know, if you say, because . . . to try to be able to get to the truth because we don't have any way of confirming what you're telling us. you tell us that you had an investigation at the state farm arena. i don't have any report. i've never seen a report of investigation. i don't know that is. i've been pretty involved in this, and i don't know. and that's just one of 25 categories. and it doesn't even. and as i, as the president said, we haven't even gotten into the dominion issue. that's not part of our case. it's not part of, we just didn't feel as though we had any to be able to develop —\n\ntrump: no, we do have a way, but i don't want to get into it. we found a way . . . excuse me, but we don't need it because we're only down 11,000 votes, so we don't even need it. i personally think they're corrupt as hell. but we don't need that. all we have to do, cleta, is find 11,000-plus votes. so we don't need that. i'm not looking to shake up the whole world. we won georgia easily. we won it by hundreds of thousands of votes. but if you go by basic, simple numbers, we won it easily, easily. so we're not giving dominion a pass on the record. we don't need dominion because we have so many other votes that we don't need to prove it any more than we already have.\n\nhilbert: mr. president and cleta, this is kurt hilbert, if i might interject for a moment. ryan, i would like to suggest that just four categories that have already been mentioned by the president that have actually hard numbers of 24,149 votes that were counted illegally. that in and of itself is sufficient to change the results or place the outcome in doubt. we would like to sit down with your office, and we can do it through purposes of compromise and just like this phone call, just to deal with that limited category of votes. and if you are able to establish that our numbers are not accurate, then fine. however, we believe that they are accurate. we've had now three to four separate experts looking at these numbers.\n\n\n\ntrump: certified accountants looked at them.\n\nhilbert: correct. and this is just based on usps data and your own secretary of state data. so that's what we would entreat and ask you to do, to sit down with us in a compromise and settlements proceeding and actually go through the registered voter ids and the registrations. and if you can convince us that 24,149 is inaccurate, then fine. but we tend to believe that is, you know, obviously more than 11,779. that's sufficient to change the results entirely in and of itself. so what would you say to that, mr. germany?\n\ngermany: i'm happy to get with our lawyers, and we'll set that up. that number is not accurate. and i think we can show you, for all the ones we've looked at, why it's not. and so if that would be helpful, i'm happy to get with our lawyers and set that up with you guys.\n\ntrump: well, let me ask you, kurt, you think that is an accurate number. that was based on the information given to you by the secretary of state's department, right?\n\nhilbert: that is correct. that information is the minimum, most conservative data based upon the usps data and the secretary of state's office data that has been made publicly available. we do not have the internal numbers from the secretary of state. yet we have asked for it six times. i sent a letter over to . . . several times requesting this information, and it's been rebuffed every single time. so it stands to reason that if the information is not forthcoming, there's something to hide. that's the problem that we have.\n\ngermany: well, that's not the case, sir. there are things that you guys are entitled to get. and there's things that under law, we are not allowed to give out.\n\ntrump: well, you have to. well, under law, you're not allowed to give faulty election results, okay? you're not allowed to do that. and that's what you done. this is a faulty election result. and honestly, this should go very fast. you should meet tomorrow because you have a big election coming up, and because of what you've done to the president — you know, the people of georgia know that this was a scam — and because of what you've done to the president, a lot of people aren't going out to vote. and a lot of republicans are going to vote negative because they hate what you did to the president. okay? they hate it. and they're going to vote. and you would be respected. really respected, if this thing could be straightened out before the election. you have a big election coming up on tuesday. and i think that it is really is important that you meet tomorrow and work out on these numbers. because i know, brad, that if you think we're right, i think you're going to say, and i'm not looking to blame anybody, i'm just saying, you know, and, you know, under new counts, and under new views, of the election results, we won the election. you know? it's very simple. we won the election. as the governors of major states and the surrounding states said, there is no way you lost georgia. as the georgia politicians say, there is no way you lost georgia. nobody. everyone knows i won it by hundreds of thousands of votes. but i'll tell you it's going to have a big impact on tuesday if you guys don't get this thing straightened out fast.\n\nmeadows: mr. president, this is mark. it sounds like we've got two different sides agreeing that we can look at those areas, and i assume that we can do that within the next 24 to 48 hours, to go ahead and get that reconciled so that we can look at the two claims and making sure that we get the access to the secretary of state's data to either validate or invalidate the claims that have been made. is that correct?\n\ngermany: no, that's not what i said. i'm happy to have our lawyers sit down with kurt and the lawyers on that side and explain to him, hey, here's, based on what we've looked at so far, here's how we know this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong.\n\nmeadows: so what you're saying, ryan, let me let me make sure . . . so what you're saying is you really don't want to give access to the data. you just want to make another case on why the lawsuit is wrong?\n\ngermany: i don't think we can give access to data that's protected by law. but we can sit down with them and say —\n\ntrump: but you're allowed to have a phony election? you're allowed to have a phony election, right?\n\n\n\ngermany: no, sir.\n\ntrump: when are you going to do signature counts, when are you going to do signature verification on fulton county, which you said you were going to do, and now all of a sudden, you're not doing it. when are you doing that?\n\n\n\ngermany: we are going to do that. we've announced —\n\nhilbert: to get to this issue of the personal information and privacy issue, is it possible that the secretary of state could deputize the lawyers for the president so that we could access that information and private information without you having any kind of violation?\n\ntrump: well, i don't want to know who it is. you guys can do it very confidentially. you can sign a confidentiality agreement. that's okay. i don't need to know names. but on this stuff that we're talking about, we got all that information from the secretary of state.\n\n\n\nmeadows: yeah. so let me let me recommend, ryan, if you and kurt will get together, you know, when we get off of this phone call, if you could get together and work out a plan to address some of what we've got with your attorneys where we can we can actually look at the data. for example, mr. secretary, i can you say they were only two dead people who would vote. i can promise you there are more than that. and that may be what your investigation shows, but i can promise you there are more than that. but at the same time, i think it's important that we go ahead and move expeditiously to try to do this and resolve it as quickly as we possibly can. and if that's the good next step. hopefully we can, we can finish this phone call and go ahead and agree that the two of you will get together immediately.\n\ntrump: well, why don't my lawyers show you where you got the information. it will show the secretary of state, and you don't even have to look at any names. we don't want names. we don't care. but we got that information from you. and stacey abrams is laughing about you. she's going around saying these guys are dumber than a rock. what she's done to this party is unbelievable, i tell you. and i only ran against her once. and that was with a guy named brian kemp, and i beat her. and if i didn't run, brian wouldn't have had even a shot, either in the general or in the primary. he was dead, dead as a doornail. he never thought he had a shot at either one of them. what a schmuck i was. but that's the way it is. that's the way it is. i would like you . . . for the attorneys . . . i'd like you to perhaps meet with ryan, ideally tomorrow, because i think we should come to a resolution of this before the election. otherwise you're going to have people just not voting. they don't want to vote. they hate the state, they hate the governor, and they hate the secretary of state. i will tell you that right now. the only people that like you are people that will never vote for you. you know that, brad, right? they like you, you know, they like you. they can't believe what they found. they want more people like you. so, look, can you get together tomorrow? and, brad, we just want the truth. it's simple.\n\n\n\nand everyone's going to look very good if the truth comes out. it's okay. it takes a little while, but let the truth come out. and the real truth is, i won by 400,000 votes. at least. that's the real truth. but we don't need 400,000 votes. we need less than 2,000 votes. and are you guys able to meet tomorrow, ryan?\n\n\n\ngermany: i'll get with chris, the lawyer who's representing us in the case, and see when he can get together with kurt.\n\nraffensperger: ryan will be in touch with the other attorney on this call, mr. meadows. thank you, president trump, for your time.\n\ntrump: okay, thank you, brad. thank you, ryan. thank you. thank you, everybody. thank you very much. bye.\n\nan earlier version of the full audio of trump's call inadvertently left in a reference to an individual about whom he has made unsubstantiated claims. it has since been updated.
before this year, super bowl commercials were blocked in canada by a practice called simultaneous substitution, which aims to protect canadian broadcasters while allowing tv viewers to watch u.s.-based channels. when programs are shown at the same time on both canadian and u.s. outlets, the canadian broadcaster gets to substitute its ads for u.s. ads on the american feed.\n\nso a canadian tuning in to cbs to see the super bowl 50 last year didn't see the glitzy ads from u.s. advertisers, but rather more mundane fare from the likes of bank of montreal and the loblaws supermarket chain. that has angered canadians, who have been forced to go to youtube if they wanted to get a look at the most talked about super bowl ads.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbut this year, canada's broadcast regulator will change the 40-year-regulations to allow american super bowl ads to air, saying it's for the sake of consumer choice. while fans are happy — hirsch-allen knows his wife and other super bowl guests seem to care much more about the commercials — the decision has infuriated the national football league and bell media, the parent of canada's largest broadcaster, ctv, which have banded together with canadian ad agencies and the creative community to cry foul. backed by sen. marco rubio (r-fla.), there are even calls for the government of prime minister justin trudeau to override the decision by the canadian radio-television and telecommunications commission and reinstitute the ban on super bowl ads.\n\nmichael geist, a law professor specializing in internet and e-commerce at the university of ottawa, says that the idea of simultaneous substitution is increasingly irrelevant in a world of specialty channels, recording devices and live streaming. he thinks the super bowl decision is a kind of toe in the water that may eventually lead to the end of the substitution practice entirely.\n\nthat would be bad news for canadian broadcasters. simultaneous substitution of ads is worth an estimated $250 million (canadian) a year to the broadcasters, who build their programming around access to popular u.s. series and sports events. the super bowl is the most watched broadcast in the country; last year, 8.3 million canadians watched the super bowl in english and french while only 3.9 million tuned into the most recent grey cup, the championship game of the canadian football league.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin turn, broadcasters are supposed to use some of that ad revenue to invest in canadian programming.\n\nthe nfl is livid at the super bowl ad change. it says it sold the rights to its schedule, including the super bowl, to ctv under one set of rules and now finds those regulations changed midstream. the league also complains it's been unfairly singled out, with no other program aside from the super bowl affected. it's random, arbitrary and pretty harmful, said jocelyn moore, the nfl's senior vice president of public policy and government affairs. we're just asking for a fair shake.\n\nit's clear the nfl doesn't like the prospect of lower ad revenue for the broadcast. when u.s. broadcasters bid for rights to the super bowl, they don't typically pay for access for canadian viewers. so when audi, honda or skittles buy ads for this year's game on fox, they will effectively be getting free access to millions of canadian consumers.\n\nad\n\nad
it turns out the moon is older than many scientists suspected: a ripe 4.51 billion years old.\n\nthat's the newest estimate, thanks to rocks and soil collected by the apollo 14 moonwalkers in 1971.\n\na research team reported last week that the moon formed within 60 million years of the birth of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago. previous estimates ranged from 100 million years after the solar system's creation to 200 million years.\n\nthe scientists conducted ­uranium-lead dating on fragments of the mineral zircon extracted from apollo 14 lunar samples. the pieces of zircon were minuscule — no bigger than a grain of sand.\n\nsize doesn't matter, they record amazing information nonetheless! melanie barboni of ucla, the lead author of last week's report, said in an email.\n\nshe noted that the moon holds so much magic . . . the key to understand how our beautiful earth formed and evolved.\n\nsome of the eight zircon samples had been used in a previous study, also conducted at ucla. barboni said she is studying more zircons from apollo 14 samples, but doesn't expect it to change her estimate of 4.51 billion years for the moon's age, possibly 4.52 billion years at the most. it would be more a ­double-checking than anything else, she explained.\n\nbarboni and her colleagues — whose work appeared in the journal science advances — are eager to learn more about the moon's history and, in turn, the evolution of early earth and the entire solar system.\n\nalan shepard and edgar mitchell collected 92 pounds of rocks and dug up soil while exploring the moon's fra mauro highlands in february 1971.\n\nalso last week, israeli scientists suggested the moon may be a melting pot of many mini-moons. rather than one giant impact that shaved off a chunk of earth and formed the moon, a series of smaller collisions may have created multiple moonlets that eventually merged into one, according to the researchers.\n\nbarboni said regardless of how the moon came to be, you still end up at the end solidifying the moon as we know it today.\n\nthe giant-impact theory holds that the resulting energy formed a lunar lava ocean that later became solid. it's this solidification age that barboni and her team have now ascertained.\n\nwe finally pinned down a minimum age for the moon formation, she said, regardless of how it formed.
mandelblit is in a bind that recalls the lose-lose decision then-fbi director james b. comey faced over the investigation into hillary clinton's emails before the 2016 u.s. presidential election.\n\nif the attorney general lays out his conclusions in the corruption probe against netanyahu before the april 9 vote, he will be accused of improperly influencing the electoral process.\n\nad\n\nthe coalition of israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu dissolved parliament on dec. 24 and called for a general election to take place as soon as april. (associated press)\n\nif he waits until afterward, he could draw criticism for improperly withholding information from voters.\n\nad\n\nnetanyahu, who is widely thought to have called early elections to in a bid to avoid indictment before the vote, has much riding on a delay in the legal process. if he is reelected, he could argue that he has the public's support despite the allegations. and if he survives until july, he will become israel's longest-serving prime minister, overtaking the country's founder, david ben-gurion.\n\nnetanyahu has vehemently asserted his innocence, dismissing the investigations with his often-\n\nrepeated mantra, there will be nothing because there is nothing.\n\nad\n\nbut the corruption allegations that long swirled around him have solidified. top aides are now state's witnesses. police recommend that he be charged with fraud, bribery and breach of trust. in one case, he is accused of accepting bribes in relation to gifts worth $300,000 from wealthy business executives. in the most serious case, he is suspected of influencing regulatory decisions that netted hundreds of millions of dollars for the telecommunications company bezeq in return for favorable coverage on a news site it owned.\n\nad\n\nmandelblit could decide there is insufficient evidence to proceed, or he could decide to indict — although in the latter case, a hearing would first be held in which the prime minister's attorneys could put forward a defense, a process that could drag on for months.\n\nhe's in a quandary, said guy lurie, a researcher at the israel democracy institute. you need to keep the prosecution nonpolitical, and the decision he takes and the time frame should remain nonpolitical and professional.\n\nad\n\ndoing that requires maintaining a distance from the election process, lurie said. but the issue here is the public has the right to know, and the attorney general has this obligation towards the public. at the same time, he noted, he also has an obligation to the suspects, who have the right to a fair criminal proceeding and fair trial.\n\nad\n\nthose considerations don't push in the same direction, he said.\n\nat stake is the reputation of the office itself, which risks being politicized in an ugly and polarized climate.\n\nreturning from a trip to brazil on thursday night, netanyahu posted a video clip in which he denounced thuggish and inhumane pressure on the attorney general from the left wing and the media.\n\nad\n\nthey are trying to force the attorney general to intervene crudely in the elections by summoning me to a hearing, when it is known in advance that the hearing cannot be completed by the elections, he said.\n\nthe vitriol is seeping onto the streets.\n\nmandelblit is a collaborator, read freshly sprayed graffiti on a wall alongside israel's coastal highway this past week after reports that he is moving to indict.\n\ntwo weeks earlier, the grave of mandelblit's father was desecrated.\n\nad\n\nbut others have praised the jurist. boom! bibi is finished, tweeted former prime minister ehud barak, who has called for netanyahu's resignation. scoop: mandelblit is growing a spine.\n\nad\n\nwhatever mandelblit decides, it will tear the country apart, said reuven hazan, a political science professor at the hebrew university of jerusalem. there's that democratic perspective that the public should know, but netanyahu will always spin it, saying: 'it's the liberal, left-leaning elite that wants to oust me. they can't do it in the voting booth, so they are doing it in the legal system.' \n\nnetanyahu's attorneys have said that indicting him, pending a hearing, before the election would be inconceivable because the public would not hear the case for his defense until after the election and the attorney general may be persuaded by it. there have been many cases where hearing the answers of the other side led to the case being closed, a statement from his attorneys said.\n\nad\n\ndavid amsalem, coalition chairman and one of netanyahu's closest allies, called the prospect of an indictment madness and an apparent coup attempt by the attorney general's office and the police.\n\nad\n\nmandelblit has responded that those attacking state institutions are seeking to undermine the deepest foundations of the rule of law.\n\nonly the evidence will speak, he said thursday at a conference in haifa. there is one compass that guides our path — the good of the country.\n\nwhen he was appointed attorney general two years ago, mandelblit was widely seen as a netanyahu ally. a right-wing orthodox jew, he served as the chief military advocate general before becoming cabinet secretary in netanyahu's government in 2013.\n\nbut political analysts consider it likely that he will bring at least some charges against the prime minister. with so many cases and so much evidence, he can't dismiss all of them, hazan said.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nnetanyahu has said that he will not quit if he is indicted. under the law, he is not explicitly required to do so unless convicted. and if he makes it to the election and wins a new term, his fifth, he could argue that he has been given a new mandate by the public despite the cases, refuse to step down and perhaps even try to push through a change to the law that prevents the indictment of a sitting prime minister.\n\na majority of israelis, 51 percent, said netanyahu should have to resign if he is indicted pending a hearing before the elections, according to a poll commissioned by the jerusalem post this past week. but netanyahu needs to win only a plurality to stay in office. some 34 percent of respondents said he should not have to resign if indicted ahead of the vote.\n\na poll by the israeli daily maariv shows netanyahu's likud party winning 30 seats and remaining the largest party in the knesset even if the prime minister is indicted. still, analysts say, even some die-hard likud supporters are likely to balk at electing an indicted leader.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nif netanyahu were to win despite an indictment, he would still need to form a coalition, and other political players are sensing weakness.\n\nformer cabinet minister gideon saar has announced he will run in likud primaries. netanyahu's right-wing education minister and justice minister — naftali bennett and ayelet shaked, respectively — have split from their current bloc to form a new party.

kim, a physician and former president of dartmouth college, informed the bank's board on monday of his decision to leave, surprising bank officials, employees said.\n\nthe bank, funded by countries around the world to lend money to developing nations, said kristalina georgieva, chief executive of the bank's two main lending arms, will become interim president.\n\nthe world bank's directors, who represent donor countries, have the right to nominate candidates for the president's job and will vote on a winner.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nby an unwritten tradition since the bank's founding in 1944, the board has always chosen washington's nominee. the europeans in turn have determined the head of the international monetary fund.\n\nin 2012, just before kim was selected for his first five-year term, some countries lobbied for the role to be filled by ni­ger­ia's then-finance minister ngozi okonjo-iweala or colombia's former finance minister jose antonio ocampo.\n\nwashington's pick had opponents for the first time in the world bank selection process, said scott morris, senior fellow at the center for global development and the treasure department's former deputy assistant secretary for development finance and debt.\n\nad\n\ni have no reason to think that won't be the case this time, morris said. this is not 1944, where the u.s. is sort of the acknowledged architect, financier and no question the leading power in this institution. it really is seen as a global institution today, with a global membership, he said. it becomes more and more frustrating to have this unbroken chain of american presidents, morris added.\n\nad\n\nkeeping the world bank presidency in american hands may be even tougher given the trump administration's rocky relations with some european allies. i think it's going to be a fight, said clay lowery of rock creek global advisors, who served as assistant treasury secretary for international affairs under president george w. bush. it's going to be a lot harder to get the europeans to sign off this time.\n\nthe trump administration has questioned the value of multilateral institutions including the united nations and the world trade organization. but it supported a funding increase for the world bank last year, which raised $13 billion from member countries.\n\nad\n\ndevelopment officials credit kim with helping convince the administration to back the funding increase.\n\nin exchange, the trump administration got the bank to agree to reforms, including a review of the salaries of board members and staff, which washington in some cases viewed as excessive. senior managers this year received no salary increases, according to a bank official who declined to be named to discuss sensitive matters.\n\nthe world bank chief also cultivated ties with ivanka trump, working alongside her in 2017 to establish a $350 million fund to support female entrepreneurs in developing countries.\n\nad\n\nwe appreciate mr. kim's service to the world bank, the treasury department said in an emailed statement. the secretary looks forward to working with his fellow governors in selecting a new leader.\n\nad\n\nin a speech last month, secretary of state mike pompeo said the administration was pushing the world bank and imf to halt lending to nations that can already access global capital markets — countries like china.\n\nkim oversaw an expansion of the bank's work into fighting climate change, which the bank did by providing loans to combat coastal erosion and expand sustainable agriculture, home-building and water management.\n\nearly in his tenure, he also undertook a restructuring and cost-cutting effort that caused upset among bank staff, some employees said.\n\nit has been a great honor to serve as president of this remarkable institution, full of passionate individuals dedicated to the mission of ending extreme poverty in our lifetime, kim said in a statement. the work of the world bank group is more important now than ever as the aspirations of the poor rise all over the world, and problems like climate change, pandemics, famine and refugees continue to grow in both their scale and complexity.
the report was written in compliance with president trump's march 2017 executive order halting immigration from six majority-muslim countries.\n\nad\n\ncritics immediately expressed alarm at what they considered highly misleading data presented without context. they called it an attempt to misuse law enforcement agencies to advance a political agenda in opposition to immigration, and former senior counterterrorism officials warned it could play into terrorists' hands by fueling misperceptions about radicalization and stoking societal divides.\n\nad\n\nseveral government watchdog and civil liberty groups in may sued the two agencies in two federal courts, seeking a retraction or correction under the little-known information quality act. the agencies refused, and the courts stayed the lawsuits to allow time for an administrative appeal.\n\nnow, after two rounds, the justice department has told the groups it will not retract or correct the document. rather, in future reports, the department can strive to minimize the potential for misinterpretation, michael h. allen, deputy assistant attorney general for policy, management and planning, wrote in a dec. 21 letter to the groups.\n\nit is, experts said, a rare admission from the department that its reporting may have confused and misled the public. this is the government's statement on the risk of terrorism presented by foreign-born individuals in the united states, and it's critical that it be accurate — not just because the law requires it but because they have a duty to the american people to accurately report information of this type, said ben berwick, counsel for protect democracy, one of the groups that sued the government and is representing the others in court.\n\nad\n\nad\n\notherwise, he said, it erodes trust in the government. it erodes democracy.\n\none flaw the justice department acknowledged was the report's assertion that between 2003 and 2009, immigrants were convicted of 69,929 sex offenses, which in most instances constitutes gender-based violence against women.\n\nbut, allen said in his letter, the alleged misrepresented data constitute mere editorial errors which the [law] does not obligate the agencies to withdraw or correct.\n\nstill, he added, the department appreciates being made aware of such errors so they will not be repeated.\n\nberwick said the errors were not merely editorial. the nearly 70,000 offenses spanned a period from 1955 to 2010 — 55 years, not six; the data covered arrests, not convictions; and one arrest could be for multiple offenses, he said, citing the government accountability office, which provided the underlying data.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ncritics also decried the report's inclusion of eight illustrative examples of foreign-born individuals out of a pool of 402 convicted of international terrorism. six of the eight cases involved people admitted to the country as family members of legal residents or u.s. citizens, which protect democracy contended was an effort to portray chain migration as a threat.\n\non reconsideration, the department acknowledges that a focus on eight seemingly similar 'illustrative examples' from a list of more than 400 convictions could cause some readers of the report to question its objectivity, allen wrote.\n\nat least 189 of the 549 people convicted were caught up in an investigation with a link to international terrorism but not charged with an offense directly related to terrorism, berwick said, citing justice department data. it is unclear how many were foreign-born. nonetheless, that would change the statistics considerably, but the department did not address that in its letter.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe report included about 100 foreign-born individuals who were extradited to the united states to stand trial for terrorism-related crimes committed overseas, without clarifying the reason they were brought to the country, berwick said. that is misleading because the report creates a false impression that those extradited came in as immigrants, he said.\n\nthere is no requirement in either the [law or department guidelines] that agencies must always provide underlying data when disseminating information to the public, allen wrote.\n\nthe coalition of groups is considering whether to return to court.
on martin luther king jr. day, the wizards hosted the portland trail blazers as the nba celebrated the federal holiday with a slate of nine games. the wizards have played 27 games on the holiday, the past four coming at home.\n\nad\n\nthough the day brings about a flood of tributes, several members of the wizards organization have paid homage to the civil rights hero in their daily lives as well.\n\nad\n\nthe thing that always throws me for a loop is that he was so young. when he was killed, he was 39. they started that movement in his mid-twenties, brooks said. like i tell my son, you can be a leader at a young age. you don't have to be old like me in the fifties; you can be somebody that can make change. it has nothing to do with age. it has everything to do with a belief and a commitment, a conviction.\n\nbradley beal picked the king memorial for his video feature that plays inside verizon center before weekend home games. before tipoff against the blazers, beal addressed the crowd, saying: because of his courage, we're able to dream today.\n\nad\n\njohn wall, meanwhile, has a permanent tribute to king on his back. over the summer, during his knee rehabilitation, wall sat for four hours to get tattoos of muhammad ali and king under his great wall piece. wall said he wanted to pick an iconic athlete to be paired with an african american trail blazer.\n\nad\n\njust two powerful black men, wall said, explaining the idea behind the ink, that helped kind of pave the way to have freedoms and believe in what you want to do. you never can be nothing if you don't believe in yourself and give yourself a shot. i see it as if i've never believed in myself to be a basketball player and give myself a shot to go out there and play against whoever, [then] i wouldn't be who i am.\n\nleading into the trail blazers' four-game road trip, several members of the team visited the national museum of african american history and culture, a visit portland coach terry stotts described as sobering. stotts recalled a previous mlk day when the blazers had played in memphis, the site of king's assassination, and recognized the significance in the nba's celebrations.
in january 2013, owner ted lerner agreed to a deal for rafael soriano, an unsigned boras client, to the surprise of many in the front office. in january 2015, the nationals unexpectedly leaped into the pursuit of max scherzer, whom they signed to the biggest contract in team history. in late february 2017, after spending most of the offseason lukewarm on catcher matt wieters, they suddenly signed him, too. when big-name boras clients linger into the new year, the nationals linger, too, as potential suitors, regardless of whether they have an obvious need.\n\ncandidates for the nationals' annual boras-related splash abound this year. they have already endured a wave of rumors regarding jake arrieta, who would likely command a contract large enough that ownership would need to be convinced of its wisdom. in recent years, no one has proved himself more able to convince nationals ownership of the value of his players than boras.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwhile they didn't need scherzer at the time and had a starting catcher when they signed wieters, the nationals do not seem likely to create room for free-agent first baseman eric hosmer. ryan zimmerman is entrenched at first base, and hosmer is too one-dimensional defensively to make any sense long-term. hosmer's former royals teammate, mike moustakas, would require similar uncomfortable shuffling. in theory, he could play third if anthony rendon moves to second and daniel murphy plays . . . well, the trouble there is obvious.\n\nbut if there is a dark horse among the big boras clients this winter, perhaps it's j.d. martinez, who could serve as power-hitting outfield insurance in the event bryce harper departs in free agency next winter. the nationals, with a glut of outfielders and a payroll that already positions them above the competitive balance tax threshold for 2018, seem unlikely to outbid other martinez suitors, such as the red sox.\n\nperhaps the most logical boras splash would actually fit something of a need. former royals and rockies closer greg holland, who reestablished himself as a reliable late-inning option with a strong season in colorado last year, is one of the only elite relievers left on the market. the nationals have checked on the asking price for nearly every late-inning type this winter, securing one in kintzler, though they could use another. they have three proven relievers and are already over the cbt threshold for a second consecutive year, which could reduce their incentive to engage in a bidding war with other contenders for holland's services. the right-hander could end up out of their price range but, should he remain unsigned in the weeks to come, perhaps that will change, as it has for boras clients before him.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nspeaking of which, another still-unsigned boras client is jayson werth, who has not been on the nationals' list of priorities this winter. in fact, the consensus in the organization was that last year was the end of their partnership, and that werth would have to find a job elsewhere –perhaps in the american league, where he could serve as a designated hitter. werth still seems likely to land elsewhere, but he has been a surprise offseason signing for these nationals before. given who represents him, as with so many other boras clients, one simply cannot rule the nationals out.
imaad zuberi — a venture capitalist who gave significant money to democrats and republicans over the years — was accused by federal prosecutors in new york of trying to hide from investigators that a $900,000 donation he made to trump's inaugural committee was actually funded by others, court records show.\n\nzuberi already had pleaded guilty last year in federal court in los angeles to an array of charges stemming from a lobbying scheme in which he arranged illegal campaign contributions, hid his work from the government and cheated on his taxes.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ndavid kelley, zuberi's attorney, said he had reached an agreement with federal prosecutors in new york to transfer the new matter to los angeles, where zuberi intends to plead guilty. provided the arrangement is approved by the court, he would presumably be sentenced on the west coast in connection with both matters.\n\nkelley said zuberi had reached a plea agreement. it's not a cooperation agreement. he said the agreement brings closure for zuberi's part of the investigation involving the trump inaugural committee.\n\na spokesman for the u.s. attorney's office for the southern district of new york declined to comment.\n\nzuberi, who ran the los angeles-based firm avenue ventures and gave millions to various politicians over the years, once seemed a strong supporter of hillary clinton, backing her campaign with more than $600,000. but after trump won the election, zuberi seemed to change course — giving $900,000 to trump's inaugural committee and $100,000 to pay off debt from the 2016 republican national convention.\n\nthe new charges center on the $900,000 contribution. prosecutors allege that although zuberi made it in the name of his firm, avenue ventures, it was actually funded by other sources, including a man they identified only as donor-1.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nprosecutors allege that zuberi deleted emails to and from people who gave him money around the time he made the donation, including messages with a foreign national who transferred about $5.8 million to the account zuberi used to pay out the $900,000. when investigators confronted zuberi about the deletions, he contacted his email service provider to ask how he could ensure that copies of his messages were not stored on a server, prosecutors allege.\n\nthe foreign national is identified in court records only as donor-2.\n\nprosecutors allege that zuberi asked donor-1 to make a donation to the committee in exchange for exclusive access to inaugural events, and that the donor gave zuberi a $50,000 check. zuberi, they allege, did not tell the committee or the federal election commission that money was a part of his $900,000 donation.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe donor ultimately decided not to attend the inaugural festivities and asked for his money back, federal prosecutors allege. zuberi, they allege, initially did not do so.\n\nthen, in early february, news broke that prosecutors had issued a subpoena to the trump inaugural committee and were investigating the source of its funds, including zuberi's donation. zuberi, prosecutors allege, requested an in-person meeting with the donor, asking whether he had been contacted by investigators.
those who applied in the second round, ahead of the regular jan. 1 deadline, will receive decisions by the end of march. everyone admitted has until may 1 to decide whether to enroll.\n\nas a result, u-va.'s admission season — from the first essays that high school students write for early applications to the last offer made to a wait-listed student to join the fall class — now takes virtually the entire academic year. fall applications account for more than 60 percent of the annual total. despite the growing early workload, admission officers aim to give each file a thorough evaluation.\n\nad\n\nad\n\neverything has become pushed forward, greg w. roberts, u-va.'s dean of admissions, wrote in an email. the popularity of the early round, he said, makes our review quite challenging given the tighter window of time.\n\nu-va. is hardly alone. many schools, public and private, report significant increases in early applications.\n\nthere are basically two types of early applications. one, known as early action, allows those admitted to continue applying and shopping until may. that is the practice for u-va., georgetown university, princeton university and numerous others.\n\nthe other, known as early decision, requires admitted students to enroll unless the college does not offer adequate financial aid. applicants, parents and counselors must sign an early decision agreement that spells out the binding commitment. some schools use two rounds of early decision in addition to a regular round.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nat the university of rochester, about 1,200 applied for fall early decision. that was up 35 percent from the year before. the private research university in upstate new york also offers a second early decision round in the winter.\n\nit's been a long trend for us, said jonathan burdick, rochester's dean of admissions and financial aid. the numbers keep growing rapidly. we've had double-digit increases each year for as long as i can remember.\n\noccasionally, burdick said, students admitted through early decision will try to break the rules and keep shopping. such students run a genuine risk of having their offers revoked, he said, if schools learn a contract has been broken. burdick said he tells prospective students: please don't apply early unless you love rochester and it's definitely where you want to be.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbelow are charts with preliminary early application data for the class of 2023 at selected schools on u.s. news & world report lists of top national universities and liberal arts

the video, published monday on a taliban spokesman's twitter account, came amid a rash of targeted shootings and bombings in the afghan capital that have killed several dozen journalists, civic leaders, physicians, democracy advocates and government officials. the mayhem has brought a new kind of personal terror to a city long accustomed to insurgent attacks against official buildings and military targets.\n\neven though u.s. troops are leaving the country, the militiaman explained, it is permissible to kill the [american] puppet regime of kabul and those who aid it. english subtitles accompanied his raised voice. we are carrying weapons to avenge our values and institutions, he said. we are wholeheartedly obeying the supreme command of allah.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe video was posted days before negotiations between taliban and afghan delegates are set to resume wednesday in qatar, after a two-week break. afghan security officials have blamed the taliban for most of the targeted killings, saying the insurgents are using new scare tactics to leverage their position at the negotiating table and undermine public confidence in the government of president ashraf ghani.\n\nthe killings have led prominent civilians to take extra security measures or avoid going outdoors. the taliban appear to be keeping close tabs on a variety of activities; a recent fashion show at a local hotel was immediately denounced in a tweet from a taliban leader, who charged that western intoxication and ideas have entered afghan culture and warned that anything in conflict with islam will be destroyed.\n\npeople in kabul used to worry whether they would be caught by chance in an attack on a government building or international institution. now they worry whether they will be next on the list, said one security official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly.\n\nthe chief taliban spokesman, zabiullah mujahid, denied any involvement in the attacks, calling the charges propaganda. in a voice-mail response friday to questions from the washington post, he said the insurgent group had nothing to do with the killings and blamed them on afghanistan's intelligence agency.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwe have not killed the doctors, civil-society activists or people who have not taken up arms against us, he said in dari. they are not among our military targets, and killing them has no benefit for us. when peace comes, he added, the country will need educated afghans.\n\nmujahid said that the group's primary goal is to settle the issues through talks and that a military solution would be used only as a last resort.\n\ndespite such denials, afghan experts and officials said they have little doubt that the taliban is behind the surge of attacks. most victims have been killed in their vehicles, by gunmen who escaped on motorbikes or magnetic bombs placed underneath the carriages. they said the insurgents are sending a veiled message to several audiences, including afghan officials trying to retain public confidence, delegates returning to the peace talks and american officials in the incoming administration.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe afghan government has doubled the number of police and other security forces patrolling the capital, and vehicles are being stopped and searched on many street corners. officials said they have made a number of arrests, and interior minister massoud andarabi told afghan lawmakers wednesday that detainees had described a special new cell based in nearby logar province that plans attacks on high-profile individuals.\n\nunclaimed bombings & targeted assassination of civil society activists are . . . pillars of talbn terror campaign linked to their negotiations strtegy, vice president amrullah saleh, a former national intelligence chief, tweeted last week. they want to break the political will of the afg people & demand impossible concessions.\n\nkabul residents going about daily routines that expose them to danger, whether selling used winter clothing in outdoor markets or delivering supplies in handcarts, are also scared.\n\nif i didn't have to feed my wife and children, i wouldn't leave home at all now, said ali agha, 26, who sells fruit in a crowded west kabul neighborhood. with so many explosions and attacks, he said, he decided to move from a more profitable market to one that was safer. i blame the president, because he can't provide security for the people.\n\nmany afghans say u.s. officials gave too much away to the insurgents in the deal they signed in february, failing to commit them to specific conditions regarding violence and ties to other extremist groups while agreeing to withdraw most u.s. troops by spring.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nsince the pact was signed, the taliban have waged a relentless campaign of attacks across the country, killing thousands of people. in october however, president trump announced that troop drawdown would be speeded up, adding to the insurgents' sense of imminent victory.\n\nthe taliban are feeling triumphal, and they want to be seen as tough. they are not interested in winning hearts and minds, said davood moradian, director of the afghan institute for strategic studies. they are using force to delegitimize the afghan state by showing it can't protect the public, and to remove a layer of resistance to their victory by getting rid of those who represent the values of the afghan republic.\n\nwith a new government soon to take over in washington, moradian said, the insurgents want to make sure president-elect joe biden does not change the terms of the february pact or set new conditions for pulling out the remaining 5,000 troops, slated to be halved next month. by sowing terror on city streets, the taliban are telling the new administration, 'don't you dare reopen the deal,'  moradian added.\n\nad\n\nad\n\namong afghan delegates returning to the doha talks early next week, the intensifying targeted violence has created a sense of dispirited gloom. some have lost friends to recent attacks or started wearing bulletproof vests. others said the dismissive harshness of the taliban's attitude makes it hard to stay optimistic about prospects for peace — or even to remain polite in meetings with adversaries bent on killing people and creating chaos in their capital.\n\nthe taliban have not changed, said abdul hafiz mansour, a conservative lawmaker and delegate. they are eager for power, but they have no plans or policies, no ability to run a country. they are a fighting army, not a governing group. they know how to destroy but not to build.\n\nwe have to keep talking because there is no other option, he said, but it is going to be difficult.\n\nad\n\nad
mount pleasant, va.\n\na: you're not alone in experiencing the frustration of trying to figure out what a maintenance contract should include. more than a decade ago, the air conditioning contractors of america, a trade association, recognized that heating, ventilating and air conditioning contractors were using many different approaches for inspecting and maintaining equipment. as the association says on its website, there was no way to determine if the many types of 'seasonal tune-ups', 'clean and checks', and 'maintenance services' performed on hvac equipment were equivalent. so the association developed checklists, including the minimum tasks that should be done during a maintenance check.\n\nad\n\nad\n\none of those guides is spot-on for your needs, because it covers maintenance of equipment in one- and two-family dwellings of three stories or less. you can download it at the association's website, acca.org/industry/quality. this document includes a checklist for inspecting and adjusting gas furnaces on pages 7 to 9; one for your main air conditioner (including the evaporator coils inside and the condensing unit outside) on page 14; and one for the basement heat pump (listed as air-to-air heat pump condenser) on page 16. just skimming these sections makes it clear that a company that merely checks gauges isn't doing an adequate job. the company should do a whole list of things, including checking that electrical connections are tight and inspecting the heat exchanger for signs of corrosion, cracks or other problems.\n\nthe association's website also includes a find a contractor service that allows you to search by zip code for members near you. whether you confine your interviews to companies listed there or consult with others, you can use the association's checklists to ensure that the services a company offers include the items that the industry considers necessary. you're unlikely to find the same wording, however. heating and air conditioning companies usually start with the industry guidelines and then tweak them to make it into your own list of service points, said ryan bramble, operations manager for aire serv heating and air conditioning in front royal, va. (855-259-2280; aireserv.com), which is listed on the association's website and serves your community.\n\nin some cases, the industry guidance is vague. for example, regarding the two issues you raise — whether the service company should clean the filter and change the humidifier pad — the checklists say only to inspect and clean or change if necessary. one reason for that: equipment varies. in these cases, it pays to read what the manufacturer of your equipment recommends. lennox, for example, recommends replacing one-inch pleated filters on its air conditioners once a month (a homeowner task), but says that a pro should replace all other filter sizes at an annual maintenance visit.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nyou can learn other useful things by reading the manufacturers' maintenance guidelines. for a natural gas furnace, the trane website offers tips for an annual maintenance check that homeowners can do, along with advice about when a pro should be brought in. if family finances are tight, it might be tempting to skip a professional maintenance contract and just call in help if something troubling turns up, especially because many of the steps seem simple. you do a visual inspection, vacuum out the furnace cabinet, check the belt for fraying and loose tension (can you push it down more than ½ inch?) and change the furnace filter.\n\nhowever, there is a difference between how a homeowner can check things and what a pro can accomplish, bramble said. a homeowner can check whether flames are mostly yellow or orange, rather than blue — a sign that the gas isn't burning completely, which not only wastes money but also increases the risk of carbon monoxide's getting into living spaces. but a pro with the right equipment and an appropriate to-do list will be able to determine oxygen and carbon monoxide levels, flue temperature and other details, allowing the furnace to be adjusted for optimum performance.
further, texas boosters must grapple with paying their ex-guy only roughly the same amount not to coach as south carolina will pay its ex-guy, will muschamp. that one has to hurt.\n\nad\n\nnor is it amazing that texas will pay herman $15 million not to coach four months after layoffs and pay cuts in the athletic department to save $13 million, with one of those prepared statements containing excruciating layoff passages such as extremely challenging times, ever-changing times and planning ways to put us in a position for success moving forward. some might find that amazing, but remember, the priority of the american football donor is finding the guy who can beat the hell out of the despicable rivals on the schedule, as well as those somewhat less despicable.\n\nad\n\nno, what's amazing is that texas has gone a so-so 78-60 across 11 seasons with all that money, which is humorous if you can refrain from sobbing. and what's really amazing is thinking back to monday, oct. 12, 2015, surveying the landscape of that day, and then realizing that five years and change later, steve sarkisian would replace tom herman at texas.\n\non that monday, southern california athletic director pat haden fired sarkisian amid his second season as head coach after his troubles with alcohol found its way into team meetings, practices and events. and on that monday, herman's first houston team stood 5-0 on its way to 13-1 and a peach bowl drubbing of florida state, making him one of the hottest coaches in the history of hot coaches.\n\nherman, 40 at the time, had just finished a stint as ohio state's offensive coordinator in which the buckeyes surged to a national championship even through the outrageous inconvenience of two injured starting quarterbacks. houston's recruiting roared, and herman headed for texas by november 2016 as a choice more obvious than plain-old obvious.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nto sit in his office and listen to him in the summer of 2017, before it all got started, was to wonder how some people wind up with this magnetic confidence that others of us would like to try on for a day. to see the whole thing go sideways to 9-10 against ranked teams and 1-4 against oklahoma and zero big 12 titles and just one title-game appearance and 32-18 over four seasons at a place that doesn't crave 32-18 . . . and to see the recruiting rankings for the big-energy young coach plunge from no. 4 (2018 and 2019, per rivals) to no. 14 (2020) and no. 16 (2021), one spot ahead of, sheesh, north carolina, coached by mack brown, who spent a good while at texas . . .\n\nwait, tom herman ends up one of those dudes who gets the old vote of half-confidence from the athletic director dec. 12 and then the sacking jan. 2?\n\ntexas athletic director chris del conte, dec. 12: when i look at our football program right now, i see tremendous young men and promising talent. our student-athletes are developing, and they play their hearts out. . . . i want to reiterate that tom herman is our coach.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ntexas athletic director chris del conte, jan. 2: decisions like this are very, very difficult and certainly not something i take lightly. as i've said before, my philosophy is to wait until the end of the season to look at all the factors in evaluating any of our programs. after much deliberation and a great deal of thought, as i looked back at the totality of where our football program is and in discussing its future, it became apparent that it was in the best interest of the university of texas to move in a different direction.\n\nso herman became the subject of that kind of dialect, so drearily familiar in the american experience. next, you're going to say they replaced a 45-year-old herman with a 46-year-old sarkisian?\n\nthat's the second half of amazement. the long lens on sarkisian's comeback yields something richly impressive, coursing twice through nick saban's alabama, that portal for the wayward. the trajectory went all the way to the broyles award this season as the top assistant coach in the land, coordinating alabama's otherworldly offense, the receivers darting about with unparalleled skill and geometric beauty.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nsaban had sarkisian as offensive coordinator briefly in winter 2016-17 after shooing lane kiffin before the national championship game after kiffin, on his way out the door to florida atlantic, reiterated that his knacks don't include silence. then when sarkisian left a minute later for the atlanta falcons, saban displayed a notable lack of pettiness when he rehired sarkisian in winter 2018-19.\n\ni've just tried to be a sponge here, man, sarkisian said ahead of friday's rose bowl win over notre dame, calling saban the best to ever do it. he said: and then a year ago i had a couple opportunities to become a head coach, and i decided to come back because it felt like my work here wasn't done. you know, i felt like i owed it to him. i made a commitment to him to be part of this program. . . .\n\ni think probably the biggest thing i've learned from him is his ability to balance all aspects of the program, whether it's on the field, off the field, recruiting, all that goes into being a head coach at a place like alabama, those are all the things i've tried to take in from him because his balance of all of that is what i think is pretty incredible.\n\nad\n\nad
state and federal officials said the sixth infected person in the united states is married to the chicago-area woman who contracted the virus when she traveled to wuhan, china, the epicenter of the outbreak. the unidentified man, who is in his 60s, has been isolated in the same suburban hospital as his wife since tuesday, when he began exhibiting symptoms consistent with the early stages of the virus, including fever, coughing and shortness of breath, officials said.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nofficials suspect he picked up the virus in the couple's home while his wife was symptomatic, according to jennifer layden, state epidemiologist for the illinois department of public health. the woman, who was identified last week as the second u.s. case, has been hospitalized since and is doing well, layden said.\n\nher husband has not attended mass gatherings, ngozi ezike, director of the state health department, said in a news briefing. the virus is not spreading widely across the community, she added.\n\nofficials are tracing the people who came in contact with the new patient but are not recommending any new precautions by others, ezike said.\n\naround the globe, however, and particularly in china, the respiratory illness caused by the newly identified virus continued on a widening, destructive path that increased public anxiety. the virus had killed 213 people — all of them in china — and infected more than 9,700 as of friday.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nabout 90 cases have been recorded outside china — including the first two in italy, both chinese tourists, according to news reports.\n\nairlines are cutting or completely canceling flights to china, a nation of 1.4 billion people, and some businesses have begun preparing for a possibly extended slowdown in operations and sales there. the union representing 15,000 american airlines pilots sued the company to halt the carrier's u.s.-china service, citing serious, and in many ways still unknown, health threats posed by the coronavirus.\n\nthe who criticized such actions, urging countries against imposition of trade or travel barriers. it also called for the world community to combat misinformation about the outbreak and accelerate vaccine development.\n\nad\n\nthe global health agency urged chinese health authorities to take a range of measures, in addition to the travel restrictions already imposed on 50 million people in central china's hubei province.\n\nad\n\nit asked china to collaborate with the who and others to conduct investigations; share full data on all of its cases; keep people informed about the evolution of the outbreak and protection measures the government has taken; boost efforts to identify the animal source of the outbreak; and conduct exit screening at international airports and ports so travelers with symptoms can be identified and treated.\n\nthe who cannot enforce its recommendations, but countries are under political pressure to follow them.\n\nad\n\npublic health officials and experts have criticized china for not sharing crucial data about patients, including when they became ill. that information is needed to learn more about the evolution of the outbreak, which would help officials control its spread.\n\nwho director-general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus nevertheless praised china's efforts to contain the outbreak.\n\nad\n\nlet me be clear: this declaration is not a vote of no confidence in china, he said. on the contrary, who continues to have confidence in china's capacity to control the outbreak. the chinese government is to be congratulated for the extraordinary measures it has taken to control the outbreak despite the severe social and economic impact those measures are having on the chinese people.\n\nad\n\nthe white house also announced the formation of a task force, led by health and human services secretary alex azar, to coordinate the u.s. response.\n\nas countries began repatriating citizens or planning to do so, the difficult task of balancing personal rights and public protection became more acute. in southern california, riverside county health officials issued a quarantine order thursday that allowed them to hold an individual against the person's will.\n\nad\n\nthe person, who had been flown in from wuhan a day earlier, had attempted to leave the military base where 195 american evacuees are being temporarily held for monitoring and observation.\n\nthey expressed a desire to leave, they tried to leave, said jose arballo jr., a spokesman for riverside county's department of public health. but they never got off the grounds of the base.\n\nad\n\nin a statement, officials said cameron kaiser, the county's public health officer, ordered the person to stay on the base until the individual is cleared by health officials, because of the unknown risk to the public should someone leave [the base] without undergoing a full health evaluation.\n\nthe individual will remain at [the base] until their health status is confirmed, the statement said. all other passengers from the flight also remain at [the base] and continue to be evaluated.\n\nad\n\nin australia, prime minister scott morrison's plan to send evacuees from hubei to christmas island, a territory 1,000 miles offshore, drew mixed reaction. there are hundreds of australian citizens in the chinese province.\n\nad\n\nif australia is able to bring them home, they will be required to stay on the island for two weeks and pay about $677 each for the evacuation, australian media reported.\n\nin a television interview with the australian broadcasting corp., daniel ouyang, an australian citizen stuck in wuhan after visiting family, said he is debating whether he should board a flight that will require the stay on christmas island.\n\nwhat's going to happen to us when we arrive? he asked. what's going to happen to our freedom? what are going to be able to do and not be allowed to do?\n\nin chicago, public health commissioner allison arwady said the new u.s. patient was placed in isolation tuesday, the same day he exhibited symptoms. the man, who has underlying health conditions, is in stable condition at a medical center in hoffman estates, a suburb of chicago, where his wife is also hospitalized.\n\nad\n\nad\n\narwady said the man has been extremely helpful in sharing the details of his recent activities.\n\nhe has not taken the 'l.' he has not attended any large gatherings, she said, noting that he has used his own car, not the city's elevated-train system, to get around. this news does not change the risk to the general public. it is not a local emergency.\n\nofficials warned a jittery public, however, to expect additional cases and perhaps more person-to-person transmissions of the virus. that has now occurred in the united states, germany, japan, vietnam, china and taiwan.\n\nmoving forward, we can expect to see more cases, and more cases means the potential for more person-to-person spread, said nancy messonnier, director of the national center for immunization and respiratory diseases at the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention.\n\nad\n\nnonetheless, the overall risk to people in the united states is still considered quite low, officials said. they advised u.s. residents to take the kinds of precautions they would to guard against seasonal flu — which already has killed at least 8,200 people in late 2019 and early 2020 — including frequent hand-washing and staying home when they are sick.\n\nthere is no need for face masks in the united states, messonnier said.\n\nyet at mr. ace, a hardware store in the hoffman estates neighborhood where the chicago couple are hospitalized, sales of face masks have spiked over the past week.\n\nwe can barely keep them on the shelves, said owner mike patel. so far, the store has sold about 120 masks and has restocked them every three days.\n\nwe keep getting them, and people are still buying them, he said.
resign! resign! demonstrators chanted as a column of marchers stretching many city blocks made its way along andrassy avenue, the city's grand central boulevard. by late afternoon, the crowd had filled the sprawling plaza in front of the hungarian parliament, near the banks of the danube.\n\nad\n\norban has helped pioneer a breed of autocracy in a country that threw off the shackles of communist authoritarianism three decades ago, and he serves as inspiration for other hard-line leaders in europe and beyond.\n\nad\n\nhis authority in hungary is normally unquestioned. the political opposition is divided and leaderless, civil society is hemmed in by punishing laws, much of the media is in his pocket and supposedly independent branches of the government are beholden to the ruling party.\n\nin elections in april — deemed free but not fair by independent observers — orban won a two-thirds parliamentary majority that gives him license to change the constitution at will.\n\nad\n\nyet saturday's protest offered fresh evidence that orban — normally sure-footed in keeping the public on his side — may have erred with recent moves that have provoked a backlash more intense and sustained than any in recent years.\n\nafter the election, we had apathy. but then something changed, said bernadette szel, an independent lawmaker who has helped spearhead the protests. this is fake democracy and people are fed up with it.\n\nad\n\namong the factors driving the unrest are the eviction of central european university, the creation of a parallel justice system that will allow the government to bypass independent courts and the dead-of-night removal of a statue that paid tribute to a hero of the failed 1956 anti-soviet uprising.\n\nad\n\nbut the most important trigger for the demonstrations was legislation, jammed through the parliament last month with little debate, that allows employers to force workers to perform as many as 400 hours of overtime per year. employers can delay payments for up to three years.\n\nthe workplace code, dubbed the slave law by opponents, was the government's response to an ultratight labor market that has left employers struggling to find workers. orban has been highly successful in attracting major european firms to hungary, using low wages to cement the country's reputation as the continent's factory floor.\n\nad\n\nbut hundreds of thousands of people have abandoned hungary, seeking higher pay and greater freedoms elsewhere. the workers who are left behind are increasingly chafing under the strain.\n\nad\n\nthe workers are already exhausted by the amount of work they're doing. the new law makes it even worse, said bela balogh, president of the hungarian metalworkers federation.\n\nbalogh's union was among a number of workers groups out in force on saturday. the unions have threatened more protests, as well as strikes, in the weeks to come.\n\nalongside the unions, civil society groups and a motley collection of opposition parties — from left to right — have been the primary drivers of the demonstrations, which began with a series of protests last month.\n\nthe largest of december's protests numbered around 15,000 demonstrators. saturday's event appeared to have at least matched that total, and it may have exceeded it.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ngovernment spokesmen have dismissed the demonstrators as agents of george soros, the hungarian american financier and the prime minister's all-purpose boogeyman.\n\ntoday's rally is part of the election campaign of george ­soros for the european parliament, said balazs hidveghi, a spokesman for the ruling fidesz party, at a news conference. he wants to import a pro-migration agenda. therefore, he's activating his supporters everywhere.\n\norban has cast himself as the patriotic defender of hungary against an invading tide of migrants, even though immigration to the country is negligible. with european parliamentary elections coming up in may, he has sought to transform the campaign into a struggle between his brand of illiberal democracy and the tolerant and open societies advocated by soros.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nopinion surveys suggest orban and fidesz remain popular in hungary, with especially robust support in the countryside and in small cities. balogh, the union leader, acknowledged that many of his members support the government and agree with its argument that the labor law will help them up their earnings.\n\nin the countryside, where the majority of our membership lives, people believe what the government tells them. they don't have access to independent media, he said.\n\nwhile orban has gone to great lengths to commandeer the press, he has resisted using brute force to suppress dissent. analysts say he prefers a light-touch style of autocracy that allows him to wield virtually unfettered power without resorting to cracking heads.\n\nad\n\nbut the recent demonstrations have tested orban's approach. the police used tear gas last month to fend off protesters who were trying to force their way into the parliament. security guards later forcibly evicted several opposition lawmakers from the state television headquarters, sending one to the hospital.\n\nad\n\nthis is showing people the real face of their power. not the mask. the real face, said szel, who was among the parliamentarians roughed up.\n\nsaturday's protest unfolded peacefully, with police blocking off large sections of the city center to allow demonstrators to march. after nightfall, protesters chanted we've had enough! as riot police circling the parliament building looked on impassively.\n\nad\n\ndemonstrators said they were demanding free courts, a free media and a repeal of the labor law. but mostly, the protests have become a catchall for everyone uneasy with the direction in which orban has led the country since returning to power in 2010.\n\norban is not taking us forward or left or right but backward into the darkest times of our history, julia abraham, an organizer of a civil society group called hungary for everyone, told the crowd.\n\nad\n\nthat fear was made vivid late last month by the cover-of-darkness removal of a statue that had stood beneath parliament's soaring spires. the statue depicted former prime minister imre nagy, a hero to many hungarians for his role in supporting the 1956 uprising.\n\nbut orban's government evidently did not want a figure associated with resistance to a despotic regime gracing the country's central public square.\n\nthe statue will be replaced by a memorial to the victims of a 1919 purge of anti-communist forces. the memorial had previously occupied that spot under the regime of adm. miklos horthy, a right-wing authoritarian who led hungary during the interwar years and who, according to historians, appears to be a model for orban's reign.\n\nthe horthy era was quite similar to the orban system, said janos rainer, a nagy biographer who heads the budapest-based 1956 institute. a nationalist public discourse. fully controlled media. a strong governmental party. most of all: democratic structures, but no democratic procedures.
iran has a powerful security force, but leaders have not yet called on the revolutionary guard and the basij militia, who flattened the 2009 demonstrations by killing dozens of protesters.\n\nwhy are people protesting?\n\non dec. 28, protests broke out in the northern city of mashhad, spurred at first by concern over the country's stunted economy and the high prices of basic goods like eggs, which saw a 40 percent jump in price. over the next six days, the protests in more than two dozen towns would turn into an open rebellion against iran's islamic leadership itself.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nprotesters' chants and attacks on government buildings upended a system that had little tolerance for dissent, with some demonstrators even shouting death to the dictator! — referring to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei — and asking security forces to join them, the post's erin cunningham reported.\n\nin iran, where ruling clerics hold much of the power, some protesters are frustrated that social freedoms and political openness are being suppressed by the establishment. working-class iranians who want higher wages and a solution to unemployment are frustrated that the economy has been slow to grow despite the lifting of sanctions under an international nuclear deal.\n\niranian authorities have blocked access to social media and messaging apps that would allow demonstrators to organize, according to the new york times. the decision prompted president trump to tweet that the country had closed down the internet so that peaceful demonstrators cannot communicate. not good!\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe protests appeared to have been initially caused by president hassan rouhani's leak of a proposed government budget last month that called for slashing cash subsidies to the poor and raising fuel prices to lower debt, the post reported. but the plan also included fees for car registration and an unpopular departure tax.\n\nprotesters are also demanding to know why iran has spent billions of dollars on foreign policy in the middle east at a time when people are struggling at home. iran has sent cash, weapons and fighters to syria, for example, and has financially supported palestinians and the lebanese shiite group hezbollah.\n\nunemployment for young people, half of iran's population, is at 40 percent, the new york times reported.\n\niran's economy has grown since the nuclear deal thanks to resumed oil exports, although growth outside the oil sector has sagged. global oil markets have already seen the effects of the unrest in iran, an opec member. oil futures pushed above $60 a barrel, close to a 30-month high, the post reported.\n\nhow intense are the protests?\n\nthe revolts have left at least 20 people dead — including nine overnight tuesday — after protesters clashed with security forces in locations around the country.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nvideos online show protesters running from tear gas and water cannons and others confronting police. about 90 percent of those arrested in protests were under 25 years old, reuters reported, citing official figures.\n\nsix of the latest causalities took place during an attack on a police station in qahdarijan, according to state television. the clashes were allegedly sparked by protesters who tried to steal guns from the station. state television also reported an 11-year-old boy and a 20-year-old man were killed in the town of khomeinishahr, and a member of the revolutionary guard was killed in the town of najafabad.\n\na semiofficial news agency reported tuesday that 450 people have been arrested in tehran since saturday. the ilna news agency cited ali asghar nasserbakht, a security deputy governor of tehran, in its report.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ni demand all prosecutors across the country to get involved, said sadegh larijani, according to the associated press. their approach should be strong, he said.\n\nprotesters could also potentially face the death penalty when their cases come to trial, according to the head of tehran's revolutionary court, the ap reported.\n\niran's semiofficial tasnim news agency quoted mousa ghazanfarabadi as saying: obviously one of their charges can be moharebeh, or waging war against god, which is a death penalty offense in iran.\n\non wednesday, tens of thousands of people marched in pro-government rallies called to counter the earlier demonstrations. the marches, broadcast by iranian state media, had the hallmarks of previous state-organized gatherings, with crowds waving iranians flags and holding placards with slogans backing iran's supreme leader, ayatollah ali khamenei, the post's erin cunningham reported.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmaj. gen. mohammad ali jafari, the head of the country's powerful revolutionary guards, said the marches marked an end to the anti-government protests, which he referred to as the sedition.\n\nmuch is still uncertain about the size and endurance of the protesters. some analysts anticipate the collapse of the regime, though it is unclear whether leadership or political aspirations exist within the anti-government movement. others have drawn parallels to the 2011 arab spring uprisings.\n\nhow do the current protests compare to 2009?\n\nthe protests are the country's largest since a 2009 demonstrations over disputed election results. at its height, the 2009 protest, known as the green movement, saw as many as 3 million peaceful demonstrators challenge official claims that then-president mahmoud ahmadinejad won the presidential election in a landslide. after six months, the protesters were quashed by the country's security forces.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nunlike the 2009 revolt, the current protests have sprung throughout country, including provincial, traditionally conservative areas that rarely participate in the political activism led by groups in tehran and other cities. the 2009 protests were primarily fueled by the capital's educated elite and urban middle class, while videos circulating online suggest younger, working-class people form the bulk of the current protest's numbers.\n\nthose younger people, some from towns and small cities in rural areas, are now expressing their frustrations with the political elite, who they say have appropriated the economy to their own benefit, according to the new york times.\n\nsince the new protests began, the pro-reform figures of the 2009 uprising, some of whom remain under house arrests, have been noticeably absent. protesters have not called for their release.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe protesters have either become more radicalized in their demands and/or simply don't belong to the generation that experienced the events of 2009 as adults, mohammad ali shabani, editor of iran coverage at the online news portal al-monitor, wrote sunday.\n\nhow have iranian leaders responded?\n\nkhamenei posted comments tuesday asserting the current protests were brought on by the country's enemies — often used as shorthand for the united states, its allies and anti-government iranian exiles.\n\nin recent days, enemies of iran used different tools including cash, weapons, politics and intelligence apparatus to create troubles for the islamic republic, said the statement from khamenei on his official website.\n\nad\n\nrouhani, a relative moderate who was reelected to a second term in may, too spoke out, and tried to downplay the significance of the violence, according to cnn.\n\nad\n\nour great nation has witnessed a number of similar incidents in the past and has comfortably dealt with them, rouhani said in a meeting with iranian members of parliament monday. this is nothing.\n\niranian president hassan rouhani reacted to anti-government protests in a televised speech dec. 31, rebuffing president trump's support of the dissent. (reuters)\n\nhow has trump responded?\n\nthe protests provide a glimpse into trump's policies toward iran — whether he will adopt a tougher stance in dealing with the country than president barack obama, for example, and whether he will call for regime change.\n\non friday, trump tweeted that iranians are finally getting wise, and said the administration was keeping a close eye on the government's violence. he has also suggested the possibility of reimposed sanctions.\n\nhis language was similar to that of obama in 2009, when he responded to the challenged presidential election. obama said he respected iranian sovereignty, but that he was deeply troubled by the government's violence against peaceful protesters.\n\ntrump has continued to tweet about the conflict since, though it's unlikely his tweets will lead iranians to further revolt.\n\nhe has no friends in that country, barbara slavin, director of the future of iran initiative at the atlantic council, told the post's carol morello and anne gearan. his first act as a president was to ban iranians from traveling here. but if his statements are irrelevant to what's going on in iran, his actions are relevant. if he does not continue raising nuclear sanctions and pulls out of the jcpoa [nuclear agreement], that will have a more chilling effect on the willingness of anyone to invest in iran and trade with iran.\n\na senior trump administration official said wednesday that u.s. officials were surprised by the outbreak of the protests and how they have spread.\n\nwe're looking at something new, something we haven't seen in iran since the islamic revolution, the official said, adding that the novelty of the protests is making it difficult for u.s. officials to predict where they will lead.\n\nerin cunningham and brian murphy contributed to this report.\n\nanti-government protests spurred by economic woes hit iran share share view photos view photos next image a pro-government demonstrator stands under an iranian flag during a march in iran's southwestern city of ahvaz.

hi, carolyn: every christmas, we host my parents and my brother's small family. my brother's family is kind but poor and relies on help from family, friends and various agencies to make ends meet. when christmas comes, they buy presents for the kids in lieu of a larger gift exchange.\n\nmy parents get gifts for everyone. my husband and i buy gifts for my parents. the question that comes up every year is: what do we do for my brother and sister-in-law? they're the only ones we're not buying gifts for and only because we don't want to make them feel bad because they can't reciprocate.\n\nbut that doesn't feel right. we would like to give them something — even something small. what do you suggest? is there a non-gift-giving option that we haven't thought of?\n\nb.\n\nb.: you're already using a non-gift-giving option: you're giving your brother and his wife respect for their dignity. and you're letting them off the hook of feeling they have to reciprocate; even something small becomes a burden to someone raised to want to give back.\n\nthe system you describe in your family is logical, because most people feel more comfortable accepting help from above — parents, boss, religious institution — than from peers. if your brother is comfortable with the way you all handle christmas, then it wouldn't be right to change it just to make yourself feel better. especially not if you're telling yourself that you're making changes on his behalf.\n\nif what you really want is to help your brother more, then offer money to your parents so they can increase what they give to him, either at christmas or throughout the year. that way he gets more, you feel better and there's no awkwardness about the source.\n\nhi, carolyn: my brother accused me of being selfish for raising my 11-month-old daughter as a vegetarian. i have been a vegetarian for most of my adult life for moral reasons, and the decision to raise my daughter as such was reached after careful consideration, research and discussions with my spouse, as well as my ob and pediatrician, all of whom fully support my decision. my brother stated that his wife had read a study online that said vegetarian children are at risk of not getting the nutrients they need, and he said he was worried i was going to make my child retarded.\n\ni found myself justifying my choices and providing him with information on my daughter's diet and pediatric assessments, which he blew off. admittedly i also went for a low blow and stated i would not take nutritional advice from an obese woman (his wife). after i cooled off and apologized for my comment, i asked for an apology from him. he said i should get over it, because he didn't feel he was in the wrong.\n\ni know i need to get over this difference in opinions — any advice on how?\n\nanonymous\n\nanonymous: anyone who used retarded that way in 2016 is not absorbing new information. know this, for your own sake, and stop believing he will.\n\nas in, stop justifying yourself to your brother. instead, hereafter: i have a pediatrician, or just, thanks for caring, with zero further engagement. take any lingering rage out on a celery stick.
i got rid of her. no one talks to me that way.\n\nwell, okay, maybe it was 10 years later, after she had helped lead me back home, to myself, to radical self-care, to friendship with my own heart, to a glade that had always existed deep inside me, to mostly healthy eating, but that i'd avoided all those years by achieving, dieting, binging, people-pleasing and so on.\n\nad\n\nnow when i decide to go on a diet, i say it to myself: great, honey. how much weight are you hoping to gain? here is what's true: diets make you fat, 95 percent of the time. we gain it back, plus five pounds.\n\nad\n\ni may have mentioned several hundred times that i have had the tiniest, tiniest struggle with food and body image for the last — well, lifetime. hardly worth mentioning. it is a long story, having to do with childhood injuries to my sense of self, terrible anxiety, and the inability of my parents to nurture my soul, so starving and chastising myself cannot possibly heal this.\n\ni hate to say it, but only profound self-love will work, union with that scared breath-holding self, and not a diet that forbids apples or avocado. horribly, but as usual, only kindness and grace — spiritual wd-40 — can save us.\n\nad\n\ncan you put the scale away for a week? okay, then how about four days? i have been addicted to the scale, too, which is like needing former vice president dick cheney to weigh in every morning on my value as a human being.\n\nad\n\ncan you put away your tight pants, that don't actually hurt you? wear forgiving pants! the world is too hard as it is, without letting your pants have an opinion on how you are doing. i struggle with enough esteem issues without letting my jeans get in on the act, with random thoughts about my butt.\n\nby the same token, it feels great to be healthy. some of you need to be under a doctor's care. none of you need to join jenny craig. it won't work. you will lose tons of weight quickly, and gain it all back, plus five.\n\nad\n\nsome of you need to get outside and walk for half an hour a day. i do love walking, so that is not a problem for me, but i have a serious problem with sugar: if i start eating it, i sometimes can't stop. i don't have an off switch, any more than i do with alcohol. given a choice, i will eat raisinets until the cows come home — and then those cows will be tense, and bitter, because i will have gotten lipstick on the straps of their feed bags.\n\nad\n\nbut you crave what you eat, so if i go for three or four days with very little sugar, the craving is gone. that is not dieting. if you are allergic to peanuts, don't eat peanuts. have an apple! have some avocado.\n\nit's really okay, though, to have (or pray for) an awakening around your body. it's okay to stop hitting the snooze button, and to pay attention to what makes you feel great about yourself, one meal at a time. unfortunately, it's yet another inside job. if you are not okay with yourself at 185 pounds, you will not be okay at 150, or even 135. the self-respect and peace of mind you long for is not out there. it's within. i hate that. i resent that more than i can say. but it's true.\n\nad\n\nmaybe some of us can try to eat a bit less, and walk a bit more, and make sure to wear pants that do not hurt our thighs or our feelings. drinking more water is the solution to all problems. doing a three-minute meditation every day will change your life. naps are nice.\n\nad\n\ni'll leave you with this: i've helped some of the sturdier women at my church get healthy, by suggesting they prepare each meal as if they had asked our beloved pastor to lunch or dinner. they wouldn't say, here pastor, let's eat standing up in the kitchen. this tube of barbecue pringles is all for you. i have my own, and then stand there gobbling from their own tubular container. no, they'd get out pretty dishes, and arrange wonderful foods on the plates, and set one plate before veronica at the table, a plate filled with love, pride and connection. that's what we have longed for, our whole lives, and get to create. wow!\n\njoin me in not starting a diet this year. and god bless you all real good, as my pastor always says.

the opioid files inside the drug industry's plan to defeat the dea faced with pressure to curtail suspicious opioid shipments, an alliance fought back with every weapon at its disposal illustration by eddie alvarez/the washington post warning: this graphic requires javascript. please enable javascript for the best experience.\n\nnewly unsealed documents in a landmark civil case in cleveland provide clues to one of the most enduring mysteries of the opioid epidemic: how were drug companies able to weaken the federal government's most powerful enforcement weapon at the height of the crisis?\n\nthe industry enlisted members of congress to limit the powers of the drug enforcement administration. it devised tactics to push back against the agency. and it commissioned a crisis playbook to burnish its image and blame the federal government for not doing enough to stop the epidemic.\n\nthe new information is emerging through the efforts of lawyers in the massive federal lawsuit against two dozen drug companies in cleveland who have obtained depositions from high-ranking company officials, internal company emails and confidential memos. the documents were unsealed in july after a year-long legal fight by the washington post and the owner of the charleston gazette-mail in west virginia.\n\nin 2016, the drug companies convinced members of congress and obama administration officials to rein in the dea and force the agency to treat them as partners in efforts to solve the crisis. the crowning achievement of the companies was a piece of legislation known as the marino bill, named after its original sponsor, which curbed the dea's ability to immediately suspend the operations of drug companies that failed to follow the law.\n\nthe post has twice investigated the industry's battles with the dea, first in 2016 and again in 2017 with 60 minutes. but the full story has never been told because so few of the people involved will talk about it. the list of people who have declined to be interviewed includes former congressman tom marino (r-pa.), who first proposed the bill; former acting dea administrator chuck rosenberg, whose agency surrendered to the pressure; former attorney general loretta e. lynch, whose department did not stand in the way of the legislation; and, finally, then-president barack obama, who signed it into law.\n\n[the drug industry's triumph over the dea]\n\nthe lawsuit, filed on behalf of more than 2,000 cities, towns and counties in federal court in cleveland, seeks to hold the industry accountable for the opioid epidemic. the plaintiffs' lawyers are pursuing their civil case under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations (rico) act, a law crafted to attack criminal organizations.\n\ndefendants carried out their coordinated strategy to weaken the dea's enforcement capabilities in part through the marino bill, states a filing by the plaintiffs' lawyers in the case.\n\nlawyers for the drug companies have ridiculed the rico argument and asked u.s. district judge dan polster to toss out the case before it heads to trial, scheduled for oct. 21.\n\nplaintiffs have no evidence that distributors associated with manufacturers or one another, as part of a continuing unit, for the 'common purpose of engaging in a course of unlawful conduct,'  drug company lawyers wrote in their motion to dismiss, which was denied by polster on sept. 10.\n\nin a statement to the post, the healthcare distribution alliance, the association that represents drug distributors, defended its support of the marino bill, formally known as the ensuring patient access and effective drug enforcement act.\n\nthe intent of the law was not to decrease the dea's enforcement against distributors, the alliance said in a statement. hda believed that the legislation would help provide greater clarity to one element of dea's enforcement standards and encourage communication and coordination that was much-needed between the dea and the industry.\n\n[full responses from distributors and a drug industry trade association]\n\nthe alliance also noted that the bill was approved by both houses of congress and signed by obama.\n\nbeginning in 2006, the dea went after drug distributors and pharmacies for failing to report suspicious orders of millions of opioid pills that spilled into the black market. over the next decade, the dea brought two dozen enforcement cases and forced the companies to pay $500 million in fines.\n\nexecutives of the nation's largest drug manufacturers and distributors were alarmed.\n\nthe dea is now hammering all of us, ann berkey, then a senior vice president of mckesson corp., wrote in a 2014 email to another senior mckesson officer, according to a deposition in the cleveland case.\n\nduring meetings at resorts in places like pebble beach, calif., and palm beach, fla., the industry alliance charted a way to respond. they implemented a political strategy that they knew the dea believed would result in tying the agencies [sic] hands to actively and aggressively address diversion and compliance, according to an internal alliance memo that is now part of the case.\n\nthe strategy worked.\n\nfor years, joe rannazzisi led the government's war against opioid abuse at the dea. he says he was pushed out by members of congress amid a drug industry campaign to weaken enforcement. (jahi chikwendiu/the washington post)\n\nthe big three\n\nby 2005, the opioid crisis was claiming 10,000 lives a year.\n\nthe dea mounted a crusade against internet pharmacies and corrupt doctors and then took on the companies making and distributing the opioids to prevent drugs from being diverted to the black market.\n\nthe effort was led by joe rannazzisi, a hard-charging dea agent from new york who worked the streets of detroit before being promoted to lead the dea's office of diversion control, a small unit that was seen at the time as something of a backwater in an agency devoted to pursuing high-profile heroin, cocaine and marijuana cases.\n\n[who is joe rannazzisi: the dea man who fought drug companies and lost]\n\nthe dea had always relied on drug manufacturers, distributors and pharmacies to police themselves by monitoring suspicious orders and reporting them to the agency. it was essentially an honor system. the flow of pharmaceuticals was simply too immense for the dea to monitor on its own.\n\nrannazzisi and his dea legal counsel, d. linden barber, wrote to drug distributors and manufacturers, warning them to more closely track their painkillers and stop suspiciously large shipments to pharmacies.\n\nthe warnings didn't work. the dea decided to get tougher. it had several tools at its disposal, in ascending order of severity: it could send a company a letter of admonition warning it to follow the law; it could send an order to show cause demanding to know why operations should not be shut down for failing to report suspicious orders; it could issue an immediate suspension order instantly halting operations; or it could bring a civil or criminal enforcement case with heavy fines.\n\nbut cases against big companies were difficult to make, requiring on-the-ground investigations involving numerous interviews and thousands of pages of documents. they could take years to complete.\n\nin august 2006, the dea issued a show-cause order asking mckesson, the nation's largest drug distributor, why its operations at the company's distribution center in lakeland, fla., should not be shut down. the dea alleged that three mckesson distribution centers filled hundreds of suspicious orders of hydrocodone, such as vicodin, placed by internet pharmacies.\n\nsoon, there would be even harsher action.\n\nin april 2007, the dea issued an immediate-suspension order for the lakeland, fla., distribution center of amerisourcebergen, the third-largest drug distributor in the nation. drug distributors based their hubs in lakeland because it is centrally located near major highways.\n\nmckesson and amerisourcebergen were two of the big three — along with cardinal health — which distributed nearly 85 percent of the nation's legal drugs. they all belonged to the healthcare distribution alliance — then called the healthcare distribution management association, or hdma — which represented nearly three dozen drug distributors.\n\nthe big three made up the alliance's executive committee.\n\nan excerpt from an industry alliance executive's email to members.\n\non sept. 25, 2007, anita t. ducca, then the alliance's senior director for regulatory affairs and health-care policy, drafted an email to members.\n\ngiven the intensity and impact of the drug enforcement administration's (dea) recent actions, and the concerns expressed by hdma's executive committee last week, hdma recommends developing a comprehensive dea strategy, she wrote, according to a deposition unsealed in the cleveland case. what, if any, legal options do we have?\n\nshe wrote that the strategy included contacting appropriate decision-makers at the dea, on capitol hill and inside federal agencies who may be supportive of the industry.\n\na second order to show cause went to a mckesson facility in landover, md., in november 2007. that month, cardinal had its license suspended at its center in auburn, wash. the dea alleged the company had supplied 18 million doses of hydrocodone in nine months to retail pharmacies, including one filling illegitimate prescriptions.\n\nthey just weren't getting it, said jim geldhof, a 43-year dea veteran supervisor now hired as an expert by the plaintiffs' attorneys. they weren't paying attention to us.\n\nan email from jack crowley of purdue pharma to a counterpart at cardinal health.\n\nin december 2007, jack crowley, a former dea supervisor who had joined oxycontin manufacturer purdue pharma as executive director of compliance, wrote an email to a counterpart at cardinal.\n\ni'm sorry that dea is being so aggressive with this suspicious orders stuff, crowley said. i wish there was something i could do to help in this situation — we are all in the same boat.\n\ntactic 8\n\nin the face of the dea pressure, the industry alliance took a two-pronged approach.\n\npublicly, it issued industry guidelines that appeared to appease the agency and provide greater controls against drug diversion.\n\nin february 2008, the alliance said it planned to adopt best practice guidelines for its companies to follow, the unsealed documents from the cleveland lawsuit show. the guidelines included establishing limits of pills or thresholds that customers such as pharmacies could order. the guidelines also included identifying orders of unusual size, frequency and pattern and stopping shipments that seemed suspicious, all of which are required by law and regulations.\n\nthe dea would later call the guidelines important for guarding against diversion of pain pills.\n\nbut privately, the alliance was pursuing another path. an internal alliance document says one of the proposed reasons for the guidelines was to head-off further enforcement or regulatory action by the dea.\n\non march 20, 2008, kristen freitas, then associate director of federal government affairs for the alliance, wrote an email that outlined a confidential draft political strategy. it contained several tactics to combat the aggressiveness of the dea.\n\nas part of the strategy, the alliance would brief congressional appropriations committee members in advance of dea budget hearings. the strategy said to seek commitment to ask questions of the agency's then-administrator, michele leonhart, who was scheduled to testify.\n\nthe alliance also wrote questions for the lawmakers to ask leonhart.\n\nso you drafted on behalf of your members potential questions to be asked by members of congress to ask the dea, correct? plaintiff's attorney mark pifko asked patrick m. kelly, the alliance's executive vice president of government affairs, during a deposition in the cleveland case.\n\nthat's what i understand, kelly said.\n\npifko then showed kelly two talking points the organization had prepared for members of congress to pose during the hearing. one of them was a defense of the drug industry: it seems to me at the end of the day that prescription drug abuse is caused by inappropriate prescribing and inappropriate dispensing, neither of which wholesalers are authorized or capable of regulating or enforcing.\n\nso these questions are for senators to ask the dea? pifko asked.\n\nthat's the process, kelly said.\n\nanother tactic: seek advocates among pain community who will assist in delivering our message to hill, according to the unsealed records.\n\ntactic 8 in the draft was one of the most important elements of the alliance's political strategy: identify high-level congressional 'champion' who will request a meeting with dea to discuss concerns.\n\npifko asked kelly during the deposition why the organization needed a high-level congressional champion?\n\nwe were seeking greater clarity from the agency and it was not forthcoming, kelly said. we were requesting that our congressional colleagues possibly request a meeting so we could convey those concerns.\n\none of the high-level champions would turn out to be tom marino of pennsylvania. and one of the things he would do was to request an investigation of rannazzisi, head of the dea's office of diversion control, by the inspector general of the justice department.\n\nformer congressman tom marino (r-pa.), center, sponsored a bill that, according to a former senior justice department official, created a high standard for dea action against drug distributors. it would become law in 2016. (susan walsh/ap)\n\n'overzealous regulators'\n\nin 2008, the dea took its strongest action yet against the drug companies. that may, mckesson agreed to pay a $13 million fine — then a record for a drug diversion case — for failing to report suspicious orders from the internet pharmacies and drugstores. that record was shattered in october when cardinal agreed to pay $34 million.\n\nthat same month, congress passed a bill shutting down internet pharmacies. signed by president george w. bush, it was a major victory for the dea.\n\nin its database tracking drug shipments, the dea could see the flow of opioids from some of the nation's largest manufacturers and distributors to an increasing number of pain management clinics, some of which became fronts for illegal pill mills. the dea took its offensive to the next level.\n\nthe agency again notified distributors and manufacturers that their pills were being diverted to the streets, and they had a responsibility under the law to monitor and report suspicious activity.\n\nthe first time, you can say you didn't know, said rannazzisi, now an expert witness for plaintiffs suing the drug companies. the second time, you can't say we didn't know. they knew. they knew what they were doing. how did they know? we told them. everything we told them to do, they disregarded.\n\nthe companies were feeling the pressure. crowley, purdue's compliance director, wrote to a colleague on march 19, 2008, about dea's latest plans to squeeze the wholesalers and distributors on 'pain clinics,'  according to an email unsealed in the case. crowley predicted that the dea will call distributors into headquarters and read them the riot act, etc.\n\nthree months later, crowley wrote to a senior vice president at cardinal and another purdue director to say the drug industry needed to support itself and each other and to protect itself from overzealous regulators.\n\ni'd like to discuss that with you to see if we can support each other in the 'dea-created' mess, crowley said. i can certainly commiserate with you about dea actions from a select few individual crusaders in their headquarters.\n\ncrowley, who has since left purdue, told the post in an email that he and his colleagues did their best to cooperate with the dea.\n\nall of these emails have context and can't be read fairly in isolation but none in any way changes our record of cooperation and our proactive steps to address the misconduct of bad actors, crowley wrote.\n\nbetween 2008 and 2011, the dea had launched a half-dozen pain-clinic investigations involving drug distributors, including cardinal for a second time, and one manufacturer, mallinckrodt, the largest producer of generic opioids. the dea hit them with inspection warrants, subpoenaed internal corporate records and issued orders to show cause as well as immediate suspension orders.\n\nin april 2012, the alliance was concerned about the dea's latest efforts to thwart drug diversion and abuse, according to an internal email unsealed in the cleveland case.\n\nthe alliance had enlisted one of washington's most prominent attorneys, robert b. barnett. he and his law partner, richard m. cooper, had some advice for the alliance.\n\ninstead of challenging the dea, the attorneys suggested the industry may be better off averting dea actions by taking even stronger compliance measures, according to an internal alliance memo.\n\nalliance representatives also told barnett and cooper that they were considering a legislative approach to address the growing tension with the dea.\n\nmr. barnett and mr. cooper felt that new legislation to specifically address our concerns with dea was highly unlikely to be successful due to limited momentum in that direction, alliance president john m. gray wrote in the memo.\n\nbarnett and cooper declined to comment. (their firm, williams & connolly, does legal work for the post.)\n\ndespite the pessimistic assessment, the industry moved forward with the legislative plan.\n\nin the fall of 2012, the dea embarked on its biggest diversion action to date, filing a civil case against walgreens. the agency accused one of the nation's largest pharmacy chains of flooding florida with painkillers. the case would ultimately result in an $80 million fine.\n\nthe details were damning.\n\nbetween april 2010 and february 2012, walgreens's distribution center in jupiter, fla., sent 13.7 million oxycodone doses to six pharmacies in the state, a large and sudden increase.\n\nthis occurred despite internal warnings. kristine atwell, who managed the jupiter center, said of one pharmacy, i don't know how they can even house this many bottle[s] to be honest. how do we go about checking the validity of these orders? according to an email now part of the cleveland case.\n\na dea investigation of the jupiter facility found that walgreens failed to maintain an effective system for detecting suspicious orders.\n\nthe dea cited the industry alliance's own compliance guidelines issued four years earlier as evidence that walgreens knew or should have known that it was required to report suspicious orders and ignored them.\n\nthe alliance eventually removed the guidelines from its website, noting that they were never intended to be an industry standard, according to minutes from an alliance board meeting that were cited in a deposition in the case.\n\nin february 2012, the dea suspended the registration of cardinal for the second time for failing to report suspicious orders of painkillers.\n\nthe battle between the dea and the companies was approaching its final, critical stage.\n\nlinden barber, who left the dea and set up a law practice to represent the industry he once regulated, had warned that the agency's legal office could lose cases on appeal. the office eventually raised the agency's internal standard of proof for bringing enforcement actions from a preponderance of evidence to beyond a reasonable doubt, according to former dea supervisors and lawyers. the number of cases brought by rannazzisi's team plummeted.\n\nformer high-level justice officials who worked for or on behalf of cardinal approached their former colleagues. rannazzisi was summoned to the justice department by then-deputy attorney general james m. cole, who later told the post he thought it made sense to listen to what cardinal had to say.\n\nan excerpt from the industry's crisis playbook, developed by a crisis communications firm.\n\nin the wake of the walgreens and cardinal cases, the industry alliance hired a crisis communications company, apco worldwide. in april 2013, the d.c.-based firm created a 44-page crisis playbook that proposed responses for the industry in several theoretical scenarios.\n\nunder one, the dea has suspended the license of a drug company that was filling unusually large orders from several pharmacies. the playbook suggested that drug companies consider using the suspension as an opportunity to push its message of misdirected dea enforcement with national media and to inform relevant members of congress about the action to head off greater criticism.\n\na talking point to use with the news media: dea appears to be pursuing a path of conflict, rather than collaboration with our industry.\n\n(illustration by eddie alvarez/the washington post)\n\nthe marino bill\n\nby 2013, tom marino, a former u.s. attorney from pennsylvania, was a second-term republican congressman from williamsport, a community that had been ravaged by the opioid epidemic. representatives from the industry enlisted marino and then-rep. marsha blackburn (r-tenn.), whose state also was hard hit by opioids, to their cause.\n\nboth lawmakers told industry lobbyists that they would be willing to work with the drug companies and had expressed interest in introducing legislation on their behalf, according to an email unsealed in the cleveland case.\n\nrep. marino's office is very open to feedback and additional ideas, jewelyn cosgrove, a lobbyist for the alliance, wrote to her colleagues on june 12, 2013.\n\na lobbyist for the industry alliance emailed colleagues about working with the measure's sponsor.\n\nsix months later, drug company representatives gathered at the alliance's headquarters in northern virginia, for a dea strategy task force meeting. the companies included mckesson, cardinal and amerisourcebergen, along with several other distributors, including h.d. smith.\n\nthe representatives identified three areas of attack, according to an email written by h.d. smith senior vice president tom twitty on dec. 12, 2013, and recently unsealed in the case.\n\ntwitty told his bosses that the industry representatives had agreed to work together and discussed ways to prepare for blowback on the marino/blackburn bill, which was about to be introduced on capitol hill. they also decided to use material from apco worldwide, the company that created the crisis playbook, to conduct a targeted media outreach campaign. they agreed it was time to craft industry responses to push back against negative news stories.\n\nmy sense was that all were pretty passionate about going after this, except cardinal, twitty wrote in the email. more to come.\n\ntwitty declined to comment about the meeting. so did cardinal. h.d. smith has since been acquired by amerisourcebergen.\n\nan executive at distributor h.d. smith wrote to his bosses after executives from several companies gathered for a meeting on dea strategy.\n\ntwo months later, on feb. 18, 2014, marino and blackburn introduced legislation on capitol hill that would redefine the law regulating suspicious orders filled by drug companies.\n\nthe initial version of the legislation was written by barber, according to an internal justice department document. barber, the onetime dea legal counsel who had worked alongside rannazzisi, was representing some of the biggest names in the drug business, including cardinal. he gave the industry intimate knowledge of the dea's strategy.\n\nbarber, now a senior vice president at cardinal, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nthe professional credentials and personal character of the cardinal executives named in the reporting are unassailable and the company stands behind both their service to our country, and to cardinal health's commitment to work hard every day to be part of the solution, a cardinal spokeswoman said in a statement to the post.\n\nthe unsealed court records show marino reached out to cardinal, which was in the process of pushing for the legislation.\n\none of our member companies had been contacted by mr. marino, said kelly, the top lobbyist for the alliance, which by then had changed its name to the healthcare distribution alliance (hda).\n\ndo you know which member company it was? kelly was asked during his deposition.\n\nit was cardinal.\n\nthen they reached out to you and asked hda to participate?\n\nthey did.\n\ndid hda end up providing any drafting on the bill?\n\nwe did participate in that process, kelly said.\n\nthe bill would create a high standard for the dea to meet in order to immediately suspend a drug company's operations, former dea officials told the post. previously, the dea had to show only that a company's actions were posing an imminent danger to public health or safety. the new bill defined imminent danger to mean that a company was creating a significant and present risk of death or serious bodily harm.\n\nformer dea agents and agency lawyers have told the post it would be virtually impossible to show that a drug company thousands of miles from a particular community was posing a present risk.\n\nin the spring of 2014, the alliance finalized preparations for an upcoming congressional hearing on the marino bill. scheduled to testify: rannazzisi, barber and john gray, the president of the alliance.\n\non april 3, a washington lobbying firm provided the alliance with questions for members of congress to ask during the hearing, a common practice on capitol hill but not widely known outside washington.\n\nfreitas, the alliance official, was concerned that the questions could be traced back to the outside lobbying firm, co-founded by carlyle p. thorsen, according to emails unsealed in the cleveland case.\n\nthis is all so sensitive and anxiety levels are high so we need to have some control over how these questions are shared, freitas wrote to thorsen that day.\n\nthorsen, who runs thorsen french advocacy, also preferred to remain behind the scenes.\n\npls scrub my name and source info before they are forwarded, he replied.\n\nthe alliance would go on to pay his firm $140,000 in lobbying fees that year, records show.\n\nthorsen declined to comment.\n\nthe suggested questions for lawmakers to ask included:\n\nwhat efforts is dea engaged in to promulgate clear standards for prescribers, pharmacies, and distributors?\n\nwhat are you doing [to] help well-intentioned registrants determine who they can do business with?\n\non april 7, a house energy and commerce subcommittee held its hearing.\n\namong the questions that blackburn asked rannazzisi:\n\narticulate what the efforts are that the dea is engaged in to promulgate some clear standards for the prescribers, for the pharmacies, for the distributors?\n\nwhat are you doing to help well-intentioned registrants to determine who they can do business with?\n\n(illustration by eddie alvarez/the washington post)\n\n'i applaud your efforts'\n\nan internal email written in 2014 by ann berkey, the then-mckesson senior vice president for public affairs, shows how the company's lobbyists were also working with rep. michael c. burgess (r-tex.), then vice chairman of a house energy and commerce subcommittee.\n\nper our discussion with rep. burgess on saturday, his office called me this afternoon before the hearing and asked me for questions he could ask dea, berkey wrote in the email disclosed in an unsealed deposition.\n\nberkey, who has retired from mckesson, declined to comment.\n\nburgess also declined to comment.\n\nthe dea and the justice department opposed the measure.\n\ngray, the president of the alliance, wrote a memo saying he had conversations with numerous members of his group, along with select hill staff. members of the alliance noted that the dea believed the bill would be tying the agencies [sic] hands, according to the memo disclosed in an unsealed deposition.\n\nwithin a few months, the first bill died in a house committee.\n\nsoon after, marino and blackburn introduced a second version, along with 11 co-sponsors.\n\nthis version also would have made proving cases more difficult for the dea, according to former federal officials. it defined imminent danger as a case in which a company intentionally distributed or dispensed drugs in a manner that poses a present or foreseeable risk of serious adverse health consequences or death.\n\nthe bill also would require that drug companies be given an opportunity to file corrective action plans, which would delay any enforcement actions by the dea.\n\nin july 2014, after the house passed the bill, then-attorney general eric h. holder jr. publicly came out against it.\n\nhe said it would severely undermine a critical component of our efforts to prevent communities and families from falling prey to dangerous drugs. leonhart, then the dea administrator, vehemently opposed the bill, according to rannazzisi and other dea officials.\n\nthe bill died in the senate.\n\nin september 2014, marino and blackburn accused rannazzisi of trying to intimidate the united states congress during a july 2 conference call with congressional staffers. they said rannazzisi told them you'll be protecting criminals with the bill.\n\nthe two lawmakers asked the justice department's inspector general to investigate rannazzisi, who denied their accusation. the investigation came to nothing, but rannazzisi said it derailed his career.\n\nin january 2015, marino and blackburn introduced a third version of the bill in the house. the next month, sen. orrin g. hatch (r-utah), the powerful chairman of the finance committee, introduced it in the senate. the bill was called s.483.\n\non sept. 28, 2015, gray issued a directive to the members of the alliance during a board of directors meeting, according to the unsealed court records. item number 1 on the agenda: exhaust all efforts to secure passage of s. 483.\n\nthis bill also created a high bar for action, according to a former senior justice official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. the measure defined imminent danger as a substantial likelihood of an immediate threat that death, serious bodily harm, or abuse of a controlled substance will occur.\n\ndea officials still did not want the bill but felt there was too much momentum for it in congress, the justice official said. dea officials said the bill, which removed the word intentionally and replaced present with immediate, was a less bad option, the justice official said.\n\nfor those reasons, the dea did not raise a red flag with justice, the official said. the post has previously reported that a white house official, speaking anonymously, said that neither the dea nor the justice department raised objections to the bill.\n\non march 17, the senate passed the measure by unanimous consent. the house followed weeks later. not one lawmaker opposed it.\n\nan email from a purdue pharma executive to colleagues that described the company's role in the bill's development.\n\nthe bill is one we have been working on with hdma and [the national association of chain drug stores] for the past two years, burt rosen, purdue pharma's vice president for government affairs, wrote that evening in an email to his colleagues that was unsealed in the cleveland case. purdue was very active in influencing the ultimate definition of an 'imminent danger to the public health or safety.' \n\nrosen declined an interview request. josephine martin, a spokeswoman for purdue pharma, declined to discuss rosen's email and said no one from the company would comment because of the pending litigation in cleveland.\n\nthe change in position at justice and dea came after a change in leadership at the two agencies.\n\nattorney general loretta e. lynch's justice department did not stand in the way of the marino bill. (bill o'leary/the washington post) chuck rosenberg did not oppose the measure when he was acting administrator of the dea.

(bill o'leary/the washington post) chuck rosenberg did not oppose the measure when he was acting administrator of the dea. (brendan smialowski/agence france-presse/getty images)\n\nholder's successor, loretta e. lynch, has never publicly explained why the justice department switched its position.\n\nleonhart's successor, chuck rosenberg, has never explained why he did not oppose the bill.\n\nobama signed it into law on april 19, 2016. he has never spoken publicly about the bill.\n\nlynch, rosenberg and obama all declined repeated interview requests from the post. marino did not return requests for an interview.\n\nblackburn, now a u.s. senator, declined an interview request but provided a statement to the post saying she has worked to fight the opioid crisis.\n\nthe ensuring patient access and effective law enforcement act was passed unanimously by every democrat and republican in the united states house and senate and signed into law by president obama, she said. as a mom and a grandmom, my heart breaks for those touched by the opioid crisis.\n\nsince the first marino bill was introduced, the sponsors and co-sponsors have received $1.4 million in campaign contributions from the industry and the alliance, according to campaign finance records.\n\ntwo months after obama signed the bill, rosenberg testified on capitol hill.\n\nhatch praised the dea's new chief.\n\ni've been told the dea's relationship with supply chain stakeholders has improved since you've taken the helm at dea, hatch said. i want to just say i applaud your efforts on this front.\n\nhatch asked rosenberg how he saw the partnership between the dea and the industry evolving.\n\nthe overwhelming majority, 99 plus percent, are our allies in this thing, rosenberg testified. what we need is them as partners.\n\nmore than a year later, in october 2017, the post and 60 minutes published and broadcast a joint investigation into the circumstances surrounding the passage of the marino bill. several dea officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said they had fought the bill for years but eventually yielded to industry pressure that had created a wave of support for it in congress.\n\nin addition, the news organizations cited a law review article by the dea's chief administrative law judge, john j. mulrooney ii, who wrote that the marino bill imposed a dramatic diminution of the agency's authority.\n\nthe reporting had an immediate impact. marino, who had been nominated by president trump to become the nation's drug czar, withdrew from consideration two days after stories appeared.\n\nthey made it and camouflaged it so well all of us were fooled, sen. joe manchin iii (d-w.va.) said. all of us. nobody knew. that bill has to be retracted, has to be repealed.\n\na spokesperson for blackburn, one of the authors of the bill, said at the time if there are any unintended consequences from this bipartisan legislation . . . they should be addressed immediately.\n\nthen-attorney general jeff sessions said he was dubious about the law when he was a senator and had concluded that it should be changed. forty-four state attorneys general, as well as congressional democrats, also called for repeal. maryland attorney general brian e. frosh said the new law handcuffs the dea.\n\nhatch publicly attacked the reporting by the post and 60 minutes in 2017.\n\nthis wasn't some effort to help drug companies kill people, he said. this was an effort to ensure that dea's efforts . . . didn't end up hurting legitimate patients.\n\nthe industry alliance told the post recently that the law did not weaken the dea's ability to issue immediate suspension orders against drug companies and cited 2017 testimony from demetra ashley, then acting chief of the agency's diversion control division.\n\nashley testified that the law did not hamstring the dea. but she also said she was concerned about the agency's ability to use immediate suspension orders against drug distributors and manufacturers.\n\ndea along with the department of justice supports a change in the legislation, she testified.\n\nsince the bill became law, the dea has issued no immediate suspension orders against manufacturers and one against a distributor in may 2018. the louisiana distributor, morris & dickson, denied the allegations, saying the dea failed to show any evidence of an immediate threat of death, serious bodily harm or abuse — the new standard in the marino bill that became law. two weeks later, the justice department rescinded the order.\n\nin february and march 2018, u.s. assistant attorney general stephen e. boyd wrote letters to congress requesting that the legislation be rewritten.\n\nafter four months of repeated requests, doj finally offered specific feedback to this committee's questions, stating they believe the law does impede the dea's ability to do its job, said rep. greg walden (r-ore.), then chairman of the house energy and commerce committee.\n\nwalden said in a statement thursday that he is still waiting for guidance on how to rewrite the law from the dea.\n\nthe justice department, which oversees the dea, declined to comment. the dea also declined to comment.\n\ndrug distributors defended their role in the law in recent statements to the post.\n\nour nation's drug supply chain is highly complex, so we routinely engage with elected officials and regulators to share our knowledge, experience and occasionally, recommendations, mckesson said. there is nothing inappropriate about companies communicating with policymakers in a transparent, law-abiding way to foster a more effective working relationship with the government.\n\na cardinal spokeswoman said the company supported the legislation, which was passed unanimously in both chambers of congress and signed into law by president obama, because it brought greater clarity to the regulatory landscape.\n\namerisourcebergen said the new law sought to clarify the industry's responsibilities for opioids.\n\nwe worked in conjunction with dea and other members of industry to support its passage while keeping the dea fully empowered, a company spokesman said. to the extent it can be proven there were any unintended consequences of the legislation, including lessened enforcement authority by dea, we support parts of the law being reevaluated.\n\nthe marino bill remains the law

all of that is well and good, but he nears the end of 2019 also as a candidate who has absorbed more criticism than just about everyone else in the democratic field combined, and he has survived the attacks reasonably well. he remains atop the national polls, his support among african americans has proved durable through the year, and while his numbers have slipped in iowa and new hampshire, he is nonetheless in the battle in those two early-voting states.\n\nthe story of biden for most of the year has been written as a glass-half-empty narrative. what about the opposite way of viewing where he stands? i recently asked a democrat who has been involved in several presidential races this question: what if biden were to win the iowa caucuses? his answer: he could run the table.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthis democrat was not predicting it; nor was he ruling it out. but if iowa falls into biden's column, it would instantly change the way everyone looks at the 2020 field and the potential outcomes.\n\nthis has happened before. in december 2003, then-sen. john f. kerry (d-mass.), the perceived early front-runner, was in all kinds of trouble. he was running behind in iowa and new hampshire and was down in the polls nationally. his campaign had been through a staff shake-up that left supporters lacking in confidence. he seemed to be floundering.\n\neven some of kerry's closest advisers were saying privately, just weeks before iowa, that howard dean was the likeliest person to win that state and to become the party's nominee. then kerry won iowa, and the opposition melted away. he went on to win new hampshire eight days later, and he cruised to a nomination he was being given no chance to capture only a few months earlier.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmost remember that kerry surged in the final days of the campaign to overtake dean. in reality, he won iowa in the period the democratic race is now going through, the weeks between mid-november forward to the caucuses. it was more than just a late surge. kerry went all in long before the final weeks — all in financially, organizationally, and with his own time and energy.\n\nin the closing days of that campaign, kerry tried to be in every media market in iowa every day, with the help of a helicopter and a private plane. he also got some breaks toward the end that helped tip the race: a surprise endorsement from a fellow vietnam veteran whose life kerry had saved and attack politics between dean and rep. richard a. gephardt (d-mo.) that hurt both of them.\n\nstrategically, iowa loomed as a more crucial test for kerry than it might for biden. the former vice president continues to hold the lead in south carolina polls, thanks to his support in the black community. that is his potential firewall. biden might be able to survive a loss in iowa, a scenario kerry and his team were not sure his campaign could survive.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin iowa, south bend, ind., mayor pete buttigieg is leading in the polls, but the realclearpolitics average shows the top four candidates bunched between 16 percent and ­not-quite-23 percent. the organization of sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.), who has faltered recently over her health-care plan, among other things, has long been rated the best in the state. sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) nearly defeated hillary clinton in iowa in 2016 and maintains a loyal base that is financially self-sustaining — unusual among the candidates.\n\nbut all have challenges of their own to overcome: can warren rebound? how durable is buttigieg? while sanders has a solid base, how much further can he expand it?\n\nand lately buttigieg and warren have been sniping at each other, sensing perhaps that they share a pool of well-educated white voters. it is a low-level version of the dean-gephardt warfare of 16 years ago, which is good for biden.\n\nthe reason why [biden] hasn't faltered at least at the national level is because there are real, persistent fears about all the other candidates, said a democratic strategist who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share perceptions of the contest.\n\nbiden was the high-profile candidate earlier in the race. now that is less the case, to his benefit. he was high profile not just because he was a former vice president, but also because he entered the race amid controversy, much of it self-generated. his past record came under scrutiny, on issues of race and criminal justice and how he allowed anita hill to be treated during the confirmation of justice clarence thomas. his penchant for putting his hands on people, especially women, forced him to promise to reform.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhe was the target of attacks in the early debates, but he weathered the criticism of summer and early fall. and though his debate performances often left something to be desired, he has managed to maintain a level of support and goodwill.\n\nalso, none of the adversity has caused any public display of staff turmoil or internal warfare in the biden camp. his campaign has remained tight and mostly free of damaging leaks from disgruntled staffers.\n\nthis just reminds me so much about 2004, said another democratic strategist who was involved in the campaigns that year and who also spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment. nobody is crazy about any of the candidates. there's no real movement candidate [like barack obama in 2008]. . . . people are trying to think about what they can accept.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nkerry's message in iowa in the closing 60 days was: don't just send them a message in january. send them a president. a variation of that is biden's message: don't just look for inspiration, look for reassurance. that message could have even greater resonance after the shellacking that a british labour party with a left-wing agenda and left-wing leader suffered thursday.\n\nwhether biden is capable of delivering his message with consistency and clarity could be the difference between winning and not winning in iowa.\n\nit is not known whether biden has committed quite as much to iowa as kerry. he did an obligatory bus tour recently, but the real test will come in january, when sanders and warren and the other senators in the field (minnesota's amy klobuchar, new jersey's cory booker and colorado's michael f. bennet) are tied down with the senate impeachment trial. will he truly gamble on iowa? or will he play it safe, believing he can recoup elsewhere from an early defeat?\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthere has been much discussion about what might happen to biden's candidacy if he were to lose iowa and new hampshire. (the granite state could be challenging given the fact that warren, sanders and now former massachusetts governor deval patrick are all new england neighbors.) the assumption of his rivals is that losing those first two races would put him in a deep hole.\n\nbut consider the opposite: not what biden risks by losing iowa but what he could gain by winning the state. most of the leading democrats could win the caucuses and still face major obstacles. biden stands to gain the most from winning because of the lowered expectations that have come with his slipping iowa poll numbers and the fact that he has broader support nationally than the others.
republicans have similarly returned leaders to power even though some members objected, as in 2015, when rep. john a. boehner (r-ohio) likewise narrowly secured reelection as house speaker, despite dissent.\n\nwhy do the political parties tend to reelect leaders despite persistent opposition from their ranks? parties make a critical trade-off. they empower strong leaders to advance the party's agenda. but those leaders are then harder to remove because they can exploit the position's powers to buy off dissenting party members and keep the job.\n\nthis is what my research shows\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmy research uses game theory to understand why legislators write rules that make their leaders difficult to remove from office. i support my claims by comparing my predictions to patterns of leadership transitions over the past 150 years of congressional history.\n\nparties face a dilemma when writing rules. if the rules weaken leaders — for example, by taking away their right to nominate members for the rules committee — those leaders may not be able to pass important parts of the party's policy agenda. but if the rules make leaders powerful, it becomes harder for opponents to challenge them, even if a large faction prefers new leaders.\n\nsince the early 1990s, both parties have decided in favor of having powerful leaders who are difficult to remove. a variety of factors shape this decision: increasing ideological unity within each party, rising polarization between the parties, the greater importance of the president in making laws and more intense competition between the parties for control of the chamber in the next election.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhow does pelosi maintain power?\n\nhouse chamber and democratic rules grant party leaders influence in virtually every important organizational decision made in the house. since the november elections, pelosi has deployed these resources to chip away at the 66-member faction that initially declined to endorse her reelection as speaker. that included creating a leadership position for rep. barbara lee; reviving the house administration subcommittee on elections for rep. marcia l. fudge to chair; and promising the problem solvers caucus, a group within the house that advocates bipartisan cooperation, that she would let moderates share control over which bills and amendments come to the floor for a vote.\n\npelosi's entrenchment echoes that of boehner (2011-2015): the ohio republican used his control over committee assignments and appointments to various leadership offices to co-opt every gop house member who could plausibly have challenged him for the speakership.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nto be sure, boehner never tamed the fractious members of the tea party movement. he ultimately chose to retire to avoid a government shutdown. still, no credible challenger ever ran against him, suggesting how firmly boehner neutralized potential rivals.\n\npast partisans often preferred weaker leaders\n\nparties have not always resolved the trade-off in this way. throughout most of the 20th century, the rules made party leaders weak enough to remove from office, even though this limited their ability to impose party discipline. as a result, leaders did not enjoy the control over committee assignments, the congressional agenda or the choice of committee chairs that they have today.\n\nad\n\nonly the most exceptional leaders — such as speakers nicholas longworth (r), 1925-1931, and sam rayburn (d), 1940-1961 — won de facto control over these resources. party members recognized their talent as leaders and deferred to their judgment on important organizational matters. with leaders deemed less worthy, partisans successfully deposed, sidelined or pressured into retirement speakers such as charles halleck (r), 1959-1965; frederick gillett (r) 1919-1925; and john mccormack (d) 1962-1971.\n\nad\n\nthis system had serious shortcomings. when party members could not find or agree upon someone who commanded widespread respect within the majority party, the house struggled to pass legislation on important policy priorities. for example, mccormack failed to pass most of the kennedy legislative program in the 87th congress, between 1961 and 1963, despite a large democratic majority.\n\nas parties became more ideologically unified and the competition between the parties became fiercer, this drawback became unacceptable. but a leader who engendered dissent within the party like pelosi likely would not have survived.\n\nad\n\npelosi's concessions are unlikely to undermine her power\n\nif democrats want to change the rules to prevent their leaders from entrenching themselves, they will have to wait until pelosi leaves office. since pelosi was elected house minority leader in 2006, she has used her tremendous power to render harmless the few concessions she has had to make to her party.\n\nad\n\nconsider the rule changes to which pelosi reportedly agreed. the changes guarantee bills and amendments that have substantial bipartisan support will be brought to a vote. pelosi would be obliged to bring to a vote any bill that can attract 290 co-sponsors.\n\nbut that is not a significant change. the rules already enable a coalition of 218 legislators to pass a discharge petition that would compel a floor vote. the new rule would hardly make a dent on the leadership's power to set the agenda. the other promised changes have such large loopholes that pelosi still has full discretion over what will and will not receive a vote on the house floor.\n\nlikewise, pelosi's pledge to retire from the speakership after four more years is only a token concession. in 2022, she will be 82, the oldest person to have ever served as house speaker. she will have served as the top democrat in the house for 19 years. if a democrat is elected president in 2020, pelosi will hold the reins during the typically productive first term and depart just in time to avoid blame for any setbacks during the 2022 midterm election. and if the republican experience provides any guidance, democrats may remove the limit should she have a change of heart.
as he demonstrated at kc, playing a supporting role doesn't mean he will be ignored.\n\nserenade for horace, the first tune played by hayes's quintet, featured hard-swinging solos by every other member: vibraphonist steve nelson; tenor saxophonist abraham burton; pianist anthony wonsey; and bassist dezron douglas. hayes didn't need one himself. his personality was unmissable in his accompaniment, full of thudding bombs on his bass drum, accented change-ups on the snare and a ride-cymbal sound that was as much a lash as a hiss.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhis playing retained that character, and a fair bit of volume, throughout the set. but it never became domineering. instead, it nicely spurred on burton's mighty tirade on, for example, st. vitus' dance. on bolivia, hayes meshed with nelson such that he and the vibist seemed to be playing a duet, the drummer adapting and accenting nelson's rhythms with seeming telepathy. he didn't quite establish that level of rapport with wonsey on what followed — it was clearly a solo, belonging to the pianist — but neither did he miss an opportunity to spice it up, raising the temperature on the ride cymbal and forcing wonsey to respond in kind.\n\neven on the set's ballad, darn that dream, hayes was difficult to miss. he switched to brushes and stayed away from nelson's warm, declaratory lines, but his playing was ever-present, with a sensuous sweep at times offset with pitter-patter. he resumed stickwork on wonsey's solo — burton laying out — making the cymbal shiver, along with this listener's spine.
a: does your proximity to your children's school affect your children's lives as well as yours? you bet! your children's social lives are greatly affected by the distance you must travel, but unlike families from 20 to 30 years ago, you have realized that the replacement for in-person friendships is online interaction. and that's not so great, is it?\n\nfor as long as children have been going to school, they have been traveling significant distances to get there, by walking miles or sitting on long bus rides. as our country and educational system have grown, we have opened and closed schools to accommodate ever-changing populations. and if you choose a private or magnet school, you may face the challenge of a long distance as well as few school friends in proximity.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nback in the day, even children who didn't attend the local school went outside and played with the neighborhood kids. and because children didn't sit on gaming devices, they roamed neighborhoods and found other children to play with, no matter where those children went to school. you had school friends and neighborhood friends, and it worked out nicely for everyone.\n\nnow, throw in a long commute, busy schedules and technology, and your children are doing a lot of sitting around.\n\nso, should you move? it is absolutely an option, but let's look at some others:\n\nhave you considered significantly limiting the technology to allow for other activities? aside from weekends, it isn't like you are trying to fill hundreds of hours between the end of school and bedtime. between apple's newest screen time function (which allows for restrictions on apps and shows time on the device in general) and circle home (which also helps manage phone habits), there are a number of simple and effective ways to control the amount of time spent on apps and games. it isn't easy, but it is possible for your children to spend a little bit of time on technology and then just . . . play. the boredom may be excruciating at first, but your children will find a way to be creative.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhave you considered an activity closer to home? a recreational team? taekwondo? art? swimming? there must be something to do around your house, or something between your house and the school. this would accomplish two things: first, the children would not be on tech 24/7, and second, they would meet other children. finding activities near your home could get pricey and tiring, but it's much cheaper than moving.\n\nor, could you host more play dates at your house on weekends? offer to pick some children up so their parents don't have to drive both ways? i am not suggesting that you need to do this every weekend, but you could create an easy schedule to host play dates at least once a month.\n\ni am also wondering: are you sure you're dedicated to this school for the next six years? if you had asked me where my kids would be in school six years ago, i never would have guessed they would be where they are now. life, learning issues, social issues, giftedness, complete school administration meltdowns — these are just a few challenges you could face that would change the trajectory of your children's academic futures. moving because you are absolutely sure you will be at that school for the next six years is a bit of gamble.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ni am trying to offer alternatives to moving, because that is a big decision. if you create your list of pros and cons and there are numerous reasons to relocate closer to the school that don't have to do with the school, then go for it! you may find a different type of community, more children, more resources and a house that suits your needs, and that could be a great decision for your family. but unless there is a compelling reason (learning needs, specialized schooling, etc.), relocating just to satisfy your children's social needs is a dicey move. zoom out and look at all of the options in front of you, and place your own needs (work commutes, etc.) high on the list.
some, such as sens. josh hawley (r-mo.) and ted cruz (r-tex.), have deep-seated reservations about the conduct of the election and wish to air them. others want to remind the body of allegations they may not believe but which their constituents would like investigated.\n\ni am not persuaded that any state vote, subsequent recount or court challenge should rise to this level of debate. not one court in any case found the threshold level of evidence necessary to establish significant fraud, so i would not vote to object. but i am not a senator or representative. i didn't think there was anything remotely approaching an impeachable offense a year ago, nor did 99 percent of republicans in the congress. but that didn't stop democrats from pressing on with a foolhardy impeachment that cost the country dearly.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nfollowing both the 2004 and 2016 elections, hawley said in announcing his decision to object to the electoral college count, democrats in congress objected during the certification of electoral votes in order to raise concerns about election integrity. he continued:\n\nthey were praised by democratic leadership and the media when they did. and they were entitled to do so. but now those of us concerned about the integrity of this election are entitled to do the same.\n\nhawley is not arguing that his concerns are the same that animated democrats in 2004 and 2016. he is saying his right to object for his reasons is as grounded in law as theirs was, and hawley is correct.\n\nsen. josh hawley (r-mo.) on dec. 30 pledged to challenge president-elect joe biden's victory next week when congress convenes to certify the electoral (reuters)\n\nin the debate that follows the objections, i hope no member of either body airs any false allegation. there are some concerns among conservatives that pennsylvania and wisconsin passed laws and adopted rules for voting that were unconstitutional under their state constitutions. some argue, for example, that the pennsylvania state legislature's authorization of no excuse absentee voting in 2019 violated the keystone state's constitution. but anyone objecting to the way pennsylvania conducted its election needs to look back to 2019, when voting reform passed the pennsylvania legislature and was heralded by republicans in the state legislature. hawley and cruz are both accomplished constitutional lawyers, and i will listen closely to their arguments. but i have not been persuaded yet. indeed, the president's legal team has never articulated in even one state much less the minimum of the three needed to change president-elect joe biden's victory a claim backed by evidence that persuaded a court that any responsible citizen could repeat.\n\nad\n\nad\n\neven still, belief that a debate ought to be held on the topic does not trigger a constitutional crisis or a threat to democracy. those claiming otherwise are overwrought actors in the never-ending trump derangement syndrome-fueled drama among the never trump rump of republicans and deeply partisan democrats.\n\nwe are a constitutional republic. if the individuals charged with casting their vote behave within the bounds of the constitution and their rights and obligations, all is well. any time someone declares a crisis of democracy when they are in fact simply objecting to political actions or rhetoric, they are displaying an ignorance of the constitution and its evolution to the present.\n\nthis state of hyper-alarm — of paul revere-like cries that the democracy is threatened! the democracy is threatened! — is corrosive to civil society. it is fueled by extremes and feeds the media's endless pseudo-panic about everything president trump does or says. just about anyone who has proclaimed a crisis about something in the united states — save the pandemic — is ignorant of law and precedent, sometimes willfully so. they do not understand or refuse to admit that any process allowed by law is never a crisis.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmany are addicted to the fake endorphins of twitter. it isn't sexy to note that not much new is happening or that the new president will be sworn in on jan. 20. it certainly isn't necessary for people who hate trump to declare again that they hate trump and haven't changed their minds. attempts to disqualify some potential future presidential candidates are over the top.\n\npay them no mind. the vote of the electoral college will be certified, and the country will continue. the vaccine rollout will plow forward, and new debates and heated arguments will break out. those clinging to notoriety that trump gave them had best find another source of faux outrage. this one is spent.\n\nwatch opinions videos:\n\nthe u.s. is more politically polarized than ever. the post's kate woodsome asks experts what drives political sectarianism — and what we can do about it.

but late sunday, some on the party's right flank began trying to take corrective action.\n\nleading the charge were two of each chamber's most conservative members, rep. chip roy (r-tex.) and sen. tom cotton (r-ark.). both expressed concern about the legitimacy of the election, but both also argued on federalist grounds that congress has no constitutional authority to try to overturn the results of a given state's certified votes.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nroy's tack was particularly novel. sunday was swearing-in day for members of congress, and roy rightfully noted that many of the members being sworn in ran on the same state ballots that his fellow republicans now say are in question. if president-elect joe biden's win is in doubt, he argued (extremely logically), how can you seat members from those same states? so he forced a vote on seating them. just two republicans voted against seating members in those states, with everyone else apparently accepting their colleagues' wins as legitimate despite their stances on biden's win.\n\nroy's gambit and opposition to the electoral college end-run is particularly notable given his former job: chief of staff to none other than cruz.\n\nthe more significant event on this front, though, arrived sunday night. in a statement, cotton outlined his opposition to the effort to challenge the certification of the votes in states such as michigan, pennsylvania and georgia. the statement was as significant for its argument as it was for the source of it: a very conservative senator who, much like cruz and hawley, is in line for a presidential run in the future. the fact that someone such as cotton would decline to go along with the charade undermines the charade itself and would seem to give other conservatives cover to back off it.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbut just as notable as the symbolism was cotton's actual argument. while his statement legitimized illegitimate concerns about the election, his argument was otherwise sound — both when it came to the unconstitutionality of the effort and, as notably, the political wisdom of it.\n\n … the founders entrusted our elections chiefly to the states — not congress, cotton said. they entrusted the election of our president to the people, acting through the electoral college — not congress. and they entrusted the adjudication of election disputes to the courts — not congress. under the constitution and federal law, congress's power is limited to counting electoral votes submitted by the states.\n\ntrump's allies in congress will mount a final challenge to biden's win during a joint session on jan. 6. but history shows it's destined to fail. (the washington post)\n\nall of this is correct. the law does allow members of congress to object to a state's chosen electors for any reason, but the selection of those electors is up to the states. what's more, the courts have ruled repeatedly on the legitimacy of the claims of widespread voter fraud and irregularities, ruling against the trump team almost without fail and rendering wednesday's challenge of the results something amounting to an extrajudicial attempt to overturn an election.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ncotton's statement then turns to the politics. not only would this be unconstitutional, he argues, but it was also simply a bad idea. cotton notes that the effort is doomed to fail — which it is given the gop's slim senate majority and democrats controlling the house — and argued that it would set a horrible precedent that could come back to bite the gop.\n\ni'll post this section at-length:\n\nfirst, congress would take away the power to choose the president from the people, which would essentially end presidential elections and place that power in the hands of whichever party controls congress. second, congress would imperil the electoral college, which gives small states like arkansas a voice in presidential elections. democrats could achieve their long-standing goal of eliminating the electoral college in effect by refusing to count electoral votes in the future for a republican president-elect. third, congress would take another big step toward federalizing election law, another long-standing democratic priority that republicans have consistently opposed.\n\nthe beginning of this is essentially a slippery-slope argument. while such arguments can be and often are overstated when it comes to their imminence — and this one might suffer a similar defect — there is plenty of truth in it.\n\nas i wrote a couple weeks back, an attempt by members of both chambers to actually overturn an election result by challenging electors would be unprecedented. there have been two instances in which electors were formally challenged by members of both chambers, but neither of them was practically and expressly about changing the results of the election. republicans love to cite sen. barbara boxer (d-calif.) joining house democrats in challenging ohio's electors after the 2004 election, but boxer made clear she was simply taking a symbolic stand and didn't intend to reverse the results of the race.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nand her effort shows what can happen with this kind of thing. much like cotton today, democrats in 2004 fretted at the time about what kind of precedent it might help set. and the chorus of look at what boxer did has at least provided republicans with the veneer of a precedent for their current effort.\n\nwhatever precedent now exists, republicans would be vastly expanding it. not only would this be more than one senator joining the effort, but it would be expressly about changing the election results. what's more, there is virtually zero substance behind it. at least with boxer, election officials in ohio acknowledged problems including long lines, voting machine glitches and voters being inadvertently dropped from the rolls. republicans would be pressing forward with this despite the courts having repeatedly ruled on this dozens of times and found nothing to call into question the election results.\n\nmoving forward, any party that loses a presidential race narrowly but controls both chambers of congress could simply follow the same playbook: raise all kinds of baseless accusations about the legitimacy of the election and then, even if the courts rule that they are indeed baseless, overturn the result. if all you need to change the results is innuendo and suspicion — rather than proof — what's to stop this from happening in a more concrete and decisive way when a party actually has the power to make it so?\n\nad\n\nad\n\nit almost surely wouldn't be the outright and immediate abolition of popular presidential elections or the electoral college that cotton suggests, given there would ostensibly still be lawmakers like him objecting to the gambit on legal and philosophical grounds. but it would certainly move the ball forward in a huge way, given the utter lack of evidence to substantiate the effort.
or would they split up their partnership and head elsewhere?\n\nwhere the pair lands could determine where some of the most popular television — present and future — will live.\n\nif walden and newman have made any decisions, they aren't saying. but the pair, speaking publicly thursday for the first time since the merger, underscored the key issues facing them. in the process they also highlighted how the coupling of entertainment giants may not be as simple as top executives have suggested.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwe remain super-committed to the network and the studio, newman said, addressing reporters at the semi-annual television critics association gathering in a hotel north of los angeles. whether we end up at disney, stay or move on to something else, certainly for the next 12 to 18 months, we're very committed to fox and all the people here, newman said, referring to the period in which regulators will scrutinize the merger before it can be completed.\n\nwalden said that clearly we'll have a decision to make over time, but said she wouldn't speculate right now about leaving or frankly about anything other than the work that's at hand, referring to new winter shows and pilot season. fox has a slew of fresh shows, including the ryan murphy-created procedural 9-1-1, which debuted this week on the network and is produced by the studio, and the music-competition show the four, featuring sean combs and meghan trainor.\n\nnewman began the panel by saying he wanted to show a photo of what he and walden — collectively the pair have more than a half-century of experience at fox — did over the holidays. the screen then flashed an image of the pair with mickey mouse at disneyland. realizing later his joke may carry more import than he intended, newman said. i certainly did not mean to give any hints to what the future would be.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ndisney acquired fox primarily for its rich content pipeline. that gives executives like walden and newman, who are responsible for so much of that content, a lot of leverage in where they'll end up. disney chief robert iger called them both after the acquisition, walden said, presumably to make the case for why they should join disney.\n\nthe choice in a sense comes down to whether a modern tv executive would want to run a network without a studio, as post-merger fox will be, or enter into a much larger fold running a studio, as the pair would do if they went to disney.\n\nor, put another way: content or distribution? (disney has plenty of distribution, of course, but walden and newman likely wouldn't be running it.)\n\nad\n\nwalden said she liked the idea of a network without a studio, since it meant an ability to buy shows from any content provider. (networks with in-house studios sometimes privilege their own shows because the upside is greater.) but she also spoke of the rejiggered fox several times in the third person, which left a more disney-centric impression.\n\nad\n\nin the meantime, the pair need to reassure their own talent not to exit. newman said thursday that no producers at fox's tv studio have out clauses in their deals due to ownership change: i'd be lying if i said there wasn't anxiety that week the deal was announced, newman said. [but] we talked with many of our producers and assured them this will be business as usual for 12 to 18 months.\n\nhe said the company will commission the same number of pilots in the months ahead even as he acknowledged that they were, essentially, operating on borrowed time.\n\nad\n\nwalden said she was initially shocked by news of the disney merger. it just didn't seem to be [what] was on the table. she said that after she talked to iger, though, her worries were assuaged.\n\nthe shock turned into a clear view of what an opportunity this is, she said. disney is a company that has such a deep legacy of storytelling, she added. when the acquisition goes through the company will be in the hands of people who care about storytelling.\n\nad\n\nwalden wasn't the only one surprised. murphy, who has been behind stalwart franchises at fox subsidiary fx including american horror story and american crime story, is another key piece of human capital on the company's lot.\n\nad\n\nat a panel later in the day, he also described hearing about the merger and having concerns. he said iger called him to talk them out.\n\ni said 'the stuff i do is not specifically disney. am i going to have to put mickey mouse in 'american horror story?'  murphy recalled.\n\niger assured him he wouldn't. that placated murphy — to an extent.\n\ni think mr. iger has done a tremendous job of taking over communities and keeping them intact, murphy said.\n\nbut the creator said he's made no decisions about where to go after the merger is complete. i'm sort of interested in what that company is going to look like, he said. i don't think anyone knows.
following sanders's resounding victory in saturday's nevada caucuses, and with polls showing him on the rise, democrats are entering a season of open warfare over whether sanders (i-vt.) is equipped to beat trump in what could be a brutal general election. the senator and his allies insist he could, but his detractors say he is too polarizing to win in november — and could severely cost democrats in congressional or state races if republicans use sanders's self-description as a democratic socialist to paint all democrats as extreme.\n\nthe sanders insurgency is the culmination of grievances that have simmered for the past decade among liberals who say washington has all but ignored the problems of income inequality, health-care access and climate change.\n\na headstrong, 78-year-old senator, sanders has galvanized his supporters with an unwavering commitment to their shared cause and forceful critiques of the billionaire class. they in turn see him, despite his unorthodox persona, as a weapon against a governing class that has failed them.\n\nad\n\nad\n\non the campaign trail, there is an unusual intensity to sanders's performances, reminiscent of the energy that built around trump on the right during his 2016 rise. sanders has emerged as a movement candidate, with his rallies coast to coast drawing thousands of people who wait for hours to see him.\n\nsanders's stump speech is a liberal wish list — passing a green new deal to combat climate change; wiping out student debt and paying for it by taxing wall street; raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour; reforming immigration laws to protect the undocumented; nominating liberals to the supreme court and protecting abortion rights; and, of course, his signature health-care idea, medicare-for-all, which has become a rallying cry on the left.\n\npeople who have been locked out of power are speaking up about corporate influence over the issues that matter in their lives, said abdul el-sayed, a sanders ally and liberal organizer who ran unsuccessfully for michigan governor in 2018. what you're seeing is a necessary and natural readjustment in the democratic party.\n\nsanders's emphatic win in nevada illustrated his potential to expand his coalition far beyond the ceiling of 25 percent or 30 percent that many party-establishment figures and commentators assumed he had. in nevada, sanders won with 29 percent of whites, 51 percent of hispanics and 27 percent of blacks, according to entrance polls of democratic caucus-goers. he won a staggering 65 percent of caucus-goers under 30 years old, and he carried every other age group except for caucus-goers over 65 years old, which former vice president joe biden won.\n\nin nevada, we have just put together a multigenerational, multiracial coalition which is going to not only win in nevada, it's going to sweep this country, sanders said at his rally in san antonio on saturday.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwe are bringing our people together — black and white and latino, native american, asian american, gay and straight, sanders added. we are bringing our people together around an agenda that works for the working people of this country.\n\nsen. bernie sanders supporters gathered in las vegas to celebrate his win in the nevada caucuses. (the washington post)\n\nsanders's dominance among young people, his supporters say, signals his ability to energize this potentially important demographic in november.\n\ndisregard electability, said isabel lozoya, 19, a texas state university student who drove for an hour on saturday to see sanders campaign in san antonio. it should be about picking somebody you really believe in as opposed to somebody you think other people will believe in.\n\nad\n\nthe race for the nomination is just getting started and remains fluid, with a half-dozen contenders still running, although sanders has clear momentum after winning nevada and the new hampshire primary, while finishing second in the iowa caucuses by a tiny margin.\n\nthe next primary is on saturday in south carolina, where the latest polls show biden leading and sanders running close behind. the super tuesday contests on march 3 may be decisive, with voters in california, texas and 12 other states determining approximately one-third of the nearly 4,000 pledged delegates to be awarded by primaries and caucuses.\n\nsome other candidates have stepped up their attacks on sanders in urgent hopes of blunting his rise. pete buttigieg, the former mayor of south bend, ind., has been one of the most aggressive, warning in a speech saturday night that sanders as the party standard-bearer could be disastrous for other democrats on the november ballot.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbefore we rush to nominate senator sanders in our one shot to take on this president, let us take a sober look at what is at stake for our party, for our values and for those with the most to lose, said buttigieg, who ran third in nevada following a win in iowa and a second-place finish in new hampshire.\n\nsanders is bracing for a harsher assault to come from his democratic rivals, including at tuesday night's cbs news debate in south carolina.\n\nto finally be seeing it all start to catch on is powerful, but he knows they're going to throw the kitchen sink at him. he's a realist, said sanders's friend ben cohen, the co-founder of ben & jerry's ice cream and a vermont-based liberal activist.\n\nsome democratic leaders are sounding the alarm about the party's viability in the november election with sanders atop the ticket. house majority whip james e. clyburn (d-s.c.), an ally of house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.), said sunday that sanders could jeopardize the party's house majority.\n\ni think it would be a real burden for us in these states or congressional districts that we have to do well in, clyburn said on abc's this week. if you look at how well we did the last time [in the 2018 midterm elections] and look at the congressional districts, these were not liberal or what you might call progressive districts. these were basically moderate and conservative districts that we did well in.\n\nstill, the rev. jesse l. jackson, the civil rights leader who unsuccessfully sought the democratic presidential nomination in 1984 and 1988 with a message about economic violence, said it is clear to him that the party's liberal wing is asserting control.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthey represent the direction of the party, said jackson, who said he has spoken recently with sanders and sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.). they're speaking to the pain that people feel. and democrats are beginning to understand that democratic socialism doesn't mean eastern european socialism.\n\nrandi weingarten, president of the american federation of teachers, compared the disruptive mood of democratic voters this year to the right-wing tea party movement in 2010.\n\nthey want to shake things up. there is a sense that things are broken, and prioritizing working families has to be at the center of the economic system, said weingarten, whose union has not endorsed a candidate but last week approved its members to support sanders, warren or biden.\n\nad\n\nformer wisconsin governor jim doyle said sanders definitely has tapped into the kind of youthful enthusiasm and idealism that's been at the heart of the democratic party for a long, long time.\n\nad\n\ndemocrats are always best when the race is one in which it's change versus status quo, and the democrats are change, doyle added. you go back historically to roosevelt, to kennedy, to carter, to clinton, to obama. that's how democrats win.\n\nsanders is trying to counter the assumption of many in the so-called democratic establishment that he is too liberal to win a general election.\n\nsome of the folks in the corporate media are getting a little bit nervous, sanders said at a rally sunday afternoon in houston before an enthusiastic crowd of more than 6,200 at the university of houston. and they say bernie can't beat trump.\n\nsanders then listed the results of a few recent polls that he says show him defeating the president head-to-head nationally as well as in such states as michigan, pennsylvania and wisconsin.\n\nsteve rosenthal, a veteran democratic labor strategist who has been focused on mobilizing working-class white voters in a trio of battleground states — michigan, pennsylvania and wisconsin — said it would be foolish to discount sanders's appeal there.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe establishment, which i guess i'm a part of after all these years, seems to know as much about electability as a donkey knows about calculus, rosenthal said. we always get it wrong. . . . the voters are going to tell us who's electable.\n\nrep. ro khanna (d-calif.), a national co-chair of the sanders campaign, said it is expanding its outreach to a broader cross-section of voters.\n\nhe wants to build a coalition like bobby kennedy or f.d.r. did — one that is racially diverse and reaches out to everyone, khanna said. we're going to make a very concerted effort over the next few months to bring all the wings of the democratic party onboard.\n\nad\n\nworking to sanders's advantage is the persistence of several more moderate candidates — biden, buttigieg, sen. amy klobuchar (d-minn.) and former new york mayor mike bloomberg — who appear to be competing for many of the same voters and jockeying to survive as the lone alternative to sanders.\n\nad\n\nfor the proudly liberal and activist wing of the democratic party, sanders's ascent has been welcomed as a potentially historic development. robert reich, the liberal former labor secretary and a professor of public policy at the university of california at berkeley, said this moment can be traced directly back to the 2008 financial crisis, which he called a galvanizing event that led to a surge in anti-establishment fervor.\n\nthis isn't like 1972, when liberal sen. george mcgovern (s.d.) won the democratic nomination and collapsed in the general election against richard m. nixon, reich said. in 1972, america's middle class was still growing. what you see here is a middle class responding to not having a raise in 40 years.\n\neven if he fails to secure the nomination outright at the democratic national convention in milwaukee this summer, sanders is unlikely to go away quietly, aides and friends said. they suggested that sanders's long run and defiant exit from the 2016 race — doggedly carrying on with his calls for a political revolution until the final primary, weeks after hillary clinton had effectively sewn up the nomination — was a revealing glimpse into his character and his desire to move the party to the left.\n\nhe doesn't quit, said sanders confidant and political adviser jeff weaver. he's campaigning to win.
no one else sits in pelosi's chair — no one.\n\nfrom world leaders to wavering lawmakers ahead of big votes, pelosi would guide them off to one of the other three chairs so she could oversee the meeting.\n\nad\n\nit's all part of the effort to convey a return to normalcy, reclaiming the speaker's gavel that pelosi had to hand over to republicans eight years ago. she then fought through four long elections to win it back — the first person in the 230-year history of the house to go eight years between stints as speaker.\n\nad\n\nas she took the oath of office thursday, pelosi re-created the famous scene of january 2007 by again inviting the young children of lawmakers onto the dais. she took over again as the leading democrat up against an unpopular republican president.\n\nbut even her closest allies know this time is so much different.\n\nthe way her office is decorated and arranged may be the only thing that is similar between now and then, rep. jan schakowsky (d-ill.), a close ally of 20 years, said before thursday's swearing-in ceremony.\n\nnancy pelosi was elected and sworn in as speaker of the house on jan. 3, and pledged to pursue transparency, truth and compromise in the 116th congress. (jenny starrs/the washington post)\n\nthe biggest change comes from the person at the other end of pennsylvania avenue.\n\nad\n\nin early 2007, then-president george w. bush congratulated pelosi before a nationally televised audience. he called it an honor to be the first president to begin the state of the union message with these words: madame speaker.\n\nad\n\nthey fought bitterly over the iraq war and anti-terrorism techniques, but bush and pelosi — both children of powerful politicians — maintained a public show of respect during her first two years as speaker (his last two as president). it led to several compromises on domestic issues and allowed them to work hand in hand during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\ntrump hosted pelosi and senate minority leader charles e. schumer (d-n.y.) in the oval office three weeks ago, their first public meeting in more than a year. trump began the meeting without congratulating her on the midterm victory and repeatedly addressed her as nancy. he angered her by questioning whether she would have enough support to win thursday's speaker vote.\n\nad\n\nmr. president, please don't characterize the strength that i bring, pelosi retorted.\n\nad\n\nin her address thursday, pelosi never mentioned trump by name, only referring to the divisive nature of the past two years.\n\nwe renew the great american experiment, pelosi said, signaling the transfer in power would lead to a unifying 116th congress.\n\na few hours later, trump made a surprise visit to the white house briefing room, beginning with some congratulations for pelosi. but he also appeared with border agents and decried the pelosi-led opposition to building a multibillion-dollar wall along the southwest border — a standoff that has led to a partial shutdown of government agencies for the past two weeks.\n\nad\n\ndemocrats saw the move as trump's attempt to cut into pelosi's moment, part of trump's unpredictability that drives the house speaker to sometimes confess she lacks respect for the president.\n\nad\n\nthe difference now between george w. bush and . . . schakowsky said, pausing and refraining from even saying trump's name. it's hard to even plan. you don't know what tomorrow is going to bring.\n\nshe wore an orange nancy button on her coat jacket, the same one that was handed out on the house floor 12 years ago.\n\nbut the vast majority of democrats won office after pelosi surrendered the gavel, so rep. joe kennedy (d-mass.) handed out dozens of new blue buttons that read madame speaker.\n\nad\n\nwhen kennedy handed one to rep. kathleen rice (d-n.y.), signs of pelosi's internal battles appeared. rice had led a centrist rebellion that wanted to block pelosi even after the historic 40-seat gain thrust democrats back into the house majority in november's midterms.\n\nover the next six weeks, pelosi, 78, ground down her opponents and in a final compromise agreed she would not serve more than four more years as speaker.\n\nad\n\nrice posed for a picture with the pin but never put it on.\n\nshe was one of 15 democrats who declined to vote for pelosi, including three who voted present and 11 who were freshmen who flipped previously gop-held seats.\n\nthat left pelosi with 220 votes for the gavel, a handful to spare, but it once again demonstrated that some lawmakers worry about her unpopular image in swing districts.\n\nad\n\nby wednesday, pelosi faced a rebellion on her left. a few prominent liberals opposed a budgetary proposal, arguing that it would impose constraints that could hamstring ambitious legislation on health care and infrastructure.\n\nwhen she first became speaker, pelosi hailed unquestionably from the liberal movement. seizing the moment in 2002, she bucked more senior democratic leaders and led the opposition to the iraq war resolution.\n\nad\n\nit passed, but a majority of house democrats sided with pelosi, and within months they voted her to be minority leader.\n\nthe congressional progressive caucus, home to the most liberal democrats, almost always fell in line whenever speaker pelosi told them it was time to vote. they wanted a publicly funded option as part of the affordable care act in 2010, and over long negotiations by her fireplace or in the long conference table next door, pelosi eventually told them the votes were not there.\n\nad\n\nthey backed the legislation.\n\nbut in today's politics, such compromises might face more revolt. and now, unlike any other time in the past, a group of ambitious young democrats have seats at the leadership table and are angling for even more power, wondering which one will get to succeed pelosi.\n\nas 3 p.m. approached thursday, the pageantry ended and it was time to get down to business. pelosi instructed a deputy to start moving ahead with the first round of legislation.
these talks will have a positive outcome because both sides are trying to deal with the issue in an active and practical manner, said wei jianguo, a former vice commerce minister. i'm not saying there could be positive results; i think there definitely will be.\n\nthat optimism was echoed in washington, where commerce secretary wilbur ross told cnbc that there is a very good chance that we'll get a reasonable settlement that china can live with, that we can live with and that addresses all the key issues.\n\nad\n\nad\n\na potential deal is likely to involve a sharp increase in chinese purchases of american soybeans and liquefied natural gas. it would also probably spur significant changes in structural aspects of the chinese economy that the trump administration says unfairly disadvantage foreign companies in china, ross said.\n\nscott kennedy, a china expert at the center for strategic and international studies, said: the chinese are showing interest by sending a large team and having liu he show up. but that's far from agreeing to major reforms to their industrial policy system, which should be the measure of genuine progress.\n\ninvestors in both countries adopted a wait-and-see approach. china's blue-chip csi 300 index rose by 0.6 percent monday, while in new york the dow jones industrial average was up by about 0.4 percent.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nan american delegation led by deputy u.s. trade representative jeffrey gerrish is in beijing for two days of negotiations, the first face-to-face talks since president trump and chinese president xi jinping agreed dec. 1 to a 90-day truce.\n\ntrump had vowed to increase tariffs on $200 billion worth of chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent on jan. 1. but in return for more chinese purchases of american farm and industrial goods, he said he would give the negotiators until march 1 to reach a deal before raising the tariff rates.\n\ni really believe they want to make a deal, trump told reporters at the white house on sunday. the tariffs have absolutely hurt china very badly.\n\nad\n\nmuch has changed since trump and xi met on the sidelines of the group of 20 meeting in argentina last month.\n\ntrump would probably like something he can point to as a win, even if it's not substantive, amid the wall and government shutdown chaos, said ben cavender, an analyst at china market research group in shanghai. and in china, there are definitely feelings of concern about the stability of the economy.\n\nad\n\ntrump has repeatedly said that china is desperate to strike a deal because its economy is slowing while the united states continues to power ahead. on friday, the labor department said employers added a better-than-expected 312,000 new jobs in december, buttressing the president's view.\n\nthe chinese are very eager to de-escalate the trade war because they're worried about the domestic economic situation, said trey mcarver, co-founder of trivium china, a beijing-based consultancy.\n\nad\n\nmost independent economists expect china's growth rate to fall to about 6 percent this year, the lowest since 1990.\n\nto counteract the slowdown, the people's bank of china said friday that it would inject about $117 billion into the economy by reducing the amount of money that financial institutions must hold in reserve.\n\nad\n\nthe government is also pouring more than $125 billion into new rail projects in a bid to spur growth.\n\nforeign ministry spokesman lu kang dismissed concerns about the chinese economy. we have adequate resilience and potential, and we have firm confidence in the long-term sound fundamentals, he said at a news briefing monday.\n\n\n\nthe global times, a nationalist state tabloid, said china is not on the brink of surrendering. it would be unrealistic to expect china to wave the white flag to the u.s., it wrote in an editorial monday. we would have done it already if we had plans to.\n\nboth countries have suffered turmoil in their stock markets. recent reverses on wall street have erased one of trump's principal talking points.\n\nad\n\nboth markets are facing downward pressure, and that would create additional incentive to resolve the dispute, said wei, the former vice commerce minister, who is now vice chairman at the china center for international economic exchanges. over the past year, the main chinese stock gauges have lost about one-quarter of their value, while the dow has dropped 7 percent.\n\nad\n\nalthough china has pledged to increase its purchases of american goods to help narrow the $375 billion u.s. trade deficit, this would not address the structural causes for the imbalance. washington has demanded that beijing level the playing field for american companies by granting greater access to the chinese market, protecting u.s. intellectual-property rights and cutting down on unfair government subsidies for chinese firms.\n\nbefore this week's talks, china made gestures to show that it is serious about committing to reforms — unlike in past rounds of negotiations, when it waited before talks ended to take action, said jake parker, vice president at the u.s.-china business council.\n\nad\n\nin recent weeks china has released a new draft foreign investment law that bans chinese companies from forcing foreign partners to hand over their technology secrets and prohibits government officials from illegally interfering with foreign companies' operations, practices that have long riled western firms. china has also resumed purchases of u.s. rice and soybeans.\n\nad\n\nthere are positive signals of what we'd like to see on the implementation side, parker said. we're cautiously optimistic.\n\nnow, the question is not only whether china and the united states can reach a satisfactory deal this week on a list of deliverables but also how to make sure china keeps its promises. the big sticking point is going to be what does enforcement look like? said cavender, of china market research group.\n\nad\n\nsince last year, u.s. officials have proposed a framework to hold china accountable, possibly with a quarterly review process, but the details have yet to be thrashed out.\n\nif there is progress at these talks, u.s. trade representative robert e. lighthizer and china's liu are expected to meet in washington as soon as next week.\n\ntrump could also get involved by the end of the month. he is expected to travel to the world economic forum in davos, switzerland, which starts jan. 21. china's foreign ministry confirmed monday that vice president wang qishan will attend. analysts say the two could meet to try to inject momentum into the negotiations.\n\nad\n\nbut yao xinchao, a professor of trade at the university of international business and economics in beijing, said both sides will remain suspicious of each other.\n\nad\n\nas long as trump is in office, nothing is for certain in china-u.s. relations, he said. he is quick to make promises and even quicker to break them. americans might doubt the sincerity of the chinese, but i think the opposite is also true.
a significant boost for biden came sunday evening, when former south bend, ind., mayor pete buttigieg — one of his rivals for moderate votes — ended his campaign with a speech that, while not an endorsement, echoed biden's arguments for consolidating behind him.\n\nad\n\nseveral influential democrats from super tuesday states also gave biden a lift on sunday as they announced their support, including former senator barbara boxer of california. in virginia, rep. jennifer wexton — who won her suburban district in 2018, turning the seat blue for the first time in 38 years — endorsed biden, calling him a steady, empathetic leader.\n\nad\n\nwexton's nod came after other prominent virginia democrats such as sen. tim kaine, former governor terry mcauliffe and rep. robert c. bobby scott endorsed biden — a reflection of the urgency in the party's establishment to counter the rise of sanders, a self-described democratic socialist.\n\nbiden's efforts are rooted in his campaign's belief that he needs to use the burst of momentum and attention from south carolina to rally democrats to his side before tuesday's elections, when 14 states and one territory will vote to award 34 percent of the convention delegates. biden has lagged behind rivals in organizing and fundraising for months.\n\nad\n\nbiden attempted to make up for past deficiencies with a round-robin set of television appearances in which he contrasted his centrist approach with sanders's pitch for a federal overhaul, which centers on a move toward a single-payer health-care system.\n\nad\n\npeople aren't looking for a revolution, biden said on cnn's state of the union. they're looking for results.\n\non nbc's meet the press, the former vice president boasted of the gains already seen by his campaign, which has struggled since its start to keep pace with better-financed candidates.\n\na lot of supporters stepped up the last 24 hours; we raised over $5 million, biden said.\n\nwhile saturday's south carolina's primary was a thunderclap — biden decisively won the contest, in which african american voters had a significant say for the first time this election season — it provided a crucial affirmation of his candidacy rather than a guarantee of coming success. sanders is polling strongly in many super tuesday battlegrounds, and former new york mayor mike bloomberg has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising in those states.\n\nsens. elizabeth warren (mass.) and amy klobuchar (minn.) and rep. tulsi gabbard of hawaii remained in the democratic race on sunday night. but throughout the day, there was pressure on buttigieg and klobuchar, in particular, to consider ending their bids after they struggled in south carolina and the nevada caucuses to expand their appeal among minority voters. liberal investor tom steyer dropped out of the contest late saturday.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthose conversations — a flurry of phone calls and meetings — rippled with political calculations as top democrats mapped out the brutal stretch ahead.\n\nfor many biden allies, bloomberg — the billionaire centrist whose name will appear on ballots for the first time tuesday — remains the biggest headache, and they are hopeful that he may soon decide to bow out. on sunday, they passed around a clip from msnbc in which david plouffe, barack obama's 2008 campaign manager, said, the reality is bloomberg needed biden to lose south carolina to have any chance.\n\nbloomberg is the one in focus because he has the resources to go on indefinitely and compete and divide the center-left vote with biden, said david axelrod, a senior adviser in the obama white house.\n\nad\n\nalthough biden's campaign would welcome a narrowed field, several allies are also informally telling allies of klobuchar and warren to consider staying in the race until tuesday night, to deny sanders a major delegate haul in the super tuesday states of minnesota and massachusetts, according to three people briefed on the talks who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly.\n\nad\n\nin the arcane process that democrats use to pick nominees, delegates are awarded proportionally to any candidate who hits a threshold of 15 percent of the vote. those rules put a premium on candidates who have broad support to win statewide, which determines a portion of the delegates, and also win individual congressional or state senate districts, which account for the rest. and the setup benefits campaigns that can pinpoint the areas where they can either win a few extra delegates — or potentially deny an opponent from doing so.\n\nfourteen states and one u.s. territory will hold nominating contests on tuesday, to award about one-third of the 1,991 delegates needed to clinch the nomination. tuesday's states also include arkansas, maine, utah, oklahoma and colorado.\n\nad\n\nafter winning 60 percent of the african american vote in south carolina, biden's super tuesday outlook is best in states where those voters represent a high percentage of the democratic electorate, such as alabama.\n\nad\n\nonce things start settling, you'll see that joe biden will overwhelmingly take more delegates, frank love, the arkansas state house minority leader, predicted sunday, as biden's wife, jill, campaigned in north little rock. the core reason, he added, was that biden was the partner of the greatest president of our generation and is ready to defeat trump and pick up that obama legacy.\n\nsanders's campaign aides say that he is ready to make gains with younger, more liberal african american voters in states such as north carolina and have argued that south carolina is older and more moderate than most of the states voting on tuesday.\n\nwait until you see what happens in other states, said sanders deputy campaign manager ari rabin-havt. transmuting a population, one state's population to every state in the country, is a mistake.\n\nbloomberg has attempted to make inroads with african american voters but has encountered continued problems over his past support of stop-and-frisk, a police strategy that opponents say is a form of racial profiling. before announcing his candidacy, he apologized for defending the practice.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nas bloomberg spoke sunday in selma, ala., at brown chapel ame church, about 10 people stood and silently turned their backs to him. they returned to their seats after the former mayor stepped away from the podium. the incident caused a stir in the church, but bloomberg continued his remarks without interruption. other attendees continued to listen, some cheering and applauding.\n\nbiden and sanders are now running near polar opposite campaigns. the once-ailing biden operation is trying to ride the wave of momentum and attention as he reminds voters of his work alongside obama and warns them of the perils of backing sanders.\n\ni have gotten major, major things done. i'm able to cross the aisle and get things done. and so i think it's about who can not only win, bring along a senate and keep a house, the house of representatives, but who can then get something done, biden said on cnn.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhe said on abc's this week that, while it would be difficult, he could make up a lot of ground in california by tuesday. super tuesday is not the end; it's only the beginning, he said.\n\nsanders, meanwhile, is roaring before thousands at rallies and is counting on his grass-roots organizing in states such as california and texas, which he has been building since his insurgent 2016 campaign.\n\nsanders raised $46.5 million in february, his presidential campaign said sunday, a huge sum that could help sustain him in a lengthy battle for the nomination. the senator from vermont won nominating contests in nevada and new hampshire last month before placing a distant second in south carolina.\n\nad\n\nsanders, who has sharply criticized biden for his past backing of military intervention in iraq and his support of free trade, attacked biden on sunday as an ally of the wealthy and centrist democratic establishment that he is trying to overhaul.\n\nad\n\nspeaking at a rally in san jose on sunday, sanders said: at a time when the american people are sick and tired of endless wars, of the terrible death rate we have seen from these wars, the trillions of dollars we have spent on these wars, please do not forget joe biden voted for the war in iraq.\n\nwe've got to be honest, sanders told the crowd. which campaign can beat trump? his supporters chanted bernie! bernie!\n\nmost national democrats treaded carefully as they approached the candidates and senior aides to struggling campaigns, knowing that the decision to drop out is deeply personal as well as political. with obama on the sidelines and former nominee hillary clinton also quiet, there was also open debate about who, if anyone, had enough political capital to force an exit.\n\nformer democratic national committee chairman howard dean, recalling his past presidential campaign, said the process can be painful for candidates who feel they owe it to their supporters, many of whom put their whole lives on hold, to carry on.\n\nand in interviews with more than a dozen operatives, lawmakers and campaign aides, who requested anonymity to speak frankly, it was clear that house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) and obama, among others, are reluctant to do anything at this point that would seem heavy-handed.\n\nbiden, in the abc interview, dismissed the notion that obama's lack of endorsement leaves him vulnerable.\n\nno, it isn't hurting me, and i don't think it's time, biden said. he and i have talked about this in the very beginning. i have to earn this on my own.\n\nwarren, for her part, showed no signs of relenting. her campaign announced that she raised $29.3 million last month, more than doubling her january haul thanks to a boost from her well-reviewed debate turn in nevada — and the campaign increased its advertising spending in super tuesday states to $2.4 million. a pro-warren super pac is also spending millions.\n\nklobuchar's aides and confidants said she was campaigning hard ahead of super tuesday and felt good about her chances in her home state.\n\ni want to go everywhere, klobuchar told a utah television station on sunday.\n\nbuttigieg on sunday met with former president jimmy carter near carter's home in plains, ga. carter, who has been friendly with the 38-year-old democrat, told reporters, he doesn't know what he's going to do after south carolina.\n\nbuttigieg replied, every day, we'll do the math.\n\nhours later, buttigieg dropped out before a rapturous crowd in south bend that chanted 2024! 2024!\n\nthe truth is that the path has narrowed to a close for our candidacy, if not for our cause, he said.
in november, bicycle space closed its adams morgan store, the most high-profile of its three district-based shops. the location — among nearly a dozen vacant storefronts along 18th street nw — is to be filled by wawa, the hoagie-churning convenience store chain.\n\nad\n\nby any measure, the district's economy is roaring, with office and apartment towers mushrooming in newly fashionable neighborhoods. and that makes this phenomenon all the more puzzling: along the city's older corridors — from adams morgan to georgetown to dupont circle — retailers are struggling.\n\nad\n\nwhile new supermarkets and restaurants have proliferated in the district and chains such as target and walmart have opened, independent merchants selling clothing, jewelry, art and other goods are shutting down, consolidating or retreating to online sales.\n\nthey face rising rents and changing consumer tastes — retail pain that is rippling through cities from new york to san francisco.\n\nad\n\nyet the notion that brick-and-mortar retail is at the edge of extinction is premature, said david dochter, a d.c.-based commercial real estate broker. instead, he said, we won't have as many, and the reason is, stores will be used for different purposes — for education, for creating community, for branding and awareness, and for returns.\n\nretail is evolving, he said. no longer is a retail store only for the distribution of a widget.\n\nad\n\nmerchants are seeking new ways to corral shoppers, who may notice that their bank or cable company is offering comfortable seating, gourmet coffee and free wifi. and online retailers such as amazon.com and rent the runway are opening three-dimensional stores.\n\nad\n\nat the same time, merchants who have been pillars of the city's shopping culture are trying to hang on. on the brink of a lease renewal last june, penny diamanti closed her dupont circle shop, beadazzled, which for more than two decades had been a magnet for customers seeking to create their own beaded jewelry.\n\nin addition to her rent tripling during that time span, from $5,000 to $15,000 a month, diamanti said she could not compete with shoppers turning to online jewelers and newly flourishing strips in other parts of the city.\n\nwhen we moved in, connecticut avenue was the place to be in that part of town, said diamanti, whose sister still operates a beadazzled store in falls church, va. but then all the new action started moving over to 14th, and we were just stuck.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ndiamanti said she decided to close after her landlord rejected her request for a reduced rent. six months later, as she focuses on an online importing business and makes her own jewelry, her sign remains over the vacant shop and the entrance has become a place for homeless people to sleep.\n\nless than a mile away, in adams morgan, jim nixon for 11 years owned tora mata, a shop filled with peruvian art, home furnishings and jewelry. nixon closed in 2016 after he said his landlord, sheldon arpad, wanted to raise his rent by more than 20 percent.\n\nnixon's former shop remains empty, alongside two other vacant storefronts arpad owns and across from several more on 18th street nw. a representative for arpad, who lives in florida, declined to comment.\n\nad\n\nnixon said he prefers now to sell online and at pop-up events such as the annual holiday market downtown. this is much less risk than a five-year lease, he said of the fee he pays for his 30-day stall at the holiday market. it's having the freedom to not be under the gun of rent and utilities.\n\nad\n\nthe shuttering of longtime businesses often prompts outrage from loyal patrons. when the adams morgan-based metro k supermarket announced in november that it would close, more than 1,000 residents signed a petition. but the landlord would not give up a demand for a 30 percent rent increase.\n\nthe neighborhood won't be the same without you, a customer wrote on a card taped to the entrance after the grocer closed, a vacancy to be filled by streets market, a regional chain now with six stores, including three in the district.\n\nad\n\nat 11th and g streets nw on a recent morning, jim mathews brought a bouquet of yellow roses to lia escobar, who was behind the counter on her last day at sip of seattle, a coffee nook her family has operated for 22 years. she said they were closing because their landlord refused to grant them anything longer than a month-to-month lease.\n\nad\n\nthis kind of thing infuriates me, said mathews, a regular since 1996. there's a narrative out there that it's inevitable — things change; rents go up. but it's false. it's just a collective decision. this will be replaced by a national chain. and we lose owners who have a very loyal clientele, who worked hard and built a business.\n\nas he said goodbye to the escobars, mathews gave them information about how to open a food truck, something escobar said her family would consider. but she was not so sure about his other suggestion — that they park their truck outside the building where they had their shop and create a logo with the image of a middle finger.\n\nmoving east\n\nthirty years ago, the heart of district's retail was largely georgetown and dupont circle. once-prominent corridors such as seventh street nw, 14th street nw, and h street ne still hadn't recovered from the 1968 riots.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbut the opening in the late 1990s of what is now capital one arena and the convention center triggered a downtown renaissance. over the next two decades, as the city emerged from near bankruptcy, developers descended on u street and 14th and transformed neighborhoods such as shaw, columbia heights, brookland and the wharf.\n\noverall, the vacancy rate in the district's main retail corridors is just above 6 percent — higher than a year ago but below the national average, said dochter, whose firm conducts regular surveys. the vacancy rate has crept upward in neighborhoods such as dupont circle, columbia heights, adams morgan and georgetown, brokers say.\n\neverything is moving east from where it was 10 years ago, said reza sabaii, a commercial real estate broker. the hip and cool people and all the people who want to be hip and cool have left georgetown and neighborhoods like that, and they're coming to 14th and seventh streets. the vacancies in georgetown and dupont and adams morgan are a sign that businesses are unwilling to pay those high rents and want the cachet on the east side.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nstorefronts sometimes remain vacant for years because owners prefer to hold out for a higher rent that will raise the value of their properties, brokers say. that is also the case in areas with new development — h street ne and shaw, for example — as landlords wait for projects to finish to charge more.\n\nthey don't want to settle for a lesser tenant because they're waiting for the better tenants who are right around the corner, sabaii said.\n\nthe type of retail that is available is evolving, too.\n\nthe number of hair and nail salons and barbershops on h street fell from 37 to seven over the past decade, said anwar sa­leem, a salon owner and executive director of h street main street, the corridor's business association. the percentage of businesses that sell neither food nor beverages has fallen from 75 percent to 25 percent, he said.\n\nad\n\nyou need to be able to buy underwear and socks, he said. but most landlords would rather rent to a bar or a restaurant. there's more money in alcohol than in retail.\n\nalbert hillman, the owner of an h street barbershop since the 1980s, said he survived rising rents because he owns his property. he also has adapted to the neighborhood's changing demographics by welcoming newer residents, many of them white, to join a clientele that was almost entirely black.\n\ni'm just thankful i'm still holding on, he said.\n\nretailers are finding ways to cater to consumers seeking more than a simple transaction, brokers say. the xfinity store on seventh street nw now includes a la columbe coffee bar, where shoppers can order croissants while looking at cellphones and flat-screen televisions.\n\nacross the street, steve goldsmith, 33, a software designer, sipped peet's coffee and read at the capital one cafe, which is opening a second cafe in a prime location that the bank purchased in georgetown.\n\nwith ambassadors to offer advice on financial products, the cafes are envisioned as a way for capital one to engage younger customers who largely bank online.\n\ngoldsmith said he was more interested in the caffeine and free wifi and the capital one ski cap he received. i'm always looking for a place i can sit down and work, he said. this makes perfect sense.\n\nmore traditional retailers are also finding ways to adapt.\n\nafter buying pumpernickel's, a chevy chase pizza and bagel shop, a year ago, jim o'brien said, he took the business's space and what was a nearly $10,000-a-month lease.\n\nat $10,000 a month, you must do $1 million in sales each year, he said. that's a lot of bagels at $1.35 a bagel.\n\nhe negotiated an early end to the lease and found an alternative one block north, at arucola, a decade-old italian restaurant. with its kitchen unused in the mornings, arucola agreed to allow pumpernickel's to sell coffee and bagels, an arrangement that began in early november.
another day; another metro derailment, the letter began. many [riders] come to expect these incidents as routine and a normal risk of their commute.\n\ncomstock introduced a bill in congress last month that would provide more long-term funding for metro in exchange significant governance reforms, including the establishment of a reform board and cuts to labor costs. in wednesday's letter, comstock said that monday's derailment at farragut north station, which was preliminary information shows was caused by a cracked rail, is further evidence that dramatic change is necessary.\n\nthere were 63 people on board the train; none were injured.\n\nincidents like the derailment on the red line are another example of the unacceptable condition of [metro] and the dire need for fundamental reform to not only provide more resources, but also truly address the constant dangerous and unreliable conditions that plague the system and result in repeated problems that we have been assured have already been addressed, comstock wrote.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nstrong assurances were made to riders that safetrack would avert these types of accidents, the congresswoman added, yet we continue to see these situations far too frequently.\n\ncomstock said she wants metro to release a number of documents related to the derailment, including records on walking inspections, ultrasonic testing, and geometric measurement testing that took place in the weeks and months leading up to the derailment.\n\nshe also requested copies of the forensic analysis and metallurgic testing of the section of cracked rail that is being shipped to outside experts for examination, as well as documents related to the post-derailment assessment of the 7000-series train that was involved.\n\nad\n\non wednesday afternoon, metro spokesman dan stessel said the agency would respond to comstock's request for documents, though he didn't specify when.\n\nad\n\nwe thank the congresswoman for her leadership on funding for metro and appreciate her concerns regarding monday's derailment, stessel said in an email. we look forward to responding with information as the investigation advances.\n\ncomstock is also taking issue with metro's ongoing advertising campaign for its back to good program, which is focused on improving the reliability of metro's rail cars. the transit agency has received flack from the public — and from members of congress — aimed at the confident tone and steep price tag of the snazzy video and accompanying advertising package. the agency spent $400,000 for the promotional package — though the video itself cost less than $100,000 to produce, metro said last year.\n\nthe ad aired during the second quarter of the college football national championship game earlier this month.
for the nationals, that's significant on a few levels.\n\nthe first is that the franchise has signaled — to its competitors, to its fans and, maybe most importantly, to itself — that life after bryce harper began once the star outfielder passed on the nationals' 10-year, $300 million offer extended in late september. that doesn't mean harper and the nationals won't circle back with each other as the sweepstakes drag into the new year. but it did show that the nationals were ready to build, and build to be competitive, regardless of what happens with harper's free agency.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe second is that moving at such quick pace has, in subtle ways, helped the nationals fill most of their pressing needs as they narrow their focus to a full-time second baseman and additional help in the rotation and bullpen. that says nothing about the viability of each trade and free agent signing. yan gomes and kurt suzuki, with a combined age of 66, still need to show it is smart to pay around $11 million for two veteran catchers who will split starts this year. left-handed starter patrick corbin has to live up to a six-year, $140 million contract, a tall ask for any player. and the other new pitchers — relievers trevor rosenthal and kyle barraclough, and starter anibal sanchez — also have a lot to prove.\n\nbut their aggressive offseason approach produced a snowball effect of sorts, and that has them well ahead of schedule as spring training nears.\n\nwe're very impatient people, general manager mike rizzo said on dec. 1, an understatement that came after the nationals added barraclough, rosenthal, suzuki and gomes, and before they traded tanner roark and signed matt adams and sanchez. we have a wish list, and we try to get things done. when you see something that makes sense for you …\n\nad\n\nad\n\nrizzo did not finish that thought before jumping into why he feels barraclough and rosenthal make sense for the nationals. he didn't have to. when you see something that makes sense for you, you get it done. that is how rizzo and the nationals' front office approached the offseason, which started when they acquired barraclough from the marlins for $1 million of international slot money on oct. 1.\n\ntheir next move, signing rosenthal in early november, likely couldn't have waited much longer. rosenthal finished with 45 or more saves in 2014 and 2015, then was out of baseball last season while he recovered from tommy john surgery. his los angeles workout in late october drew around 40 scouts and, just hours after his fastball reached 98 miles per hour off a mound, the 28-year-old had multiple teams reaching out. the nationals acted fast, offering at least $7 million for 2019 and a 2020 option, and made rosenthal the first free agent signing of the offseason.\n\nrosenthal, 28, was eager to join a team after his year away, making a november deal that much more logical. that was also the preferred route for suzuki and adams, two veterans who did not want to see their free agencies seep into 2019. suzuki wanted peace of mind for both him and his family, and he officially signed with the nationals on nov. 20. adams, who a year earlier had joined the nationals on dec. 22, again avoided stress by signing a week earlier this time around. rosenthal, if anything like his pre-tommy john self, could be the shutdown setup man the nationals have been seeking. suzuki helped the nationals fill a glaring hole behind the plate, and adams provides a left-handed-hitting first baseman to pair with ryan zimmerman. springing into negotiations helped the nationals land each player.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ni think it's huge. for me, the way that my brain and myself worked, the later that i sign the more freaked out i'm going to be, adams said. it's the unknown, being out there and not knowing where you're going to go, how many people you're going to know on that team you sign with . . . so for me, i was lucky and blessed to have the opportunity to be able to sign back with the nats.\n\nnext came the cumulative results, most notably in how adding suzuki and gomes influenced conversations with starting pitchers. corbin called pitching to gomes and suzuki a huge part of his decision to sign with the nationals instead of the new york yankees or philadelphia phillies, even if the $140 million was the most attractive element of the equation. gomes is a heralded pitch framer and suzuki, at 35, is a respected game caller. sanchez, who the nationals signed to a two-year deal on dec. 20, raved about suzuki in a phone call with reporters and said the pair has a really good relationship between pitcher and catcher. they played together with the atlanta braves last season and sanchez made tweaks to his pitching approach that turned his career around. the 35-year-old noted that suzuki was involved in everything, in every change that i made and everything that we worked for.\n\nthis all matters, for what has happened and what will happen next, as the nationals look to finish off their to-do list before looking toward 2019. washington has downplayed its pursuit of harper ever since principal owner mark lerner took to the radio in early december and said, i don't really expect him to come back at this point. i think they've decided to move on. but a club source confirmed wednesday that there have been multiple meetings between harper and the team, leaving open the possibility of a return.\n\nwhen asked about harper at the winter meetings in early december, rizzo indicated that the team would not meet with harper while in las vegas for the event. rizzo did, however, maybe sneak it in a small pitch most other teams could use at that point, made possible by the nationals' unwillingness to wait for the market to dictate their plans.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nnothing's changed with harp since the end of the season except that i think we're a better team than we were at the end of the season, rizzo said. but we're not closing the door on anything.
president-elect joe biden has said he wants to see most u.s. schools reopen in the first 100 days of his administration, which begins jan. 20. and congress recently approved a coronavirus relief package that includes $54 billion for k-12 schools, which could help districts cover expenses for measures aimed at stemming the spread of the virus in schools.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe centers for disease control and prevention has recommended that states prioritize teachers as part of the second group of people eligible for vaccines — but each state will make its own decision, and there are big differences in approach among governors.\n\nin indiana, teachers in rural knox county began receiving the vaccine dec. 28 — not because they were prioritized over health-care workers and the elderly but because there were extra vials, education week reported. and in evansville, ind., a hospital had removed some vials out of the freezer where they must be kept and the vaccine had to be given that day, so teachers were put on the list, the evansville courier & press reported.\n\ni was so excited because, to me, it was light at the end of a very long tunnel, susan kemper, a fourth-grade evansville teacher was quoted as saying. we're finally going to be able to get our lives back.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin colorado, school nurses in the cherry creek school district got the vaccine on friday, with the same expected for teachers by mid-january, the denver post reported.\n\nbut in florida, teachers are upset that their governor, republican ron desantis, has declined to prioritize them for the vaccine even though he ordered all schools to reopen last fall and threatened to withhold millions of dollars in state funding if they didn't.\n\nkalyn lee, a literacy coach at miami edison senior high school, said teachers are upset that they have been forced back into classrooms without being vaccinated. she sees hundreds of students a day as she goes class to class providing literacy support, she said, and she feels exposed.\n\nad\n\ni'm very, very, very afraid, she said in a recent interview. this is real. my boyfriend's parents both had covid-19. both were hospitalized. my first cousin, she had covid. her boyfriend had covid. one of my best friends has covid right now. i have a lot of teacher friends who are currently quarantined. this is not one of those things, 'oh, don't worry, it's going to be fine.'\n\nad\n\nthe orlando sentinel quoted wendy doromal, president of the orange county classroom teachers association, as saying: teachers want to be vaccinated, the vast majority of them, and we think they should be … [desantis] wants the school doors to be flung open, and he doesn't want to provide the protection.\n\nin el paso, there is a push to reopen schools, but teachers are not being prioritized for vaccinations. in a virtual town hall last week, vince sheffield, the interim superintendent of the el paso independent school district, said he has asked gov. greg abbot (r) to move teachers up on the priority list. but the governor has not.\n\nad\n\nin a recent interview, anthony s. fauci, the nation's top infectious-disease official, has said it may not be until fall 2021 that schools can get back to some form of normality.\n\nad\n\nin a dec. 18 interview with timothy p. white, chancellor of the california state university system, fauci, director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, said he will encourage the prioritization of teachers when he becomes biden's chief pandemic adviser in a few weeks.\n\nit is extremely important to get children back into school and kept in school, and the idea of vaccinating teachers is very high up in the priority as well as surveillance in the schools so you can get a good feel for the penetration of infection, which hopefully will continue to be low and not have to shut down every time you get a student that's infected, he said.\n\nad\n\nhe said he hopes that by the time the 2021-2022 school year begins this coming fall, enough people will have been vaccinated. i think we could be in good shape, and so i am cautiously optimistic that we can do that and get back to some form of normality, he said.\n\nin california, gov. gavin newsom (d) on dec. 31 announced a plan for reopening elementary schools that would give vaccine priority to teachers and said he wants the youngest students and those with special needs back in classrooms in february. he said he would ask the legislature to spend $2 billion to help schools take the steps necessary in schools to get them to reopen.\n\nad\n\nbut austin beutner, superintendent of the los angeles unified school district, which serves nearly 600,000 students, said in a recent interview that vaccines alone will not ensure that schools can automatically reopen, if community transmission rates remain high. even vaccinated people can spread the coronavirus, he said, and it will take a long time for everybody to get vaccinated.\n\nad\n\nso we are a long way from having students and staff in school, he said.\n\nrandi weingarten, president of the american federation of teachers, the second-largest teachers union in the country, agreed in a recent interview that it would take time to vaccinate all teachers, and she said some teachers should get inoculated before others.\n\nteacher vaccinations and ultimately student vaccinations, when it is found to be safe, should be aligning with the reopening of schools, weingarten said. to the extent that you are focused on reopening elementary schools, teachers in those places should be offered the priority of places in january and february. there is that alignment. we understand that teachers and students should have the added need and protection more at the front end of the prioritizing after health-care workers and the elderly, who are so at risk.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbut you are not going to vaccinate 3 million people at the same time, she said, referring to an estimate of the number of working full-time teachers. so the priority should be the schools that are reopening and the educators that are going into those schools.\n\nzachary patterson, a student member of the board of education in the san diego unified school district, said neither the new stimulus money nor the vaccine are silver bullets to reopening schools\n\na full reopening will be most strongly correlated to infection rates, he said in an email. obviously, the biggest determination in reopening has been the safety of teachers, students and family. while vaccine distribution may be occurring, it is difficult to tell to what extent teachers will be prioritized.
but the nascent international swimming league [isl] has faced harsh resistance from fina, the sport's international governing body, which has blocked the start-up's efforts by threatening swimmers' olympic eligibility. the dispute has prompted a federal antitrust lawsuit, sparked discussions around the pool deck about labor organizing and has cast a spotlight on the tilted economics that long have ruled the sport.\n\nswimmers have the same level of talent like nba players or soccer players, sometimes even more. but a swimmer who has talent like lebron james receives 1,000 times less money, said konstantin grigorishin, the isl's chief backer and financier. we have to fix this.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nfina is, in effect, the gatekeeper for the olympic games, setting standards and staging championship events for six aquatic sports, such as water polo, diving and swimming. the organization has not endorsed the isl and has emphasized to its member nations that athletes who compete in unsanctioned events face suspensions that could imperil their olympic dreams.\n\nafter fina effectively blocked a test event from taking place last year in turin, three swimmers — americans tom shields, michael andrews and hungarian katinka hosszú, a three-time olympic champion — filed a proposed class-action lawsuit in the u.s. district court, accusing fina of operating a monopoly and choking off any potential competitors.\n\nthe lawsuit says fina unlawfully wields its dominant influence to prevent outside organizations from expanding opportunities for hundreds of world-class swimmers and their millions of fans across the world.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nfina understands that a free market for top-tier international swimming competitions would preclude it from continuing to keep for itself the lion's share of profits earned from the swimmers' skills, the swimmers state in their complaint.  … fina's power over the swimming world is so strong that it will crush isl, and destroy the careers of swimmers who want to compete in isl meets.\n\nfina has yet to file a response with the court, and officials with the swiss-based organization did not respond to multiple messages seeking comment. the organization said in a statement last month: as always, fina remains open to proposals that would genuinely enhance — rather than conflict with — the current and planned competition calendars, providing further opportunities for aquatics athletes, and ideally in a manner that benefits the whole sport.\n\nthe isl has designs on nearly 300 elite swimmers competing for 12 teams; six would be based in the united states with one tentatively planned for washington. league officials have promised more than $3 million in prize money and aim to stage 15 events in their inaugural season. but the risk of upsetting fina and losing olympic eligibility has been a major hitch in the league's planned launch.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthey basically have a rule for us all: you're gonna party with us or you're not going to party, shields said in an interview. and that's not the way it should work.\n\n'fina's captives'\n\ngrigorishin is the leading shareholder of the energy standard group whose fortune was once estimated at more than $1 billion by forbes. he took an interest in swimming when his son began competing in 2008. he recalls watching fina's 2013 world championships in barcelona and realizing the sport wasn't coming close to its potential.\n\nit should be one of the most popular events in the world and nobody understands or knows this, just specialists and relatives of swimmers, he said in a telephone interview. boring ceremony, format, bureaucrats giving speeches. i started to wonder how is it possible to change this?\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhe tinkered with youth meets and test events, settling on a team-based format and an annual series of events that would pit the world's best swimmers against each other in the same pool. grigorishin initially planned a 2018 meet in las vegas, but in response to pressure from fina, usa swimming pulled out of negotiations, according to the lawsuit.\n\nthe lawsuit cited a june 2018 letter from usa swimming to isl officials that said, we want the assurance that fina is willing to work with isl before we commit.\n\na usa swimming spokeswoman declined to comment on the pending lawsuit. usa swimming officials have endeavored to provide u.s. athletes with factual information regarding the current state of the competition, and any possible associated sanctions as shared by fina, the organization said in a statement last month.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nfina has told national governing bodies that swimmers could be punished by competing in a non-sanctioned event. they've highlighted bylaws that call for a one- to two-year suspension for participation in unauthorized meets. that timeline would include this year's world championships in south korea and possibly the tokyo olympics next summer.\n\nnations took immediate notice. after plans for a u.s. meet fell through, isl officials began working with the italian swimming federation on a proposed event in turin. according to the lawsuit, more than 50 swimmers signed up to compete, but fina coerced its member federations into agreeing to, and participating in, an overt effort to shut down the turin event by threatening the swimmers with a ban. the turin meet was canceled in november, and the swimmers filed their lawsuit alleging antitrust violations on dec. 6 in the northern district of california.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nas fina's captives, swimmers can never compete in any event to earn money for themselves without fina's advance approval, the complaint states.\n\nfina officials have said little publicly about isl but have taken issue with the suggestion that they've threatened to discipline swimmers. in a news release last month it said: fina merely stated that results achieved in competitions for which approval and sanction were not duly sought and obtained would not be recognised.\n\nthe lawsuit also alleges that fina demanded $50 million from isl and complete control over most of the facets of the isl league, including its name. fina disputes this characterization and says the isl is the one that proposed the eight-figure fee. grigorishin says he isn't sure why the isl should pay fina anything if the governing body won't provide tangible services that boost its events.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nyou have to bring some additional value, he said. not just give some shares so you will not be an obstacle. otherwise it's extortion.\n\nanother series\n\nfive days after the lawsuit against fina was filed, the governing body announced plans to launch its own series of meets for high-level swimmers. many details haven't been made public, but fina plans to stage a three-leg competition this spring, promising nearly $4 million prize money and appearance fees. the series will be team-based, invitation-only and include olympic and world champions.\n\nby creating this additional elite competition, fina will generate a true swimming show, where sport presentation and stars' promotion are key concepts for a successful meet, fina president julio c. maglione said in a statement.\n\nad\n\nfrom the isl's perspective, fina's new series serves as further evidence the governing body intends to choke off any other entities.\n\nad\n\nnow they prove they have a monopoly and that they threaten and destroy competition because they've copy-and-pasted our format, grigorishin said.\n\nfina's recent actions have spurred plenty of discussion in swimming circles, and 30 or so swimmers assembled last month in london to discuss organizing as a unified athletes' association — not technically a labor union because of the international nature of swimming.\n\nat issue for many is the finances associated with the sport and whether money is getting fairly distributed. the lawsuit cites fina's reports that show it took in $118 million in 2016 and '17 revenue and gave $15 million (12.5 percent) to athletes in the form of prize money.
the new e.u.-china deal, which the european parliament still must ratify, is a diplomatic coup for china. it is also an indicator that president trump's belligerent america first approach may have done lasting damage to transatlantic relations. first, mr. trump alienated traditional u.s. allies in europe by accusing them of treating us very badly in trade — even worse than china, he asserted at one point. then, he abated tariffs on beijing in return for a phase one market-access deal at the beginning of this year, giving europe both a rationale and an incentive to do the same.\n\nbrussels seems to have concluded that it must hedge against the possibility the changes mr. trump made will prove at least in part irreversible even after president-elect joe biden takes office. at least that's one way to interpret the fact that the e.u. pressed on with its china deal despite a dec. 21 public invitation from mr. biden's national security adviser-designate, jake sullivan, to early consultations with our european partners on our common concerns about china's economic practices.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe biden administration has to thread a tricky needle if it wants to pivot from president trump's aggressive approach to china. (the washington post)\n\nno western democratic country has clean hands when it comes to economic relations with china; all have pursued self-interest at the expense of at least some professed principles. it was the united states, after all, that spearheaded beijing's inclusion in the world trade organization two decades ago, acting on the now evidently naive justification that this would encourage the country's communist rulers to adopt more lawful behavior both at home and abroad. given the sheer size of china's economy, there is probably no practical alternative to doing business with beijing at some level.\n\nhowever, the west could exercise more control over the terms on which it engages with beijing, now that it is clear the xi government intends no fundamental change on human rights or its mercantilist economic practices — or its aggressive military posture toward taiwan. the united states and other democracies will succeed only if they act as a united front. mr. biden has, sensibly, proposed to do just that, beginning with a restoration of u.s.-european relations. he should follow through on this promise, the urgency of which the latest e.u.-china deal ironically has demonstrated. mr. trump's policies have encouraged and enabled beijing to play the allies off against one another, but mr. biden still has a chance to repair the breach.
white house cheat sheet: the politics of stem cells\n\n\n\n\n\npresident obama moves to repeal the bush administration's ban on stem cell research. ap photo by pablo martinez monsivais\n\npresident obama will overturn an eight-year old policy that placed restrictions on the use of federal funds for embryonic stem cell research this morning, a move being greeted with plaudits by members of his own party but with significant skepticism among those on the conservative right.\n\nobama will sign an executive order allowing the study a far broader group of stem cell lines, which scientists believe could provide insight into the causes of and treatments for various diseases.\n\nduring the campaign, obama promised to overturn the federal ban -- and attacked sen. john mccain (ariz.) in a radio ad on the topic although mccain, in fact, expressed support for removing restrictions on federal funding.\n\npolling suggests that wide swaths of the american public support obama's position. a january 2009 washington post/abc news poll showed nearly six in ten voters favoring a loosening of restrictions on stem cell research. a time poll conducted in the summer of 2008, more than seven in ten supported using stem cells for research while 19 percent opposed using human embryos for that purpose.\n\nlooked at another way, however, there is less clarity on the issue. in a 2007 pew poll 51 percent said stem cell research's potential for new cures to diseases was of primary importance while 35 percent said not destroying human life took precedence.\n\nnewt gingrich (r-ga.), a former speaker of the house, told the fix late sunday that obama's move on stem cells was an ideological sideshow that took focus away from the continued decline of the economy. it is dangerous for the obama administration to pick a wide series of fights, said gingrich. each of these fights simply drains energy away and increases the coalition which decides it has a collective interest in stopping everything.\n\nexpect a series of statements today from leading contenders for the 2012 presidential nomination echoing gingrich's sentiment as opposition to stem cell research is a stone-cold winner among conservatives who view it as a slippery slope in the abortion argument.\n\nthe stem-cell signing -- like the economic stimulus bill -- is an example of the two different tracks that obama and republicans are currently on. obama, with his base solidly on his side, is making policy with broad support among independents. republicans, on the other hand, remain in the wilderness and are looking to rebuild from core principles, shoring up from their base of social and fiscal conservatives.\n\nfor the broad electorate, i think obama will get credit for the perception of aligning with progressive medical interests, said mark mckinnon, a media consultant who worked closely with former president george w. bush. but, it will also fire up the base of the republican party because this strikes at core principles and ignites strong passion and fury.\n\nrepublicans' current path isn't one that will lead them back to the majority. but, for a party decimated by electoral losses over the last two elections, it's the only direction in which they can head at the moment. they must first re-state to their base why they are republicans before working to broaden their coalition to independents and even some conservative democrats. it's a long and winding road but it's the road republicans have chosen.\n\nhappy birthday to ted: yes, that was president obama leading a sing-along version of happy birthday to ted kennedy at an event last night in which the massachusetts senator received a profiles in courage award. (kennedy turned 77 on feb. 22.) caroline kennedy, the senator's niece and an erstwhile senate candidate, joked i never thought i'd be in a room with so many senators, according to the one-of-a-kind tweeting of missouri sen. claire mccaskill.\n\nmonday must-reads: we read the world's newspapers and blogs so you don't have to.\n\n1. president obama will pull out 12,000 troops from iraq by the fall.\n\n2. the new york times' mark leibovich, as only he can, breaks down how republicans are trying to solve a problem like sen. jim bunning (ky.).\n\n3. the post's shailagh murray and the los angeles times' mark z. barabak take in-depth looks at senate majority leader harry reid (d-nev.).\n\n4. maureen dowd on michelle obama's biceps. (she's for them.)\n\n5. does twitter have a business model?\n\n\n\ndems continue anti-rush efforts: americans united for change, a liberal group, is up with a new television ad today aimed at keeping conservative talk-radio host rush limbaugh (and his comments about president obama) in the national spotlight. the ad says that republican leaders created the worst economic crisis in a generation, opposed all of obama's plans to rebuild it and take their marching orders from limbaugh. tell rush and republicans america won't take 'no' for an answer, says the ad's narrator. americans united is spending $25,000 on the commercial, which is running on cable in the washington media market. it is the final act of americans united president brad woodhouse, who starts as communications director at the democratic national committee today.\n\n\n\ntwitter time: we continue our drive for 10,000 twitter followers at thefix and thehyperfix. today's highlights: 1) we'll give away an official fix

obama's candidacy cast his own bid as a continuation of that winning effort -- promising to bring change to the aloha state, which has been under republican rule since 2002. abercrombie, who was elected to the state's 2nd congressional district in 1996, is the first democrat in the contest but likely won't be the last, as honolulu mayor mufi hannemann and state senate president colleen hanabusa (among others) are considering the race. republicans have cleared the way for lt. gov. duke aiona. in a state where obama won 71.5 percent in 2008, the democratic nominee will be favored in a

top congressional democrats unveiled a new $94 billion bill to make broadband internet access more available and affordable nationwide, aiming to remedy some of the digital inequalities that have kept millions of americans offline during the coronavirus pandemic.
this sudden change of heart caught traders off-guard. the universal first read at various equity-trading and sales desks in hong kong was shock and befuddlement. investors nonetheless saw this as a bullish signal. shares of the three companies — china mobile ltd., china telecom corp. and china unicom hong kong ltd. — surged, while the offshore yuan, sensitive to ties between washington and beijing, pushed even higher.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nkicking out mainland companies from american exchanges has been a long endeavor of a white house seeking to limit chinese access to u.s. investment dollars. the president and allies such as republican senator marco rubio have harped on china inc.'s shady accounting practices and beijing's unwillingness to allow u.s. audits.\n\nbut any focus on fraying investment ties misses the point: direct listings in new york aren't a good idea, whether or not the public company accounting oversight board is allowed to do its job. the key reason is that china is a nation with fast and furious credit cycles, and an ever-changing regulatory environment. investing there shouldn't be this easy for someone sitting on park avenue who has never bothered to walk the crowded streets of beijing or shanghai. just consider the accounting scandals that unfolded at luckin coffee inc., once an investor darling in new york that was shunned back home.\n\nnow the nyse fiasco gives even more reason for chinese companies to return home, as liquidity and listing conditions improve. just as their new york counterparts are groping in the dark on beijing's policies, asian traders have no clue how u.s. politics work, either. but an ability to read the tea leaves is critical, even at this late juncture in president donald trump's term. all nyse said was that its reversal was in light of further consultation with relevant regulatory authorities, without elaborating further, and markets went wild.\n\nad\n\nad\n\na rational trader would ask why these telecom stocks are moving at all. if beijing suddenly puts out signals that it intends to make national champions out of dumb pipes, i'd get it. that could affect company financials and cash flows. but why should the nyse influence sentiments in hong kong?\n\njust like the offshore yuan, stocks with u.s. listings have become market playthings on u.s.-china relations. while it's reasonable to expect that foreign exchange is loaded with bets on geopolitics, telecom stocks traditionally are valued using concrete cash-flow analysis and mundane metrics, such as enterprise value to ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. they shouldn't be driven by blind speculation.\n\nafter all, nyse could just have taken a precautionary stance since the executive order prohibited transaction in publicly traded securities of any communist chinese military company. how do you prevent transactions unless you delist, nyse may have reasoned. but the order itself didn't require it. this document only sowed confusion among exchanges and index providers. in the end, nyse's reversal may not signal a subtle change in geopolitics at all.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ngranted, i might be biased. just like tens of thousands of financial worker bees in hong kong, i don't feel like toiling away well into the night just because hot chinese tech stocks are trading in new york. but we've got many reasons to ask domestic companies to come home. neither side of the pacific should be flying blind. if you want to invest in china, come here and work asia hours.\n\nthis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or bloomberg lp and its owners.\n\nshuli ren is a bloomberg opinion columnist covering asian markets. she previously wrote on markets for barron's, following a career as an investment banker, and is a cfa charterholder.\n\nfor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com/opinion
the first to step out forcefully to embrace a futile objection to the election's electoral vote tally was sen. josh hawley (r-mo.). in a statement, his office announced he would oppose certifying the result on wednesday to highlight the failure of some states, including notably pennsylvania, to follow their own election laws as well as the unprecedented interference of big tech monopolies in the election. that latter point is a hobbyhorse of hawley's, appliquéing another plotline in conservative media onto the issue of the moment.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbut sen. ted cruz (r-tex.) has been in the senate longer and is intimately familiar with attempts to convert conservative fervor into attention. so he one-upped hawley in a very senate-y way, assembling a collection of nearly a dozen senators and senators-elect who issued a joint statement focused on the unprecedented allegations of voter fraud, violations and lax enforcement of election law, and other voting irregularities. nearly 4 in 10 americans think the election was rigged, they noted — a tragic development that demanded they intervene.\n\nthat development, of course, is a function of those unprecedented allegations, allegations entirely uncoupled from reality. trump and allies, including hawley and cruz, have elevated the baseless claim of election fraud specifically to cast a pall over trump's loss. that about 40 percent of americans believe these allegations despite the utter lack of evidence should be seen as proof of a failure of honest discourse, not of the election.\n\ncruz and crew offered a very institutional remedy for their purported concerns: a 10-day audit of the vote by a newly formed congressional committee in disputed states (read: states that trump lost). it's an odd request, given that many of those states have already conducted recounts or audits by their nonpartisan state offices.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ncruz's effort to own the trump-defender lane among his caucus, though, was hobbled a bit when sen. patrick j. toomey (r-pa.) condemned both cruz's letter and hawley's stated objection.\n\nthe senators justify their intent by observing that there have been many allegations of fraud. but allegations of fraud by a losing campaign cannot justify overturning an election, the toomey statement read in part. they fail to acknowledge that these allegations have been adjudicated in courtrooms across america and were found to be unsupported by evidence.\n\npennsylvania, of course, is one of the states at the center of trump's allegations, given that its slow vote-counting — itself a function of republican opposition to counting mail-in ballots earlier than election day — was what put president-elect joe biden over the top nearly two months ago.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhawley responded to toomey's opposition by again alleging questionable activity in his colleague's state of the sort that necessitated the raising of eyebrows.\n\n[i]n pennsylvania: since the nineteenth century, the pennsylvania constitution has required all votes to be cast in person, with narrowly defined exceptions. this fact is widely acknowledged. pennsylvania courts have ruled on this question multiple times. but last year, the state legislature enacted a new law purporting to permit voting by mail for any reason, directly contradicting the state constitution. this november, state officials put the new law into effect. more than 2.5 million pennsylvanians voted by mail on november 6 (or after), in numbers far exceeding the margin of difference between donald trump and joe biden.\n\nthis is a remarkably and presumably willfully dishonest explanation for why the votes of millions of pennsylvanians should be thrown in the trash.\n\nad\n\nad\n\none will notice, first, that there's no allegation that those votes don't accurately reflect the will of pennsylvania voters, simply that maybe they were cast following a change to the law that hawley suggests was invalid. those mail-in ballots overwhelmingly favored biden, which is why the extended process of counting them slowly but inexorably made clear that trump had lost the state. toss out those ballots on the sort of technicality that hawley alleges and suddenly trump wins pennsylvania.\n\nbut hawley's presentation of what happened with the law is also misleading and inaccurate. he claims that a law passed last year, titled act 77, was put into effect for the november election, suggesting some murky attempt to reshape the electorate. but, in fact, the legislation expanding mail-in balloting was passed in october 2019 — largely thanks to republican votes — and signed into law that same month. it went into effect immediately, but there weren't any elections to which it applied until the 2020 primaries.\n\namong the changes was an implementation of no-excuse mail-in voting, something that was used in the state's june primaries without issue. but, then, trump won that contest.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe core of hawley's assertion, of course, is that there is an alleged conflict between the law passed in 2019 and the state's constitution, a conflict that he claims had escaped any court's consideration.\n\nbut that is also misleading, specifically in the situation at hand. in late november, the pennsylvania supreme court rejected a lawsuit that included the constitutionality question, with the court's chief justice, thomas saylor, specifically stating that the state's vote tally should stand despite any such questions.\n\n[t]here has been too much good-faith reliance, by the electorate, on the no-excuse mail-in voting regime created by act 77, saylor wrote, to warrant judicial consideration of the extreme and untenable remedies proposed by appellees — that is, to throw out those 2.6 million votes.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nas noted by university of kentucky election-law professor josh douglas, the decision itself approved of allowing mail-in ballot drop boxes, given that the clear legislative intent underlying act 77, which animates much of this case, [was] to provide electors with options to vote outside of traditional polling places. that intent was upheld in the decision.\n\nagain, this ostensible problem with pennsylvania's voting laws is the central claim hawley has repeatedly raised to rationalize his objection to certifying the results of the election. he argues that the objection is simply an effort to make his concerns heard, but that claim collapses when considering the substance of those concerns. it is also undermined by hawley waving his hands about some states beside pennsylvania having failed to follow existing election laws, an effort to exaggerate the problem given that even a rejection of pennsylvania's results wouldn't affect the election's outcome.
in a hollowed-out los angeles memorial coliseum in the frigid 58 los angeles degrees, with clouds holding a meeting over downtown, the rams' return season finally expired on a third down and six from their own 18-yard line. almost poetically, a reserve quarterback making his first appearance, sean mannion, ran to the right, got tackled and got stripped, whereupon teammate malcolm brown recovered the ball to prevent a fourth turnover.\n\nthe scoreboard read 44-6, arizona cardinals, the rams had gone 4-12 and 1-11 since starting off 3-1, the coach had got fired, the olympic flame still burned above, and the lingering witnesses did not boo. actually, the crowd at the start wasn't too sparse given a 4-11 team, and they don't boo much here yet, except for that time in the third quarter, when the sparse section 13 near the top of the stadium booed because the rams sent out the punting unit on a fourth and one while trailing 30-6, and the fans didn't see the point of punting on fourth and one while trailing 30-6.\n\n[nfl week 17: live news and updates from around the league]\n\ninterim coach john fassel crossed them up. he had star punter johnny hekker throw it to chase reynolds for a first down.\n\neverybody cheered.\n\nthe rams committed a false start.\n\nmost everybody booed.\n\nup there in the ancient edifice opened in 1923, wendell stevens sat with his wife, vanessa, and they kept noticing and joking about a narrow crack in the floor below them, and the fact you could see some type of light through the crack. once the new stadium opens in 2019, these concerns will end, and for now, anyway, the stevenses drove here from fresno because, as wendell said, i had to.\n\nhe had grown up playing cornerback for mighty carson high and tilting toward the raiders, the previous nfl team to play here, but that didn't matter. i wanted a team in l.a. for so long. got one. got to support it, he said. i think we're all just excited to have football here in l.a.\n\n[nfl coaching rumors: chargers fire mike mccoy; 49ers fire chip kelly]\n\nhe wore a 29 eric dickerson shirt, and rams fans wore eras of other shirts from the franchise's eccentric history that has bounced from cleveland to los angeles to st. louis to los angeles: a lot of dickersons, a few jack youngbloods, some kurt warners (odd, given that he played only for the st. louis rams), and a lot of todd gurleys, celebrating a current player. wendell stevens even saw a vince ferragamo, citing the only quarterback to lead the los angeles rams to a super bowl, and remembered he did some gardening for ferragamo's mother.\n\neventually, the rams filed out next to the cardinals in the one stadium tunnel, and the fans who lingered at the edges got enough nfl intimacy that it felt a little like a rec league game of some type. a 4-12 season had died out, so the locker room had 4-12 sounds, with a new coach as yet unchosen.\n\nsafety t.j. mcdonald: something has to change. something has to change — a lot. a lot has to change. tackle greg robinson: honestly, i don't know what to expect. tight end lance kendricks: we need someone to motivate us and to be on our backs when we mess up. cornerback trumaine johnson: this is my fifth year [smiling]. they bring a coach in, he could wipe out everybody, he could keep people. so i don't know what the future holds. wide receiver tavon austin said departed head coach jeff fisher had given him his chances, and he missed fisher.\n\ndefensive end william hayes: the only thing i know is, individually, everybody just needs to work their craft and when the new coach comes in here, make sure we don't do anything to get him fired.\n\nrookie no. 1 draft pick jared goff, the quarterback, said he had walked around the locker room asking teammates to treat it as a beginning, and that he looked forward to having an offseason without any schoolwork, and that he is fine, even though a viewer might have winced more than once observing some of the seven sacks he took. he said that because a new playbook was coming, it might not be much use to obsess on this year.\n\nnone of this will deter many of the people who watched them, especially the melon patch down low with watermelon rinds (or likenesses thereof) on their heads. david stanley, who first came to a rams game at the coliseum in 1968, said it had been a year of faces unseen during the 22-year absence, coming up and tapping on the shoulder. he said that when the team honored hall of fame linebacker kevin greene, he noticed the melonheads, came over and said, 'you guys, man! i remember you guys! i can't believe you guys are back.' that, to me, is something that was just so special.'\n\nmelon-headed daniel rojas, 12 when the rams left, said that opening kickoff against seattle back in september had been surreal, in the aspect that you still couldn't believe that they were back. you look up at the scoreboard and you see the 'l.a.' versus 's-e-a,' and you're like, 'wow.' \n\nif i knew that it was going to be a season like this, just to get my team back, i'll take it, he said. why? because we've got years to improve. they're back. they're not going to go anywhere.
five people have been removed from duval high, including the principal, an assistant principal and three other employees, according to people familiar with the situation. district officials said they could not provide details because personnel matters are confidential, but they said the employees learned of the change friday.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe school of 1,866 students in lanham, md., was once touted as an example of the district's success — one of eight schools celebrated with fanfare last year for having a graduation rate at or above 90 percent. duval's was 92.4 percent.\n\nintentional violations of school system policies and procedures will not be tolerated, kevin maxwell, the system's chief executive, said in a statement released shortly after a letter went home to families. changes are being made to improve student achievement and strengthen the duval community's confidence in its school.\n\nthe changes come a week before prince george's is scheduled to appear before the maryland state board of education to present its plan to address problems identified by the state report.\n\nad\n\nthat report, which sampled students with late grade changes in 2016 and 2017, found that at duval, more than 27 percent of that group lacked documentation showing graduation eligibility or did not qualify to graduate.\n\nad\n\nit found that duval ran a large, unofficial credit recovery program for students trying to compensate for failing grades. staff told investigators that previous credit recovery programs were not always graded and that students got points for attempting, according to the report. seventeen students in 2016 and 2017 racked up more than 50 days of unlawful absences, it said.\n\nschool board member edward burroughs iii, who has been critical of the district administration, raised concerns that punishment appears limited to employees at duval.\n\nad\n\nit appears that there is one standard for school-based employees and an entirely different standard for executive level staff, he said.\n\nburroughs said he expects that other actions will follow the duval shake-up.\n\nduval is the first school to go through this but certainly not the last, he said.\n\nad\n\ndistrict officials said they have assigned a support team of central office supervisors to assist at the school. an acting principal has been in place since august.\n\nraaheela ahmed, a board member who joined burroughs in calling for an investigation of whistleblowers' complaints, said the letter sent home to families doesn't give enough detail.\n\nit is a statement saying change is being made without specifically pinpointing what exactly is going to happen and what exactly is going on, she said. there is a lot of wonder left.
hours before the mayor was to make an announcement, she said she needed more time.\n\nthe city spent the next five months trying to bring students and teachers back to classrooms. a combination of mismanagement by the mayor and her aides and intransigence from the district's teachers union combined to thwart every move, according to interviews with city officials, union leaders, educators and activists. the city kept changing its plan, and the union kept changing its demands. a lack of trust on both sides fueled failure at every turn.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nas urban school districts across the country struggled with classroom reopening plans, a close look at the district's experience shows how hard it has been to develop workable strategies — and how much power teachers wield, particularly when they have a strong union behind them.\n\nthe district's impasse meant it squandered the chance to give its most vulnerable children classroom time while infection rates were low. now the earliest any students will have face-to-face instruction will be february.\n\nwhile teachers worked to persuade parents that reopening was dangerous and the district's plan inadequate, the city did little to sell either the urgency of going back or the details of its plan to the general public.\n\nad\n\nthe school system had proof that children were falling behind because of remote learning but sowed doubt in the findings by presenting inaccurate data. principals had no input in shaping the reopening plan and were left in the dark about its details. advocates for homeless children — the students city officials argued most urgently needed to be in school — never heard from administrators. groups that worked with students with disabilities said they couldn't get their questions answered, so these families were reluctant to go back.\n\nad\n\npaul kihn, deputy mayor for education, said the city surveyed families in the summer and knew about half were ready to return to school buildings. but city officials made a major miscalculation. they assumed they would be able to strike a deal with the union and enough teachers would be willing to come back to classrooms.\n\nthat never happened.\n\nad\n\nat least twice, the washington teachers' union reached tentative agreements with the city to reopen, only to back out a few days later. the union staked out demands that went far beyond what was in place elsewhere and beyond guidelines set by its national union.\n\nthe result: teachers were applying maximum pressure to stay closed, but there was virtually no public pressure to reopen.\n\nthe plans we made assumed we would be able to have our teachers in our buildings, kihn said.\n\nad\n\neven as restaurants and salons opened to customers, as private and charter schools began in-person classes and available data show scant virus infection in the nation's open schools, the traditional public school system has remained entirely virtual, with a few hundred elementary school students participating in virtual learning from classrooms under the supervision of nonteaching staff.\n\nad\n\ncity officials maintain they have done everything possible to reopen safely and effectively.\n\nour plans are being made on the best available science, d.c. public schools chancellor lewis d. ferebee said in july before previewing one of the city's reopening plans. there is no substitute for in-person instruction.\n\nthe teachers union says it agrees, in theory, but has opposed every plan to open classrooms.\n\nit's almost like they are building the plane while flying, elizabeth davis, the union's president, said. that is not okay with us.\n\nad\n\nnow city leaders are trying again. if health metrics allow for it — a major question given the surging caseloads — they plan to reopen all school buildings with teachers in february. this time around, according to city officials, principals, staff and parents are having more of a say in their schools' reopening plans.\n\nschool is out\n\nschool had been virtual all spring and summer, and with the new academic year looming, bowser planned to bring students back to schools. schools would use a hybrid model, an idea employed across the country where students would be in class part of the week and home the rest. teachers would return unless they qualified for an exemption.\n\nad\n\nit rested on a survey of teachers to determine who could come back, but the teachers union said its contract required terms to be negotiated and told its members not to respond. bad blood between the city and teachers was already thick, with a toxic history of mistrust.\n\nad\n\nteachers began venting on a private union facebook page. they tagged one another, and the group grew fast from about 250 to some 1,000 members.\n\ni've tried to tell [school leaders] that this is not just a few rabble-rousers anymore, said the union's secretary, laura fuchs, a high school history teacher and a leader of the union's far-left contingent.\n\nunion participation swelled, prompting the union to upgrade its zoom subscription. even then, a july meeting hit the 1,000-person limit, and the union had to switch to another platform to accommodate everyone.\n\nad\n\nfuchs's growing faction inside the union embraced aggressive tactics. teachers staged protests in front of the mayor's and chancellor's colonial homes in northwest washington. on july 28, a group of teachers dropped mock body bags in front of the district's headquarters to warn of the deaths that they believed would result from reopening schools.\n\nad\n\nthe union's initial demands included hazard pay for going back and a suspension of teacher evaluations and standardized testing. these went well beyond guidelines adopted by the american federation of teachers, their national union.\n\nin mid-july, bowser had punted a decision on reopening until the end of july. when that deadline arrived, she canceled it altogether. all students would begin online in september.\n\ntry and try again\n\nby early september, school leaders had data showing how far students had fallen behind in the spring and during summer school. some of the city's charter schools began to bring small groups of students back to buildings.\n\nad\n\ni think dcps can do it, and i think dcps should do it, bowser said.\n\nshe put together what turned out to be a tiny plan with limited programs and virtually no teachers at just 13 schools.\n\nad\n\nunion negotiations continued with the parties convening for virtual sessions — ferebee sometimes logging on from an empty classroom between meetings; davis at home, digitally surrounded by at least a half-dozen union representatives.\n\nthe mayor and chancellor did little to win support from the broader community.\n\na city committee had been formed in may to look at school reopenings, but the mayor did not seek its input or try to recruit its members as advocates for her plans, said cathy reilly, a longtime education activist who served on that panel. kihn, who chaired the committee, responded that it disbanded as planned in the summer after it presented broad guidelines on how schools should reopen.\n\nad\n\nthey consulted with us after they had decided on it, reilly said. yet she said she absolutely heard from davis and other teachers about their concerns.\n\nad\n\nthe chancellor held a few public forums and said teachers helped shape the plans during hundreds of hours of union negotiations. but the virtual town halls frustrated many attendees, as participants were forced to ask questions through a chat window, providing no opportunity for follow-up questions or pushback.\n\non oct. 5, bowser went to an elementary school to announce a new reopening plan. she appeared to have made no effort to recruit allies for it ahead of time.\n\nschool leaders and the head of the council of school officers, a union representing principals, said they were left to tune in to her news conference to find out what was going on, because there was no direct communication. these same people were tasked with answering parent questions, with scant information to share.\n\ni am learning the information in real time with you, so i am working to obtain more details for all of us, said a note to parents from an elementary school principal.\n\ndavis, too, said the mayor didn't give her a heads-up that the plan was coming. the city again was surveying teachers to figure out who could return to classrooms. again, the union told members not to participate.\n\nkihn said city officials knew they wouldn't be able to get enough teachers for a systemwide hybrid model, so they settled on something smaller.\n\nthe plan they picked was complicated and appeared to please just about nobody. eleven students per grade in each elementary school, chosen by lottery, could come back for in-person classes, with priority given to homeless, english-language learners and special education students. that would accommodate about 7,000 of the district's 52,000 students. a second piece of the plan would let another 14,000 students could come back to buildings to do remote school from inside classrooms, supervised by nonteachers, including some administrative staff pulled from other schools.\n\nsome students would have the chance for a more normal school day, but because classes were so small, the online classes for everyone else would grow larger. some students would have to change teachers in the middle of the semester, frustrating parents who were already struggling to make remote school work.\n\nparents who wanted their children to return to classrooms were confused about what the in-person program would look like. would they have the same teacher? would they receive specialized services such as speech or occupational therapy?\n\nthe lack of concrete and specific information absolutely made families lose confidence, said judith sandalow, executive director of children's law center, an organization that represents d.c. children from low-income households. they didn't have thoughtful answers to really legitimate questions that parents were asking.\n\nconfused parents bombarded principals with questions. confused principals turned to richard jackson, the head of the council of school officers, who didn't know any more.\n\nit has made the principals' lives kind of miserable, jackson said.\n\nthe plan also required the city to divert administrative staff from middle and high schools to elementary schools to supervise the care classrooms, angering a whole new set of parents and administrators.\n\nthen, two days after the plan was announced, ferebee unexpectedly fired a veteran principal who had been openly critical of the city's plans for building safety.\n\nferebee said he was fired for unrelated reasons — he was accused of not following enrollment rules last academic year, a lightning rod issue in the district — but the dismissal fueled fears that the city was glossing over safety concerns.\n\nthe principals union, normally a quiet group loath to complain publicly about anything, released a scathing letter deriding just about every aspect of the reopening plan.\n\nthe plan was aimed at high-needs students, but many of these families turned down slots offered by the school system.\n\nthey didn't understand it. they didn't trust that their kids would be safe. and they already found alternatives, said ryane nickens, who operates a learning hub out of the langston lanes subsidized apartment complex in southeast washington for children impacted by gun violence.\n\nnickens said the city failed to make the case to these parents, and she wished there had been meetings in school parking lots or courtyards of public housing complexes to answer questions. they didn't go directly to the people impacted, she said.\n\neighty percent of the school system's 52,000 students are black or hispanic, and 47 percent are considered at risk, which puts them in the high-needs category.\n\nkihn said he thought the city did what it needed to do. schools reached out to families personally to offer them slots. the district had expensive safeguards in place in classrooms to mitigate the spread of the virus. and they had people who wanted to go back, with demand about what the city had expected based on a summer family survey.\n\nbefore the city canceled the reopening plans, it offered about 5,500 students seats for in-person learning, and 2,200 accepted slots. the city was awaiting a response from 1,100 families and then planned to call more people to offer them slots.\n\na 'final' deal unravels\n\nby mid-october, the city and the union both signaled they had finally reached a deal. a five-page agreement marked final was circulated oct. 14.\n\nthe chancellor committed to more measures than he had before, including a safety checklist for each school. schools would require masks and social distancing. a health professional would be on every campus, taking temperatures and monitoring isolation rooms set aside for people showing symptoms. the city promised to update its air filtration systems with a $24 million plan to buy top-of-the-line air filters and portable air filtration systems for each classroom.\n\nin an email, a labor lawyer for the city referred to the documents as the final agreed upon version, and the union shared them with reporters.\n\novernight, the deal fell apart. the next morning, davis insisted a union representative be empowered to verify that buildings were compliant with the agreed-upon checklist. it is unclear whether this had been her understanding all along or whether she added this demand after circulating the proposal with her members. it was not spelled out in the documents.\n\nfor their part, the mayor's advisers said they were angry davis continued to share tentative agreements with the media. they suspected she was trying to test reactions among teachers and the public before signing.\n\na week later, the public employee relations board delivered the city a debilitating blow. the union had filed a formal complaint over the teacher surveys, and the board concluded the city could not use the results. the board said the city was obligated to work through the union, not communicate with teachers on its own. without the survey, the chancellor had no way of assigning teachers and staff.\n\nan agreement with the union was not strictly required for schools to open. but school leaders feared they would not have enough teachers show up without a deal. nonetheless, two days later, ferebee told the d.c. council that he would go through with a reopening plan even without an agreement with the union.\n\nbut now something else was holding up an agreement. the union said teaching had to be optional for all teachers, even those who are young and healthy, or nobody would go back.\n\nmeanwhile, teachers had been lobbying parents to oppose the reopening, and the city had barely even tried to sell it to the general public. not a single member of the city council spoke up in favor of the reopening plan.\n\nover halloween weekend, the union and the city continued talks, and on the evening of nov. 1, bowser and davis spoke by phone, davis and aides to the mayor said. bowser said the deal they reached had to stick for the entire school year. she didn't want more uncertainty. but davis wasn't willing to commit to anything beyond the next quarter, saying circumstances could change.\n\nbowser also wanted to use the survey results to assign teachers. davis objected to that, too.\n\nduring that phone call, davis never mentioned what the union had planned for the following morning. that monday, in the early hours, thousands of parents received emails from their children's teachers telling them that they were taking a mental health day and would not be teaching that day.\n\nin the end, 39 percent of all city teachers called in sick. an hour after the school day began, ferebee emailed the community saying the district was abandoning its reopening plan.\n\nwe apologize for any inconvenience this update may cause, he wrote.\n\nthe city was left with a tiny plan: 450 or so students returned to 24 campuses in november for online school from inside supervised classrooms. by mid-december, around 900 elementary students accepted slots at nearly 70 campuses, with attendance hovering around 50 percent each day. these care classrooms were envisioned as serving 14,000 students, but the plan had to reduce the number, partly because schools were only able to use nonteaching personnel assigned to their schools for supervision.\n\nthis was cold comfort to nery pena, who had accepted an in-person slot for her second-grade daughter at garrison elementary in northwest washington. she was also hoping for a spot for her younger daughter, who has developmental delays and is struggling with distance learning.\n\nthe family lives in transitional housing, which means her daughters meet the federal definition of homeless and were given priority in the lottery for seats. when pena told her daughters they might be returning to school, her youngest was particularly excited.\n\nif the plan was not definite, they should have kept it to themselves and not informed parents because parents are obviously going to inform their children, pena said. i was counting on it. i was getting ready.\n\nin the aftermath, bowser and ferebee explicitly blamed the union for the failure to reopen schools.\n\nthe primary barrier now for in-person learning is having the supply of teachers to teach in those classrooms, ferebee told families at a town hall meeting.\n\nagain in november, the union signaled a deal had been reached for teachers to return to classrooms on a purely voluntary basis, at least at first. but looking like lucy, who repeatedly pulled the football away from charlie brown at the last moment, the union changed its mind a few days later and another agreement unraveled.\n\ninfection rates were surging throughout the region. the effort to give some students classroom instruction in the first semester had failed.\n\nfocused now on february, the third quarter of the academic year, ferebee and davis signed an agreement last month that is intended to reassure teachers. they will not get a carte blanche to refuse to teach in-person but will be required to return if not enough teachers volunteer. it also outlines safety protocols and protective items that will be in each school building. the city recently started testing asymptomatic students and staff, which teachers had wanted.\n\nferebee says he is optimistic schools will reopen with teachers in february. some teachers have already volunteered to return, though ferebee said it is fewer than he expected.\n\nas the pandemic rages on, school leaders are visiting school buildings, touting their safety features and hoping they can someday say their plans were successful.
q: we have dark granite countertops, i think called ubatuba, that were installed in our kitchen when our house was built in 2003. there is one major seam between two slabs on the l-shaped main countertop. the seam was filled with some substance during installation. i think they mixed granite dust with caulking material to match the color. that caulking has worn away over the years. is there a way i can restore that? or do i need to contact someone with access to the same kind of granite dust to do the repair?\n\nashton\n\na: if you want to fix this yourself, you should pry out all the loose filler, then refill with two-part epoxy tinted to match the stone as closely as possible. tape along both sides of the seam first so the epoxy doesn't smear over the stone surface. mix and apply the epoxy, remove the tape, and let the epoxy harden as recommended on the label. then scrape off the excess with a sharp razor blade. defusco industrial supply (defusco.com; 800-289-6384) sells lamlock rocketgel basic bundle, a kit with the epoxy components, plus eight colors that you can mix to get a good match, for $52.\n\nor you could call a professional, which has a few advantages. first, you'd get someone experienced in matching colors. and you would get advice about whether there is a larger problem. in the picture you sent, the front edges of the two sections appear to be out of line. if that's the case, it could indicate that the slabs have shifted.\n\nherbie bennett, one of the owners of the granite guys in hagerstown, md. (301-739-5510; thegraniteguysonline.com), said patching the seam would cost about $100. the price isn't all that much more than the supplies would cost you.\n\nthis antique mirror needs to be resilvered. (reader photo)\n\nq: i have a small antique mirror, 12 inches by 8 inches, that needs to be resilvered. it is part of a three-piece set for a dining table centerpiece. the center rectangular piece and the matching piece for the other side are fine, but the tarnish on the third piece spoils the look. i haven't been able to find anyone who resilvers mirrors. do you know who can do it?\n\nlake ridge\n\na: angel gilding in forest park, ill. (708-383-3340; angelgilding.com), sells the supplies, and its website lists several professionals who do this work. two who responded to emails and phone calls are tom huisman of huisman glass in north oaks, minn. (651-428-8865; huismanglass.com), and tom eddleman of eddleman etching in jackson, miss. (601-540-5207; tomsetching@bellsouth.net).\n\nboth recommended that you consider having all three pieces resilvered. if one has a lot of deterioration, chances are the others do, too, huisman said. if i resilver one and the others are a little tarnished, the one will stand out.\n\neddleman said customers often opt to have a newly resilvered mirror antiqued so that it conveys a sense of its age. basically, when you antique a mirror, you do a regular resilvering and then you distress the silver, he said. it can change colors, depending on how you do it. more than likely it will show some of the backing paint — dark brown. but here's the thing: it's a random thing. there is no way to match a truly antique mirror. but if all three pieces are given the same treatment, they will look like they belong together.\n\nhuisman charges $25 per square foot of mirror, with a $40 minimum. after looking at the picture you sent, he spotted what might be a couple of chips on one edge of your mirror. if that damage is really there, and if you want him to smooth it out, he can do that, too. he charges $2 a running inch to create a bevel up to half an inch wide along the edge of a mirror, but if he just needs to feather an edge or round over a corner a bit, the price often works out to $20 to $40, depending on how much time the job takes. given that your mirror is not even one square foot, you might be able to get a touch-up done and still be under the minimum fee.\n\neddleman's business focuses more on etching glass than on resilvering. he gets only a few resilvering jobs each month, and that is reflected in his prices. he said he could resilver one piece for $275 or all three for about $475, with no extra charge if you opt for the antiquing treatment. it's because of the chemicals, he said to explain the difference in the price of repairing one vs. three mirrors. you have to buy so much of the chemicals to do it, and they have a shelf life. so one piece or three pieces, the chemicals are going to cost the same.\n\nif you want to tackle the resilvering yourself, angel gilding sells what you need and supplies instructions. a kit for removing an old reflective coating and its protective paint costs $49. a bare-bones kit with the chemicals needed to create up to eight square feet of new mirror coating costs $50. a more complete kit that includes equipment you'd need is $190.\n\nif you leave the job to a pro, pack the mirror or mirrors carefully to avoid breakage. wrap each mirror in padding, putting the padded pieces in a box, and stuff any empty spaces with more padding. then place that box in a larger box that has additional padding.
we talked to designers about how to make classic updates that will stand up over time. here are their suggestions.\n\nuse marble counters\n\nwhether you're doing a whole-kitchen remodel or making savvy moves to refresh the space, wendy blackband of blackband home & design in california likes marble counters. it's been around for a long time, and you see it whenever you're traveling through europe, she says. blackband suggests calacatta, a whiter marble with veining.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmarble is an investment, at $40-$100 per square foot. but leanne ford, a pittsburgh-based interior designer and hgtv star, says it's worth it. being that the kitchen is the most-used room in the house, anything you love is worth the investment, she says. scrimp somewhere else.\n\nif you want a similar look with less expense and upkeep — marble requires sealing every six to 12 months to prevent stains and acid etching — blackband also likes the engineered neolith countertop material.\n\nquartz countertops from companies such as caesarstone and pentalquartz are another good option. blackband recommends sticking with white or, if you don't like white, a neutral color, such as tan, beige or ivory. go with a subtle pattern and low veining for a longer-lasting look.\n\nmind your lighting\n\neverything looks better and more upscale in the right light. we believe kitchens should have sufficient and flexible lighting, as if there was never any natural daylight in the space, says kelly emerson, a designer with aidan design in silver spring, md. (natural light is a bonus.)\n\nad\n\nad\n\nif this isn't already the case in your kitchen, upgrade to recessed downlights on dimmer switches in the ceiling, so you can control the light levels, and add task lighting under cabinets. a layer of recessed wall-washer ceiling lighting, pendants or sconces add both decoration and directional lighting, especially if under-cabinet lighting isn't possible.\n\nto replace dated pendants, designer sarah zames, principal and founder of the brooklyn, n.y., design firm general assembly, and colin stief look for fixtures with warm materials, such as brass in a natural or black finish. go bigger rather than smaller with these lighting fixtures.\n\nglobes of any size are forever — frosted or clear, says ford, who is the co-star of hgtv's restored by the fords. for more information on sizing and placement, look to circa lighting's online guide to lighting.\n\nchoose the right cabinets\n\nchoosing or replacing kitchen cabinets is one of the biggest investments in a kitchen, so you'll want something that you won't have to change, paint or refresh anytime soon.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwalnut is the timeless, classic wood species, emerson says. rich variations of light- to medium-warm gray stains on maple, cherry, hickory or walnut are also good, as well as natural stains on cherry and walnut. whatever you do, she says, stay away from yellow and pink-red coloration to wood stains.\n\nalthough white cabinets are a popular choice, emerson warns that they are on their way out of fashion. if you still like the lighter look, emerson recommends linen colors vs. stark whites, which can help achieve more layered tone-on-tone palettes.\n\nas for style, blackband says to look at slab-panel cabinetry, which features a flat door over the cabinet box and lends a modern but classic look. installing panels over appliances is a luxurious extra touch if you can afford it, making the room seem less like a kitchen full of machines and more like a living space with furniture.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nlike counters, cabinets are a place to spend your money wisely. they are expensive, but investing in the highest quality you can afford will pay off in more long-lasting materials.\n\nselect quality hardware\n\nwe know that updating hardware is one of the easiest kitchen upgrades, but what if you're choosing for the first time — for the long haul?\n\nour office tends to like things that have a natural, warm feeling, zames says. she specifically looks to oil-rubbed bronze knobs and pulls, because the patina can change over time, giving them a classic, well-worn look.\n\nknobs don't have to match plumbing hardware, blackband says, as long as they're complementary, such as black knobs with a polished chrome faucet. emerson recommends keeping all the hardware warm or cool, such as satin and nickel finishes that go with stainless steel appliances.\n\nwhat matters more than the type of metal, though, according to zames and stief, is the quality of the hardware. for example, even though brass hardware is trendy right now, if that brass is well-made, has been worn in and has an aged patina, it can still have lasting value.\n\nchoose a classic backsplash\n\nsubway tile is the most enduring choice for a backsplash. avoid bold, trendy colors, and instead look for white or neutrals. keep it simple, and bring in color elsewhere in the kitchen, with more easily replaced items, such as dish towels, art, bowls of fruit and rugs.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nif, as zames says, white subway tile feels too much like playing it safe, there are ways to up the interest. blackband suggests choosing a larger tile than the standard 3-by-6-inch size, or changing up the orientation; try stacking the tile vertically or in a chevron pattern.\n\nanother way to make this classic feel more personal is to choose subway tile that's handmade, blackband says, or to get creative with your grout color.
what also felt true was a prevailing feeling of helplessness. there was a strong desire to do something, anything, but retaliatory feelings were all we had. vengeance fantasies, judgment and name-calling, desperation over the feeling of loss of moral norms, and powerlessness to help the citizens these norms had protected: this anger and fear eclipsed any efforts to be a better citizen, inspire change or develop a clear voice of response.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nrecently, i learned of remarks tara brach, buddhist meditation teacher and founder of the insight community of washington, had made after the election during one of the weekly community meditation sessions she leads at river road unitarian church in bethesda. brach told those gathered that it was okay to feel anger, fear and grief. that night and in a follow-up talk on nov. 23, she reminded them that bringing mindfulness and meditation to difficult emotions is necessary if wisdom is the goal: [anger is] part of our most primal survival system. it's saying, 'there's something going on here that can really get in the way of us meeting our deepest needs.' it's a call to energize, and it needs to be attended to, she said.\n\nnow, with the inauguration days away, it is clear that brach's words were the call to action i was seeking. meditation and mindfulness — the practice of noticing the contents of the mind and flow of the breath — are the first and most important steps to take to find clarity and inner resolve. while my first reactions on nov. 9 were normal, indeed human, moving through and beyond those feelings would be key to both healthy action and activism. meditation and mindfulness can turn gut reactions into more thoughtful actions that in turn have greater potential to change the conversation.\n\nthe benefits of meditation and mindfulness are well-known, and they are increasingly measured and understood. we know they decrease stress and sharpen focus, that they can lower the risk of heart disease and strokes. neuroscientists and doctors now point to evidence that meditation rewires the brain to value an expanded awareness of ourselves, and therefore others, over the instinctual self-preservation habits of fight-or-flight.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwhen i let negative emotions overtake me, i only hurt myself. they either root inside and take up valuable real estate, or they compel me to do and say negative things out in the world. or they do both. when, instead, i sit with emotions like the ones that came up in november, i create an opportunity to observe them, to stop them in their tracks and start asking questions. why this feeling vs. another one? why am i feeling this way right now? what's behind this feeling? almost without fail, after this kind inquiry i find that underneath the nastiness and hurt are deeper feelings of care, for myself and for others.\n\nin my unmeditated state in late november, after a heated argument with my devoutly methodist mother (we voted differently), i sent her this letter from the united methodist church on the emerging bigotry and hate we all witnessed during the campaign. my intention was partly to converse with my mother, but it was mostly to shame and to harm. i felt so betrayed at that time by one of my deepest bonds, to her, that i perverted an otherwise holy letter with peaceful intentions into a weapon of verbal attack. this felt terrible, and my mother didn't respond. soon after, i sat with my actions, and i realized that beneath my anger and sadness was concern for my mother that was just as great as that for the people i felt i was speaking up for.\n\nrenowned buddhist monk and peace activist thich nhat hanh advocates that meditation actually leads to activism. once you discover this expanded consciousness, he contends, you are driven to share it and act on it. the dalai lama says, basically, universal responsibility is feeling for other people's suffering just as we feel our own. it is the realization that even our enemy is entirely motivated by the quest for happiness. we must recognize that all beings want the same thing that we want. this is the way to achieve a true understanding, unfettered by artificial consideration.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nas we move into uncharted sociopolitical waters, it's important to understand that sharing your beliefs and advocating for yourself and others requires self-knowledge and self-care. it requires pausing regularly and asking yourself deeper, sometimes difficult questions. counterintuitively, perhaps, we care for ourselves more by acknowledging our pain vs. ignoring it and hoping it will go away — or by using it to attack others, on social media or anywhere else. a poorly cared for body is less effective and expressive in the world, regardless of action or intention.\n\none way of thinking about this is through an analogy i make with my yoga students about doing a good bridge pose. the pose is the act of lying on your back with your knees bent and feet on the ground, and lifting your hips as high off the ground as you can. bridges are built to sustain the stress of heavy loads, but with a load beyond the bridge's capacity, or without repairs and some rest, the bridge over time will break or collapse.\n\nknowing when the stress of any action, large or small, is welcomed by your body is a powerful and necessary tool that comes from going inside and checking in. this checking-in process will, over time, help you understand what's making you less effective in your words, actions and activism. once you understand this, all your words and actions will take on a different hue. they will be received differently by others because they will differ from what we must reject as the toxicity of what has become normal sociopolitical discourse. they will all have a higher chance of being received for what they are. there will be less chance for misunderstanding. it's how you change the conversation.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nyou'll do it, you'll be able to effect the change in the world you want to see, by first acknowledging yourself.\n\nkim weeks started yoga in 1995 and has been teaching it since 2001. she was voted several times dc's best yoga teacher and has appeared on nbc4 washington as a yoga expert and in a pbs documentary on spirituality. mother to two young children, kim teaches weekly classes at yogaworks in washington.\n\nread more on inspired life:
we're shutting dion down. we haven't played dion the last three games because of his back. dion is not going to be able to make the trip. just trying to get him treatment, just trying to get him better, and then hopefully have him back before tuesday, turgeon said.\n\nwiley had previously made trips to michigan and illinois over the past two weekends, warming up before both of those contests but otherwise sitting out while turgeon remained cautious about his injury.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nit is yet another medical setback for the former potomac (md.) star, who missed all of last season with a torn meniscus in his left knee. wiley was nearing full strength through much of the nonconference season – he's averaged 4.6 points and 1.9 rebounds in 13 games – and had a strong showing in the big ten opener against illinois, finishing with nine points in a 25-point maryland win. on new year's day, he played just four minutes in a loss to nebraska and has been on the shelf ever since. turgeon said on wednesday that the team had to change its initial rehabilitation course for wiley, who was still participating in team activities in a limited fashion.\n\nwhat we were doing wasn't working, so we're going to shut him down, turgeon said.\n\nwhile turgeon is still unsure if wiley will be read for next tuesday's game against rutgers, he was much more optimistic about the recovery of junior center michal cekovsky, who has missed the past five games with an ankle injury. cekovsky, who has played in just nine games this season and has dealt with injuries to his hamstring, foot and ankle, has made incremental progress with his health over the past three weeks. while he is still questionable for thursday's game at iowa, turgeon likely will have to work cekovsky back into playing shape gradually after nearly a month off.
mark morgan, the acting cbp commissioner, told reporters at a white house briefing that more than 52,000 migrants were taken into custody in september at u.s. ports of entry and between them, a decline of 18 percent from august.\n\nad\n\noverall, u.s. border authorities made 977,509 arrests during fiscal 2019, up 88 percent from last year and the highest total since 2007. morgan called it a staggering increase.\n\nad\n\nthese are numbers no immigration system in the world is designed to handle, he said.\n\narrests by u.s. border agents reached an all-time high of 1.6 million in 2000, but department of homeland security officials insist that the migration wave they faced this year is unlike anything in the past.\n\na generation ago, most of the migrants crossing the border illegally were single adults from mexico who could be quickly processed and deported.\n\nthis year, central american parents with children made up the overwhelming majority of border crossers. instead of seeking to evade capture, many sought out u.s. agents to surrender and stated a fear of being sent home, the first step in seeking asylum or another form of legal protection in the united states.\n\ncourt limits on the amount of time minors can be held in cbp custody mean that nearly any parent who arrived with a child could expect to be issued a notice to appear in court and to be released into the u.s. interior within a few days.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhomeland security officials said smuggling organizations have been exploiting this loophole, reaping huge profits by marketing an easy trip north.\n\nthe surge reached its height in may, when more than 144,000 were taken into custody, including one group of 1,036 that crossed the border into el paso to surrender.\n\nafter that event, president trump demanded a crackdown, threatening to impose tariffs on mexican imports if mexican authorities did not help stem the tide.\n\nthe government of andrés manuel lópez obrador responded by deploying thousands of national guard troops to clamp down on the central american migrants, while also allowing the united states to expand a program that requires migrants to wait outside u.s. territory while their legal claims are processed.\n\nad\n\nunder that program, which the trump administration calls the migrant protection protocols, nearly 50,000 migrants have been returned to mexico, many of them waiting months in dangerous border cities. trump officials say the program has been effective at deterring migrants who might be trying to game the system with baseless asylum claims.\n\nad\n\nthe legality of the mpp is being challenged in federal courts — an appeals court allowed it to continue temporarily while weighing it — as is a new policy that disqualifies asylum seekers who do not attempt to gain protection in other nations while en route to the u.s. border.\n\nmorgan said that asylum bar would be implemented this week, following a u.s. supreme court ruling last month that allowed the administration to go forward while legal challenges are pending in federal courts.\n\nad\n\nadvocates for migrants say the trump administration has all but slammed the door on migrants fleeing violence and persecution, exposing children and other vulnerable populations to grave risks.\n\non tuesday, morgan said: the administration's efforts — they're working. four short months ago, our daily apprehensions were close to 5,000. and today . . . it's below 1,700.\n\nad\n\nmorgan said that the figure remained too high and that a more manageable level would be 500 apprehensions per day. the 52,546 enforcement actions cbp tallied in september still rank it higher than any single month during the 2018 fiscal year.\n\nbut compared with the rest of fiscal 2019, it was the lowest monthly total and a 65 percent drop from the may peak, morgan noted. he said the agency had essentially ended catch-and-release, the term trump administration officials use to refer to the practice of releasing border crossers from detention with a notice to appear in court.\n\nad\n\nif you come to our borders with a child, it's no longer an immediate passport into the interior of the united states, he said.\n\nin another crucial indicator of the change in volume, morgan said the number of migrants in cbp custody is approximately 4,000, down from 19,000 in early june, when cells were overflowing with families and children in squalid conditions.\n\nad\n\nmorgan also told reporters that the administration has completed 71 of the 450 miles of beautiful new border barriers cbp plans to complete by the end of 2020.\n\nasked about the president's promises that mexico would pay for the structure, morgan said he didn't care how the wall would be funded.\n\nad\n\ni'm the commissioner of cbp, he said. that's a political thing to me. . . . i don't care who's paying for the wall. all i care about is that it's being built.\n\nas the acting cbp chief, morgan has attended meetings at the white house in recent weeks to discuss the administration's concerns about wall funding, including a gathering trump adviser jared kushner led last month at which senior officials outlined a plan to divert $3.6 billion from the pentagon budget for the second year in a row.

but the team will also have to take a look at the free agent market. here are five players the team should consider as it seeks to upgrade the roster.\n\nlandon collins, safety, giants\n\nfollowing the release of d.j. swearinger, and with midseason trade pickup ha ha clinton-dix's contract expiring, the redskins have decisions to make at the safety position. clinton-dix earned an overall pro football focus grade of 79.3 this season (on a scale of 0 to 100), good for 13th in the league, but there's no guarantee he'll be brought back. if he goes elsewhere in free agency, collins could provide a replacement with a much higher ceiling.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin 2016, collins had a defensive player of the year caliber season, notching five interceptions, seven pass breakups and four sacks to go along with 46 defensive stops — the most among safeties by eight. he backed that up with another excellent season in 2017, before an underwhelming 2018 campaign that was reflective of the giants' overall struggles. collins showed in his rookie year that he has limitations as a safety — namely that he will struggle being the single-high player in a defensive scheme — but in the right position can be a dominant force and transform a defense.\n\nearl thomas, safety, seahawks\n\nwashington is among a number of teams that have leaned heavily on using a single-high free safety in running variations of cover-1 or cover-3. the seattle seahawks were the team that first really showed what that scheme could do, and thomas was the player whose unrivaled range made that scheme and the legion of boom secondary excel.\n\nas the scheme has proliferated throughout the league, no team has been able to match seattle's original unit, in part because it can't find its version of thomas.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe redskins could change that by securing the actual earl thomas in the middle of their secondary. thomas is 29 years old, and coming off a broken leg, but he had shown no sign of slowing down before he was hurt. thomas has unique range that allows him not only to make plays along the sideline, but also to do so when lining up about two and a half yards closer to the line of scrimmage than the average free safety. this season he had an overall pff grade of 91.3 before his injury, his fourth elite grade in the past five seasons.\n\nbrandon graham, edge rusher, eagles\n\nthe redskins have a decision to make about keeping preston smith, who is an unrestricted free agent this offseason, at outside linebacker opposite ryan kerrigan. smith, a 2015 second-round pick, was productive this season, producing 53 qb pressures, but if he departs, graham would be a very good option as a veteran replacement.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ngraham has been underrated throughout his career, in large part because his sack totals have not reflected just how effective he is at generating pressure. he is versatile enough to play in any scheme, and he proved again this season that he is one of the nfl's most productive edge rushers. graham recorded 70 pressures this season, the fourth-most of any edge defender. if he hits the open market, washington should give him a look.\n\nmatt paradis, center, broncos\n\nchase roullier was solid in 2018, but he finished the season ranked 17th in the nfl in grades among centers, and hasn't really shown a ton of untapped potential the team can rely upon moving forward. bringing in a player like paradis from denver would be a huge upgrade and secure a quality player on one of the most important positions along the offensive line, and possibly allow the redskins to move roullier to left guard to shore up the spot vacated by oft-injured free agent shawn lauvao.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nparadis ended 2018 as the no. 2 center in pro football focus grades, having also ranked in the top 10 each of the two previous seasons. he has a proven track record, allowing just five total pressures this season and only one sack over the last two years. while roullier surrendered just one sack this season, he gave up 19 total pressures. it's not a glamour position, but shoring up a key spot along the offensive line could bolster the offense in 2019 and beyond.\n\nronald darby, cornerback, eagles\n\nwhile redskins fans would likely want to see an upgrade at wide receiver, the free agent class doesn't offer much this year. instead, addressing the cornerback position — particularly if the team decides to release josh norman, which would produce significant cap savings — could be a different way for the team to upgrade its roster.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ndarby has missed time this season, but when he was on the field for the eagles he wasn't beaten for a catch longer than 33 yards. he allowed just 9.5 yards per catch and a passer rating of 86.5, which is higher than he allowed a year ago, but reflective of the overall increase leaguewide. norman, on the other hand, surrendered a passer rating of 114.2 this season, along with four touchdowns, and has seen his status as a top cornerback eroded. replacing norman with darby could go a long way toward improving the defense next year, if the finances make sense.
it's not just the democratic female senator from massachusetts who may feel compelled to come up with an answer. the 2020 presidential campaign is expected to include the largest-ever field of female candidates, all of them campaigning in the wake of the defeat of the first female nominee of a major party.\n\nad\n\nthe reasons for clinton's loss are still debated two years after the election. but even as rep. nancy pelosi (d-calif.) was elected house speaker on wednesday, the women looking at white house campaigns continue to shoulder gendered criticism and demands not placed on their male counterparts: to be strong but not too tough; to be assertive without being pushy, lest voters turn away for reasons that they may not acknowledge are sexist but that researchers say are.\n\nad\n\nthe website mcsweeney's covered the flap over warren's likability with a report whose headline, while satirical, made a pungent point: i don't hate women candidates — i just hated hillary and coincidentally i'm starting to hate elizabeth warren.\n\nfor democratic women running for president, it conjured what may be a preliminary contest in 2020: demonstrating they're not hillary clinton — nothing like her! — before they earn the nod to take on president trump.\n\nthat obstacle was also placed before democratic female candidates in the 2018 midterm elections, as republicans tried to tie them directly to clinton. it has also led some democrats to openly wonder whether the party would be smarter to avoid a female presidential candidate in 2020 — a notion offensive to many in the party.\n\nad\n\nit is ridiculous, said jess mcintosh, a democratic strategist who worked on clinton's campaign. we never look at loss by a man and say, 'i guess we shouldn't take another gamble on another white man' or 'i guess we should not have another veteran.' \n\nad\n\nthere's a particular oddity to the comparison between warren and clinton because the two women, aside from sharing a gender and being similar in age, have different life stories and views on issues.\n\nwarren graduated from the university of houston, an institution she refers to as a commuter college, and rutgers law school — not the typical path to the elite. clinton graduated from wellesley college before heading to yale law school.\n\nad\n\nwarren called out clinton by name in her 2003 book, the two-income trap, suggesting that the new york senator sided with big financial institutions during a seminal fight over bankruptcy legislation because she was beholden to the financial-services industry. she did not endorse clinton for president until june 2016, when clinton was already the presumptive democratic nominee.\n\nad\n\nother women considering presidential campaigns are similarly distinct from clinton.\n\nthree democratic senators mulling a run — kamala d. harris of california, amy klobuchar of minnesota and kirsten gillibrand of new york — are in their 50s, putting them a generation behind clinton and warren.\n\nad\n\nunlike clinton, raised in illinois before moving to arkansas with her husband, harris made a career in california and projects a distinctly west coast sensibility. klobuchar offers a midwestern vibe.\n\nthat has not stopped the comparisons. gillibrand — who took clinton's seat in the senate when the former first lady was named president barack obama's secretary of state — has been labeled by conservative commentator ben shapiro as a sort of hillary clinton mini-me.\n\nin warren's initial days as a presidential candidate, she seemed to go out of her way to push back on the likability question. on the evening of her announcement, she cracked open a bottle of beer in her kitchen, broadcasting the moment live via social media.\n\nad\n\nad\n\non wednesday, en route to an appearance on msnbc's rachel maddow show, she openly mocked the concept.\n\ni hear female candidates are most likable in the quiet car! she tweeted, with a video of herself and her husband on a train, and then promoted her upcoming appearance.\n\none change since clinton's defeat that may simplify strategies for female candidates is the #metoo movement, which created a heightened awareness about the shifting standards that women can face. that may have contributed to a growing willingness of 2018 candidates to call out what they see as sexist — and even racist — expectations.\n\nduring her congressional campaign in massachusetts, rep. ayanna pressley openly talked about the biases she faced as a black woman.\n\nad\n\ni'll tell you the truth. as a woman of color who has a platform, i have been asked to not come off as outraged or angry for fear of being labeled an angry black woman, pressley said in a speech she delivered amid the battle over the supreme court nomination of brett m. kavanaugh, who was accused of assaulting a woman when they were teenagers in suburban maryland. well, i am angry. and i am outraged. because this is outrageous.\n\nad\n\nthe midterm elections also were powered by female voters and activists, many of them animated by similar sentiments. that contributed to the democratic house takeover that returned pelosi to the speakership, which is seen by potential presidential candidates as a force in their favor.\n\nthe notion that all women are the same and that women should be judged on anything other than their own merit is just offensive and wrong, gillibrand said. women proved in 2018 that democrats could win back the house majority powered by extraordinary female candidates and a women-led grass-roots movement.\n\nad\n\nthe disparagement of female candidates, and comparisons to clinton, extended beyond pressley's race.\n\nas gretchen whitner campaigned for governor of michigan, a state that clinton narrowly lost, whitmer had to battle the idea that the state would reject another female candidate.\n\nad\n\nthere was some of that 2016 hangover, early on, said brandon dillon, the chairman of michigan's democratic party. there were some folks who didn't think that having a female candidate at the top of ticket was going to be a good thing.\n\nwhen clinton endorsed whitmer in the final week of the campaign, the republican national committee snarked that nobody knows how to win michigan better than hillary clinton.\n\nad\n\nwhitmer won overwhelmingly, defeating republican bill schuette by about 10 percentage points.\n\nin iowa, republicans worked to tie a number of female candidates to clinton and pelosi, said sean bagniewski, the chairman of the polk county democratic party.\n\nthat rattled some democrats, who were deeply aware that their state had never elected a woman from their party to congress, he said. but the victories of cindy axne and abby finkenauer — two women who beat republican incumbents in house contests in the fall, convinced many activists that any curse was broken, bagniewski said.\n\nad\n\nvoters have long had higher standards for women seeking executive positions, rather than legislative. winning one, however, seems to smooth the path for future victories, experts say.\n\nthere also might be strength in numbers for the upcoming crop of female presidential candidates. not all of them can be unlikable, said jennifer palmieri, who was clinton's communications director in 2016.\n\nif it continues to happen to the other female candidates, it will be more obvious that there are gender biases at work, palmieri said. you can have legitimate reasons for why you don't support a warren candidacy. you have to hope that people look deeper when it's something intangible, like something like likability.\n\nformer pennsylvania governor ed rendell is among the democrats who reject the idea that the party should be shy about nominating a female candidate.\n\nad\n\nthere will be hell to pay if there is not a woman on the ticket, at least, rendell said. he spoke positively about klobuchar, albeit in terms few would use for a male candidate in the same circumstances.\n\nshe's tough as anyone, and yet she appears to be the girl next door, rendell said. the person every father would like their son to meet and maybe marry.\n\non wednesday, as warren greeted lawmakers in boston on the opening of the commonwealth's legislative session, there was chatter about her chances.\n\nthe only comment i keep hearing about elizabeth is: is she electable? can she win? said state sen. david linsky (d). or does she have some of the same issues that took hillary clinton down in terms of likability?
i believe i know how to deal with any harsh criticism, but i am at a loss for how to deal with what, at first, seems to be genuine interest, but turns into more of a test of whether i am fulfilling an unwritten set of standards that non-home-schoolers seem to have for home-schooling families. they seem to think, for example, that we do better in co-ops, which are optional and not liked by all.\n\nad\n\ni would not normally wish for relatives and old friends to feel they could not ask us about our lives (though i did wish my gynecologist had waited until my physical exam was over to express interest), but the fact is that i can predict how each conversation will go as soon as i hear the question, has she started school?\n\nad\n\nconcerns over the acquisition of playmates and my readiness for the long-term commitment required for home-schooling will inevitably be expressed, and i will begin to feel that my home-school has a self-appointed principal, who is not thrilled with my performance.\n\nif i answer the questions sincerely, i seem to be acknowledging the role of the other person as an appropriate judge of the matter, while most other answers i can think of would make me appear defensive. i have given a great deal of thought to the benefits of home-schooling over public schooling, and yet i would never question other parents' choice to send their children to public school.\n\nad\n\nwould it be harsh to head off these conversations before they begin? if not, how can i politely do so?\n\nit is never a good idea to enter a conversation looking for a fight.\n\nad\n\nbut if the seemingly inevitable line of inquiry ensues, miss manners encourages you to say, we are teaching our children at home, which we have found unequivocally to be the best method for us. there is a lot of literature on the subject if you are interested.\n\nand then change the subject — perhaps to the relative schooling of your gynecologist.\n\ndear miss manners: the invitation to a wedding shower for my girlfriend's daughter states that it is a no hostess shower, and that guests are required to send a check for $50 to cover the brunch and group gift. maybe i'm old-fashioned, but that sounds distasteful to me.\n\nad\n\nmy husband and i were only recently invited to the wedding, after being told we could go because some other couples couldn't attend. what to think and do?\n\nit could not be any more clear that this family does not count you among their principal friends — but would be happy to take your money anyway. politely decline without excuse. miss manners assures you that feeling insulted by rude behavior has not gone out of fashion.\n\nnew miss manners columns are posted monday through saturday on washingtonpost.com/advice. you can send questions to miss manners at her website, missmanners.com.
panel signals it will pursue impeachment father robert drinan, a former congressman who served on the house judiciary committee during watergate, testifies at monday's hearing. (ap)\n\nrelated links\n\nfull coverage: clinton accused judiciary committee profiles\n\nby ruth marcus\n\nwashington post staff writer\n\ntuesday, november 10, 1998; page a01 meeting for the first time since gop setbacks in last tuesday's elections, republicans on the house judiciary committee yesterday strongly indicated they still plan to move forward with impeachment proceedings against president clinton. god, i'd like to forget all of this. i mean, who needs it? said judiciary chairman henry j. hyde (r-ill.), as the panel met to hear from constitutional experts about the standards for impeaching a president. we paid attention to the polls and the elections. but, hyde said, i'm frightened for the rule of law. . . . i really believe that notion that no man is above the law. he condemned all of the sophistries that i hear, rationales, justifications -- 'everybody does it. it was just about sex.'  in the wake of the gop's poor showing in last week's elections and the continuing large majority of americans who say they would like congress simply to drop the subject of clinton's alleged misconduct in the monica s. lewinsky matter, the president's prospects for avoiding impeachment seemed significantly improved. but committee republicans yesterday appeared more energized than chastened, despite their party's five-seat house loss and the conclusion by strategists in both parties that the gop may want to consider an exit strategy for an investigation that may have backfired politically. i think the election probably affected the disposition in the senate more than it did anything here, rep. lindsey graham (r-s.c.) said outside the hearing room. i do not see any change in mood, said rep. asa hutchinson (r-ark.). they are two of the key republican members of an informal breakfast club on judiciary, a bipartisan group that has discussed the possibility of a solution short of impeachment. democrats who had hoped yesterday's session might mark the start of a new, more conciliatory attitude by the gop were disappointed. rep. jerrold nadler (d-n.y.) said republicans haven't read the election results and that it was quite likely the committee would vote out articles of impeachment. in comments outside the hearing, several republicans said they did not think disciplinary measures short of impeachment, such as censure, would be appropriate, and some of the experts who testified yesterday said they saw constitutional problems with that approach. i don't think censure is a possibility, said rep. steve buyer (r-ind.). either we proceed or we do not. hutchinson expressed similar reservations. the options are limited constitutionally, he said. opening the daylong constitutional law seminar, rep. charles t. canady (r-fla.) was biting in his assessment of clinton's conduct and the arguments by the president's supporters that, however reprehensible, it did not rise to the level of an impeachable offense. obstruction of justice and lying under oath by a president inevitably subvert the respect for law which is essential to the well-being of our constitutional system, said canady, chairman of the judiciary subcommittee on the constitution. a president who engages in such behavior, canady said, must be called to account for setting a dangerous example of lawlessness and corruption. he must be called to account for subverting the respect for law, which is the foundation of our constitution. graham said he was inclined not to support articles of impeachment for clinton's testimony at his deposition by paula jones's lawyers, but that the president's testimony before the grand jury was a good candidate for an article of impeachment. the subcommittee's ranking member, rep. robert c. bobby scott (d-va.), warned against doing irreparable harm to our system of government by establishing a dangerous and partisan 'impeach at will' precedent that will forever weaken the institution of the presidency. moreover, he said, the american people have now clearly told us that it is time to move on. members looking for guidance about whether clinton's misconduct warrants impeachment -- -or, perhaps more likely, to buttress their already stated positions -- had an array of choices yesterday. the panel of experts was divided among those who argued that clinton's alleged conduct could easily justify impeachment and those who said it fell far short of what the founding fathers had in mind when they envisioned removing a president from office for treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. ten of the 19 who testified represented the republican side, eight the democratic approach, and one -- william and mary law professor michael gerhardt -- was a shared witness. former reagan justice department official charles cooper said clinton's actions are not at the fringe of high crimes and misdemeanors. they're at the core of it. responding to the argument that clinton's alleged lies were less serious because they involved private sexual matters, northwestern university law professor stephen presser said, no person, and least of all no president . . . can pick and choose over which matters he will be truthful and over which he will not. but georgetown university law professor susan low bloch said it would be a dangerous and frightening prospect to remove a president for such actions. university of chicago law professor cass sunstein warned that using the very heavy artillery of impeachment to go after clinton would expose many future presidents to such attacks and end the tradition of mutual arms control that has greatly limited the use of impeachment. experts on both sides expressed concerns about the constitutionality of censuring the president in some way and, in particular, imposing some kind of fine on him. in light of the founders' concern that the president not be subjected to political molestation by congress, it cannot be emphasized too strongly that impeachment is the only means granted to congress to censure the president, said university of london professor gary mcdowell, a gop witness. it is either impeachment or nothing. georgetown university law professor rev. robert drinan, a former democratic member of the judiciary committee, agreed that censure would establish a dangerous precedent. . . . almost every election cycle we would have the congress censuring the president if he were of a different party. but gerhardt said censure has a textual, historical pedigree. he said two presidents -- andrew jackson and james polk -- and five judges have faced censure votes. the lawmakers also talked about whether the house could conclude that clinton had committed impeachable offenses yet choose not to impeach him. rep. thomas m. barrett (d-wis.) got gop panel members mcdowell and yeshiva university law professor john mcginnis to agree that the house could decide not to proceed. duke university law professor william van alstyne, also a gop witness, agreed. the house has the political discretion to express its dismay, disappointment, recrimination, and still conclude it is not appropriate to take up the time of the senate, he said. but george washington university law professor jonathan turley said that were the house to conclude that clinton committed impeachable offenses, the role at that point should be the submission to the senate. . . . it would be an enormous mistake for this matter to end in the house with some form of extra-constitutional means like censure. harvard university law professor laurence h. tribe disagreed, saying it is a fallacy to conclude that you have to pass the buck to the senate.\n\n© copyright the washington post company back to the top
ad\n\nad\n\nhagerty, a private equity executive who served as president trump's ambassador to japan but has never held elected office, joined a quixotic effort led by sen. ted cruz (r-tex.) to contest the counting of legally certified electoral votes. notably, four of the 10 gop senators to support the cruz gambit were just elected in november. besides hagerty, the others are sens. roger marshall (kan.), tommy tuberville (ala.) and cynthia lummis (wyo.).\n\nnot one of the dozen gop senators who have announced plans to turn what is normally a pro forma session into a circus-like spectacle served in the chamber before the tea party wave of 2010. this reflects not just the trump takeover of the gop since 2016 but a more fundamental radicalization. the party, while divided, is shifting to become less committed to the democratic process and the foundational governing institutions that have made the american experiment work.\n\nby design, the senate has six-year terms to insulate members from scenarios like trump's bid to disenfranchise millions of voters. these new members do not need to face voters again until 2026.\n\nad\n\nad\n\njoining hagerty in opposing the certification of biden's electors is sen. marsha blackburn (r-tenn.). just two years ago, she replaced bob corker when he retired. illustrating how different she is than he would have been if he had sought another term, corker publicly congratulated biden on his victory on nov. 10. a week later, the former senator tweeted that responsible citizens cannot let the reckless actions by [trump] and his legal team stand. republicans have an obligation when the subject is of such importance to challenge demagoguery and patently false statements.\n\nblackburn and hagerty defended their position in a joint statement: on behalf of tennesseans, we are taking a united stand against the tainted electoral results from the recent presidential election. american democracy relies on the consent of the governed. allegations of voter fraud, irregularities and unconstitutional actions diminish public confidence in what should be a free, fair and transparent process.\n\nas a reminder, this election was not close: biden won 306 electoral votes to trump's 232. that is the same margin of victory the president prevailed with four years ago. the former vice president also beat the incumbent by about 7 million votes. nearly 100 judges across the political spectrum, including several trump appointees, have ruled in court against the president or one of his allies seeking to challenge or overturn the election.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe other republican senators who have said they plan to oppose election certification are ron johnson (wis.), elected in 2010; james lankford (okla.) and steve daines (mont.), elected in 2014; john neely kennedy (la.), elected in 2016; and mike braun (ind.) and josh hawley (mo.), elected in 2018. (kevin uhrmacher is tracking what every gop senator has said about this issue.)\n\non the house side, rep. mo brooks (r-ala.) told reporters that more than 50 republicans are backing his move to challenge certification.\n\nsenate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) had urged gop senators not to contest the results, warning that it will inevitably fail because democrats control the house and the donnybrook will only highlight divisions within their own party's ranks. republican senators such as mitt romney (utah), ben sasse (neb.) and pat toomey (pa.) have spoken out against the effort over more principled concerns.\n\nad\n\nad\n\non sunday night, sen. tom cotton (r-ark.) tried to thread the needle. he said he supports a commission to study the results and expressed concern about unspecified irregularities, but the potential 2024 presidential candidate added that he will not vote against certifying the electors because doing so would essentially end presidential elections and place that power in the hands of whichever party controls congress.\n\nthe founders entrusted our elections chiefly to the states — not congress, cotton wrote in a statement. they entrusted the election of our president to the people, acting through the electoral college — not congress. and they entrusted the adjudication of election disputes to the courts — not congress.\n\nquote of the day\n\nit is difficult to conceive of a more anti-democratic and anti-conservative act than a federal intervention to overturn the results of state-certified elections and disenfranchise millions of americans, former house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) said in a statement on sunday. the fact that this effort will fail does not mean it will not do significant damage to american democracy.\n\nmore on the voting wars\n\nin a phone call on jan. 2, president trump insisted he won the state and threatened vague legal consequences. here are excerpts from the call. (obtained by the washington post)\n\ni just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have, trump told georgia's secretary of state.\n\nthe president pushed fellow republican brad raffensperger on saturday to find enough votes to overturn his defeat in an extraordinary one-hour phone call. amy gardner obtained a recording of the conversation, in which trump alternately berated georgia's top elections official, tried to flatter him, begged him to act and threatened him with vague criminal consequences if he refused to pursue his false claims. so what are we going to do here, folks? i only need 11,000 votes. fellas, i need 11,000 votes. give me a break, trump said. there's no way i lost georgia.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe rambling and at times incoherent conversation offered a remarkable glimpse of how consumed and desperate the president remains about his loss, gardner notes. the secretary of state repeatedly sought to correct trump, saying at one point, 'mr. president, the problem you have with social media, they — people can say anything.' 'oh this isn't social media,' trump retorted. 'this is trump media.' (read the full transcript and listen to the audio of the call here.)\n\nthe only democrat on georgia's state election board called on raffensperger to investigate possible civil and criminal violations committed by trump during the call. david j. worley, an atlanta lawyer, said the transcript amounted to probable cause to believe that trump violated state law. he cited georgia code § 21-2-604, which makes it a crime to solicit someone else to commit election fraud. such a violation can be punished by up to three years in prison. asking the secretary to change the votes is a textbook definition of election fraud, worley told teo armus.\n\nsome lawyers argue that trump may have violated federal law. the question, according to justin levitt, a law professor at loyola marymount university, is whether trump was 'knowingly and willfully' pressuring raffensperger to count nonexistent votes when he told the gop official, 'i just want to find 11,780 votes.' … considering that two recounts, an audit and several judges have upheld [biden's] win in georgia, levitt said it is clear trump was not actually pushing for an 'honest tally' of the votes, armus reports. michael r. bromwich, a former justice department inspector general, put it more bluntly on twitter: 'his best defense would be insanity.' …\n\nother legal scholars said that trump possibly violated 18 u.s. code 241, which makes it illegal to participate in a conspiracy against people exercising their civil rights. that longstanding statute has been used frequently to prosecute acts of voter intimidation, especially those committed by the ku klux klan against black voters. but charging trump under that code would require prosecutors to show that someone else on the phone call was also aiding and abetting a scheme, levitt said.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthere are but 16 days left in president trump's term, but there is no doubt that he will use all of his remaining time in office to inflict as much damage as he can on democracy — with members of a now-divided republican party acting as enablers, writes chief correspondent dan balz\n\ntrump began his presidency trying to obstruct justice. he's ending it trying to obstruct democracy, and with an alarmingly large cadre of co-conspirators, writes deputy editorial page editor ruth marcus\n\nit's impeachable. it's likely illegal. it's a coup, adds columnist jen rubin . there must be a response to a president who exploits his office for the purpose of overthrowing an election. the evidence is on tape. the next attorney general should move forward, if for no other reason, to deter further attempts at such reprehensible conduct.\n\nvice president-elect kamala d. harris on jan. 3 slammed president trump for urging georgia election officials to find enough votes to overturn his defeat. (the washington post)\n\ngeorgia's senators struggle to steer around gop infighting ahead of tuesday's runoffs.\n\nif democrats jon ossoff and raphael warnock defeat sens. david perdue and kelly loeffler tomorrow, their party would control the senate. vice president-elect kamala harris campaigned with them in savannah on sunday, and both biden and trump are scheduled to headline rallies in the state later today. harris referred to trump's call with raffensperger as the voice of desperation and a baldfaced, bold abuse of power by the president of the united states. perdue and loeffler have not just echoed trump's baseless claims but also called for raffensperger's resignation. republican voters continue to hear a contradictory message from their party: vote in large numbers in a system that the gop's most popular politician says is riddled with fraud, cleve wootson jr. reports.\n\nneither loeffler nor perdue — whose senate term expired sunday — cast votes on friday when the senate overrode trump's veto of the defense reauthorization bill. loeffler declined to say how she would have voted during a sunday appearance on fox news, during which she also dodged whether she supports challenging the election results. perdue, appearing separately on the cable channel, said he would not be eligible to participate in wednesday's vote because the runoff results would not be certified in time, but suggested he would be on board with the challenge if he could be there. both loeffler and perdue endorsed trump's call for $2,000 stimulus checks after he made the demand, even as mcconnell likened it to socialism.\n\ngeorgia's republican governor has gone radio silent.\n\nloeffler has brought in the biggest gop names in the country in the closing days of her re-election runoff campaign, including [cruz], sen. lindsey graham of south carolina, and, on sunday, gov. kristi noem from south dakota, where the population of the entire state is smaller than gwinnett county, the atlanta journal-constitution reports. but absent from the campaign trail in the final week leading up to election day has been gov. brian kemp. although kemp campaigned frequently for the senators earlier in the fall, he has been missing from the final republican push ahead of tuesday's runoffs, embroiled instead in a contentious standoff with trump … repeated requests for comment about kemp's absence went unanswered sunday by the governor's office and loeffler's campaign … despite the governor's support, not the least of which was kemp's decision to appoint her to the senate in 2019, loeffler focused on just one chief executive sunday on the trail. 'are you ready to welcome president trump to georgia on monday night?' loeffler asked the cartersville crowd.\n\nall 10 living former defense secretaries say the time to question results has passed.\n\nthe former pentagon chiefs issued their warning sunday evening in an opinion piece that they co-wrote and published in the washington post. its authors include trump's two former defense secretaries, jim mattis and mark t. esper, as well as each surviving, senate-confirmed pentagon chief dating back to donald h. rumsfeld in the 1970s, dan lamothe reports. the article brings together a group of republicans and democrats who disagree on many national security issues. its genesis is a conversation between eric edelman, a former u.s. ambassador and defense official, and former vice president and defense secretary richard b. cheney about how the military might be used in coming days … while trump has called reports that he discussed the possibility of invoking martial law to overturn election results 'fake news,' he did have michael flynn, a retired army general and former national security adviser for trump, at the white house recently after flynn suggested on television that trump could declare martial law and use the military to hold new elections. protests are expected in washington on trump's behalf this week, and the president has encouraged his supporters to show up, tweeting: 'be there, will be wild!' … after cheney expressed interest in co-authoring an opinion piece, edelman solicited participation from other former defense secretaries, and wrote a draft of the article along with eliot cohen, a former republican national security official who is dean of the johns hopkins school for advanced international studies. some of the defense secretaries requested revisions, but nothing significant to the message …\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwilliam cohen, [a former republican senator] who served as defense secretary under president bill clinton, said in an interview that the discussion of martial law alarmed him, especially after trump's use of the military and other federal forces to remove protesters outside the white house in june. the former defense secretary also cited the use of federal law enforcement personnel to remove protesters in portland, ore., in unmarked vehicles as another abuse of power. while he said he has no doubts about the willingness of gen. mark a. milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, and other senior military officials to follow the law, he is concerned that violence started by trump supporters such as the proud boys in coming days could be used as a pretext to use the military against civilians again. 'it's a very dangerous course of action that needs to be called out before it happens,' cohen said of using the military against civilians.\n\nthe other former secdefs who signed onto the op-ed are ash carter, bob gates, chuck hagel, leon panetta and bill perry. the group of 10 also calls on the trump team to assist biden's transition team: acting defense secretary christopher c. miller and his subordinates — political appointees, officers and civil servants — are each bound by oath, law and precedent to facilitate the entry into office of the incoming administration, and to do so wholeheartedly. they must also refrain from any political actions that undermine the results of the election or hinder the success of the new team. we call upon them, in the strongest terms, to do as so many generations of americans have done before them. this final action is in keeping with the highest traditions and professionalism of the u.s. armed forces, and the history of democratic transition in our great country.\n\nrep. liz cheney (r-wyo.), the no. 3 in house gop leadership and the former vp's daughter, has circulated a 21-page memo to colleagues rebutting the case made by the senators who plan to challenge the results. such objections set an exceptionally dangerous precedent, threatening to steal states' explicit constitutional responsibility for choosing the president and bestowing it instead on congress, she writes. this is directly at odds with the constitution's clear text and our core beliefs as republicans.

by retaining manusky and inside linebackers coach kirk olivadotti — and potentially assistant defensive backs coach aubrey pleasant, who remained in negotiations to receive a promotion to defensive backs coach — redskins officials ensured that the returning players will have coaches who speak a familiar language and already have a good understanding of their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nplayers had a great deal of respect for those three coaches. throughout last season, players, along with team officials and gruden, praised all three for their strong communication and teaching skills.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nasked about manusky on sunday, linebacker ryan kerrigan said, he just knows [football], and he makes his players understand it, too. not just knowing our responsibilities but understanding what the call means for the entire defense. [it] makes you a smarter player.\n\ngeneral manager scot mccloughan described manusky as probably the best outside linebackers coach in the league during a talk last season. mccloughan knows manusky's work well. the two worked together in san francisco for three years (2007 to 2009) when mccloughan was in the front office there and manusky was defensive coordinator. mccloughan was instrumental in bringing manusky on staff last season when the coach became available after four seasons as indianapolis's defensive coordinator.\n\nmanusky and gruden also developed a strong relationship during the past year, people within the organization say.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbecause of their respect and appreciation for manusky, redskins officials opted to keep him even after firing barry on jan. 5. they told outside candidates that they wanted to retain him as an outside linebackers coach.\n\nteam brass wanted the same for olivadotti and pleasant, the other two assistants retained when barry, defensive line coach robb akey and defensive backs coach perry fewell were fired.\n\nolivadotti has coached with the redskins for 14 seasons (2000 to 2010 and 2014 to present), serving under eight head coaches. players and coaches say he has a great football mind and a gift for breaking the game down in digestible bits for young players to help expedite their development.pleasant just completed his fourth season with the redskins, spending the past three working with the defensive backs under raheem morris and then fewell.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nsean mcvay and the rams tried to lure him to los angeles, but the redskins didn't want to let him get away. if they finalize that deal, the redskins will expect pleasant to get more out of young cornerbacks bashaud breeland, quinton dunbar and kendall fuller while also developing converted safety su'a cravens.\n\nbut most of the pressure will rest on the shoulders of manusky, a charismatic former nfl linebacker who relentlessly drilled and challenged his players last season. manusky helped kerrigan produce one of his best seasons, and trent murphy had a career year.\n\nmanusky has to find a way to bring some ferocity to a predominantly toothless unit. the redskins have ranked 28th in total defense in each of the past two seasons. this past season, washington ranked 24th in rushing yards allowed, 25th in passing yards allowed, 19th in points allowed, 32nd on third downs, 17th in takeaways and 26th in red-zone touchdowns allowed.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe redskins made few game-changing plays on defense. their defensive line got gashed against the run far too often and also did little to assist in pass rushing. the inside linebackers and outside linebacker preston smith could have provided a more consistent impact. and safety has been an area of weakness.\n\ntalent is among washington's many problems. people around the nfl said that the shortage of pieces to work with was a factor in the redskins' struggles to land their most desired candidates, gus bradley and wade phillips.\n\nwith bradley going to the chargers and phillips to the rams, the redskins were left with manusky, rob ryan, jason tarver, dennis thurman, john pagano and mike pettine to interview. they settled on manusky largely because of his tough mind-set, one person familiar with the situation said, and because of his preexisting knowledge of the unit.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nredskins officials need to place a high priority on upgrading the talent on defense, both through free agency and the draft, particularly along the line, at safety and possibly at inside linebacker. but it's impossible to solve every area of weakness in one offseason.\n\nso it will be on manusky to find a way to maximize the talent he has to work with, mask the weaknesses and dial up more aggressive schemes to cause the disruption that the defense has lacked. deficiencies in those three areas were among the biggest criticisms of barry during his two seasons as coordinator.\n\nentering the final month of the season, when asked about potential changes on defense, redskins decision-makers said continuity carried high importance. a switch from barry would have meant some of washington's players would be playing for their third coordinator in four years. they worried that such a move would stunt the growth of younger players. for a while, they leaned toward bringing barry back, hoping that improved talent would lead to better results.but after assessing the season, gruden ultimately decided that despite his respect for barry and their strong friendship, the unit needed a change.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhowever, retaining three coaches will keep players from starting over entirely.\n\ngruden has guided the redskins to back-to-back winning seasons — a first for the franchise since the 1996 and 1997 campaigns. however, his 2016 squad fell short of the playoffs despite having multiple opportunities to punch its ticket. shortcomings on defense played a role in a number of losses.\n\ngruden is entering the fourth season of a five-year contract. it's believed that he needs a strong 2017 campaign to earn an extension. dramatic regression could prompt owner daniel snyder, team president bruce allen and mccloughan to dismiss the coach rather than let him enter a fifth season.\n\nad\n\nthe uncertainty of gruden's future is believed to have been another factor in the lack of desirable outside candidates for washington's coordinator job.\n\nad\n\nbut the redskins now turn to manusky to see whether he can help provide the boost they need. in nine seasons as a coordinator, manusky has never overseen a top-10 defense. his units on average have ranked 18th in total defense and 17th in points allowed. one of his best seasons came in 2014, when the colts' defense ranked 11th in the league in total defense, and another came in 2009, when his 49ers unit ranked fourth in the nfl in points allowed.
dear amy: my husband and i have been married for six years. he is a christian, and is active in his church. i am an atheist. while he tries to convert me on occasion, we have no problems with our religious differences. in fact, the conversations we have are some of the highlights of our marriage.\n\nmy husband is not a tidy man. he rarely does any cleaning, but will help with the dishes or laundry sometimes, and that's good enough for me. the one area that i have (slightly) nagged him about over the years is his car. i usually end up waiting for his car to get really bad, then go and clean it out myself, or pay to have it detailed while he is at work.\n\ni regularly ask him to clean out his car, but in six long years, he has never done it. until yesterday. yesterday, he suddenly spent two hours cleaning out his car. i was thrilled! then, he told me why he cleaned out his car.\n\napparently, his pastor had needed a ride somewhere. after the ride in my husband's car, the pastor gave my husband some great advice: clean out your car. and he immediately did it.\n\namy, i am happy that my husband finally cleaned his own car. but i'm a little upset that after six years of me asking him to perform this small task, he listened to his pastor and not to me.\n\nam i looking a gift horse in the mouth, or am i right to feel a bit slighted?\n\nbent out of shape\n\none reason your husband has never cleaned his car is because every once in a while — when it gets really bad — a magical elf appears and does it for him. if he has been an especially good boy, the elf actually pays for the car to be professionally detailed while he's at work! no wonder he has religion: because in his life good things just . . . happen!\n\nthe way to stop nagging is to simply stop. disengage. most of us listen to people outside our families a little more closely than we listen to family members. this dynamic is why you can bug your child about something for years, but the minute a peer says the same thing, it becomes true.\n\nyour husband is showing you that he understands that cleanliness is next to godliness. you should roll your eyes at the source of this sudden transformation, and tell him you hope it sticks.\n\ndear amy: my husband and i are friends with another couple. we usually get along great and have lots of fun . . . except when the male friend, jack, goes into braggart mode.\n\njack will start in on my husband, stating he can beat him at any game, especially racquetball. my husband made the mistake of asking jack to play racquetball — more for exercise than competition, but he has stopped asking since the chest-beating started.\n\njack's wife excuses his behavior by saying, this is just jack being jack. jack blames the behavior on his competitive upbringing.\n\nit is obnoxious, annoying and happens too often. jack went so far — once — as to call us both stupid, later apologizing.\n\nany suggestions on how to get this to stop?\n\nhad it\n\nyou can draw jack's attention to his behavior and see if he is willing to change (his apology to you means that he knows he crossed the line). people who brag are overcompensating in the most obvious way.\n\nthe next time he flies into full-braggart mode, you can try to slow things down and get his attention by saying, gently, jack, you know we would still like you even if you weren't the best at everything? you don't have to prove your greatness to us — we're your friends. repeat, if necessary.\n\nkindness might be the way to kill off this terrible habit.\n\ndear amy: i was shocked by your response to not your chum in chico, who didn't like it when coffee clerks made small talk. bah humbug! why be such a grouch when people are just trying to be friendly?\n\ndisappointed\n\ni love pleasantries, but don't like specific comments regarding what i am purchasing, or whether i look tired, stressed, happy or sad. i realize that clerks have a very tough and repetitive job to do, and that they are sometimes forced to greet customers in a specific way. i think that for most people, a smile, a simple greeting and then fulfilling the order competently is appreciated.
ad\n\nad\n\nnos. 1-20\n\ngeneral manager chris ballard did a masterful job last offseason of rebuilding the offensive line for the return of quarterback andrew luck. he also began to reconstruct the defense, striking it big when he drafted linebacker darius leonard. that work of solidifying the defense must continue, and ballard would be wise to give luck another reliable wide receiver to complement t.y. hilton.\n\ndallas cowboys (10-6, first-round draft pick was traded to raiders)\n\nthe cowboys' trade of their first-round draft choice to the raiders for wider receiver amari cooper turned out to be a savvy move. cooper's production helped the cowboys to the nfc east title. but now they must ensure that the deal looks good in the long term as well as in the short term by signing cooper to a contract extension. he is to make $13.924 million next season and would be eligible for free agency after that.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nlos angeles chargers (12-4)\n\nit's probably time for the chargers to add a quarterback of the future to groom as the eventual successor to philip rivers. it's not that rivers is done; he's not. he played well this season and likely has productive years remaining. but he just turned 37 and the chargers need to begin thinking about their future at the position.\n\nnos. 21-24 (lost in wild-card round)\n\nseattle seahawks (10-6)\n\nthe seahawks overachieved, to the credit of coach pete carroll, in a transitional season, reaching the playoffs before losing a first-round game at dallas. the top offseason priority should be retooling the offensive line, with qb russell wilson having been sacked 51 times during the regular season. it's long overdue. wilson last was sacked fewer than 40 times in a season in his rookie year in 2012.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbaltimore ravens (10-6)\n\nthe ravens have said they'll keep john harbaugh as their head coach, but it's possible they'll receive a trade offer or two for him. eric decosta takes over at gm upon ozzie newsome's exit, and he'll deal with the expected departure of quarterback joe flacco. with the ravens committed to lamar jackson at qb, they might want to add a running back if they plan to stick with this season's run-first approach.\n\nhouston texans (11-5)\n\nthe losses of will fuller and demaryius thomas to season-ending injuries left the texans shorthanded at wide receiver. fuller should return to go with deandre hopkins and keke coutee, but thomas's future in houston is less certain. the offensive line is a major issue after quarterback deshaun watson was sacked 62 times during the regular season and three times during the playoff loss to the colts.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nchicago bears (12-4; first-round draft pick was traded to raiders)\n\nthe bears failed to deal with their season-long kicking issues with cody parkey, and it cost them dearly in their playoff loss to the eagles. it wouldn't be easy for the bears to extricate themselves from parkey's four-year, $15 million contract, which includes $9 million in guaranteed money. but can they keep him? they also might need to replace defensive coordinator vic fangio, who could land a head coaching job.\n\nnos. 1-20 (did not make playoffs)\n\narizona cardinals (record: 3-13)\n\nthe cardinals are on the clock for the top overall selection as they search for a replacement for steve wilks, the coach they fired after only one season. they have their would-be franchise quarterback in josh rosen, so they undoubtedly would like to trade down. unfortunately for them, there's probably not a quarterback in the draft to prompt overwhelming trade offers.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nsan francisco 49ers (4-12)\n\nthe season-ending knee injury to quarterback jimmy garoppolo kept the niners from building on their strong finish to 2017. as a result, general manager john lynch and coach kyle shanahan will enter year 3 of their six-year contracts with little progress made toward respectability. ensuring that garoppolo's return goes smoothly, without significant setbacks, is by far the main priority entering next season.\n\nnew york jets (4-12)\n\nthe numbers weren't great for quarterback sam darnold in his rookie season, but he showed enough promise to justify the no. 3 overall choice in last year's draft. the keys now are to bring in an offensive-minded head coach to oversee darnold's development and to add some talent around him, perhaps by making a bid to acquire running back le'veon bell.\n\noakland raiders (4-12)\n\nad\n\nad\n\nnow that mike mayock is in place as general manager alongside coach jon gruden, it's all about how to use that trio of first-round draft picks. the trades of khalil mack and amari cooper mean that the raiders must get a great pass rusher and standout wide receiver just to break even. having a place to play next season also would be nice.\n\ntampa bay buccaneers (5-11)\n\nthe buccaneers are making a head coaching change, having fired dirk koetter, but say they are committed to sticking with jameis winston at quarterback. he is to be paid $20.922 million next season in the fifth-year option of his original rookie deal exercised by the team. how will head coaching candidates react to being told that winston will be their quarterback, and will the buccaneers eventually make a more lasting commitment to winston with a long-term contract?\n\nad\n\nad\n\nnew york giants (5-11)\n\nso much for the decision to pass on a quarterback with the second overall choice in last year's draft to take running back saquon barkley. nothing against barkley, who's terrific. but this is not the draft to be looking for a future franchise qb, and the giants probably will have little choice but to enter another season with eli manning as the starter. they do need to add the best young quarterback they can find, however.\n\njacksonville jaguars (5-11)\n\nowner shad khan opted against an organizational housecleaning even after the jaguars went from reaching the afc championship game to being one of the league's biggest disappointments this season. the decision to stick with blake bortles going into the season backfired. it's probably time for the jaguars to stop hoping that bortles will work out and go in a new direction at quarterback.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ndetroit lions (6-10)\n\nmatt patricia, the lions' rookie head coach, inherited a team that went 9-7 under predecessor jim caldwell in 2017 and promptly went 6-10. patricia's defenders talk about the need to establish a new culture in detroit. but what he has established is a six-win culture. the lions had better hope that patricia grows into the job. the offense must improve, beginning with patricia's choice of a new coordinator, and golden tate, who was traded midseason, must be replaced.\n\nbuffalo bills (6-10)\n\nquarterback josh allen was an effective runner as a rookie but was even more unpolished as a passer than expected, with an ugly completion percentage of 52.8 and an unsightly passer rating of 67.9. the bills' offseason will be devoted to trying to mold allen into a more accurate and reliable pocket passer while utilizing their improved salary cap situation to upgrade the offense around him, likely adding a no. 1 wide receiver and deciding whether to keep running back lesean mccoy.\n\ndenver broncos (6-10)\n\nfront office football czar john elway is looking for a new coach after firing vance joseph. will elway be back in the quarterback market as well? that's an interesting call. case keenum threw too many interceptions and didn't live up to expectations in his first season in denver. but if he somehow could recapture his 2017 level of play while with the vikings, he'd probably be better than anyone the broncos could add this offseason.\n\ncincinnati bengals (6-10)\n\nit will be a new era for the bengals after they and their coach of 16 seasons, marvin lewis, parted ways in what the team called a mutual decision. owner mike brown could opt for a more widespread organizational reset that also would include a change at quarterback. the structure of andy dalton's contract, with no guaranteed money remaining, means that he could be traded without the bengals incurring any so-called dead money on their 2019 salary cap.\n\ngreen bay packers (6-9-1)\n\nthe packers' offseason is all about ensuring that whichever coach they hire to replace the fired mike mccarthy is on the same page with aaron rodgers. it seemed, especially in mccarthy's final season, that there was a disconnect between coach and quarterback. that simply cannot happen with green bay's next coach. the packers can't waste any more of rodgers's prime, and they need him to get back to being a player who negates the deficiencies elsewhere on the roster.\n\nmiami dolphins (7-9)\n\ncoach adam gase failed to make things work with ryan tannehill. now gase has been fired and the dolphins' new regime, with general manager chris grier being given additional front office authority, must decide whether to stay the course with tannehill or start over at quarterback.\n\natlanta falcons (7-9)\n\nthe defense and running game must be repaired. matt ryan and the passing game were fine. but the falcons ranked 28th in the league in total defense and 27th in rushing offense. even in a pass-happy league, the falcons need to be better balanced to get back to having success.\n\nwashington redskins (7-9)\n\nthe quarterback situation is a quandary, with the uncertainty about alex smith's return and the salary cap constraints created by his big contract. the redskins probably must prepare to play without smith by getting a qb to go with colt mccoy and, possibly, josh johnson. adding a no. 1 wide receiver certainly wouldn't hurt.\n\ncarolina panthers (7-9)\n\nthe main issue is getting qb cam newton healthy. newton was on the fringes of league mvp conversation early in the season but his ailing shoulder contributed to the panthers' downward spiral in the season's second half. newton sat out the final two games. the panthers must make sure his shoulder is sound, and they probably have to add a better option as their backup quarterback, just in case.\n\ncleveland browns (7-8-1)\n\nthings are looking up for the browns. that hasn't been said very often over the years. baker mayfield is the real deal and looks like an honest-to-goodness franchise qb. the pieces are in place for a winner. general manager john dorsey merely needs to do some roster tweaking and make sure he hires a coach who will oversee mayfield's development deftly.\n\nminnesota vikings (8-7-1)\n\nthings didn't go quite as expected in the first season of kirk cousins's fully guaranteed three-year, $84 million contract. but there's no turning back now and there are no refunds on that $84 million. so the vikings must regroup and try to upgrade the team around their quarterback, beginning with his offensive line.\n\ntennessee titans (9-7)\n\nso is marcus mariota a true franchise quarterback or not? four years into his nfl career, it's difficult to know. he has totaled 24 touchdown passes and 23 interceptions over the past two seasons, and he's had difficulty avoiding injuries. no one is saying that it's time for the titans to give up on mariota. but his recovery from nerve injuries and the signals that the team sends about his future contract situation will be the biggest issues of the titans' offseason.\n\npittsburgh steelers (9-6-1)\n\nremember when quarterback ben roethlisberger, running back le'veon bell and wide receiver antonio brown were going to be the centerpieces of a super bowl team? now the steelers await bell's pending departure in free agency after he sat out the entire season in a contract staredown with the team and they must figure out what, if anything, to do with brown, who reportedly asked to be traded after his dust-up with roethlisberger.
tabor also said customers wanted more chances to win smaller prizes. in response, both powerball and mega millions tweaked their formulas.\n\nad\n\nthose two things just so happen to fuel sales (not to mention that mega millions tickets used to be $1).\n\nhow mega millions works\n\nhere's how mega millions used to work: players picked five numbers from 1 to 75 and a mega number of 1 to 15. the odds of winning the top prize were 1-in-258,890,850.\n\nad\n\nthen, in october, mega millions changed the rules.\n\nnow players pick numbers from 1 to 70 and a mega number of 1 to 25. the odds of winning the jackpot are now 1-in-302,575,350.\n\nreducing the number of balls for the first five numbers increases the chances of winning a smaller prize. but raising the number of mega balls makes it harder to win the jackpot.\n\nstarting jackpots will more than double from $15 million to $40 million, and jackpots will grow faster overall. there will be better odds to win $1 million prizes and higher secondary prizes, the multi-state lottery said in a release.\n\nthe move is paying out for some players in the short run.\n\nad\n\ntwo tickets sold tuesday — one in ohio and the other in florida — each matched five numbers for a $1 million prize. (one of the two paid out $4 million because of an optional megaplier, quadrupling the award.)\n\nad\n\nthat makes six payouts of $1 million since the rule change, a wednesday release said.\n\nmega millions tickets are sold in 44 states, plus the district of columbia and the u.s. virgin islands. but not all of those jurisdictions use a megaplier.\n\npowerball announced that a single ticket sold at a convenience store in chicopee, mass., was the winner of the aug. 23 $758.7 million jackpot. here's how winning the lottery has brought more than a windfall for some. (taylor turner/the washington post)\n\nhow the formula changed powerball\n\nit may be too early to determine whether mega millions's rule modification has boosted sales, but it is clear that powerball benefited from a similar change in 2015. powerball's revenue for fiscal 2016 rose $7 billion from the year before. revenue had also climbed in 2015 from 2014, by $3 billion, compared with basically no growth from 2013 to 2014.\n\nad\n\nlottery ticket sales, defended by state commissions as a way to help fund education and veterans programs, have drawn fire in recent years. in 2014, hbo's john oliver delivered a scathing segment questioning the potential harm for addiction and some dubious claims of how much revenue actually reaches state programs. and that was before powerball's rule change.\n\nu.s. lottery ticket sales in fiscal 2016 totaled more than $80 billion, according to figures from the north american association of state and provincial lotteries. that's more than was spent on movies, video games, books, music and sports tickets combined.\n\nad\n\na friday jackpot would be the fourth-highest-ever payout for mega millions. (the drawing, in atlanta, is at 11 p.m. eastern.)\n\nthe most was a $656 million monster pot divided by three winners in 2012.\n\nso someone is getting rich off the lottery. it just probably won't be you.
the coronavirus outbreak has pushed the disputed status of the self-governing island of taiwan to the global health forefront.\n\ntaiwan says it's a self-functioning, independent country. china insists it's not. beijing says that, like hong kong and macao, taiwan's 23 million people are part of china's one country, two systems approach. it's a long-standing dispute in which washington has maintained a middle ground, neither recognizing taiwan as independent nor as a part of china.\n\nthe world health organization, however, has in practice taken china's side.\n\nfrom 2009 to 2015, taiwan was annually invited to be part of the who's decision-making body under an observer status. then in 2016, china blocked taipei's bid. the move was part of china's overall strategy to keep taiwan out of international organizations, said bonnie glaser, director of the china power project at the center for strategic and international studies.\n\ntaiwan's interests are often ignored, and taiwan is extremely isolated in the international community, she said.\n\nflash forward to the coronavirus outbreak, and taiwan, because it's not part of the who, is not provided with the latest updates or invited to participate in meetings.\n\nit's a loss both for the international community that is unable to tap into expertise that taiwan has, as well as putting at risk citizens in taiwan, said glaser.\n\nthe coronavirus has spread all around china and infected more than 17,000 people, but there are just 10 confirmed cases in taiwan.\n\nnonetheless, because taiwan is often grouped in with china, it has also been subject to flight suspensions — another area in which taiwan's aviation authorities are lobbying for change.\n\nwashington has even tentatively stepped in. on saturday, the state department issued a statement criticizing the international civil aviation organization after the u.n.-related agency blocked people on twitter who condemned the icao's exclusion of taiwan.\n\nin the meantime, as the coronavirus spreads, taiwanese authorities are worried about simmering health repercussions of these politicized divides.
kidspost: when did you start to snowboard?\n\nmaddie mastro: i started skiing when i was 2 years old and switched to snowboarding when i was around 6.\n\nkp: what did you like about snowboarding?\n\nmm: it was something new and challenging. i loved the rush of being on the board.\n\nkp: were you good right away?\n\nmm: i always felt comfortable standing sideways on the board. i was comfortable with turning and being in the air. so i guess i was a natural.\n\nkp: did you play other sports growing up?\n\nmm: i grew up in a very active family in california. my parents gave me the opportunity to play lots of sports. soccer, gymnastics, surfing, t-ball, just about every sport. i loved being outside and active.\n\nkp: did playing other sports help with your snowboarding?\n\nmm: definitely. playing other sports helped me become a better all-around athlete.\n\nkp: you specialize in halfpipe. how do you practice all those crazy aerial tricks?\n\nmm: there are ways to make practice safer. sometimes you practice the moves on a trampoline. other times you practice in the pipe but land on a huge pillow.\n\nkp: do you fall when you are practicing?\n\nmm: i fall a lot during practice. but as my mom always says, if you're not falling, you're not trying. your body definitely takes a beating.\n\nkp: are you ever nervous before you try a new move?\n\nmm: i'm nervous all the time. before trying new tricks, or in a new situation. but i just tell myself: you know you're good at this. you can do it. the feeling goes away when i start to snowboard.\n\nkp: you are 17 years old. are you still in school?\n\nmm: i graduated high school a year early at 16. i am looking forward to going to college someday. my mom is an english teacher, so i love to read. in fact, i just started john green's new book before you called.\n\nkp: i don't want to jinx you, but . . . what will you do if you don't make the olympic team?\n\nmm: whether i make the team or not will not break me as a snowboarder or as a person. i got into snowboarding because i found snowboarding was fun for me. that won't change. i am still young. i can try for the next olympics.
first, it places them in baseball's top half of spenders but not among its most frivolous. as payrolls stand now, the nationals have the fifth-highest payroll in the national league, behind the dodgers, cubs, giants and cardinals — though st. louis is also sitting right around $150 million. the mets are not far behind, at around $147 million, according to calculations made by the website roster resource.\n\nmeanwhile, washington's $150 million would be the eighth highest in the american league (ninth if the blue jays complete a possible deal with jose bautista). the nationals will spend less than not only the traditional high-spenders — the yankees, red sox, tigers and rangers — but also the mariners, angels and, interestingly enough, baltimore orioles.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe orioles' projected payroll stands at $154 million, a few million above the nationals' opening day mark. last year, the orioles had a higher opening day payroll than the nationals by about $2 million, an insignificant amount in baseball salary discussions that is nevertheless worth noting because the masn dispute looms over both teams' payrolls. in that ongoing litigation (and forgive an oversimplification), the nationals are seeking more money via television rights than the orioles are willing to give them, money washington's representatives have claimed the club deserves — money they claim is hurting their pursuit of free agents. forbes estimated the nationals' revenue at $293 million in its 2016 valuation, making it the ninth highest in baseball; forbes estimated the orioles' revenue at $239 million, 22nd highest.\n\nlast year was the first since the nationals' playoff run began in 2012 that the orioles had the higher opening day payroll. baltimore also had a higher end-of-season payroll — $170 million to the nationals' $169 million. all of which segues nicely to another observation about the nationals' payroll: it does not often change as much after opening day as it did last season, when the addition of mark melancon and others meant that the nationals' end-of-season payroll was $25 million more.\n\nfrom 2012 through 2015, the nationals added an average of $4.6 million to their opening day payroll by the end of each season. teams that are annually in playoff contention provide the best comparison to the nationals, because those out of the running tend to drop payroll instead of adding it, and few teams have been in the running so consistently as the nationals have since 2012. so among those teams, the royals have added more than $4.6 million in each of the past four seasons, while the giants' payroll has grown by more than $4.6 million in every season but one over the past decade. even the cardinals, less prone to deadline splashes than some other top-tier teams, have built their payroll by more than $4.6 million in each of the past three seasons.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin other words, the nationals made more in-season salary commitments last year than in any season prior, and in so doing they did what most contenders do each year. adding a player owed as much as melancon deviated from washington's norm but not the league-wide norm for contending teams. whether this year's $150-ish million payroll grows significantly during the season will, of course, probably depend on the standings, the health of the roster and the state of the bullpen in mid-july. but if the nationals contend, and do not spend midseason, they will return to their annual norm while remaining in opposition to the league norm of major deadline remodeling.\n\nregardless, the payroll as it stands provides further context to characterize 2015 as a relative spending spree for the nationals. after they signed max scherzer to create the super-rotation that wasn't, the opening day payroll sat at $162 million. after it dropped by $15 million before opening day last season, some wondered whether or not the nationals had tiptoed into the realm of big-market spending.\n\nthe nationals' average opening day payroll from 2014 to 2016 was $148.2 million. if they had made winning bids on melancon or kenley jansen this offseason, this year's payroll would far exceed that average. the fact that they bid on those players indicates some willingness to spend over their recent budget. the fact that they did not win them indicates they are not willing to spend carte blanche.\n\nad\n\nad
out on the sales floor, this appears to have been misstep. lost in the holiday hurly-burly, the album, titled x 100pre, is currently drooping at no. 29 on the billboard charts. but maybe bad bunny is playing the long game. the new year is a good time for gazing into the future, and if you squint hard enough at x 100pre, you'll hear an album that's going to change things. after issuing a few summers' worth of motley hits — including i like it, his massive neo-boogaloo brainchild with cardi b — bad bunny is giving important new lessons in genre erosion.\n\nhe still sounds most comfortable coasting over trap beats, those languorous, flickering rhythms that most atlanta rappers tend to chew like juicy fruit. but x 100pre also features smoggy puffs of reggaeton (cuando perriabas), delectable pinpricks of bachata (la romana), bully punches of dembow (la romana again), even a surprise power-pop jag that could probably be traced back to ric ocasek's 23andme kit (tenemos que hablar). and through it all, bad bunny never sounds like some pseudo-syncretist showing off how many styles he can juggle. everything here simply sounds like a bad bunny song.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nat the bottom of it all is his voice, a blunted baritone that originates in the abyss of his diaphragm and rises up through his airways, smooth like an escalator ride, finally rolling out of his mouth like a yawned shout or a shouted yawn. it's a monolithic, strangely adaptable tone — one that allows him to deaden his punchlines, gird his brags and cast his most vulnerable pleas in bronze.\n\nso let's presume that the ballast of his voice is what gives bad bunny the psychic permission necessary to take such stylish risks, sonically and sartorially. (his manicurist paints his fingernails like so many easter eggs while his barber is presumably a fan of the works of ellsworth kelly.)\n\nit's those risky wild styles that set bad bunny apart from his closest cousin in pop, drake. the two work in the same melodic neighborhood, but to hear how different they are, cue up mia, the album-closing duet in which drake lilts along in spanish while bad bunny enters his default state of effortless locomotion. the song doesn't come off like an airplay bid, or a synergy exercise, or any kind of torch-passing. instead, it feels like another mischief-flex — a contrast between one rapper who aspires to sound like everyone else and another who can only sound like himself.
i'll be back in alabama, kiffin said. we do stay here tonight. we're going to leave in the morning. i'll be with the team. it's a [recruiting] dead period. it's not like we've got a month. we basically just have a little bit longer of a week. it'll all be dedicated to alabama. the no. 1 focus will be finishing what we started.\n\nthe stunning announcement alabama made monday afternoon, then, may have blindsided kiffin. nick saban declared kiffin will focus on [his] new head coaching job at florida atlantic. what that means is, saban could not stand kiffin being around his program, even for one more week, the seven days before the crimson tide faces clemson in a national title rematch.\n\nkiffin helped saban during his three years in alabama, modernizing an offense that had started to become dated, leading three different quarterbacks to three southeastern conference titles and three playoff appearances. but saban helped kiffin much more. kiffin earned $1.4 million in a high-profile job. he landed on his feet after a humiliating exit as southern cal's head coach, when kiffin admitted there were few schools soliciting his services.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nand now their relationship has ended awkwardly, as most relationships with kiffin tend to do. when he parted ways with the oakland raiders, owner al davis used a slide show to illustrate his misdeeds. he left tennessee with a disorganized, late-night news conference and with a crowd of angry students and fans gathered outside the football complex. usc fired him at a private airport in the wee hours. and now alabama has dismissed him on the eve of the national championship.\n\nsaban's announcement made it seem like a mutual parting. the strain of trying to set up his recruiting a staff at fau while leading alabama's offense had become too much, not productive for the team or kiffin. there's some truth in that. but the part left unspoken is both more important and blatantly clear: saban wanted kiffin to take a hike.\n\nthe final straw may have been the remarkable story published last week in sports illustrated. kiffin said he had not any fun coaching at alabama, equating three years to 21 — as in dog years. he complained about the cost of alimony and taxes. he presented scientific evidence his personality shared nothing in common with the personalities of saban or the other coaches he worked with. he made these comments, and more, with the backdrop of house hunting in south florida, trying to find something in the $6 million range, with a view of the water.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nsaban does not permit assistant coaches to speak with reporters during the season. during bowl preparation, there are many opportunities when all coaches from participating schools must talk. kiffin's hiring at fau also gave him occasion to speak publicly. when given the chance, kiffin was everything saban wants kept light years away from his program: brash, distracting, selfish.\n\nalabama's performance in the peach bowl probably didn't convince saban of kiffin's focus. the tide wanted to be conservative to thwart washington's turnover-happy defense, so an explosion couldn't be expected. but the tide passed for only 57 yards, and kiffin wasn't able to get bo scarbrough — clearly the best player on the field — a significant workload until the fourth quarter.\n\nso alabama will turn to steve sarkisian to call plays in the national title game, against a clemson defense that has future nfl players and a defensive line that might rival even alabama's. sarkisian spent the season ensconced in alabama's program, and his knowledge of kiffin's offense dates back to their time together at usc. but changing coordinators a week before the biggest game of the season cannot be ideal.
the lawyer gave donald trump a note, written in trump's own handwriting. he asked trump to read it aloud.\n\ntrump may not have realized it yet, but he had walked into a trap.\n\npeter, you're a real loser, trump began reading.\n\nthe mogul had sent the note to a reporter, objecting to a story that said trump owned a small minority stake in a manhattan real estate project. trump insisted that the word small was incorrect. trump continued reading: i wrote, 'is 50 percent small?' \n\nthis [note] was intended to indicate that you had a 50 percent stake in the project, correct? said the lawyer.\n\nthat's correct, trump said.\n\nfor the first of many times that day, trump was about to be caught saying something that wasn't true.\n\n. lawyer: mr. trump, do you own 30 percent or 50 percent of the limited partnership? trump: i own 30 percent.\n\nit was a mid-december morning in 2007 — the start of an interrogation unlike anything else in the public record of trump's life.\n\ntrump had brought it on himself. he had sued a reporter, accusing him of being reckless and dishonest in a book that raised questions about trump's net worth. the reporter's attorneys turned the tables and brought trump in for a deposition.\n\nfor two straight days, they asked trump question after question that touched on the same theme: trump's honesty.\n\nthe lawyers confronted the mogul with his past statements — and with his company's internal documents, which often showed those statements had been incorrect or invented. the lawyers were relentless. trump, the bigger-than-life mogul, was vulnerable — cornered, out-prepared and under oath.\n\nthirty times, they caught him.\n\ntrump had misstated sales at his condo buildings. inflated the price of membership at one of his golf clubs. overstated the depth of his past debts and the number of his employees.\n\nthat deposition — 170 transcribed pages — offers extraordinary insights into trump's relationship with the truth. trump's falsehoods were unstrategic — needless, highly specific, easy to disprove. when caught, trump sometimes blamed others for the error or explained that the untrue thing really was true, in his mind, because he saw the situation more positively than others did.\n\nhave you ever lied in public statements about your properties? the lawyer asked.\n\ni try and be truthful, trump said. i'm no different from a politician running for office. you always want to put the best foot forward.\n\nin his presidential campaign, trump has sought to make his truth-telling a selling point. he nicknamed his main republican opponent lyin' ted cruz. he called his democratic opponent, hillary clinton, a pathological liar! in a recent twitter message. i will present the facts plainly and honestly, he said in the opening of his speech at the republican national convention. we cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.\n\ntrump has had a habit of telling demonstrable untruths during his presidential campaign. the washington post's fact checker has awarded him four pinocchios — the maximum a statement can receive — 39 times since he announced his bid last summer. in many cases, his statements echo those in the 2007 deposition: they are specific, checkable — and wrong.\n\ntrump said he opposed the iraq war at the start. he didn't. he said he'd never mocked a disabled new york times reporter. he had. trump also said the national football league had sent him a letter, objecting to a presidential debate that was scheduled for the same time as a football game. it hadn't.\n\nlast week, trump claimed that he had seen footage — taken at a top-secret location and released by the iranian government — showing a plane unloading a large amount of cash to iran from the u.s. government. he hadn't. trump later conceded he'd been mistaken — he'd seen tv news video that showed a plane during a prisoner release.\n\nbut, even under the spotlight of this campaign, trump has never had an experience quite like this deposition on dec. 19 and 20, 2007.\n\nhe was trapped in a room — with his own prior statements and three high-powered lawyers.\n\na very clear and visible side effect of my lawyers' questioning of trump is that he [was revealed as] a routine and habitual fabulist, said timothy l. o'brien, the author trump had sued.\n\nthe washington post sent the trump campaign a detailed list of questions about this deposition, listing all the times when trump seemed to have been caught in a false or unsupported statement. the post asked trump whether he wanted to challenge any of those findings — and whether he had felt regret when confronted with them.\n\nhe did not answer those questions.\n\n\n\nleft: timothy l. o'brien's book trump nation: the art of being the donald. right: andrew ceresney, top, and mary jo white, left, who represented o'brien in the suit trump brought against him. (open road integrated media; mark lennihan/ap; seth wenig/ap)\n\nin 2005, o'brien, then a reporter for the new york times, had published a book called trump nation: the art of being the donald. in the book, o'brien cited people who questioned a claim at the bedrock of trump's identity — that his net worth was more than $5 billion. o'brien said he had spoken to three people who estimated that the figure was between $150 million and $250 million.\n\ntrump sued. he later told the post that he intended to hurt o'brien, whom he called a lowlife sleazebag.\n\ni didn't read [the book], to be honest with you. . . . i never read it. i saw some of the things they said, trump said later. i said: 'go sue him. it will cost him a lot of money.' \n\nby filing suit, trump hadn't just opened himself up to questioning — he had opened a door into the opaque and secretive company he ran.\n\no'brien's attorneys included mary jo white, now the chair of the securities and exchange commission, and andrew ceresney, now the sec's director of enforcement. the lawsuit had given them the power to request that trump turn over internal company documents, and they used it. they arrived at the deposition having already identified where trump's public statements hadn't matched the private truth.\n\nthe questions began with that handwritten note and the 50 percent stake that wasn't 50 percent.\n\nthe 30 percent equates to much more than 30 percent, trump explained. his reasoning was that he had not been required to put up money at the outset, so his 30 percent share seemed more valuable.\n\nare you saying that the real estate community would interpret your interest to be 50 percent, even though in limited partnership agreements it's 30 percent? ceresney asked.\n\nsmart people would, trump said.\n\nsmart people?\n\nsmart people would say it's much more than 30 percent.\n\ntrump inflates the numbers trump: i got more than a million dollars, because they have tremendous promotion expenses, to my advantage. in other words, they promote, which has great value, through billboards, through newspapers, through radio, i think through television – yeah, through television. and they spend – again, i'd have to ask them, but i bet they spend at least a million or two million or maybe even more than that on promoting donald trump. lawyer: but how much of the payments were cash? trump: approximately $400,000. lawyer: so when you say publicly that you got paid more than a million dollars, you're including in that sum the promotional expenses that they pay? trump: oh, absolutely, yes. that has a great value. it has a great value to me. lawyer: do you actually say that when you say you got paid more than a million dollars publicly? trump: i don't break it down.\n\non to the next one.\n\ni was paid more than a million dollars, trump said when ceresney asked how much he'd been paid for a speech in 2005 at new york city's learning annex, a continuing-education center.\n\nceresney was ready.\n\nbut how much of the payments were cash?\n\napproximately $400,000, trump said.\n\ntrump said his personal math included the intangible value of publicity: the learning annex had advertised his speech heavily, and trump thought that helped his brand. therefore, in his mind he'd been paid more than $1 million, even though his actual payment was $400,000.\n\ndo you actually say that, when you say you got a million dollars publicly? ceresney asked.\n\ni don't break it down, trump said.\n\nas the deposition went on, the lawyers led trump through case after case in which he'd overstated his success.\n\n\n\ndonald trump, right, is interviewed by larry king during a taping of larry king live on oct., 7, 1999. (marty lederhandler/ap)\n\nthe lawyer played a clip from larry king's talk show, in which king asked trump how many people worked for him. twenty-two thousand or so, trump said.\n\nare all those people on your payroll? ceresney asked him.\n\nno, not directly, trump said. he said he was counting employees of other companies that acted as suppliers and subcontractors to his businesses.\n\nanother one. in o'brien's book, trump had been quoted saying: i had zero borrowings from [my father's] estate. . . . i give you my word.\n\nunder oath:\n\nmr. trump, have you ever borrowed money from your father's estate?\n\ni think a small amount a long time ago, trump said. i think it was like in the $9 million range.\n\nanother one. in one of his own books, trump had said about one of his golf courses: membership costs $300,000. i think it's a bargain.\n\nunder oath:\n\nin fact, your memberships were not selling at $300,000 at that time, correct?\n\nwe've sold many for two hundred thousand, trump said. then, trump pushed it upward: we've sold many for, i think, two-fifty.\n\nbut this was not the place to push it.\n\nthe lawyer had an internal trump document that showed the true figure — $200,000 per membership, ceresney said.\n\ncorrect, trump acknowledged. right.\n\ntrump passes the blame lawyer: you didn't correct it when you read the book? trump: well, i did correct it, and she didn't correct it. but you could have her in as a witness, and i'm sure we'll bring her in as a witness because what she wrote was — i asked her to change it to billions of dollars in debt, and she probably forgot. lawyer: and when you read it, you didn't correct it? trump: i didn't see it. lawyer: you didn't see it. trump: i read it very quickly. i didn't see it. i would have corrected it, but i didn't see it.\n\nin some cases, trump acknowledged he was wrong — but not that he was at fault. instead, he sought to turn the blame on others.\n\nthis is somebody that wrote it, probably meredith mciver, trump said at one point when confronted with another false statement. that is a mistake.\n\nmciver, a staff writer with the trump organization, blazed into the public eye last month for having inserted plagiarized material — taken from michelle obama's 2008 convention speech — in the convention speech of trump's wife, melania. mciver said it had been an innocent mistake.\n\nbut in this deposition more than eight years earlier, trump was blaming her for a mistake in one of his own books, how to get rich. in the 2004 book, co-written with mciver, trump described his massive debt load during a low period in the early 1990s. i owed billions upon billions of dollars — $9.2 billion to be exact, the book said as it retold the story of his rise back to success.\n\n\n\ntrump signs copies of his new book how to get rich in new york in 2004. (ramin talaie/corbis via getty images)\n\nthe depth of that financial hole made it seem even more impressive that trump had climbed out again. but the figure was wrong. his actual debts had been much less.\n\ni pointed it out to the person who wrote the book, trump said, meaning mciver.\n\nright after she wrote the book?\n\nthat's correct, trump said.\n\nthen the lawyer showed trump another book he'd written with mciver, three years later.\n\nin fact, i was $9 billion in debt, trump read aloud. a similar error, repeated. it was mciver's fault again.\n\nshe probably forgot, trump said.\n\nand when you read it, you didn't correct it?\n\ni didn't see it, trump said.\n\nyou didn't see it.\n\ni read it very quickly, trump said about a book he was credited with writing.\n\ntrump makes unsupported claims lawyer: when you wrote, o'brien . . . threatened sources by telling them he can, quote, 'settle scores with enemies by writing negative articles about them,'  what was the basis for that statement? trump: just my perception of him. i don't know that he indicated anything like that to me, but i think he probably did indirectly. just my dealing with him.\n\nin other cases, the lawyers prodded trump into admitting that he had made authoritative-sounding statements without any proof behind them. these statements were another kind of untruth.\n\nthey were not necessarily false. they might have been true.\n\nbut trump said them without knowing one way or the other.\n\nwhat basis do you have for that statement? ceresney asked in one case, about an assertion from trump that o'brien had been reported to the police for stalking.\n\ni guess that was probably taken off the internet, trump said.\n\non to the next one.\n\nyou wrote, 'o'brien . . . threatened sources by telling them he can, quote, settle scores with enemies by writing negative articles about them,'  ceresney asked, reading trump's words from a legal complaint. what was the basis for that statement?\n\njust my perception of him, trump said. i don't know that he indicated anything like that to me, but i think he probably did indirectly.\n\nthe most striking example was a question at the very heart of the legal case: what was trump's actual net worth?\n\ntrump had told o'brien he was worth up to $6 billion. but the lawyers confronted him with other documents — from trump's accountants and from outside banks — that seemed to show the real figure was far lower.\n\nthe lawyers asked: have you ever not been truthful about your net worth?\n\ntrump's answer here was that the truth about his wealth was — in essence — up to him to decide.\n\n\n\ntrump outside the 92-story trump international hotel and tower underway in chicago in 2007. (charles rex arbogast/ap)\n\nmy net worth fluctuates, and it goes up and down with markets and with attitudes and with feelings, even my own feelings, trump said. but i try.\n\nthe interrogation finally ended after two days. trump's attorney made a final demand.\n\ni want the record to be crystal clear that every single word, every question, every answer, every word, is confidential, said the attorney, mark ressler.\n\nin 2009, a judge dismissed trump's case against o'brien. trump appealed, but in 2011 that was denied, too.\n\nalong the way, this once-confidential deposition became part of the public record when o'brien's attorneys attached it to one of their motions.\n\nin a brief statement this week, trump said he felt the lawsuit was a success, despite his loss.\n\no'brien knows nothing about me, trump said. his book was a total failure and ultimately i had great success doing what i wanted to do — costing this third rate reporter a lot of legal fees.\n\no'brien, now executive editor of bloomberg view, said trump got that wrong. the publisher and insurance companies covered the cost.\n\ndonald trump lost his lawsuit and, unlike him, it didn't cost me a penny to litigate it, he said.\n\nrosalind s. helderman contributed to this report.\n\nmore stories\n\nfrom trump's controversial words, a pattern: outrage, headlines and then denial\n\nis split-ticket voting making a comeback? with trump on the ballot, some republicans hope so.\n\nthese 'walmart moms' say they feel 'nauseated' by the choice of clinton or trump
pay attention to this story as if your life depended on it.\n\nthat's because thinking about things other than the task at hand can seriously up your anxiety level. not to stress you out or anything, but that might make you age faster, get sick and die, according to the telomere effect: a revolutionary approach to living younger, healthier, longer, a book from molecular biologist elizabeth blackburn and health psychologist elissa epel.\n\nblackburn (and two colleagues) won the nobel prize in 2009 for the discovery of telomerase, the enzyme that replenishes the bits of dna on either end of your chromosomes. those bits are called telomeres, and they're often compared to the plastic caps on shoelaces.\n\nlet those caps wear down, and the laces fray and can't do their job. it's the same with telomeres: stress makes them shorter. and if they get too short, your cells stop dividing, which leads to pain, heart disease and other health woes — all markers of what the authors dub the diseasespan. (the idea is that we have a healthspan and a diseasespan during our lives, and people with short telomeres move into their diseasespan earlier.)\n\npictures of shoelaces are scattered throughout the book. spot one, and you're supposed to refocus your mind on the present, take a deep breath, and think of your telomeres being restored with the vitality of your breath.\n\nit's a strategy based on the book's promising premise: even if you're a total stress case, it's possible to reverse the negative effects by transforming how you respond to situations.\n\nthe key, the authors explain, is to develop a challenge response. basically, instead of crumbling under the pressure of responsibilities or events, you should have a bring it on! mentality. it also helps to banish negativity, practice self-compassion and not be an idiot about your health. (i.e., get enough sleep and physical activity, cut out processed foods and smoking.)\n\nthe bad news is that some people start off at a telomere disadvantage, blackburn and epel found. that includes a newborn whose parent has shortened telomeres, which get passed on, folks who live in unsafe or littered neighborhoods or one without nearby greenery. another way to wind up with shorter telomeres, the authors write, is to be african american and experience discrimination.\n\nfor everyone to have the telomeres they deserve, a lot needs to change in the world, the authors say in their concluding telomere manifesto. among their action items: reduce inequality and clean up local and global toxins.\n\nso it's a bit more complicated than shoelaces.\n\n— vicky hallett
fame doesn't always happen at a human pace, she says, her lips curving into the enigmatic half-smile immortalized on the cover of her 1995 debut, pieces of you.\n\nad\n\nfame happens sometimes at a pace that causes a lot of psychological problems, she continues. so my mission, number one, was to be a happy, whole human, and number two was to be a musician. and that's what i've been doing my whole career, and that's where i am today.\n\nad\n\nat 43, jewel is a prolific songwriter, a best-selling poet and occasional actress — along with other roles, she stars in the hallmark channel's fixer upper mystery movie series. she's also a single mom to a 6-year-old boy who lives with her in nashville.\n\nin song, she can summon many voices — deep and powerful, girlish and sweet, piercing and agile — but in conversation, she speaks in a soft alto, absent-mindedly twisting golden strands of hair around her fingers. she exudes a thoughtful warmth, calling to mind the word so often assigned to her by fans and critics alike since the start of her career: earnest.\n\nad\n\nfortunately, she doesn't mind it.\n\ni never saw that as an insult — 'oh, she's so earnest.' i always clung to that, she says. i think there's a danger in all of our jobs when we become too proficient at them. there's something very, very special about the beginning of anyone's career, when it's raw talent, when it's raw will, when it's raw drive. because that's when you're innovative, because no one has told you the rules or the parameters that you have to operate by.\n\nso, yes, she thinks she sounds an awful lot like kermit the frog on pieces of you, a record she described in her 2015 memoir, never broken: songs are only half the story, as imperfect, full of mistakes and guitar flubs but also honest. and she'll allow that her best-selling book of poetry — 1998's a night without armor — is filled with all the unfiltered, vaguely purple-hued angst you might expect from an expressive soul fumbling through the turbulent teen and early 20-something years, because that's who she was when she wrote it.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ni have no regrets. i never liked art as propaganda, where people make themselves seem more perfect or more polished or more educated or more mature than they are, she says. it's photoshop for poetry and music. it's not fair. it doesn't give you a clear image of who you are as a human.\n\nher unabashed sincerity resonates, even against the odds. marilyn manson — the infamous goth rocker and self-titled antichrist superstar — once pulled jewel aside to tell her that his favorite song of hers was the tender ditty i'm sensitive:\n\nyour words can crush things that are unseen\n\nso please be careful with me, i'm sensitive\n\nand i'd like to stay that way.\n\nad\n\nin an era still gripped by grunge, jewel climbed to the top of the pop charts with sweet, simple folk tunes. her poetry collection sold over 2 million copies, becoming one of the top-selling volumes of poetry in american history.\n\nad\n\nmaybe the success of her early, imperfect art isn't so surprising. in moments of despair or disillusionment, jewel has found that people gravitate toward the heartfelt vibes that have always been her hallmark: you can only feel crappy for so long and then you go, 'now what?'  she says.\n\nso she has always tried to offer answers, through song, poetry, prose and, now, as an entrepreneur. last year, she launched jewel inc., a parent company encompassing every aspect of her essential jewel-ness. it includes whole human — a mindfulness-focused program that markets training resources to companies and school districts — and jewelneverbroken.com, a nonprofit website that bills itself as an emotional fitness destination for those seeking more balance and happiness in their lives.\n\nif i can help people with any shortcuts, so it doesn't take them as long as it took me, i'm happy to share those tips i've learned along the way, she says. these lessons took me 40 years to figure out, and it was a messy journey for me.\n\nwith the introduction of jewel inc., the pop star has joined the growing ranks of celebrities who have made a personal brand their second act. reese witherspoon created the southern-inspired lifestyle brand draper james, which markets whimsical dixie charm and flirty $250 dresses. tiffani thiessen of beverly hills, 90210 fame fills her sleek, pinterest-worthy blog with favorite recipes and design ideas for your child's playroom (with links to the products you'll need to attain the look, of course.) and then there's gwyneth paltrow's goop, a newsletter that grew into a veritable lifestyle empire, complete with cookbooks, a top-dollar wellness summit and a following of more than 1 million subscribers.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nlike plenty of her celebrity compatriots, jewel sprinkles her blog and website with a few favorite buzzwords: mindfulness, self-agency, creativity. thiessen wants you to make handmade valentines; jewel's holiday tour incorporated a craft fair, offering the opportunity to create a handmade gift. paltrow famously dubbed her separation from coldplay frontman chris martin a conscious uncoupling; jewel chose the phrase tender undoing to describe her 2014 divorce from retired rodeo star ty murray, the father of her son, kase.\n\nbut lexicon aside, jewel's approach — and the path that led her to this new chapter — is decidedly unique.\n\nto be clear: jewel doesn't want to be your guru, your idol or your personal stylist. she won't try to sell you a $500 organic buckwheat meditation cushion, a la goop. she has no plans to design a clothing line inspired by the rustic style of the alaskan frontier where she grew up. and she certainly doesn't claim to be the answer to the question posed by her career-launching hit single, who will save your soul.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nshe is, as she puts it, just a fellow traveler on a road. i'm much more into helping people find their own internal compass.\n\nher idea is to bring mindfulness and balance to the corporate workplace, school classrooms and beyond. so far, jewel inc. has partnered with online retailer zappos to create the pilot program, which will offer a digital tool kit to zappos employees — like a whole university, jewel says — with the goal to ultimately make them more resilient, more creative, less risk-averse, less anxious, more entrepreneurial. with the help of education experts, she's also creating a similar curriculum for public school districts.\n\ni'm planning a mindfulness cartoon for toddlers, too, she says.\n\nad\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/afss3pidbfw frameborder=0 allowfullscreen>\n\nher underlying message, she says, is the phrase she set to music in her 1998 hit single, hands:\n\nad\n\nif i could tell the world just one thing\n\nit would be that we're all okay.\n\nif that comes off as a touch naive or overly optimistic, consider the facts of her personal history.\n\nshe grew up in a log cabin with no running water or heat outside homer, alaska, the daughter of a family filled with passionate artists and musicians who survived largely on animals they hunted and produce they could grow and can.\n\nat 5, she began performing as a singer in local hotels and restaurants with her family. three years later, her parents divorced, and jewel and her two brothers stayed with their father, atz, a vietnam veteran who struggled with alcoholism and repeated his own father's abusive behavior. jewel described one especially harrowing episode in her memoir, when atz struck her and her brother: he kept yelling, spittle flying in my face, she wrote of her father. i thought i was going to die.\n\nad\n\nad\n\njewel moved out on her own at 15 and won a scholarship to michigan's interlochen center for the arts a year later. at 18, she followed her mother's advice and moved to san diego to pursue her music career; after she was fired from a day job at a computer warehouse, she became homeless — living out of a battered van, shoplifting food and clothing and struggling with chronic kidney infections as she slowly built a local fan base by performing in bars.\n\nabout a year later, jewel finally got her break: atlantic records wanted to sign her. she almost didn't do it.\n\ni was like, oh my gosh, you just can't take somebody with my background and put fame in the mix. that's just massive self-destruction, she says. that's when i was like, i really have to make being a happy, whole person my priority. and if that's my priority in music, and my career is second, then i would be willing to do it.\n\nad\n\nshe resolved to avoid alcohol and drugs, and to continue diligently writing in her journal, where she kept a confessional record of her thoughts and behaviors. i call it being your own silent witness, she says.\n\nwhen her stardom grew overwhelming — she could no longer grocery shop without people gawking at her in the aisles or peering into her cart to see what she was buying — she stepped back from her career. she took a two-year break after her sophomore record, 1998's spirit, and turned down tours and acting jobs.\n\ni didn't like that level of fame, she says. that's a strange thing to say, maybe, but i slowed it down. and i realized i had the power to do that; i never had to give up my authenticity.\n\nthe exercises she taught herself as a girl evolved into the lessons that are now the foundation of her personal brand. among them: learning to reflect on the emotional dynamics you were raised with, practicing gratitude and helping others. she encourages time spent in silence, through meditation or prolonged prayer.\n\nthose lessons were further refined as she endured new challenges — the heartbreak of failed romances, the divorce from murray. in 2003, jewel faced a particularly bitter betrayal when she learned that her mother, nedra — who had acted as jewel's business manager since the start of her career — had mismanaged her daughter's finances, leaving the star singer millions of dollars in debt. devastated, jewel knew she needed a legal separation from nedra. the two have been estranged ever since.\n\njewel's struggles have only made her more resilient, she says, and she has never hesitated to share them openly — in her music, and her writing, and soon on a stage in las vegas: she is working with cirque du soleil to present a biographical one-night show in march, based on the highs and lows of her life story, with proceeds benefiting a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing access to safe water.\n\ni gained a skill set where no matter what i was faced with, i realized i can overcome it, and i can pick myself up, and i can figure out what i can do better and i can forgive and move on and go back to the drawing board and never felt like a victim, jewel says. i just didn't know that it would lead me to a second phase in my career.\n\nher ability to forgive also led her back to her father, atz, who has become a very different man from the one depicted in the darkest chapters of jewel's memoir.\n\nthis is the first time jewel's family — her son, her father and her brothers atz lee and nikos kilcher — have all joined her for a full tour. her father is sober now and a celebrity in his own right, starring with his sons on the discovery channel reality show alaska: the last frontier. the show, which profiles the lives of the family on their remote homestead, is in its seventh season.\n\nmy dad's a miracle. he changed in his 60s. and for anybody out there struggling with shame or addiction or the fear that so much of their life has gone in a certain direction and it's too late to change it, my dad is proof that that isn't the case, she says. we are able to have a really honest and authentic relationship that i never thought we'd have.\n\nstanding onstage together in hershey, surrounded by twinkling christmas lights, yodeling in harmony like they did in bars and hotel lobbies 30 years ago, father and daughter embody the sort of redemption that jewel hopes to inspire in others.\n\nit's not her style to tout her brand or business, but jewel peppers her performance with pearls of wisdom: i think the point of life isn't avoiding pain, but figuring out what to do with it, how to turn it into something beautiful, she says to the crowd. she spends most of the two-hour show dazzling her audience with a vast range of impressive vocal calisthenics, moving from traditional carols to her biggest hits and back again.\n\nduring her solo set, her proud father watches from behind the curtains, entranced as her crystalline voice soars to the highest register: she's always pushing herself to the edge, he gushes. she's going farther than she's ever gone!\n\nall night, jewel's life story flashes across a massive screen behind her, in grainy photographs and archival footage of her childhood in alaska. when she sings the songs that launched her career — who will save your soul, you were meant for me, hands — her fans whoop and whistle.\n\nit's not the vatican, or the white house, or a stadium-size crowd at the grammys. there are no a-list superstars sharing her stage; she is surrounded by her band and her family.
there's little question that, barring an unforeseen negative shock, all this presidential bragging will, to some extent, help the incumbent. the economy will be a tail wind for trump's reelection. that tail wind may be somewhat weaker than is usually the case, but his sails will have economic wind in them.\n\nbut how justified is that? presidents always have and always will get credit for good economies and blame for bad ones. should they?\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin many cases, including trump's, presidents ride trends they inherited. if those trends change for the better, as with barack obama and bill clinton, they get credit (sometimes deservedly, as per their anti-recessionary interventions). if they worsen, as with george h.w. bush, they get blamed. what makes trump unusual is not that he's riding favorable trends that predated him, nor that he's claiming credit for them. it's that he lies about them, claiming that the economy was awful until he saved it.\n\na typical trumpian refrain maintains, totally against the facts, that when he took office, america was stuck in a failed recovery and saddled with a bleak economic future. in davos, switzerland, last month, trump falsely claimed that the economy he inherited was in a rather dismal state. he claims to have accomplished an economic turnaround of historic proportions.\n\nif you're willing to abuse the data, it is not difficult to perpetrate this falsehood. a recent analysis by the president's economic advisers argued that under the trump administration, net worth for the bottom 50 percent of households has increased at an annual rate 15 times higher than the average growth seen under the three prior administrations' expansion periods. the analysis shows a (truly impressive) 15 percent annualized growth rate for real net worth over the first three years of trump's term (to be precise, data exist for 11 quarters) vs. 1 percent for prior administrations.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe key omitted fact is that this was precisely the growth rate when trump took office. if we back this indicator up over the final three years of obama's presidency, the growth rate is exactly the same: 15 percent, annualized. that's solid evidence of trend-riding. (full disclosure: i was vice president joe biden's economic adviser through 2011.)\n\nif we do the same exercise for the decline in unemployment and the growth in jobs — compare the past three years with the previous three years — we see that unemployment fell less quickly under trump than it did under obama (down one point under trump and two points under obama). job growth under these comparable periods was faster under obama than trump (up 6 vs. 5 percent).\n\nto be clear, that's not a slap at trump's jobs record. much as you gradually pour more slowly when filling a glass to the brim, as the job market closes in on full capacity, gains decelerate. but on these and many other indicators, it is factually uncontestable that trump is riding inherited trends.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthere are also soft spots in the economy that could translate more into political head winds than tail winds. even after the tax cuts, business investment has been unusually weak over the past couple of years, declining in real terms for the past nine months, the worst such streak since the last recession. though the most recent data hint of a potential rebound, the manufacturing sector contracted for much of 2019. factory employment averaged 4,000 per month last year compared with 22,000 per month in 2018. a particularly disturbing new trend is the decline in health coverage among the uninsured. importantly for this analysis, trump's fingerprints are on these outcomes, as they are widely associated with the uncertainty invoked by his trade war and his attack on the affordable care act.\n\nblowing the other way, two trends at opposite ends of the income/wealth scale have accelerated since 2016: the stock market and the pay of low-wage earners. the former is probably a function of high corporate profitability, and especially since so few middle- and low-income households hold much stock at all, that fuels the inequality arguments made by trump's opponents.\n\nthe faster growth in real pay of low-wage earners provides an important example of what happens when low unemployment is sustained and minimum wages go up. this may help the president, but even with these gains, there's still a large gap between what people make and what they need, a gap that's closed in part by safety-net programs that the administration is trying to dismantle.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhow all of this translates into votes in an election that's still months away is anyone's guess. one recent poll shows an uptick in trump's economic approval by independent voters, but the president's overall approval rating has always been much lower than historical economic correlations would predict. as political scientist peter k. enns recently put it: the fact that we're not seeing a corresponding uptick in presidential approval, that shows that the question of whether the economy will be less of a factor than in typical elections is still very much an open question.
through tonight: skies that cleared out this afternoon will stay rather clear through the night. as colder air filters back into the area, lows end up in the 20s most spots, which might be more like 30 downtown. winds stay up through the night, blowing from the northwest around 10 to 15 mph.\n\nview the current weather conditions at the washington post.\n\nad\n\ntomorrow (thursday): if clouds are not yet on the increase by sunrise, we'll see skies turn more gray with time on thursday. and by midday or afternoon, those clouds are also lowering as a small system works toward the area. given abundant clouds, and the fact that we're in a colder air mass again, highs will be mainly in the upper 30s to lower 40s. winds will be from the southwest around 5 to 10 mph. we should stay snow-free during most or all of the day, but we could see a sprinkle before sunset with snow showers likely by evening.\n\nad\n\nmore evening light: tonight's sunset is at 5 in d.c. that's the first time we've seen a 5 p.m. or later sunset since nov. 8. we've now already gained about 15 minutes of evening light since the minimum in december. by the end of january, we'll pick up about 30 more minutes! meanwhile, tomorrow is our latest sunrise of the year on standard time, and we won't be seeing much additional morning light for at least a few weeks. why the mismatch? for a detailed explainer, check out justin grieser's post on this topic from last year.
to date, democrats seem to be in a slightly better position than they were at this point before the november election, thanks to black turnout being a larger proportion of the early votes cast in the runoff.\n\nad\n\nbut there are a number of reasons democrats' perceived advantage might not translate to victories on jan. 5.\n\nearly vote data doesn't capture all voters\n\nat any given moment, the early vote data is just a snapshot of who has voted so far. more people are going to vote, and partisan trends often shift significantly as the early-vote period goes on.\n\nad\n\n(there is a small exception here for states that conduct their entire election by mail — such as washington, oregon, colorado, utah and hawaii. nevada is also a bit of an exception because it has such high vote-by-mail participation. given the early vote is the vote, or at least the vast majority of it, in nevada, trends there can tell us more.)\n\nhistorically, only strong partisans, older voters, military and overseas voters voted by mail or early. but the pandemic and expansion of absentee voting has led many more americans to vote early. these changes make it difficult to determine who else has not voted, and, especially, how many people are still going to vote.\n\nthis was tricky to analyze even before the pandemic. in the 2016 presidential election, absentee votes led many to think that hillary clinton was favored to win the state of iowa. democrats' early vote margin in the state had shrunk relative to 2012, but because obama had won the state by nearly 6 percentage points, the republican election day vote was not expected to be big enough to change the final outcome.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhowever, donald trump ended up winning iowa comfortably, by more than 9 percentage points. the election day electorate had simply been underestimated. while in 2012, 44 percent of voters had voted absentee, in 2016 that number was only 41 percent, and the republican strength among those voters swamped the democratic early voting advantage.\n\ntrends might not hold throughout an election\n\none way to mitigate the problem of overestimating early vote data is to look at historical trends. for example, if republicans were more likely to vote by mail in the past, then maybe we can assume that they are more likely to vote by mail now too.\n\nthe problem with that is that trends change — and often suddenly. historically, republicans were more likely to vote by mail in florida. in 2016, 40.5 percent of mail votes there came from republicans, while 38.4 percent came from democrats. however, after the unprecedented attacks on mail-in voting by president trump, many republicans decided to change how they voted. in 2020 only 31.1 percent of mail ballots were cast by republicans, and 35 percent were cast by democrats.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthis large drop in vote-by-mail among republicans is one of the reasons political analysts initially thought that florida was going to be closer in the 2020 presidential race than it ended up being. while a drop in gop participation in mail-in voting was expected, the surge in republican day-of voting was substantially larger than expected, leading to trump comfortably winning this swing state.\n\nwe don't know who people are actually voting for\n\nthe third reason you should be careful when trying to infer much from early voting is probably the most obvious one: while you might know voters' partisan affiliation, you don't actually know who people voted for.\n\nad\n\ndemographic and party information is sometimes provided by the states (and sometimes by voter file vendors), but while that can be useful, it definitely doesn't tell the entire story. this is especially true now as we are probably witnessing a political realignment in which democrats are losing support from hispanic voters, and possibly black men, while gaining support among white voters with college degrees.\n\njoe biden's narrow victory in georgia, coupled with two runoff elections that will determine control of the senate, have drawn national attention to the state. (the washington post)\n\neducation is quickly becoming a key factor, and that's not something collected on voter registration forms. it's a lot harder to model. while regional differences in education and turnout can give us some insight into whether people with or without bachelor's degrees are voting, this type of ecological inference is also fraught.\n\nad\n\neven using party registration (as we did above with florida) isn't as straightforward. party registration, party affiliation (as in, which party one might feel closest to) and presidential vote preference aren't necessarily always aligned, which can make it hard to use them to predict the final outcome.\n\nwhat does this all mean for georgia?\n\nin november, despite the pandemic, more georgians voted early in person than by mail. it looks like that trend is continuing for the january runoffs, with proportionally even more georgians voting in person than by mail.\n\nad\n\nthis suggests that more people might vote on jan. 5, the actual election day, as well. since the early vote seems to favor democrats, the election day vote will probably favor republicans. the key question is how much better will republicans do?\n\nad\n\nbut even more generally, comparing the current numbers to those from october and november is problematic. christmas and new year's mean there are a few days this time where early in-person voting won't be possible. and we generally expect early voting to slow around the holidays.
but with the mammoth legislation pushed through with little time for deliberation, and the country focused on the surging coronavirus pandemic, the convoluted saga ended with an air of anticlimax.\n\nordinary brits were unlikely to have noticed a sharp change as the clock hit 11 p.m. on new year's eve and the transition period formally ended. the deal avoided the worst-case scenario — a dreaded no deal brexit and attendant border chaos — but will bring few, if any, immediate and visible benefits.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe agreement stakes out britain's post-brexit relationship with the e.u. in painstaking detail across more than 1,200 pages. but despite years of negotiation, it leaves several questions unresolved. brexit may be over, but the relationship between an independent britain and the e.u. has just begun.\n\nhere are some of big questions that the brexit deal has not answered:\n\nwhat happens to the fish?\n\nfishing rights in the waters surrounding britain had been a subject of bitter debate over the past few weeks. in the end, the two sides staked out an uneasy, and potentially unstable, compromise in the e.u.-u.k. trade and cooperation agreement.\n\nfisheries will be in a period of transition for five years, with e.u. ships eventually giving up a quarter of their fishing rights in british waters — far below what british groups had hoped for. after the transition period is over, there will be annual negotiations over fishing rights, with both sides able to apply tariffs to the other side's fish to compensate for any losses.\n\nbritish fishing groups have lashed out, with industry groups calling it a betrayal. and given the ongoing nature of the negotiations, the small but politically powerful sector is likely to lobby for tougher positions in the future.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nit will be up to the british government to see how much they comply. critics have complained that the fishing groups — which employ roughly 12,000 people and brought in less than $1.3 billion worth of fish last year — have been given too much consideration, and the threat of e.u. tariffs may make london wary of pushing too hard.\n\nwhat about the financiers?\n\nlondon is a global financial capital, with financial services employing over a million people and contributing $178 billion to the british economy. so what does the trade agreement say about that?\n\nnot much, it turns out. the agreement is almost entirely focused on tangible goods crossing borders, rather than services such as finance. and that could prove to be a sizable problem for british firms that hope to sell their services in european states.\n\nad\n\nad\n\njohnson has admitted that the deal as it stands perhaps does not go as far as we would like, but he emphasized that the hope is that smaller equivalence deals will be reached with brussels that guarantee access for british firms.\n\nwhat is the future of northern ireland?\n\nthe threat of a hard irish border had lingered over brexit negotiations, with concerns that the violence of the troubles could return if border checks between northern ireland and ireland, which remains an e.u. member, are established.\n\nthe brexit deal has avoided that outcome. it will keep to a protocol agreed on last year that saw northern ireland stay in the e.u.'s single market for goods and apply e.u. customs rules at its ports, avoiding the chaotic scenes at the border that many in ireland had feared.\n\nthe northern ireland protocol is now in effect, which sees the region operate under different regulatory and customs arrangements to the rest of the uk. (press association (pa))\n\nin the long term, however, the changes will lead to concerns about diminished links between northern ireland and the rest of the united kingdom. under the new rules, for example, the european court of justice will remain the top court for some disputes in northern ireland — but not the rest of the u.k.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe irish government has reached out to those in northern ireland, offering to fund their places in erasmus, a popular scheme that allows students to spend a year studying in another e.u. nation.\n\nand gibraltar?\n\nthe future of this tiny british territory that sits underneath and is attached to the spanish mainland was not detailed in the trade agreement. roughly 15,000 spanish citizens crossed the border into gibraltar every day before the pandemic, and imposing a hard border would deeply disrupt economic activity in the enclave.\n\nin a last-minute agreement reached on new year's eve before the transition period ended, britain agreed to allow free movement to and from gibraltar from spain that would see the territory join the passport-free schengen area, with passport checks at the airport for flights from britain.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe agreement prevents the immediate need for a hard border but will raise longer-term questions about british sovereignty over gibraltar, which is home to about 32,000 people and has been under british control since the 1713 treaty of utrecht.\n\ncan the united kingdom stay together?\n\nnorthern ireland isn't the only issue tugging at the fabric of the u.k. as british lawmakers voted on the brexit deal on wednesday, the divisions were obvious: the vast majority of scottish members of parliament voted against the bill.\n\nscotland's story is european. and that story does not end today, ian blackford, scottish national party representative for the isle of skye, said on the floor of westminster.\n\nad\n\nthe pro-independence movement in scotland predates britain's exit from the e.u. — the country voted to remain part of the u.k. by 55 percent to 45 percent in 2015 — and it was not in the remit of brexit negotiations to deal with the issue, which is internal to britain.\n\nad\n\nbut there's little doubt that the drawn-out process has added fuel to the movement: a poll last month showed support for scottish independence hitting a record high of 58 percent, though the british government has shown no sign of allowing a referendum on the matter anytime soon.\n\nwill britain's negotiations with the e.u. ever end?\n\nthese aren't the only outstanding issues to be navigated. others include data protection and the matter of ensuring a level playing field between britain and the e.u., which could allow brussels to impose punitive tariffs on british industries if london slashed regulations to make itself more competitive.\n\nad\n\nthe brexit deal has clauses for reviewing trade terms after five years — a timing that would bring the negotiations roughly in line with the next british election — so the terms of britain's relationship with the e.u. are likely to remain a political issue for some time.\n\nad\n\ndavid allen green, a commentator on brexit, has argued that in the end britain will find itself being progressively aligned closer with e.u. rules — as he puts it, potentially swapping an ever-closer union for what may be an ever-closer agreement.
here is a list of some people in trump's orbit who have found themselves as sometimes enemies, sometimes allies of the president. you could call them the president's frenemies.\n\nsen. lindsey o. graham\n\nperhaps no one better personifies the up-and-down experience of being frenemies with trump than sen. lindsey o. graham (r-s.c.). the two have plenty of reasons to dislike each other: trump gave graham's cellphone number to the world, a tactic of harassment known as doxing, when both of them were competing in the republican presidential primary. and graham, an early supporter of the probes into russian collusion so loathed by the president, has offered somewhat regular criticism of trump.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbut observers have noted a change in the senator's tune of late. he has touted trump's golf clubs after a round with the president, lambasted the very rebukes of trump he once leveled himself and turned increasingly critical of the russia investigation. last week, graham joined sen. charles e. grassley (r-iowa) in a formal request to the justice department asking for the criminal prosecution of christopher steele, a former british spy whose research led to the so-called trump dossier, claiming that steele had lied to the fbi — a development likely to please the president.\n\nbut there he was monday on national television, poking fun at the president when asked about trump's very stable genius tweet. if he doesn't call himself a genius, nobody else will, graham said.\n\nsen. john mccain\n\nsen. john mccain (r-ariz.) and president trump have been at odds with each other for a while. here's a look at their war of words. (jenny starrs/the washington post)\n\ntrump's war with sen. john mccain dates back to the early days of his campaign, when trump disparaged the arizona republican's record as a prisoner of war in vietnam. since then the two have continued to spar; trump vowed retribution against mccain for the senator's vote against repealing the affordable care act, and mccain later went on the offensive, seeming to criticize the president's avoidance of the draft during the vietnam war for bone spurs, though he later denied that was his intent.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin september, mccain wrecked an effort to repeal the affordable care act with a thumbs-down vote, drawing the ire of the president.\n\nbut though mccain remains a critic of the administration, he has also worked to advance its priorities: he supported the vast majority of trump nominees and was an instrumental vote in helping pass the sweeping tax cuts, aimed at wealthy individuals and corporations, that were so important to the president's agenda.\n\nmccain, though he still voices criticism of the president, says he does not have any doubts which side he is on. i get along with the democrats, but please, i'm not their hero, mccain told new york magazine in 2017. they're trying to use us. we will work with them, but have no doubt, their agenda is not our agenda.\n\njames b. comey\n\nit is by now an old story: james b. comey, who as director of the fbi rebuked hillary clinton for her use of a private email server and then announced that his office had reopened an investigation into the matter about a week before the election, was lambasted by democrats for what many said were unconventional moves. trump, then a candidate, praised him. it took a lot of guts. i really disagreed with him. i was not his fan, trump said as the election neared. i tell you what, what he did, he brought back his reputation. he brought it back.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbut the tides turned as the fbi's investigation into alleged russian collusion with the trump campaign progressed. during a visit at the white house, trump called comey out by name, shaking his hand and saying, in what was both a compliment and a barb, he's become more famous than me. comey later described an uncomfortable private dinner with the president in which he said trump asked him twice to pledge his loyalty.\n\ntrump fired comey in may and called him a showboat and a grandstander, drawing wide outrage from across the political spectrum, including from many people who had sharply criticized comey previously.\n\ncomey has punched back with indirect posts seemingly aimed at trump and his associates on twitter and instagram.\n\nsen. bob corker\n\nsen. bob corker (r-tenn.) and president trump are still trading barbs. here's a look at their feud. (bastien inzaurralde, jenny starrs/the washington post)\n\namong members of congress, corker had one of the more bitter public feuds with trump, which fell into public view after the senator voted against the effort to repeal the affordable care act. he referred to the white house as an adult day-care center and commented that trump's volatility could set the united states on a path to world war iii. he accused the president of debasing the country with untruths, name-calling and attempted bullying.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ntrump returned fire, calling him liddle bob corker in october and saying the senator begged for his endorsement and decided not to run for reelection only when the president declined. he later said that corker couldn't get elected dogcatcher in tennessee.\n\nbut the two appear to be inching closer again. corker, whom many critics had hoped might vote against the tax bill, instead helped carry it across the line. he traveled with the president on air force one on monday to nashville to attend a farm bureau meeting, drawing rumors that the two had made some amends. you're great senator, trump reportedly said at the meeting.\n\nrex tillerson\n\ntension between trump and his secretary of state spilled into public view after an nbc report alleged that rex tillerson had called the president a moron after a meeting at the pentagon with the president's national security team.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nas the washington post reported at the time, trump was upset with what he saw as arrogance on the part of tillerson: he was irked by rumors of disloyalty; some of the secretary's arguments on global situations involving iran, climate change and north korea; and tillerson's visible frustration when overruled.\n\ntillerson, meanwhile, was frustrated by some of trump's behavior, including the president's frequent and incendiary use of twitter, which he has used to make statements that contradict tillerson's, and trump's remarks that there were fine people among the white nationalists marching at a rally in charlottesville in august. still tillerson pledged his loyalty to the president after the incident and sought to play down the rupture.\n\ndemocrats have looked to tillerson to rein in trump's posturing with north korea. intrigue continues over if and when he will be replaced at the state department.\n\nad\n\nad\n\njeff sessions\n\nthe relationship between president trump and attorney general jeff sessions has deteriorated in recent months. here's a look at how they got to this point. (taylor turner/the washington post)\n\nperhaps no one better personifies the confusing ride that makes for a frenemiship with trump than attorney general jeff sessions. an early and prominent supporter of trump's candidacy — he was the first senator to endorse him — sessions was awarded with the prominent cabinet nomination, narrowly winning senate confirmation after a wide debate. just a single senate democrat voted to confirm sessions.\n\nbut trump quickly soured on sessions after the attorney general recused himself from the investigation into possible collusion between the president's campaign and russia, a decision sessions faced great pressure to make after the post revealed that he had spoken with the russian ambassador twice during the presidential campaign, in direct contradiction of his assertion during his confirmation hearing that he did not have communications with the russians.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nafter months of anger, trump publicly disclosed his resentment with sessions last summer. by then, sessions had already offered to resign, the post reported.\n\nnow, as pressure mounts on sessions from trump loyalists hoping to force him from his job, some democrats have stepped in to defend him, for the sake of the mueller investigation.\n\ni voted against jeff sessions and said he never should be there in the first place, given his record on civil rights, on immigration, on so many other issues, senate minority leader charles e. schumer (d-n.y.) said thursday, according to cnn. my view now is very simple: nothing, nothing should ever interfere with the mueller investigation.\n\nsen. mitch mcconnell\n\ntrump went after senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) in august after the failure of the republican effort to repeal the affordable care act. for a thing like that to happen is a disgrace, and frankly it shouldn't have happened, trump said, adding that he was very disappointed in mitch. the criticism drew sharp responses from many prominent republicans, including sen. orrin g. hatch (r-utah) and former house speaker newt gingrich, an informal trump adviser.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmcconnell and trump have since worked to patch things over, at least publicly, and mcconnell was instrumental in passing the tax bill.
we believe the immediate risk here in the united states remains low, and we're working hard to keep that risk low, anne schuchat, the cdc's principal deputy director, said during a hastily convened afternoon news briefing.\n\nearlier in the day, cdc officials and others expressed greater urgency.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nultimately, we expect we will see community spread in the united states. it's not a question of if this will happen, but when this will happen, and how many people in this country will have severe illnesses, nancy messonnier, the director of the national center for immunization and respiratory diseases at the cdc, said during the morning briefing with reporters.\n\nmessonnier said the rapid surge in cases outside mainland china in the past several days prompted the change in official warnings.\n\nthere is growing evidence that efforts to contain the spread of the virus outside china have failed. there are now more than 1,100 cases in south korea, at least 15 people have died in iran, and new cases were reported for the first time in switzerland, austria and a luxury resort in spain. in the united states, 57 people have the virus, all but 14 of them evacuees from the diamond princess cruise ship, which had been quarantined in yokohama, japan.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmessonnier noted the emergence of cases in multiple nations without a known source of exposure. evidence of what is called community spread, she said, is triggering strategies to confront the respiratory virus, including urging businesses, health-care facilities and even schools to plan now for ways to limit the impact of the illness when it spreads.\n\nhealth leaders voiced similar warnings in a closed-door briefing tuesday morning for senators. sen. patty murray (d-wash.) said officials had cautioned them that there was a very strong chance of an extremely serious outbreak of the coronavirus here in the united states.\n\nwhile there is no vaccine for covid-19, preventive steps and awareness are the best tools to prepare and protect yourself in the event of an outbreak. (the washington post)\n\nnot long after, though, national economic council director larry kudlow tried to assuage concerns over the coronavirus and its impact on the u.s. economy, telling cnbc's kelly evans on the exchange, we have contained this. i won't say airtight, but pretty close to airtight.\n\nad\n\nad\n\neven top gop lawmakers struggled to explain the inconsistent messages coming from the government.\n\ni can't comment on what the white house has been saying on this because the people who work for the white house are not saying that, said sen. roy blunt (r-mo.)\n\nthe confused messaging threatened to obscure urgent public health advice coming from the cdc early tuesday, when officials said the agency would be focusing on containing the spread of the virus in the united states, as well as warning people to prepare.\n\ndisruptions to everyday life may be severe, but people might want to start thinking about that now, said the cdc's messonnier. she said parents may want to call their school offices to see what plans they have in place and consider options for child care. messonnier added that she called the office of her children's schools superintendent to find out about the school system's plans.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbusinesses need to consider replacing in-person meetings with telework, messonnier said. school authorities should consider ways to limit face-to-face contact, such as dividing students into smaller groups, using internet-based learning or even closing schools. local officials should consider modifying, postponing or canceling large gatherings. hospitals should consider ways to triage patients who do not need urgent care and recommend that patients delay surgery that isn't absolutely necessary.\n\nsome senators who attended tuesday's closed-door briefing played down any alarmist tone from health officials. however, sen. lamar alexander (r-tenn.) said senators were told that the number of cases in the united states would inevitably grow.\n\nwhat we heard was that it's inevitable that we'll have more than 14 cases as time goes on, alexander said. and what we'll have to try to do is the same thing we've already done through quarantining and monitoring through our public health system to limit that as much as possible.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nsen. john neely kennedy (r-la.) criticized the briefing for lawmakers, saying officials could not answer his basic questions while they issued dire warnings.\n\ni thought a lot of the briefing was bulls---, kennedy said. they would answer the question but dodge, bob and weave. i understand there's a lot they don't know. i get that. but they need to answer the questions straight up. they all talk about a task force, a committee — a committee's not going to solve this problem.\n\nblunt, kennedy and sen. mitt romney (r-utah) were among gop senators who told health officials about concerns during the closed-door briefing, including the level of spending the administration is prepared to commit, the adequacy of preparations and the length of time for development of a vaccine.\n\nad\n\ni'm very disappointed in the preparation that's been done over the last few years anticipating the potential of an outbreak of substance, romney said later.\n\nad\n\ntraveling in india this week, trump said the united states was very close to a vaccine. while top health officials have praised the record speed with which they expect to get a coronavirus vaccine into early clinical safety tests, it is likely to be a year or 18 months before the vaccine is widely available, said anthony fauci, the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases. fauci said tuesday that he expected phase-one testing of the vaccine to begin within six weeks if there are no glitches.\n\nit will still be an important tool for the future, fauci said.\n\nad\n\ntestifying before a senate appropriations subcommittee, health and human services secretary alex azar defended the administration's overall response and its $1.8 billion emergency spending plan for the virus, which includes $1.25 billion in new money and transfers of other funds from ebola research. the total the administration proposes to spend to fight the virus is at least $2.5 billion, according to the plan released late monday.\n\nsen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) and other democratic presidential candidates slammed the trump administration's response to the coronavirus at the feb. 25 debate. (the washington post)\n\ndemocrats slammed the request as woefully inadequate and excoriated the administration for cutting public health budgets for years. even some republicans wondered whether it was enough.\n\nad\n\nif you lowball something like this, you'll pay for it later, senate appropriations committee chairman richard c. shelby (r-ala.) told azar. you're not only dealing with the crisis, you're dealing with the perception of the american people, shelby said, adding that the coronavirus could be an existential threat for many americans.\n\nad\n\nthe steps the president has taken are the most aggressive containment measures ever taken, azar said. our country is preparing every day.\n\nazar pushed back against senators' complaints. he pointed to the use of the first federal quarantine authority in more than 50 years to contain the virus and efforts to restrict travel from china. he said the administration's supplemental request focused on expanding surveillance for coronavirus in the united states, support for state and local governments, procuring and supporting research and development of vaccines and therapeutics, and acquiring additional personal protective equipment such as masks and ventilators.
in a letter to the secretary on monday, departing board chairman tony knowles, a former alaska governor, wrote that he and eight other members have stood by waiting for the chance to meet and continue the partnership . . . as prescribed by law. all of the signatories, who serve as unpaid volunteers, had terms set to expire in may.,\n\nad\n\nad\n\nafter a four-month review of federal lands and waters, interior secretary ryan zinke says president trump should modify 10 national monuments. (monica akhtar, juliet eilperin, darryl fears/the washington post)\n\nwe understand the complexity of transition but our requests to engage have been ignored and the matters on which we wanted to brief the new department team are clearly not part of its agenda, knowles wrote. i wish the national park system and service well and will always be dedicated to their success.\n\non wednesday, carolyn carrie hessler radelet, the chief executive of project concern international, submitted a separate resignation letter. [f]rom all of the events of this past year i have a profound concern that the mission of stewardship, protection, and advancement of our national parks has been set aside, wrote radelet, whose term was not set to expire until 2021. i hope that future actions of the department of interior demonstrate that this is not the case.\n\nin an email earlier this month inquiring about the status of the more than 200 boards that had come under review, interior spokeswoman heather swift said, boards have restarted. she did not provide any further details and did not respond to an inquiry tuesday.\n\nad\n\nad\n\npresident trump may reduce the size of a national monument designated by former president barack obama in the last weeks of his term. (gillian brockell/the washington post)\n\nsome advisory bodies apparently are operating. but others are still frozen because the department has yet to approve their updated charters, as is legally required under the federal advisory committee act. other panels, such as the cape cod national seashore advisory commission, have been reinstated but are still awaiting department approval for their agendas.\n\ntwo of the bureau of land management's 38 resource advisory councils (racs) — rocky mountain and southwest colorado — had to postpone meetings scheduled for thursday because their charters were out of date.\n\nit's concerning that our advisory council has been unable to meet for over a year, said scott braden, a member of the rocky mountain rac who is a wilderness and public lands advocate at conservation colorado. secretary zinke has said that local input is important for blm to consider, and yet these councils, which provide just such input, have been sidelined.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbraden added that the council planned to discuss a new management plan for blm land in eastern colorado, how to implement fee increases in the region and the problem of homelessness on public lands.\n\nin at least two instances, zinke has disbanded existing advisory bodies — the wildlife and hunting heritage conservation council and the advisory committee on climate change and natural resource science. he replaced the first one with the hunting and shooting sports conservation council, which just started soliciting nominations jan. 9. it will place a heavier emphasis on sport shooting while promoting hunters' and fishermen's access to public lands.\n\nthe national park system advisory board, which was established in 1935, has typically included social and natural science academics as well as former elected officials from both parties. in recent years, it has advised interior on how to address climate change, among other issues, and how to encourage younger visitors to frequent the parks.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe board is required to meet twice a year but has not convened since trump took office last january, knowles said tuesday. members, most of whom have worked together for seven years, were surprised to not be consulted on interior's recent decisions to increase visitor fees and reverse a ban on plastic water bottles in the park system. the decision to reverse climate change directives and other policies drove the decision to resign, he said.\n\nwe were frozen out, said knowles, who emphasized that the group recognized zinke would select new members this year but wanted the momentum to continue from what the board accomplished in 2016 during the park system's centennial year.\n\ngretchen long, a board member from wilson, wyo., said in an email that the nine board members resigned given the administration's seeming attitude that the group's work could be so summarily dismissed. . . . and we worry greatly that the new initiatives incorporated in the [national park system] are now being rescinded.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe two remaining board members are harvard university public finance professor linda bilmes and university of maryland marine science professor rita colwell, whose terms end in may. in an email, bilmes said she did not resign her post because she is conducting research with other colleagues that is funded by the national park foundation and wants to complete her project.\n\nsince the interior secretary cannot establish new historical and natural landmarks without the board's approval, none has been declared since jan. 11, 2016, when then-secretary sally jewell designated 24 such landmarks.\n\nthe board members' action comes as one of zinke's top deputies, doug domenech, assistant secretary for insular areas, plans to move into the washington offices that the national park service has occupied for half a century. nps will be relocated elsewhere in the building, according to individuals briefed on the plans.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nzinke has identified repairing the park system's aging infrastructure as one of his top priorities, though he has yet to nominate a national park service director.\n\nwashington sen. maria cantwell, the top democrat on the senate energy and natural resources commitee, questioned why zinke has yet to nominate a director and urged him to solicit more outside opinion on how he manages national parks. i call on secretary zinke to personally reach out to each member of the national park service advisory board and tell them their counsel is valued and that this administration respects local voices, she said in a statement late tuesday.\n\nthe coalition to protect america's national parks, which is made up of current, former and retired park service staff, sharply criticized the secretary's treatment of the long-standing board.\n\nad\n\nad
hear the eternally pleasing voice of jackson, who died at 89 vivid years friday night, and you might close your eyes and see the leaves turning outdoors even while you remain on the sofa. hear the voice of jackson, and you might know the football situation on the television called for gravitas, even if the unpretentious voice did manage to arrive at gravitas without trying. hear that voice, and every american region seemed contained somewhere within it, from the boyhood on a georgia farm near the alabama line to the longtime residence in los angeles to all the chronic alighting everywhere in between.\n\nwith his trips into the pizazzy corridors of the english language, this man who broadcast everything from olympics to baseball helped make madcap college football into madcap college football yet also exceeded college football and then sports, becoming a form of saturday bedrock.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhear the voice, and you might know you're shirking an errand, and you might not care.\n\nthe voice took a technical game of stupefying moments and 100,000-strong crowds and distilled it to its humanity. jackson would call a game in the midwest yet give a score from arkansas vs. mississippi and say, them hogs and rebels've been fightin' down there a loooong time. he would call a ucla quarterback throwing a late bomb on the los angeles memorial coliseum floor by blaring, as the ball launched upward, throws it just as far as he can throw it . . . in a first quarter, he would introduce an offensive line, maybe nebraska's, and refer to some 280-pounder as the runt of the bunch. he would forgive a compromised running game by commending the defense as like sticking your head into a sausage factory. after a time, he would change how you viewed games, would keep you staring at blasé games just to hear what the voice might yield next.\n\nyet the voice, so lush with possibility, also knew how to go spare.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nnice kick. got a little wind under it. (pause) look at that! (pause.) oh my goodness! (pause.) one man [to beat]! (pause.) goodbye. (pause.) hellooooo, heisman!\n\nthat would be michigan's desmond howard, along the hurried path of his 93-yard punt return against ohio state in 1991, sweeping into the end zone at the end.\n\nhe's going for the cornerrrr! he's got it! (long pause.) vince. (short pause.) young. (short pause.) scores.\n\nthat would be jackson's entire call of the last touchdown he would call, texas's final offensive play with 30 seconds left and a 38-33 deficit in the unreasonably good 2006 rose bowl, with that r in corner held through part of young's diagonal fourth-down trek from the southern california 8-yard line to the pylon at the front-right corner of the end zone. that came just after abc ran a graphic of the longest winning streaks ever — because usc stood sixth with 34 at that moment — and just after yale appeared twice on the list, from the 1890s, and dan fouts said, nobody wanted to play yale back then, and jackson said, noooooo! don't jab a finger at that bunch. they'd beatcha up.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthen, as texas and usc lined up for one of the most serious plays in the game's history, the voice reminded us it also wasn't that serious, simply by saying, i'm too old for this.\n\nthat thumping sound was the doorrrrr, closing.\n\nthat came just before jackson's first retirement, in early 1999, the one retirement he couldn't quite keep, just after tennessee completed a 21-yard, fourth-down screen pass, tee martin to shawn bryson, in the fiesta bowl and bowl championship series title game. it gave tennessee a first down at the florida state 10-yard line, with a 23-16 lead, inside two minutes.\n\nphil fulmer went to see george cafego, who was an absolute legend in tennessee football history, two days before he passed away, jackson then said, referring to the tennessee coach and cafego's death the previous february. continuing: and george said to phil, 'good luck. i'll be watching.' \n\nad\n\nad\n\nthen, in a turn only jackson would make, he continued, good night, george. and thanks.\n\non the next play, tennessee fumbled the handoff exchange. it would prove harmless, but in the moment, it looked catastrophic until jackson again brought it back to humanity when he said to his broadcast partner, bob griese: you see something like that, bob, and you say, 'why in the world would anybody want to coach?' \n\ngood night, mr. jackson. and thanks. thanks for making life so much better than it would have been without you.\n\nafter all, when a sole straggler driving a florida highway that fiesta bowl night in 1999 pulled over and rented a room, the sole purpose wasn't to watch the game. it was to hear, one last time, the voice collaborating with the game. that voice mandated a highway exit both random and urgent, an exit made because a vast deprivation lay ahead after that game, and here came a last chance to savor something authentic, something irreplaceable.
ad\n\nwe are not going to stop until republicans don't even want to run candidates here, said mcadams, 54, a molecular geneticist turned singer-songwriter with a fondness for alliterative phrases. we are going to make this place too blue to bother.\n\nin this affluent outpost of the state capital, local democrats are done playing iowa nice. they are mounting aggressive recruitment campaigns, mocking opponents and organizing to try to push republicans out of elected seats, including offices that are traditionally nonpartisan.\n\ntheir strategy has upended the live-and-let-live atmosphere that often permeates the suburbs, where some democrats said they used to be content to focus on their families and leave local politics to the other party. republicans have gained more power in rural areas and manufacturing towns, turning a state that twice voted for barack obama into a place where republicans have total control of the capitol and president trump won easily.\n\nad\n\nad\n\neven as iowa democrats focus on their first-in-the-nation presidential nominating contest on monday, with many still undecided and anguishing over their choice, activists are trying not to lose sight of a longer-term political goal: staging a political takeover.\n\nit's a sprint to the finish for the democratic presidential candidates in iowa, where caucusgoers will cast the first votes of the 2020 campaign. (the washington post)\n\ntoday's suburbs aren't like the ones that existed 30, 20 or even four years ago. between rapid population growth, shifting demographics and anti-trump sentiments, they have become key to democratic hopes of compensating for the defection of many working-class white voters to the gop.\n\nstate data shows that the great voter-registration advantage that republicans once had in the des moines suburbs continues to narrow. in 2018, four state house seats and one congressional seat went from red to blue. in 2019, democrats in polk county won 13 seats on city councils and school boards that had been held previously by republicans.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe democratic party's biggest successes in those years came in a part of the state that was overwhelmingly white, well educated and affluent — home to some of the fastest-growing cities in the united states.\n\nwhen mcadams and her family moved to ankeny in 1999, this place was a reliably red bedroom community of 27,000. by 2018, the number was 66,000 and growing.\n\nwidened roads and state highways connect ankeny to cities that were once surrounded by fields and farms, like johnston, urbandale and waukee, which boasts of students speaking 62 languages in the schools.\n\nplaces where soybeans were planted and pigs once roamed are sprouting $750,000 houses, townhouses for young professionals, strip malls with barre studios and restaurants with chicken tandoori and quinoa bowls.\n\non this night, mcadams's ankeny army was composed of those relative newcomers. here was kelsie goodman, a 35-year-old high school assistant principal who had returned home because there were so many more options in this area than there had been before. she was proud to be from a state that was the first in the midwest to legalize same-sex marriage, a place that helped to springboard the candidacy of the first black president. but as her state was slowly diversifying, she had become concerned that trump was empowering voters who resented those very distinctions.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nnext to her was amy tagliareni, a 49-year-old administrator of a small nonprofit and a mother of a middle-schooler. she had moved to the state in 2008 but had never voted in a primary until 2018. she voted for hillary clinton in the 2016 general election but felt she needed to become more active because so many middle-class white women like her had voted republican or chosen not to vote at all. the president won the majority in all but one precinct of ankeny districts in polk county.\n\ni feel so embarrassed, she said.\n\nthe two women were representative of the people who were fueling the activism in ankeny: young professionals and mothers with older children. they were horrified most by what they saw as the trump administration's poor treatment of the vulnerable — separating immigrant families, restricting food stamps, banning refugees — and were desperate to post some wins. so they decided to play hard.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe change was evident when the polk county democrats invited house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) to a fundraiser. some officials from other parts of the state warned against bringing such a polarizing figure to a politically fractured state, but more than 350 people attended.\n\nthe fundraiser also attracted protesters who supported the president but misspelled his name: t-r-m-u-p.\n\nin past years, nicer democratic parties would let that go, said sean bagniewski, chairman of the polk county democrats. we took a picture, paid for a facebook ad and showed it to 500 hundred dollars' worth of people.\n\nconventional practice used to be that local elections were strictly nonpartisan affairs. no more. in 2018 and 2019, the polk county group dispatched fliers to registered democrats that showed the name and picture of every person in their party running for office, from the congress to the school board.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nour message was simple, bag­niewski said. these are the democrats. this is the fight of our lives. get rid of donald trump.\n\nnow, it is republican politicians who are fighting for their political preservation. in urbandale, the republican mayor switched parties. state house majority leader chris hagenow, seeking reelection, switched neighborhoods.\n\nand last week, state sen. zach nunn filed legislation that would ban county parties from pouring money into nonpartisan races and printing fliers like the ones distributed by bagniewski.\n\na local school board trying to figure out how to fund a teacher program or a city council working to fix a street should not be a partisan issue, nunn said. what they are doing is, in a word, frightening.\n\nad\n\nnunn also said he didn't think it was very wise. while the democrats were experiencing more success in ankeny, he was able to sail through his election in altoona — one of those blue-collar democratic districts that swung for trump. their attitude, he said, only solidified the idea that the party was catering to the elite.\n\nad\n\nthey might win these suburbs, but they are going to lose every other part of the state, and all the gains they make will be mitigated, nunn said. but as a republican in the suburbs, he readily admitted he felt a bit endangered.\n\ni'm one of the last ones left, he said.\n\non a snowy saturday, about a week before the caucuses, the new activists were targeting another one of the last remaining republicans, a square-jawed state senator named brad zaun. zaun was attending a legislative forum held in a no-frills community room at a local park, on a panel that included the urbandale mayor and state rep. karin derry, a political newcomer who had won her seat during the democratic wave of 2018.\n\nad\n\nthere's a lot of publicity around the democrats, but we live in a great community, and it hasn't changed that much, zaun said in an interview. i'm up for reelection this year, and i'm not too worried.\n\nad\n\nthe democratic activists saw it differently. when the forum started, they took their seats. there was nothing particularly coordinated about them; they weren't wearing special uniforms or reciting catchy slogans. they didn't even sit next to one another.\n\nthey took turns asking zaun questions about issues that concerned them. when one asked him to fight for more money to go toward education, another held up her cellphone to record zaun responding that he would rather try to find ways to cut administrative costs. this was potential fodder to argue that zaun was weak on school funding.\n\nwhen one asked zaun about a bill that would make it illegal for institutions to ban guns from their parking lots, another recorded footage of zaun saying he was a strong supporter of the second amendment. this was potential footage to show he didn't want gun control.\n\nderry, the state representative, knew most of the activists at the forum. after all, she had hosted them at a late-in-the-season holiday party the night before. the activists, all women, ate cookies and cheesecake and sat around her christmas tree, speckled with blue ornaments — a tradition that started in 2016 as a symbolic protest of trump. they discussed the pop star lizzo and their husbands and how to come up with a strategy to get another friend elected to zaun's seat.\n\nad\n\nthe plan didn't seem like that much of a coup. they had done the same for derry, knocking on doors and making phone calls to get her elected in a district where the republican registration advantage had shrunk from 14 percentage points in 2016 to about 7 today.\n\nthe arguments against zaun would largely be the same. they would tell residents that the 2016 election — which also gave republicans all three branches of iowa government — had deep consequences.\n\nrepublicans had weakened collective bargaining, passed voter restrictions and curbed abortion rights. derry found that even her conservative neighbors were willing to listen to their points.\n\nlifelong republicans such as mark toebben, a 62-year-old retired business executive, voted for her for reasons that went beyond trump. he had grown increasingly frustrated that lawmakers wouldn't boost the education budget past the rate of inflation. it felt as if his party was attacking the very thing that made his community great: the school system.\n\ni've really just lost faith in the republicans, said toebben, who planned on caucusing with democrats for the first time. i understand the realities of politics, but i also understand that you have got to see the bigger picture in life. i think they've lost track of the big picture.\n\nin ankeny, mcadams was still trying to understand the big picture. she saw her community as a blank political canvas, its future still unwritten.\n\ni can't do anything about wisconsin — that's their problem, mcadams said. pennsylvania, michigan — i can't do anything about that. but i can do some damage in ankeny, and i can deliver ankeny to the democrats on election night.\n\nher crusade started with a desire to remove trump, but it was also about herself. after the great unsettling of 2016, she realized she hadn't taken stock of her neighborhood, which had grown so much that she could hardly recognize it.\n\nshe hadn't taken much stock of her country, either. republicans were sweeping state houses and blocking obama's agenda in washington. young african americans had grown so exhausted with police violence that they were taking to the streets to assert that their lives, too, had value.\n\nstill, mcadams remained in a state of suburban bliss. she raised children, put on open-mic nights. she figured things couldn't be that bad; after all, the country had elected a black president.\n\ni think a lot of us felt like we had racism under control, that white supremacy was gone, that we'd solved a lot of problems, mcadams said. i think we grew complacent. i know we did. i did.\n\nshe pledged to do something to get more involved — or at least find more like-minded people. she rebuilt the democratic club's website and updated its social media pages. more residents were visiting the facebook page, and more started attending meetings. before 2016, the group averaged a monthly attendance of eight. now, the attendance averages around 50.\n\nwhen the democratic candidates began to file in 2018 and 2019, she urged her group members to do everything they could to elect them.\n\nshe asked volunteers to knock on doors. if they did not want to knock on doors, she asked them to make phone calls. if they did not feel comfortable making phone calls, they could write postcards. if not postcards, she'd ask volunteers to drive so others could knock on doors.\n\nas they set out to find registered democrats, mcadams saw an ankeny beyond its stereotype. there were trailer parks, and residents there said they couldn't afford rising rents. middle-class-looking homes had sunken ceilings and no hot water inside.\n\nthey drove through neighborhoods of bosnian refugees and met black and south asian families who had moved for better jobs. even as the city's median income continued to rise, the suburbs had become more diverse and more stratified.\n\nwe just never noticed it because we were too damn busy, mcadams said.\n\npolitics was the impetus, but the thing mcadams and others felt they were missing most was community. the old institutions for gathering neighbors — churches, union halls, country clubs — were all playing less of a role in american life. politics, and the discussion of it, was the suburbs' new social club.\n\nthey started reading clubs, drinking clubs, women's groups. deshara bohanna, who would become the first black woman on ankeny's school board, started a meetup group to discuss racism and diversity.\n\nwe are a family now, mcadams said. and i've got more best friends and sisters and brothers than i did three years ago. i'd be damned if i lost contact with them after 2018. nothing is stopping us now because we are a family, and donald trump is still president.\n\nso that night at the caucus training, mcadams tried to give the volunteers every tool they would need to make their events run smoothly. she went over complex equations to properly calculate delegate counts. she suggested displaying tallies in publicly visible spaces so everyone could clearly see the results. to prevent perceptions of bias, she asked the volunteers not to wear clothing or buttons endorsing a political candidate.\n\ninstead, she had another suggestion.
on wednesday, a successful west coast governor who knows something about trade, democrat jay inslee, suggested he would throw his hat into the ring for 2020. he is pitching himself as the guy to put climate change at the top of the nation's priority list. to govern is to choose, inslee told msnbc's chris hayes. he offered a list of his progressive successes — on voting rights, minimum wages, net neutrality, transportation, etc. — and made the case that green technology makes climate change a jobs message as well. he might consider stressing his entire record as evidence of his ability to successfully govern, which includes climate change policies, and his role in challenging trump's vile immigration policies. almost as an afterthought, he notes that renewable-energy legislation helped launched a multibillion-dollar wind industry and helped his state lead in gdp growth and wages. that seems to be his greatest selling point — creating a progressive haven while growing the economy, raising wages and saving the planet. if inslee can articulate a vision entirely at odds with trump's and evidenced by his successful stewardship, he could be onto something.\n\nanother possible candidate with experience as governor of an economically prosperous state is former virginia governor terry mcauliffe. his post op-ed stresses his practicality. democrats must maintain our credibility with a pledge of results that are honest and achievable, he writes. we can expand the affordable care act and take on pharmaceutical companies' cartel pricing, pass comprehensive climate change legislation and substantially raise incomes through minimum-wage increases and tax fairness. and he deliberately contrasts his own results with a more strident progressive vision that includes guaranteed jobs and free college tuition. when the stakes are another four years of trump degrading our country, do we really want to use the 2020 campaign as a first-time experiment on idealistic but unrealistic policies?\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmcauliffe will have to overcome his association with the clintons and big-money politics. he'll need to avoid sounding like debbie downer raining on the progressives' dreams. however, his effort to tie his own candidacy, should he decide to win, with the party's successes running moderate candidates holds promise. (as we approach 2020, he writes, we should look at the candidates who won in swing districts in 2018. they are an energetic, diverse group who ran on realistic goals of lowering the cost of health care, improving education and raising wages.) he could make his message a unifying one as a candidate for all americans (urban poor, suburban middle class, college and non-college-educated): trump is hyper-divisive and a failure at governance; mcauliffe is the uniter who knows how to govern.\n\nwhether either or both of these governors can mount a viable campaign remains to be seen, but their presence in the race would provide a much-needed emphasis on practicality and competence. trump, who cannot keep the government open with republican majorities in both houses, could enter 2020 with a faltering economy, a massive debt, a health-care system hobbled by his own machinations and a ridiculous energy policy based on fantasies like clean coal. a competent governor from the center-left might be a welcome alternative to president chaos.
oftentimes taxonomy (the study of how we classify organisms) boils down to semantics, and while research in the field is important for the sake of knowledge, it rarely has much practical application and in extreme cases might hinder conservation efforts.\n\ntaxonomists classify organisms into species based on a variety of markers. some are based on breeding patterns; others are based on where the animals live and what they look like; and others differentiate populations based on dna — which has become more common thanks to genome sequencing technology. charles darwin himself was a bit fuzzy on the concept in on the origin of species, saying: no one definition [of species] has as yet satisfied all naturalists; yet every naturalist knows vaguely what he means when he speaks of a species.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwhat this means in practice is that the way we define species is often flawed or arbitrary. one of the most common examples is the distinction between eastern and western meadowlarks. these birds are almost indistinguishable except for the different chirps they sing to attract mates. scientists have come to the conclusion that because of these songs, meadowlarks have a capulet-and-montague thing going on, making them two different species. but this isn't a hard-and-fast rule. dedicated birdwatchers have, in fact, seen the two species interbreed in the wild — a shocking scandal requiring entire bird families to be plucked from their nests and studied intensively (poor things).\n\nin the field of taxonomy, we run into flaws like this all the time. a recent paper by french biologists at the university of montpellier shows just how nebulous the concept can be, detailing the gray areas in which organisms exist in an awkward genetic limbo between two species. how different does the dna of two animals have to be before they're considered different species? and as a separate issue, how do we differentiate between extinct animals we know of only through the fossil record? the field is confusing, unstandardized and surprisingly case-specific.\n\nto muddy things up even further, species are constantly changing. populations diverge from one another after becoming isolated — often thanks to the destruction of their habitats by humans. smaller populations increase the risk of inbreeding, mutations and genetic drift, or the general change in the dna of a species due to a lack of diversity.\n\nof course, taxonomy is still important. classifying organisms is essential to understanding how they evolved and to provide a common language for scientific discussion. carl linnaeus, who came up with the classification system we use today, originally did so to make exploration and trade more efficient.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbiologists also argue that taxonomy is essential to conservation. after all, how can you protect something if you don't know what it is? but today that argument can be a bit oversold. skeptics of modern taxonomy criticize over-classification as a hurdle to conservation techniques, preventing interventions to save endangered species by introducing similar animals from elsewhere to help breed.\n\nthe panther population in florida — which was on the verge of extinction and at high risk of genetic drift — saw this debate play out: conservationists who wanted to preserve the genetic makeup of the panther resisted releasing texas cougars (a separate sub-species) into the florida cat's territory, but two decades after eight cougars were introduced, the population is now recovering.\n\nin general, it's healthy to have some skepticism when discussing taxonomy — especially regarding news articles on newly discovered animals that are really just animals we've rebranded after sequencing their genomes. science is rarely the rigid discipline we often think it is. it's worth reminding ourselves that we're defining the way we talk about these things as we go.
prime minister boris johnson won a sweeping, decisive and powerful majority of parliamentary seats — and a mandate to deliver brexit — in thursday's general election.\n\nballots tallied through the night affirmed that johnson and his conservative party had achieved a smashing success, the largest win for the tories since the days of margaret thatcher — while the opposition labour party and its hard-left leader, jeremy corbyn, suffered their worst defeat in four decades.\n\nthe final count friday had the conservatives winning 365 spots in the 650-seat parliament.\n\ngetting brexit done is now the irrefutable, irresistible, unarguable decision of the british people, johnson said, standing in front of a backdrop that proclaimed the people's government.\n\nwith this election, i think we've now put an end to all those miserable threats of a second referendum, johnson said.\n\ncorbyn, after winning in his own islington constituency, announced he would not lead his party in any future general-election campaign but that he intended to stay on as leader during a period of reflection.\n\nthis is obviously a very disappointing night for the labour party, he said.\n\nhe defended the popularity's of the party's platform, which sought to right the wrongs and the injustices and inequalities that exist in this country. and he attributed the party's losses to the notion that brexit has so polarized and divided debate within this country, it has overridden so much of a normal political debate.\n\njohnson — the bombastic showman who led the campaign to leave the european union in the june 2016 referendum — is now positioned to be the prime minister to see britain set sail from europe next month.\n\nand dreams of a second referendum — of remaining in the e.u. — have been dashed.\n\nthe pound sterling surged in after-hours trading when voting ended and the national exit poll showed the conservatives forecast to win 368 out of 650 seats. the final tally was just three seats shy of that projection.\n\n\n\n\n\npresident trump, who made little effort to hide his partiality toward johnson during the election, tweeted his congratulations: britain and the united states will now be free to strike a massive new trade deal after brexit. this deal has the potential to be far bigger and more lucrative than any deal that could be made with the e.u. celebrate boris!\n\njohn bercow, the former speaker of the house of commons known for shouting order, assessed, it was a brexit-focused, brexit-oriented, brexit-dominated campaign.\n\nbercow told sky news that with such a large parliamentary majority, johnson could count on making the first stage of brexit happen. but that's the withdrawal agreement, said bercow, a former conservative lawmaker. that is about the divorce bill; it's about the rights of european citizens. it's about the irish border. i don't think, if i may say so, that means getting brexit done in the sense that it's gift-wrapped or oven-ready for christmas.\n\n['get brexit done': boris johnson's effective but misleading slogan in the british election]\n\nbritain would enter into a year-long transition period and immediately begin to engage in talks over a free-trade agreement and a host of other vexing issues with its former partners in the continental bloc — such as trade, intelligence-sharing and the movement of capital.\n\nbercow predicted britain would be debating brexit for the next five, 10, possibly 15 years.\n\nthis was britain's third general election in a little more than four years, and the second since the june 2016 brexit referendum. according to the surplus of opinion surveys and interviews, people are as hopelessly divided over the e.u. as they were when they voted 52 percent to 48 percent to leave.\n\nsara hobolt, a political scientist at the london school of economics, said the genius of boris johnson was that he united those who wanted brexit behind him, while the 'remain' vote is much more split.\n\n\n\nexit poll results are projected on the exterior of broadcasting house in london, just after the close of voting thursday in britain's general election. (jeff overs/bbc/ap)\n\njohnson and the conservatives ran as populists, offering not only brexit, but also a spending surge for cops, nurses, schools and elder care. one of their strategies was to try to break through labour's red wall of traditional support among the working classes in faded industrial towns in england's north and midlands.\n\nthe strategy was a success. the tories won the town of workington, for example, which labour held almost without a slip since 1918. voters there told reporters they wanted brexit — and didn't trust corbyn.\n\n[boris johnson closes election campaign by trying to crack labour's 'red wall' of support]\n\njohnson on friday morning specifically addressed voters who went conservative for the first time in this election.\n\nyou may have only lent us your vote, he said. i am humbled that you have put your trust in me, and you have put your trust in us, and i, and we, will never take your support for granted.\n\nwith the conservatives primed to extend their reign — from 2010 until 2024, if johnson serves a full five-year term — labour is looking at years in the opposition.\n\nreactions from corbyn's party were gloomy. labour lawmaker barry gardiner called exit polls obviously a devastating result for us.\n\nit feels like a punch in the stomach, labour lawmaker jess phillips tweeted.\n\nparty members immediately launched into a debate over who or what was to blame for a possible tory landslide. some on the left said it was brexit, not corbyn himself or the party's transformative socialist agenda, that buried them.\n\nwe had a very similar manifesto to the manifesto at the 2017 election, where with that manifesto and jeremy's leadership we gained 3 million votes, said richard burgon, a labour lawmaker. the thing which appears to be different this time is it was an election in which brexit overshadowed traditional party loyalties.\n\nwhile johnson campaigned on a get brexit done platform, corbyn took a less decisive stance, proposing a softer brexit — plus the guarantee of a second referendum within six months, another national vote on whether to stay or go, with the option to call the whole thing off.\n\nothers said the problem was that corbyn was unpopular and that labour's agenda was too radical.\n\n[u.k. voters want jeremy corbyn's 'radical' change. they're not sure they want him.]\n\nunder corbyn, the party swung hard to the left, calling for the nationalization of rail, mail, water and electricity, also pushing for a four-day workweek and free university tuition, and heavy taxes on corporations and the wealthy.\n\nin any case, corbyn is expected to face pressure to step down.\n\ntim bale, a politics professor at queen mary university of london, said labour has a lot of very hard thinking to do, particularly with the leader it now chooses.\n\nhe said that if the party selected its next leader in corbyn's image, it would be in trouble.\n\nit was a grim night, too, for the anti-brexit liberal democrats, whose leader, jo swinson, lost her seat to a candidate from the scottish national party.\n\nnationalist parties in scotland and northern ireland, meanwhile, saw gains.\n\nwhile brexit was dominant in many voters' minds on thursday, it wasn't the only issue they talked about.\n\nsarah duncan, 71, a historian and lifelong conservative voter, was up early to her london polling station, not far from the river thames. she said this election was particularly important, because i'm very frightened of far-left-wing government and what jeremy corbyn could do to this country.\n\nduncan confessed that in the june 2016 referendum, i voted to stay, i didn't vote for brexit, but i do feel that because the country has voted for brexit, it's a democratic country, and we should do what the majority said and we should leave, and that's what boris has stood for. as a leader, she said, he hasn't had a chance to prove himself yet. we will wait and see.\n\n[dogs at polling stations are always big in britain. this election also brought horses and reindeer.]\n\nnick symes, 53, a yacht broker, standing in the rain, said he voted for the labour party because it's socialist, it's why i like it, it's redistributive, and it's not boris johnson.\n\njosh hawketts, 27, an underwriter, voted labour in his constituency in battersea, southwest london. standing outside a polling station just before sunrise, he explained that his vote was not for corbyn or anything like that; it was purely tactical. just anti-tory, basically.\n\n\n\na man enters a polling station as snow falls in the north pennines on thursday in ireshopeburn, britain.

the department found no credible reports of civilian deaths caused by u.s. operations in libya or yemen last year.\n\noutside watchdog groups such as airwars have put forward much higher death tolls for u.s. counterterrorism strikes. for 2018, despite a significant slowing of the american campaign against the islamic state, airwars found that air and artillery strikes by the u.s.-led coalition killed a minimum of 805 civilians in iraq and syria alone.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe united nations has found that international operations, mostly airstrikes, killed 406 civilians in afghanistan in 2018. estimates by airwars, the bureau of investigative journalism and new america found that at least 13 civilians probably died in u.s. attacks in libya, somalia and yemen, bringing the minimum for the entire set of countries to 1,224, far above the pentagon figure.\n\nthe gap underscores the differing approaches that outside groups, which typically rely on witness statements and accounts on social media, have taken in piecing together information about u.s. strikes, and that of the military, which has slowly begun to incorporate such data into its assessments.\n\nthe report comes several months after president trump's administration altered an obama administration rule requiring a separate, broader annual report on civilian casualties.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe white house argued the change was made to avoid duplication with the congressionally mandated report. but the white house report previously included a tally including accidental deaths caused by military and intelligence operations. its elimination means the public will no longer have access to information about cia drone strikes.\n\ncia strikes are far less frequent than they were under obama, but the agency remains authorized to conduct such attacks.\n\ndan mahanty, director for u.s. program at the center for civilians in conflict, said the report reflected improved military transparency about its operations overseas. but the lack of information from intelligence agencies brings the government's inconsistency further into relief and undermines this achievement, he said.\n\nad\n\nthe report also further validates our instinct that we clearly still have work to do on the degree of effort dod puts into proactively seeking out facts that it doesn't have at its fingertips, mahanty said.\n\nad\n\non thursday, several advocacy groups, including civic and human rights first, sent a letter to leaders of the house and senate armed services committees urging lawmakers to insert more robust transparency and reporting requirements into an upcoming defense authorization bill.\n\nsuch transparency enables the public to be informed about some of the most important policy choices the government makes in its name — ones that involve life and death decisions, the letter says.\n\nad\n\nthe pentagon found no u.s.-caused civilian casualties in yemen at a moment when u.s. involvement there has become a politically charged issue.\n\nlast month, trump vetoed a measure that would have ended u.s. military support for saudi arabia and allied countries battling houthi rebels in yemen. on thursday, a measure to override that veto fell short of needed votes in the senate.\n\nad\n\nthe u.s. military does not generally attack houthi targets, but it has provided arms and refueled planes for the saudi-led coalition, which has been criticized for repeatedly killing civilians. the u.s. military conducts a separate campaign against al-qaeda in yemen. the pentagon's finding that no civilians had been killed referred to that operation, which bij said killed at least eight civilians.\n\nad\n\nthe two deaths referenced in somalia mark the first time since u.s. africa command was created in 2008 that it acknowledged causing civilian loss of life.
this is a non-judicial foreclosure, says anu kmt, the attorney for the 72-year-old restaurant and its owner. since the foreclosure did not go through the courts, hutchins had to file a complaint to seek to halt the proceedings and prove the lender had no right to declare a default on the mortgage.\n\nmost small businesses don't have the legal muscle to fight back. this isn't free. you have to go to court to oppose it. it's very costly, kmt says. this is like a legal hit and run. they ran us off the road, and we have to chase the ambulance back down.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe lawsuit in d.c. superior court spells out the allegations against ats one holdings corp., its affiliated companies and ari jay cohen and peter aytug, the principals behind the companies. hutchins alleges that, starting in summer 2015, ats began returning the restaurant's monthly mortgage checks as undeliverable, even after hutchins and his attorney inquired about the lender's apparent (and unannounced) change of address. the lender allegedly didn't provide florida avenue grill with a new mailing address.\n\ninstead, in january of last year, ats used the alleged nonpayment of the mortgages as a pretext for declaring a default and very aggressively threatening . . .foreclosure, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhutchins alleges that he offered to give ats a check for $23,555.30, the total amount of the apparently missing monthly payments, but ats refused the money and threatened legal measures in an attempt to get plaintiffs to agree to pay off the mortgages early. at that point, according to the complaint, hutchins started sending a certified check each month to a new ats address.\n\nall those uncashed checks were enclosed in a dec. 12 letter sent to hutchins' attorney, according to the complaint. the letter informed hutchins that his partial payments had been rejected, the lawsuit alleges, and that ats was initiating a foreclosure proceeding against the restaurant at 1100 florida ave. nw. the trustee's auction of the property is scheduled for jan. 18 unless a d.c. superior court judge agrees to the temporary restraining order on thursday.\n\nin an interview, hutchins says that ats claims he still owes $139,000, plus about $39,000 in fees, on two 2011 notes totaling $250,000. the florida avenue grill property was valued in 2016 at $727,280, according to the d.c. office of tax and revenue. this year, the property's value is expected to rise to $789,830.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nit's a money grab, kmt says about ats's motivations.\n\nalan s. macdonald, attorney representing ats and its owners for the case, declined to comment on the lawsuit, which he had just received.\n\nthis whole incident has impacted the grill in the sense that it has been embroiled in a firestorm of controversy, says hutchins. the fact is, if i hadn't filed the lawsuit, most people would just kind of think the grill doesn't pay its mortgage and look askance at me. . . i paid them every month, and that's not good enough.\n\naccording to hutchins's lawsuit, ats (and its predecessor, northern funding) are real-estate lending subsidiaries of northern leasing systems inc., a company that the new york attorney general sued last year, alleging it engages fraudulent and deceptive practices that trap small business owners across the country.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe new york lawsuit involves allegations of leasing of credit card equipment with terms that are onerous and totally one-sided in favor of northern leasing, according to a press release from new york attorney general eric t. schneiderman. when a small business tries to cancel the contract or stop paying, northern leasing will send threatening letters and commence collection actions in new york civil court, the release alleges. the attorney general's office claims northern leasing and its related companies filed more than 30,000 collection actions between 2010 and 2015 and obtained more than 19,000 default judgments, often because the businesses weren't aware of the action.\n\nthe attorney general's lawsuit is still pending. defense attorneys have filed a motion to dismiss the case because, among other arguments, they say the statute of limitations has passed on the allegedly fraudulent actions. more than that, the lawsuit has no merit, says arnold n. bressler, a senior partner with the new york-based moses & singer, the outside counsel that represents northern leasing. we feel, as a matter of law, that the case should be dismissed, bressler says.\n\nhutchins alleges in the lawsuit that in 2011 he agreed to a $200,000 deficiency note and a $50,000 promissory note, even though hutchins in an interview says ats never loaned him a single dollar of those funds. the restaurant owner alleges he was forced to agree to the notes or ats would foreclose on florida avenue grill and several units of the lacey, the neighboring condominium project that hutchins developed with loans from ats.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthey did the same foreclosure move again and basically made me agree to this mortgage, hutchins says. no money was advanced for this mortgage. . . i didn't have the legal muscle at the time to fight them properly, so i had to assent to the mortgage or else they were going to foreclose on the grill. this is the kind of typical bullying tactics that they've used on me in the

europe: in terms of its share of places in the finals, uefa is expected to lose out. europe receives 13 of the 32 slots available in the current format. many predict that it will get no more than 16 of the 48 — down to a third from nearly half the field. three extra places will slightly increase the chances for nations such as scotland, which has not qualified since 1998, but the overall impact could be minimal for european teams. a 16-team allotment would also offer fifa the chance to place one european team in each group, which may satisfy broadcasters worried about having too many games between long shot african and asian nations.\n\nafrica: if europe is the biggest prospective loser, africa could be the biggest winner, with its allocation possibly doubling or at least going from five to nine. the confederation of african football (caf) has 52 member nations, a powerful voting bloc in fifa elections. the teams that made it to brazil were algeria (18th in the 2014 fifa world rankings), ivory coast (no. 34), ghana (37), cameroon (42) and nigeria (43) made it to brazil. the teams that missed out — but would have qualified under a doubled allocation — were senegal (35), ethiopia (111), egypt (60), tunisia (22) and burkino faso (63).\n\nsouth america: conmebol has the simplest — and arguably best — qualifying process of any confederation. with just 10 nations there is a de facto national team league, with a single table and home and away fixtures. currently the top four teams qualify automatically with the fifth-placed team playing off against a team from another continent for an extra place. south america is weak politically within fifa due to its small numbers so can only expect a limited increase, perhaps to six nations. no wonder then that venezuela, which struggles to compete with the likes of argentina and brazil and has never appeared at a world cup, is pushing the unlikely idea of merged qualification with the concacaf region, which might improve its chances. if sporting merit were the main factor, conmebol would have all its teams in the world cup. but fifa politics decides and south america looks set to be the biggest loser, unless the idea of a merger catches on and it can get the chance to beat up teams from north and central america and the caribbean.\n\nasia: in contrast, the asian football confederation looks set to be a major winner in the changes. currently given four automatic places plus the chance of another through an intercontinental playoff, the afc can expect eight or nine places in a 48-team format. good news, then, for china, which is itching to get on the biggest stage for only the second time. also good news for the likes of australia, uzbekistan, jordan and qatar, as well as traditional regional powerhouses japan, south korea, saudi arabia and iran. a possible wrinkle? the division in the afc between the east and west asian federations. with the arab nations, such as 2022 host qatar and the united arab emirates, enjoying a growing influence in the game, sorting out the qualification structure might not be so straightforward.\n\noceania: currently gets only a playoff against another continent's team, which is usually lost. the region is expected to be given one automatic slot, which new zealand will expect to win.
voters are most likely to rally around the flag when there is bipartisan elite support\n\nad\n\nthe rally around the flag effect happens when international crises increase support for the president at home. this effect is a major reason some might suspect that attacking iran would be politically beneficial for the president.\n\nad\n\nfor example, the approval ratings of presidents george h.w. bush and george w. bush immediately surged after their respective military interventions against iraq. trump seemed to literally want americans to rally around the flag when he tweeted a picture of the american flag soon after soleimani's demise.\n\nbut not all military crises trigger rally effects. political science research shows that rally effects are most likely to occur when there is bipartisan support among political elites for the president's actions.\n\nad\n\nthis was true even for the enormous outpouring of support for george w. bush after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. cindy kam and jennifer ramos showed that the patriotic rally behind bush eroded after democrats ended their moratorium on criticizing the republican president.\n\nof course, democratic elites have not provided any grace period before starting to criticize president trump. democratic leaders quickly condemned the president for ordering the airstrike against soleimani without informing them, saying that the administration lacked any broader strategy for dealing with iran.\n\nad\n\nthe absence of bipartisan support for a deeply polarizing president's actions makes it highly unlikely that attacking iran will rally americans in support of trump.\n\nad\n\nwar has not helped incumbents win reelection\n\nnor would a larger war against iran increase trump's odds of reelection. in fact, research suggests it would have the opposite effect.\n\ndouglas a. hibbs's famed bread and peace model argues that two factors explain most of the variation in presidential election outcomes since 1948: the positive effects of real disposable income growth and the negative effects of cumulative u.s. military casualties from unprovoked, hostile deployments of american armed forces in foreign wars.\n\nthis research suggests that the democratic party paid an electoral price for committing u.s. forces in korea and vietnam. the iraq war also appeared to undermine support for george w. bush's reelection. despite narrowly winning in 2004, bush won fewer votes than expected for an incumbent president in a growing economy.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nan armed conflict with iran that results in american casualties would therefore probably hurt trump in 2020 rather than help him.\n\nmilitary action against iran is unpopular\n\nthat is especially true considering the state of public opinion. unlike the strong initial support for military deployments in korea, vietnam and iraq, the american public has shown little appetite for war against iran.\n\na july gallup poll found that 78 percent of americans preferred diplomatic efforts over military action to prevent iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. nearly two-thirds of respondents in that survey were worried that the united states will be too quick to use military force against iran.\n\nad\n\na september poll commissioned by the university of maryland showed similar results. only 20 percent of americans in that survey said that the united states should be prepared to go to war with iran to achieve its goals, compared to 76 percent who said that u.s. policy goals do not warrant waging war.\n\nad\n\nto be sure, military action against iran will probably grow more popular as trump's supporters rally to defend the president's actions. americans often change their opinions about foreign policy based on their views of the president who is guiding it.\n\nbut that will not change the fundamental lessons from prior academic research: attacking iran will not help trump win reelection.
a draw would've clinched a berth in this summer's tournament in russia. instead, we laid an egg, said arena, who, subsequently resigned his head coaching position.\n\nad\n\nthe americans had recovered from defeats in the first two world cup qualifiers under arena's predecessor, jurgen klinsmann, and appeared poised to clinch concacaf's third automatic berth.\n\nad\n\nin a lot of ways, our team did a remarkable job coming back and positioning themselves to qualify, arena said. in all honesty, mexico and costa rica were better teams . . . but we should've been the third one. i accept that responsibility. that's why i resigned so quickly.\n\nthat's the way it goes. i don't feel good about it, but that's life. i'm not embarrassed by it because as a coaching staff and as a team and an organization, we really gave everything we had.\n\nad\n\ndespite challenges in trinidad, you find a way to get off that field with a point. if you have a team of quality and the right chemistry, you battle through that game and get a point. i couldn't care less what it looks like.\n\nan early own goal and a shot from great distance left the americans with a two-goal deficit at halftime.\n\ni felt if we went into halftime at 1-0, we had a chance to come back and get our point, arena said. we read them the riot act at halftime. we told our guys they had to go out and battle, find a way to create chances. we get the early goal [by christian pulisic]. we feel if we get another goal, we get the point, we get the hell out of here. we're going to world cup. it never came.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ni can't explain why it didn't work. we had some guys who had bad games. it was the same team that had a remarkable performance four days earlier. i can't explain it.\n\nfour days earlier, the united states pounded panama, 4-0, in orlando. but instead of injecting the lineup against trinidad and tobago with fresh players, as he had done in the away leg of the previous sets of matches, arena made no changes. he said he considered it, but in the wake of the convincing victory and a clean bill of health, he decided to stay with the same group and tactics.\n\nthe americans were flat at the beginning and fell behind, heightening the pressure on the players.\n\nad\n\ntop players respond to big games, arena said of athletes in all sports. players that lack some quality, the pressure gets to them. a lot of [u.s.] players must have felt the pressure. one thing i pride myself on is i get teams ready to play. we understood the magnitude of the game. trinidad played us very well in denver [in the summer]. they played very well against mexico in their previous game.\n\nad\n\ni told [the players] we've got to be ready. i think our players understood that. a lot of pressure built up, especially after we conceded the first goal. we seemed to get ourselves settled in after that and conceded another goal, and some people cracked.\n\narena also said the u.s. soccer federation unintentionally motivated the host team by posting photos and video of standing water on and around the stadium field the day before the match. u.s. staff was seen carrying players across the ankle-high threshold. it was, arena said, humiliating to the trinidadians.\n\nad\n\nasked if his players had taken enough pride in representing the country and qualifying for the world cup, arena said: we had good citizens. we had a couple of bad eggs, as you have on every team. we were well aware and the players were aware of who they were.\n\nad\n\narena offered high praise for the commitment put forth by players such as tim howard, michael bradley and clint dempsey. i can say [good things] about a lot of guys. i don't question their character at all.\n\nhe did say, however, there was one veteran we could never get through to. he didn't identify him, but multiple sources said it was defender geoff cameron, who didn't end up playing in the last two matches after starting four of the previous six qualifiers and entering one as a sub.\n\nad\n\nafter the t&t disaster, he said one player told him, this was a culture you couldn't change is a short period of time.\n\nin general, during his 10-month stint, arena said there were a lot of things on that team that i didn't feel right [about].\n\nlater, arena also said, i never felt really comfortable with the team. we won the gold cup [last summer with many secondary players] — the only time we had that team together for 30 days. when we mixed [regulars] back in september, it wasn't the same team or the right chemistry. it didn't seem like everything was on the same page and had the same mentalities and the same understanding of what everything was about.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe united states lost at home to costa rica, and we're in trouble now. four days later, a late equalizer by bobby wood at honduras kept the americans in good position to qualify.\n\nwe go down to honduras and have to scramble. it has nothing to do with soccer; it's survival of the fitness in those games. . . . we're now six games into qualifying [since arena was hired]. we made up a lot of ground and it's down to the last two games.\n\nafter the demolition of panama, the americans were primed to clinch in trinidad with a victory or draw. and then came the most painful defeat in recent u.s. history, probably ever.\n\narena had figured he could get through the qualifying stage with the established group. we didn't have time to experiment. we had eight games to get it right and had a very small margin of error.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhe then planned to begin rebuilding the roster ahead of the world cup. of the 11 starters in trinidad, maybe four would've been on the field for the world cup opener eight months later, arena said.\n\nwe knew we had to get better, but we somehow had to get through 2017 and make our team better for the world cup.\n\neven so, he added, i would say we weren't going to be in a great position to get out of the group stage at the world cup.
it slammed broward county sheriff scott israel, saying he was partly to blame because he had changed active shooter policy to say that deputies may enter a building to engage a shooter, indicating it wasn't necessary. israel has changed the policy again. the report also noted that some sheriff's deputies said they could not remember the last time they underwent training for an active shooter.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nand the report was critical of the school security program operated by broward county public schools. the report said it failed to stop the alleged shooter, nikolas cruz, a former student with a history of disciplinary problems and mental health concerns, from entering the school feb. 14 with a semiautomatic rifle and killing 14 students and three staff members. neither the school nor the district had a clear plan to lock down classrooms. it took several minutes for that to happen, leaving students, teachers and staff members vulnerable to being shot, it said.\n\nthe report starts with this warning:\n\nschool safety in florida needs to be improved. we can do more and we can do a better job of ensuring the safety of students and staff on k-12 school campuses. not all school security changes or enhancements have financial costs, and some only require the will of decision-makers to effect change and hold people responsible for implementing best practices. safety and security accountability is lacking in schools, and that accountability is paramount for effective change if we expect a different result in the future than what occurred at marjory stoneman douglas high school (msdhs) on february 14, 2018.\n\nthe 15-member commission included sheriffs from several florida counties, including pinellas county sheriff bob gualtieri, who served as chairman. the fathers of three students killed during the rampage were also appointed. the report will be sent to the florida legislature and governor. the panel interviewed hundreds of witnesses and reviewed a massive amount of evidence, it said.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nperhaps the most controversial recommendation among dozens made by the commission called for training and giving weapons to teachers willing to carry arms. it is not clear how that will be received by administrators, teachers, students and parents. some of the student survivors of the shooting have become leaders in a national youth gun-control movement, and the broward county school board voted in april not to accept state money appropriated for that purpose.\n\nthe south florida sun sentinel quoted broward county school board member lori alhadeff, whose daughter alyssa was killed in the shooting:\n\nteachers went to school to teach. that is their expertise. law enforcement, their expertise is supposed to be to engage a threat. unfortunately, that didn't happen on 2/14, but i still think we should leave it in the hands of law enforcement.\n\nthe commission made recommendations it said schools should adopt immediately, including keeping school gates and doors locked when not in use, and making sure school personnel are present when gates and doors are being used. all doors should be locked, too, and teachers should be able to lock them from the inside, with access to the keys.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nit also said every school should have a code red plan for emergencies and should train staff to execute that plan and communicate it to everyone at the school.\n\nand the panel said school safety requires attention to the mental health of students and acknowledged:\n\nflorida's mental and behavioral health system is underfunded. florida needs a better case management system, but no case management system can be effective unless there are effective services through which a person can be managed.
bob bauer, a senior adviser to president-elect joe biden's transition team, said the conversation provides irrefutable proof of a president pressuring and threatening an official of his own party to get him to rescind a state's lawful, certified vote count and fabricate another in its place.\n\nthe washington post obtained a recording of the call, in which the president repeatedly states that there is no way i lost georgia. he makes threats about vague criminal consequences and tells the secretary of state that he's taking a big risk.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbauer added: it captures the whole disgraceful story about donald trump's assault on american democracy.\n\nspeaking in georgia on sunday, harris called trump's conversation a baldfaced, bold abuse of power by the president of the united states.\n\nit was certainly the voice of desperation, most certainly that, she said.\n\nharris was there to campaign for democrats jon ossoff and raphael warnock ahead of senate runoff elections on tuesday in the state.\n\nduring the call, trump urged georgia's election officials to act quickly, and suggested that not doing so could endanger the political fate of sens. david perdue and kelly loeffler, both georgia republicans.\n\nin a phone call on jan. 2, president trump insisted he won the state and threatened vague legal consequences. here are excerpts from the call. (obtained by the washington post)\n\nyou would be respected, really respected, if this thing could be straightened out before the election, trump said during the call. you have a big election coming up on tuesday.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe pair of democratic senate candidates were also among those who quickly condemned trump for the call.\n\nwhen the president of the united states calls up georgia's election officials and tries to intimidate them to change the results of the election, to disenfranchise georgia voters, ossoff said, speaking to supporters, … that is a direct attack on our democracy.\n\nhe added: if david perdue and kelly loeffler had one piece of steel in their spine, one piece of integrity, they would be out defending georgia voters from that assault.\n\nin a statement, warnock called on loeffler to speak out against the unsubstantiated claims of fraud, to defend georgia's elections, and to put georgia ahead of herself. she has not and never will.\n\nad\n\ntrump was joined on the call by white house chief of staff mark meadows, as well as longtime conservative lawyer cleta mitchell and georgia-based lawyer kurt hilbert. ryan germany, who is general counsel for raffensperger's office, and deputy secretary of state jordan fuchs were also on the call.\n\nsen. richard j. durbin (ill.), who will soon be the ranking democrat on the senate judiciary committee, said the call was more than a pathetic, rambling, delusional rant.\n\nad\n\nhis disgraceful effort to intimidate an elected official into deliberately changing and misrepresenting the legally confirmed vote totals in his state strikes at the heart of our democracy and merits nothing less than a criminal investigation, durbin said in a statement. the president is unhinged and dangerous.\n\nad\n\ntrump vaguely threatened raffensperger and germany, suggesting that they would be subject to criminal liability if they don't find that thousands of ballots in fulton county were illegally destroyed to block investigators, a baseless allegation.\n\nyou are going to find that they are — which is totally illegal — it is more illegal for you than it is for them, because, you know, what they did and you're not reporting it, he said. that's a criminal, that's a criminal offense. and you can't let that happen. that's a big risk to you and to ryan, your lawyer.\n\nad\n\nmichael r. bromwich, who served as the justice department inspector general from 1994 to 1999, said that trump's threats against raffensperger and germany could violate federal law that prohibits efforts to deprive voters of a fair election.\n\nad\n\nhis best defense would be insanity, bromwich tweeted, adding: the entire call is astonishing. the bullying, the threats, the insults, the credulous embrace of discredited conspiracy theories. like a crime boss, trump occasionally says that all he wants is the truth. but he doesn't — he wants the win.\n\nlegal scholars have suggested trump's remarks put the president in a legally questionable territory as he appeared to be pushing the secretary of state to manipulate the state's election outcome.\n\nin a tweet, rep. adam kinzinger (r-ill.) suggested to his fellow lawmakers that any member of congress considering objecting to the election results, you cannot — in light of this — do so with a clean conscience.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nsen. robert p. casey jr. (d-pa.) appeared to jab at some of his senate colleagues across the aisle who have said they won't certify biden's win without an investigation of voter fraud allegations, which remain unsubstantiated.\n\ni heard there's a group of senate republicans eager to investigate election fraud, he tweeted.
for many customers . . . the tax refund is the largest single financial transaction they'll do all year, said brian ashcraft, director of tax compliance for liberty tax service. so it can really have an impact on them.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nboth credits have been a big target of fraudsters in the past because of the potential to cash in lucrative refunds.\n\nthe eitc is a tax break claimed by workers with low to moderate incomes. the credit maxes out at $6,269 this year for families with three or more children. the additional child tax credit is claimed by taxpayers who have children and who meet certain income requirements. that credit maxes out at $1,000 per child. the credits are refundable, meaning taxpayers can have the tax breaks paid out as a tax refund even if they don't owe any taxes.\n\nthe move is expected to give the irs more time to verify tax returns before it cuts the checks. some 24 percent of the eitc payments made in 2015 were erroneous, leading to $15.6 billion in improper payments, according to the treasury inspector general for tax administration, which oversees the irs. some of those errors happen by mistake because the credit is complicated, and others are caused by taxpayers purposely trying to claim larger refunds, the agency says.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nroughly 30 million tax returns claim the earned income tax credit or the additional child tax credit each year, and about half of those returns are filed before feb. 15, according to estimates from h&r block.\n\ndespite the change, people should still file their returns early, tax preparers and the irs say, to give the irs more time to review the documents and to avoid further delays with their refund checks.\n\nconsumers affected by the delays should keep in mind that status updates for when their tax refunds will arrive may not be available on the irs's where's my refund? tool until after feb. 15.\n\nhere are a few other tips and changes to be aware of this year:\n\ntax day is april 18. taxpayers have a few extra days to file their returns this year, with the tax deadline falling on tuesday, april 18. (the typical deadline of april 15 falls on a saturday and emancipation day, a legal holiday in washington, d.c., will be observed on the following monday.)\n\nad\n\nfind your old tax return. taxpayers who use a different tax software provider this year should dig up their tax returns from last year. they may need to provide the adjusted gross income from their 2015 tax returns to help verify their identities, according to the irs. in the past, taxpayers could enter their adjusted gross income or their electronic filing pins to confirm their identities, but e-file pins will no longer be an option.\n\nad\n\nidentification numbers expiring. some taxpayers who don't have social security numbers may need to renew the identification numbers they use to file their returns, known as the individual taxpayer identification number, or itin. numbers that have not been used at least once in the last three years are no longer valid. numbers issued before 2013 will also start expiring this year. taxpayers who need a new itin can apply in person at an irs center or by filing the tax form w-7.\n\nwp request for reader submission what are you planning to do with your tax refund? for many consumers, the tax refund is the biggest check they receive each year. tell us more about whether you plan to save, spend or splurge with your check. your stories may be included in a future washington post article. tell the post read our full submission guidelines here
before it embarks on all of that, however, it first has to launch what would normally be a routine flight of commercial satellites to orbit. but that launch, scheduled for monday, is now anything but routine — and is instead one of the most important in history of the company.\n\nthe launch from vandenberg air force base is the first since spacex's rocket exploded on sept. 1 while being fueled ahead of an engine test fire. that explosion was the company's second failure in less than two years — in 2015, it lost a rocket a couple minutes into flight — leading to questions about its ability to fly reliably.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin addition to the goals of mars and resuming the nation's manned spaceflight program, the company also has a massive backlog of launches that was delayed while the company was grounded during its four-month investigation.\n\nthe stakes for this flight, then, are huge, said todd harrison, the director of the aerospace security project at the center for strategic and international studies.\n\nthey've got to prove it and restore confidence in their system on this flight, he said. if they have another failure, it's going to stop them dead in their tracks.\n\non friday, the federal aviation administration cleared the way for spacex's launch. the agency accepted spacex's investigative report on its rocket explosion, closing the case, and issued it a launch license.\n\nad\n\non thursday, musk tweeted that spacex successfully performed an engine test firing and wrote that, all systems are go for launch next week. originally, the launch was scheduled for sunday, and it was unclear why the schedule slipped a day to monday.\n\nad\n\nearlier this week, the company said the cause of the september explosion was traced to a problem with a pressure vessel in the second-stage liquid oxygen tank. the tank buckled, the company said, and supercooled liquid oxygen pooled in the lining. the fuel was ignited by breaking fibers or friction.\n\nspacex said in the short term, it plans to change the way it loads fuel. eventually, it plans to change the design of the pressure vessels to prevent buckling.\n\nad\n\nevery launch carries the risk of failure, said jim muncy, the president of polispace, a consulting firm. spacex's falcon 9 is a proven vehicle, he said. spacex continually tries to innovate, and had been super cooling its fuel to make it more dense so that the rocket could carry more of it.\n\nthe extra fuel was necessary as the company began flying its rocket boosters back to land — or to ships at sea — so that they could be reused. but taking such advanced steps — no one had ever successfully landed an orbital-class rocket before — can cause problems, muncy said.\n\nas you try to increase performance, you find out if you're pushing the envelope too far, he said. they're clearly pulling back and not pushing the envelope as much with this launch.
it speaks way more about the team and the character we have, smith said when asked about what the moment meant to him. he listed everything stacked against us this year, including a coaching change, a name change, a roster rebuild. then he grinned. divisional champs. still alive.\n\nthis game — a sloppy one intent on testing the patience of its audience — was a fitting tribute to the 2020 nfc east. that it decided the division championship seemed like audacious fiction, a sentiment only furthered by smith playing through a right calf strain that limited his movement. coach ron rivera said he considered benching smith, but he stuck with the 36-year-old, who had spent many predawn hours this past week in rehab. smith gutted through the 20-14, title-clinching victory over the philadelphia eagles.\n\nsuch trust might not work saturday night, when washington hosts tampa bay in the first round of the playoffs. the buccaneers have a fearsome pass rush and hit the quarterback an average of 7.3 times per game this season, tied for the second most in the league, according to sportradar. but what smith did sunday, finishing 22 for 32 for 162 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions, still meant something to his teammates, who would never question his toughness.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nstar wide receiver terry mclaurin played through a high-ankle sprain, and he said he and smith saw each other in the training room every day last week at about 6 a.m.\n\nhe was probably in there even longer than i was, mclaurin said. you can't give him enough credit for that. i like to see myself as built the same way, doing whatever i can to help this team.\n\nin the first quarter, the pair met up again in the end zone. smith had noticed mclaurin outside one-on-one against grayland arnold, a safety the eagles converted to cornerback because of injuries at the position. it was one of the man-coverage looks smith would later say we were able to take advantage of. he put the ball in the back left corner of the end zone. mclaurin, clearly hobbled himself, snared it. washington had scored on its opening drive for the first time this season.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe washington offense replicated that success on only one of its other 11 possessions. smith pushed 55 yards in nine plays just before halftime for the touchdown that proved to be the difference. later, he admitted the calf bothered him more and more during the game, and it was apparent on the field as he struggled to avoid the pass rush and took sacks. rivera said he thought offensive coordinator scott turner tried to protect smith by getting the ball out of his hands quickly and became a little too cautious. even at halftime, just after the scoring drive, rivera considered subbing in backup taylor heinicke.\n\nthe opening drive and the two-minute drive are about as good as it gets. it really is, rivera said. it just goes to show you that, when we are clicking, we can click. there is room for improvement for us as a football team, though.\n\nyet the cause for concern about smith's calf may be less about how it limited him and more about how it came about. smith said his limited mobility was not the result of a tweak or an aggravation, a re-injury that could heal this week. it was the natural result of being on his feet for so long in a game, what he called normal wear and tear. he sounded frustrated when he acknowledged we left a lot out there on offense in the second half.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthis frustration was soothed by the final score. but the root cause of it — a balky calf making slow progress — could reappear in a new light saturday. the buccaneers could tee up blitzes against a wounded quarterback who can't escape them, as the eagles did in the second half sunday. the ultimate concern, perhaps, is that it could prevent turner from calling the best offense possible and hamstring an already limited unit.\n\nthere's no doubt smith will spend hours in the training room this week, again putting him in the best position to succeed. the question remains whether his body will let him.\n\neight days before the win over the eagles, smith's wife, elizabeth, gave him what he called one of the best christmas gifts i've ever gotten. it was a remodeled version of a fixator, the elaborate brace he had worn after his devastating leg injury two years ago. elizabeth had it fashioned to look like the lombardi trophy, a reminder, she wrote on instagram, that no matter the outcome, alex has already won.
this argument, however, mischaracterizes the district court's order. the district court's february 11 order compelled diamond to provide a fingerprint or thumbprint as deemed necessary by the chaska police department to unlock his seized cell phone. at the april 3 contempt hearing, the district court referred to diamond providing his thumbprint. the prosecutor noted that they were not sure if it's an index finger or a thumb. the district court answered, take whatever samples you need. diamond then asked the detectives which finger they wanted, and they answered, the one that unlocks it.\n\nit is clear that the district court permitted the state to take samples of all of diamond's fingerprints and thumbprints. the district court did not ask diamond whether his prints would unlock the cellphone or which print would unlock it, nor did the district court compel diamond to disclose that information. there is no indication that diamond would have been asked to do more had none of his fingerprints unlocked the cellphone. diamond himself asked which finger the detectives wanted when he was ready to comply with the order, and the detectives answered his question. diamond did not object then, nor did he bring an additional motion to suppress the evidence based on the exchange that he initiated.
the nondisclosure agreement mckayla maroney signed with usa gymnastics might cost her a $100,000 fine if she were to join the women detailing larry nassar's sexual abuse at a sentencing hearing for the disgraced former team doctor that is underway this week. chrissy teigen, a model and tv personality who has appeared in sports illustrated's swimsuit issue and on the covers of numerous magazines, said tuesday that she would be honored to pay that penalty on behalf of the 2012 olympic gold medalist.\n\nteigen posted to twitter a headline from the daily mail that declared maroney would be subject to that fine if she spoke at nassar's hearing, which began tuesday. in december, maroney filed a lawsuit against usa gymnastics, alleging that it illegally sought to buy her silence as part of a $1.25 million settlement.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe entire principle of this should be fought — an nda to stay quiet about this serial monster with over 140 accusers, but i would be absolutely honored to pay this fine for you, mckayla, teigen said in her tweet.\n\nmaroney responded appreciatively to teigen's offer, in a statement released through her lawyer, john manly. i'm not on social media right now, but i wish i was for this! maroney said. i'm shocked by your generosity, and i just want you to know how much hope your words bring to all of us! i just can't get over the fact that someone i don't personally know is sticking up for me, let alone a strong women that i've looked up to for years!\n\nthank you chrissy, you're so inspiring, and things are starting to change because of people like you! just saying that was worth the decision to speak up regardless of a fine. you're heart pure gold. god bless.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nit is unclear if maroney would actually be ordered to pay the fine were she to speak at the hearing, which is taking place in lansing, mich., and is expected to involve dozens of women. maroney, 22, may have have already violated the nda in october, when she publicly accused nassar of molesting her for a period that began when she was 13 and continued until she left the sport in 2016.\n\nattorneys for nassar cited maroney's accusations as contributing to inflammatory and sustained media coverage in attempting to delay a trial in ingham (mich.) county, home to michigan state, where he worked for two decades and which has also taken widespread criticism for not doing enough to heed victims' complaints. however, that court saw him plead guilty in november to seven counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, and in a court in nearby eaton county a week later, he admitted guilt to three more counts of abusing girls.\n\nin december, nassar was sentenced to 60 years in prison on federal charges related to child pornography, and last week, the michigan attorney general's office asked that the ex-doctor receive a sentence of 40 to 125 years for the state charges. the high end of that request was chosen to reflect the number of people who reported assaults by nassar to michigan state police, and the total number of complaints against him, including from other olympic gold medalists such as simone biles, gabby douglas and aly raisman, is more than 150.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbiles, who won four gold medals and a bronze at the 2016 games, became the latest victim to step forward on monday, when she posted extensive comments to twitter. it is not normal to receive any type of treatment from a trusted team physician and refer to it horrifyingly as the 'special' treatment. this behavior is completely unacceptable, disgusting, and abusive, especially coming from someone whom i was told to trust, biles said.\n\nusa gymnastics is absolutely heartbroken, sorry and angry that simone biles or any of our athletes have been harmed by the horrific acts of larry nassar, the organization said in a statement (via cnn). we are our athletes' advocates. usa gymnastics will continue to listen to our athletes and our members in our efforts of creating a culture of empowerment with a relentless focus on athlete safety every single day.\n\nnassar's sentencing hearing, which is set to last four days, began with a woman, kyle stephens, whose parents were friends with his family. stephens told a judge that nassar sexually abused her at his house when she was between 6 and 12, rubbing his genitals on her and digitally penetrating her, and that her parents initially did not believe her over his denials.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ni testified to let the world know that you are a repulsive liar and those 'treatments' were pathetically veiled sexual abuse, stephens said to nassar, who reportedly looked away or bowed his head frequently as his accusers spoke. as many as 100 women are expected to address the court.\n\nraisman tweeted monday that she will not speak at the hearing because it would be too traumatic, but she will have an impact letter read in court, with nassar present. i support the brave survivors, she said. we are all in this together.\n\nin reply to teigen's offer tuesday to pay maroney's possible fine, tv producer michael schur said he would split it with the model. actress kristen bell then chimed in, tweeting, i'll 1/3 it with you guys.
she continued in her role as editor in chief of the texas tribune but could not get the idea out of her head. in march last year, she sat down with amanda zamora, the tribune's chief audience officer and a veteran of the investigative nonprofit propublica, and presented her idea.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nyou could tell she was completely taken with this idea of a site that looked at the impact of politics and policy on women, zamora said. once she is set on something, you have no doubt that she's going to make it happen, and i knew it was something i wanted to participate in.\n\nthe two were soon holding meetings with advisers and funders, pitching them on their vision and honing it as they went.\n\non monday, ramshaw and zamora are launching the 19th, the organization that grew out of all those meetings, with nearly $5 million in the bank from funders such as craigslist founder craig newmark and kathryn murdoch, a climate change activist and philanthropist.\n\nthis isn't the day's news but pink. this is unique, original coverage about the roles of gender in politics and policy, said ramshaw, who is ceo of the nonprofit. we are not doing turn-of-the-screw reporting, but rather what that turn of the screw means for different parts of the women's electorate.\n\nthe name derives from the 19th amendment to the constitution, which in practice granted white women the right to vote, and whose 100th anniversary is this summer. given that the goal of the site is to elevate the voices of women who are underrepresented in the american media, be it women of color, women living off the coasts, and poor women, ramshaw said, they added an asterisk to their logo.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe 19th amendment did not grant all women equal access to the voting booths immediately, said zamora, the site's publisher, citing the 40 years it took for the civil rights movement to grant women of color the same voting rights as white women. the 19th provides a great opportunity to talk about all of those tensions and all the work that is still to be done in terms of equity whether it is at the ballot box or beyond.\n\nthe organization is launching with a single reporter in the field, errin haines, who previously covered race and ethnicity for the associated press. she will cover the 2020 race. a bare-bones site is launching monday. until 19thnews.org is fully built later this year, the 19th's articles will publish on the washington post's website.\n\nnewmark was among the first donors and made a $500,000 gift. we need a news outlet about gender politics that does a lot of fact-checking with absolutely no mansplaining, he said in an interview.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nkathryn murdoch, the wife of rupert murdoch's younger son, james, pledged $1 million to the venture. convinced by polling showing women had vastly different views from men on issues such as climate change and trump, murdoch saw the relevance of ramshaw's idea.\n\nyou need to have a very healthy media ecosystem in order to support a functioning democracy, and i look at everything we do as how do we find the actual crux of some of the problems rather than putting band-aids on them after they develop, murdoch said.\n\nwhen asked how the 19th was different from the news outlets her family owns, which include fox news and the wall street journal, she simply said the 19th and the foundation she and her husband operate are reflective of her values.\n\nad\n\nshe and her husband were recently critical of the way murdoch media properties have covered the australian wildfires. in an interview with the post, she shied away from commenting about fox news or other murdoch outlets. this is what i do, and i'm happy to be taken to task on any of it, but that is all i control.\n\nad\n\na few years ago i might have said, 'no, no [to ramshaw], things are gradually changing and getting better, and we'll get there,'  murdoch said. but the rejection of a female candidate in the 2016 election was a wake-up call: it was a turning point to realize that things don't just naturally get better over time, you have to actively participate and make them get better, and there's always a risk of backsliding.\n\nramshaw is not accepting anonymous donations to the site and will maintain a list of funders on the site in an effort to be as transparent as possible about who is supporting the journalism at the 19th.\n\nad\n\non launch day, the organization, which has hired an editor in chief, will post 17 jobs; nine in the newsroom including beats covering women in congress, in the economy, statehouses and several others. they are hiring to fill positions to cover specific demographics that make up the female electorate, including black and latina women. the site will have no opinion or editorial section.\n\nand the publication is not averse to hiring men — its cfo is male.
workers came in june to take down the home where the kasaiulis had lived for decades; it was in danger of collapsing on them. i cried before i left, said monica kasayuli, 70, seen above with her hands cupping her chin. so, so many memories. it took a long, long time to get the house paid off. they all moved into a relative's home, until the relocation, decades in the making, finally began in october.\n\nfamilies are moving in stages to mertarvik, about nine miles upriver. jasmine alexie and her folks were among the first, and while they waited, she hung out with latesha tom and latesha's phone.
durant is having a solid season as a rim-protector. his 3.1 blocks per 100 possessions is a career high and he is allowing just 0.9 points per possession against on shot shots around the basket, the 10th lowest among forwards defending at least 50 possessions of this type in 2017-18. opponents are shooting just 44 percent on these attempts, the ninth-lowest in the nba.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nunfortunately for green, durant's case as the league's best defensive player starts and ends there, with evidence suggesting durant isn't close to being an elite defender during this campaign.\n\nwith player tracking available, we can move beyond traditional defensive stats such as blocks and rebounds in favor of more in-depth analytical measures, like how good a player is at deterring shots, forcing turnovers and disrupting the offense, how the team's defense performs with a player on versus off the court and statistically based measures such as espn's defensive real plus-minus (drpm), which looks at a player's stats and adjusts them for teammates and opposition.\n\nnow that durant is focusing more on blocked shots, his defensive rebounding numbers have declined from 11 per 100 possessions last season to 8.8 per 100 in 2017-18, his lowest rate since 2013-14. on top of that, he's not locking down opponents on the perimeter as well as he has in recent years. opponents are taking 40 three-point attempts per 100 possessions with durant as the primary defender this season, hitting 38 percent of those shots. last season they managed 34 three-point attempts per 100 possessions with a 32 percent success rate. only seven other players defending at least 300 possessions this season have seen a larger share of three-point attempts against them.\n\ndurant's defense against the ballhandler on the pick-and-roll is also far from elite. he allows a team to score on this play 44 percent of the time with close to one point per possession against, putting him in the bottom 20 percent of the league's defenders. if we limit the list to only those defenders tasked with stopping at least 50 possessions this season, durant falls to 149th out of 162 qualified players.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin addition, the warriors' defensive rating improves significantly without durant on the court. this season, the warriors are allowing 103.6 points per 100 possessions with durant on the court. that drops to 98.3 with him on the bench. green, by comparison, improved golden state's defensive rating from 104.1 to 99.3 last season when he was named the league's defensive player of the year.\n\nbut wait, there's more. espn's defensive rpm numbers are very down on durant's defense, suggesting that his defensive impact is worth only 0.3 points per 100 possessions to the warriors after factoring in who he plays with and against. that ranks durant 193rd in the nba this season, a far cry from the drpm of the four previous defensive player of the year winners.\n\nseason defensive player of the year defensive rpm defensive rpm rank 2013-14 joakim noah 3.9 14th 2014-15 kawhi leonard 4.6 6th 2015-16 kawhi leonard 3.9 9th 2016-17 draymond green 5.6 2nd\n\noverall, green's endorsement of durant appears to be tainted with bias for a teammate rather than based on a sound argument. durant's improved rim protection comes at the expense of his defensive rebounding and his ability to prevent three-point shots against, making the warriors' overall defense worse with him on the court. and once you adjust his defensive efforts for teammates and opponents, durant is average, at best, putting him nowhere close to a player that should be considered a serious defensive player of the year candidate.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nread more on the nba:\n\nad

eight weeks later, with kennedy's brother robert in the audience, sanford took to the stage of raleigh's crowded memorial auditorium, bedecked with red, white and blue bunting, and gave his first address as governor.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwe are not going to forget, as we move into the challenging and demanding years ahead, that no group of our citizens can be denied the right to participate in the opportunities of first-class citizenship, sanford said near the end of his speech. he called for north carolina to extend its spirit of goodwill so that its energy could be directed toward building a better and more fruitful life for all the people of our state.\n\nsanford spoke only a few sentences on issues of race. yet those sentences were starkly different from the statements of other southern governors of that era.\n\nalabama gov. george wallace, in his first inauguration address in 1963, with his head cocked to the side on that cold january day outside the state capitol in montgomery, said passionately: in the name of the greatest people that have ever trod this earth, i draw a line in the dust and toss the gauntlet before the feet of tyranny, and i say, segregation now, segregation tomorrow, and segregation forever!\n\nin style and substance, wallace and sanford represented opposite ends of the democratic spectrum in the one-party south of that era. wallace once said of sanford: hell, you ever heard him speak? he'll bore yo' ass off.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nsanford wasn't an entertaining speaker. but the moral courage and decency of his inaugural address stands out 60 years later and was repeated throughout his four years as governor. later in his term, sanford would talk more forcefully, and in more depth, about civil rights.\n\nhe said the south needed to set itself free from hate, from demagoguery. he called for an end to discrimination in employment (it is honest and fair for us to give all men and women their best chance in life). shortly after john kennedy died, sanford supported president lyndon b. johnson's bold stance on civil rights. the president of a free people cannot condone second-class citizenship, sanford said.\n\nsanford's statements marked a break with about 250 years of north carolina history. since the first enslaved people were brought to the colony in about 1700, its white leaders, with exceptions during reconstruction, endorsed an intimidating system of apartheid for african americans.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe violence of the 1898 coup in wilmington, in which white supremacists overthrew the elected black local leadership (described in wilmington's lie by david zucchino), gave way to a system of jim crow segregation that disenfranchised black people and made them second-class citizens. it was that system that four black college students protested when they sat down at a woolworth's counter in greensboro in february 1960 and refused to leave until they were served, sparking a wave of sit-in protests across north carolina and the south.\n\nthe concept of racial profiling dates back decades, and it's prevalent throughout u.s. history. (allie caren/the washington post)\n\ntaken together, sanford's words as governor created a kind of second emancipation proclamation for north carolina. his inauguration speech and other comments signaled to the state's black residents that, as sam cooke would sing a few years later, change was on its way.\n\nsanford's words created a climate so you could see a world where equality might exist and was achievable, said state sen. dan blue (d), who was a student in a rural segregated school in north carolina in the early 1960s and later became the state's first black speaker of the house. combined with sanford's aggressive steps to improve schools, i started thinking i could do anything i wanted to, blue said.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nsanford was the first southern governor to call for employment without regard to race or creed. while other southern governors were blocking integration, sanford started good neighbor councils to encourage businesses to hire black workers and to advance cooperation between the races. he launched an aggressive campaign to hire more black men and women in state jobs.\n\nhe was part of this new progressive, kennedy-esque environment, blue said. we were very aware of what was happening in mississippi, alabama, georgia, virginia. the contrast was palpable in north carolina. sanford was the cause of that.\n\nsanford had not campaigned for civil rights. locked in a tough primary against a strong segregationist, he dodged the issue. if he'd attempted to push for civil rights, you wouldn't be sitting here talking to me because he would have lost, he told me shortly before he died in 1998, when i was working on a book about him.\n\nbut with his inauguration address, he pivoted. the most difficult thing i did was the most invisible thing. that was to turn the attitude on the race issue, sanford once told the news & observer's rob christensen. i realized that the lines of history were intersecting right there as i took the governorship.\n\nabout the time of his inauguration, sanford and his wife decided to send their two young children to a public elementary school near the governor's residence that had been integrated the previous fall by 7-year-old william campbell. it was the first public school in raleigh in which a black student attended school with white children.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nsending his children to the school was an astounding breach of southern racial protocol, said campbell, the former mayor of atlanta who grew up in raleigh as the child of civil rights activists. it was an important symbol for the governor to make that decision. it became a national story. it spoke to where his heart was.\n\nsanford's top issue was improving public schools. per pupil spending in north carolina then was well below the national average. as governor, he persuaded the state legislature to raise taxes and use the proceeds to make schools better. his plan added 2,800 teachers, raised teacher pay 22 percent, improved teacher training, doubled library money and increased money for school supplies.\n\nsanford's schools program linked together the educational fate of all children — black and white — and in doing so expanded opportunities for all.\n\nhe was a governor of unusual energy, creativity and vision. a harvard university study in 1981 ranked sanford as one of the 10 best governors of the century. campbell considers sanford one of the greatest governors in american history and the finest southern governor. his words and actions and thoughtfulness mattered, campbell said. he stood out as a beacon of hope for african americans, not just in north carolina but across the country.\n\nthe naacp's roy wilkins, one of the big four civil rights leaders, gave a shout-out to sanford in his march on washington speech in 1963 when he called on lawmakers to be as brave as our sit-ins and our marchers, to be as daring as james meredith, to be as unafraid as the nine children of little rock. and to be as forthright as the governor of north carolina.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nby law, sanford could not run for reelection. as his term progressed, his popularity diminished. he'd spent political capital in getting his schools program passed, and his words and actions on race further eroded his support among white voters. at one point, three out of five voters were dissatisfied with his performance as governor. when the 1964 governor's race became a referendum on his policies, his candidate lost badly.\n\nin 1972, sanford, then president of duke university, ran for president of the united states. in the democratic primary in his home state, he was humiliated by his old antithesis wallace, who beat him decisively. it seemed sanford's political career was over.\n\nbut in 1986 he ran for the u.s. senate and won — only to be turned out of office by voters after one term. north carolina always was ambivalent about sanford; he ran in statewide elections four times, winning twice and losing twice.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nsanford believed segregation not only held back black people but also held back north carolina and the south from fully joining the rest of the nation. i want north carolina to move into the mainstream of america, he said in his inauguration address.\n\nhe thought leaders should lead, and he was willing to take political risks to move his state forward. a former paratrooper who'd fought at the battle of the bulge, he showed during his jam-packed life both physical and moral courage. you're not elected to be a poll-taker, sanford once said. you're elected to provide some leadership. in his inauguration address, he did.\n\njohn drescher is a national politics editor at the washington post.
there were the agonizing video clips from april's facebook hearing, in which 68-year-old sen. roy blunt (r-mo.) attempted to ask facebook chief executive mark zuckerberg a question about data privacy, and revealed a conception of social media resembling a wad of tangled christmas lights: do you track devices that an individual who uses facebook has that is connected to the device that they use for their facebook connection, but not necessarily connected to facebook?\n\nad\n\nad\n\ni'm not — i'm not sure of the answer to that question, zuckerberg replied, as if he could even be sure it was a question.\n\nfacebook ceo mark zuckerberg sat down before lawmakers on april 10, and apologized, explained and defended the tech giant amid controversies over data privacy. (jenny starrs, bastien inzaurralde/the washington post)\n\ncome december it was the google chief sundar pichai's turn to visit the capitol and watch rep. steve cohen, the 69-year-old democrat from tennessee, wave his hands in the air and complain: i use your apparatus often, or your search engine, and i don't understand all of the different ways that you can turn off the locations. there's so many different things!\n\nthese hearings were live-streamed to the general populace, more than half of whom are younger than 40, many of whom were horrified to discover that a country being revolutionized by technology is apparently overseen by people whose worldview calcified in the previous century.\n\nad\n\nless surprised, but no less dismayed, were some of the tech advocates who have spent years trying to discuss issues like net neutrality and data privacy on capitol hill with representatives and staffers they say are somewhat less than engaged.\n\nad\n\nthere's different eras where people come from. it's hard to transcend that, said daniel schuman, a former hill staffer who works for a tech-oriented lobbying group, demand progress. it's like 'mad men.' you've got the secretary who does the typing and the librarian who does the research. lindsey o. graham was bragging about having a flip phone!\n\nzach graves, who regularly commutes between silicon valley and the district for his work at a free-market tech advocacy group called the lincoln network, has been wincing through congressional tech hearings since long before the google and facebook spectacles became viral dark comedy.\n\nad\n\nthere's lot of run-of-the-mill hearings where that's about par for the course, he said. it's clear from the kinds of questions they were asking they weren't prepped properly.\n\nad\n\nin particular he remembers the house agriculture committee's attempt to take on cryptocurrency. premised on the possibility that bitcoin might fall into the same regulatory category as soybeans and corn, july's hearing opened with a panel of technologists trying to explain blockchain technology.\n\na ceo with purple-dyed hair made a particularly diligent effort to connect with the congress members. email allows you to send a digital version of a birthday card to a grandchild instantly, she wrote in her prepared statement. cryptocurrency like bitcoin gives you the ability to put the digital equivalent of $10 inside that card.\n\nad\n\nbut the generational chasm became apparent when the 74-year-old ranking democrat, rep. collin c. peterson of minnesota, took the mic, rubbed something out of his eyes and announced, um. i don't know where to start. he explained that he was still uncomfortable with president franklin d. roosevelt's decision to abolish the gold standard in 1933, and liked this new idea no better. they're just creating this money out of nowhere! he said.\n\nad\n\nthe problem you're having is you don't understand technology you 8-track listening fools, countered one of several hundred cryptocurrency enthusiasts watching the proceedings live on youtube.\n\nthere is a counterargument, which issues from the offices of the lawmakers themselves. sen. orrin g. hatch ­(r.-utah), who leaves office thursday at age 84, was pilloried during april's facebook hearings for asking zuckerberg: how do you sustain a business model in which users don't pay for your service?\n\nad\n\nsenator, we run ads, zuckerberg replied, smiling cherubically, and video of this exchange instantly became a viral emblem for a doddering congress.\n\nthis irritated hatch's communication director, matt whitlock, who pointed out that the senator had spoken at length about facebook's advertiser-based business model minutes earlier, and asked his infamous question semi-\n\nrhetorically, to have zuckerberg confirm it.\n\nad\n\nsenator hatch has some of the most tech-literate staff on capitol hill and has authored more tech legislation than anyone, whitlock wrote to the washington post. but he became a meme of tech illiteracy because so many reporters only saw a 12-second video in their twitter feeds, not the three minutes preceding it.\n\nad\n\nperhaps one part of the problem is congress-illiteracy among tech reporters.\n\nmaybe so. and if an elderly congress is a problem, it's one the united states has managed throughout its history.\n\nmost americans (at least the white male ones) had not yet seen their 15th birthday before the first census in 1790, but were governed by a 1st congress in which the average senator was a methuselean 47 years old, according to the u.s. senate historical office.\n\nthe average age in the senate has ticked up steadily along with that of the population, as it has in the house since at least the 1940s, when congressional quarterly began keeping track of ages in the lower chamber. it's hard to be certain given incomplete and sometimes inconsistent age records, but the just-concluded 115th congress appears to have been the oldest in history — with an average age of 58½ as of the day it convened, if you combine senate historical office and cq figures.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwe don't yet have comprehensive age data for the next congress, but it convenes this week after an election that added a historic number of minorities, women and young people to government. the midterm election quintupled the number of millennials who will hold a house seat, according to the pew research center, though they still make up a paltry share, with just over two dozen seats. among this new class of digital natives is new york democrat alexandria ocasio-\n\ncortez, 29, who will become the youngest woman to join congress (and who complained about being mistaken for an intern when she toured the capitol after her election).\n\nthe age difference is a huge disparity. my friends and i had talked about forever, said katie hill, 31, who unseated a republican incumbent in california's 25th district last month by campaigning partly on generational issues — not so much technology as college debt, health care reform and climate change.\n\nthe technology helps, though. hill said she and a handful of other under-40s elected in november have befriended each other as they prepare to move into their new offices. they chat mostly through text.\n\nwhen hill introduces herself to incumbents, she said, she usually does so in person.
we're going to hear that the democrats won, because the voting devices they're using today are connected to the internet, said knab, 66, as he waited for a republican get-out-the-vote rally. i expect that the white house, the nsa, and individuals in government that want to do what's right are going to come forward and say: here's how this election was stolen.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe two-month runoff campaign, which has already smashed fundraising, spending and turnout records, might have been the first of a post-trump era. but the president's refusal to concede has repeatedly reshaped the race. and president trump's tactics have been rebooted by the republican nominees.\n\nat a saturday stop in carrollton, ga., loeffler warned republican voters that democratic control of washington would lead to permanent lockdowns and the passage of a green new deal that would cost every family $75,000. (there was no cost estimate in the 2019 green new deal resolution, so conservative think tanks have made their own.) at every event, loeffler warns that democrats would defund the police, an idea rejected by both candidates.\n\nthe character attacks on both democrats go further. republicans have portrayed jon ossoff as both a wealthy do-nothing and a puppet of the chinese communist party, based on a hong kong media company purchasing a documentary from ossoff's firm; they've painted raphael warnock as a genuine danger, a threat to women and children, and an ally of international marxists.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nraphael warnock has been involved in child abuse, domestic abuse, loeffler said at her saturday rallies. we've learned this morning that the lawyer for harvey weinstein has been contributing to his campaign. i don't think that's a coincidence.\n\nossoff, who's waging his second campaign in four years, has been put through the ringer before. the republican runoff effort has focused more on warnock, starting with stories about warnock's criticism of israel and ending, last week, with body-camera footage of warnock's ex-wife telling police that her husband had run over her foot with their car.\n\ni've tried to keep the way that he acts under wraps for a long time, but today he crossed the line, oulèye ndoye said. he's a great actor. he is phenomenal at putting on a really good show. that quote made it into a loeffler ad, which ends by encouraging domestic violence victims to call a hotline. (the abuse allegation was first reported by the atlanta journal-constitution in march.)\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe other attacks are thinner. the child abuse claim grew out of warnock, in 2002, telling camp counselors accused of misconduct to get legal counsel when police interviewed them. the weinstein attack came after attorney david boies donated to a democratic georgia political action committee, not to warnock directly.\n\ndemocrats have responded in two ways: accusing the republicans of constant distraction, and lowering their own bar for attacking them. when asked about loeffler's accusations, warnock has condemned the senator for campaigning with rep.-elect marjorie taylor greene, a conspiracy theorist who represents deep-red northwest georgia. ossoff, who interacts far more with the press, used an impromptu fox news interview to repeatedly say that loeffler has been campaigning with a klansman. when confronted by cnn on sunday — a former member of the ku klux klan got a picture with loeffler, who denounced him — ossoff simply insisted he was telling the truth.\n\nit's even more distressing that this isn't an isolated incident, ossoff said. kelly loeffler has repeatedly posed for photographs and been seen campaigning alongside radical white supremacists.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ntactics like that have kept both democrats in the hunt, if not slightly stronger. republicans ended the early-vote period behind their numbers from the nov. 3 election. the gop share of the electorate was the same, while democratic turnout was higher. while the president is campaigning in northwest georgia tomorrow, he has shown far more interest in reversing his loss in georgia than in messaging for loeffler or perdue.\n\nin a 35-minute call with secretary of state brad raffensperger (r), a recording of which was obtained by the washington post, the president urged the state's top election official to fabricate a new vote count that put him ahead of joe biden. he barely mentioned the senate races. as vividly negative as the campaign has been, nothing has resonated like the idea that turning out in the senate race will help the president.\n\nthe legacy of donald trump is at stake in georgia, said former trump adviser corey lewandowski, joined by republican senators and congressional candidates at a rally in sugar hill, ga. see, the country is looking at you saying: we can steal another one. they stole the last one. don't kid yourself.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nfixating republicans on the senate race, and not the fraud allegations boosted by the president, started out as a challenge. it's still a challenge. at sunday's rally, when club for growth president david mcintosh started a chant of vote, a section of the crowd chanted stop the steal! instead. sen. ted cruz (r-tex.) warned that an ambitious left-wing agenda would pass if the runoff races were lost, from statehood for washington, d.c., to a packed supreme court. the voters who reached him after the speech thanked him for challenging the jan. 6 certification of biden's win. asked about that and the trump-raffensperger call, cruz refused to talk about it.\n\ni'm going to answer what i think matters for the voters of georgia, and what matters for the voters of georgia is the special election that is happening on tuesday, cruz said. i get the media wants to report all sorts of things and get everyone

issue fresh warnings about virus after death of rep.-elect luke letlow, by david nakamura and fenit nirappil\n\nwill the fate of a 41-year-old father change any minds about the pandemic?\n\nautogolpe watch\n\nthe effort to challenge the nov. 3 presidential election results has settled into a pattern. first, there's an accusation, then a lawsuit. then when that's rejected, there's a hearing during which the accusation can be aired unfiltered, whether or not it is true.\n\nad\n\nsaturday's events fit into that pattern. in the morning, 11 republican senators announced that they would join sen. josh hawley (r-mo.) to challenge the election results, and a few hours later, the office of vice president pence said he shares the concerns of millions of americans about voter fraud and irregularities in the last election. for the first time in 144 years, the electoral vote in multiple states would be contested in congress.\n\nad\n\nthis was both surprising and inevitable, coming after the senate's hearing dec. 16 on election fraud (which hawley was part of) and after the failure of a lawsuit that argued that pence could reject electoral votes if he so chooses. the lawsuit was rejected in district court and in the conservative u.s. court of appeals for the 5th circuit. it was also opposed by the justice department. but the courts did not go into great detail, saying that the lawsuits were brought by people who did not have standing to sue.\n\nin effect, the ruling would be that you've got to go to the streets and be as violent as antifa and blm, said one plaintiff, rep. louie gohmert (r-tex.), on friday.\n\nwhile gohmert railed, sen. ted cruz (r-tex.) organized. his letter, which brought the number of republican senators challenging the election to 12, argued that the allegations of fraud and irregularities in the 2020 election exceed any in our lifetimes, and that congress must immediately appoint an electoral commission, with full investigatory and fact-finding authority, to conduct an emergency 10-day audit of the election returns in the disputed states.\n\nwho would volunteer to serve on the commission? who'd pay for it? the letter skipped the details and focused on what could happen after an emergency audit was completed, days before the next president takes office: individual states would evaluate the commission's findings and could convene a special legislative session to certify a change in their vote, if needed. why would these be special sessions, given that all but one state contested by republicans — nevada — will have begun its ordinary legislative session before inauguration day? that's also unexplained.\n\nthe republican infighting sparked off by cruz's letter, and hawley's previous promise to challenge the results, clarified just what the challenges are designed to do. both refer not to evidence of voter fraud, but to allegations that it might have happened. at the very least, congress should investigate allegations of voter fraud and adopt measures to secure the integrity of our elections, said hawley, who introduced his own election reform legislation at the end of the last congress. cruz's letter cited the precedent of the 1877 electoral college fight, when congress created a special commission to investigate the results — but the commission, dominated by republicans, handed every contested vote to its nominee, doing nothing to debunk credible fraud allegations.\n\nthis makes more sense when considered as a pattern. at state legislative hearings last month, republicans heard accusations of election fraud from people that were quickly debunked, like a man who told georgia legislators that hardware not connected to the internet could be remotely hacked. in court, they produced no fraud claims, focusing instead on getting millions of votes disqualified by arguing that election officials didn't have the power to expand ballot access without permission from republican state legislatures. but because the courts neither received nor adjudicated actual fraud charges, republicans like gohmert argued that they hadn't really been debunked.\n\nhawley argued that, too. after brushback from colleagues, he put out a weekend statement arguing that the pennsylvania supreme court threw out a lawsuit asking for all absentee voting to be invalidated without hearing the merits. hawley didn't allege fraud, instead writing (correctly) that the state legislature passed a law expanding absentee voting in 2019, then writing (misleadingly) that state officials put the new law into effect in november. in reality, the law had been in effect for several elections, including the state's tortured and delayed june primary — a fact that harmed the republican lawsuit, as they had waited until losing an election to quibble with the rules.\n\nwhy does one odd phrasing in a news release matter? because we've been here before: an allegation is made, a court rejects it, and a hearing is called so the allegation can be aired again. senators and members of the house can say nearly anything they want in floor debate, and each challenge of a state on jan. 6 will create hours of debate. in a statement endorsing the gop challenges, the vice president's office said republicans could raise objections and bring forward evidence before the congress and the american people. it never made sense when pro-trump conservatives argued that the supreme court could hear their allegations of voter fraud — that's not what the court does — but nothing stops republicans from airing those allegations on c-span.\n\ndemocratic reaction to this, and to president trump's endorsement of an 11 a.m. stop the steal rally before the certification, has leaned more toward irritation than panic. they're not worried about pence assuming extra-constitutional powers that he has already rejected in that justice department filing in the gohmert suit. just two republicans could vote down the challenges, and at least four have said they will do so: sens. lisa murkowski (r-alaska), patrick j. toomey (r-pa.), mitt romney (r-utah) and ben sasse (r-neb.). but they expect to spend hours dealing with this, and sen. amy klobuchar (minn.), the top democrat on the senate rules and administration committee, has said democrats are prepared to counter the allegations and defend the contested states' elections.\n\nwe are ready for every contingency, klobuchar told the post's mike debonis this week. this isn't like we just woke up this morning and said, 'oh, this is coming up!' we've been working on this since election day.\n\nad watch\n\njon ossoff, georgia. twelve years ago, when a race for this senate seat in georgia went to a runoff, president-elect barack obama didn't campaign for the democrat. the state's bluer now, and obama voices this spot which completes ossoff's weeks-long strategy: turn the race into a second vote for joe biden. georgia stepped up. now, america's counting on you again, obama says, emphasizing ossoff's pledge to pass more health insurance reforms and a new voting rights act.\n\ndavid perdue, total democrat control. republicans are closing out the senate runoffs with the argument that sen. charles e. schumer (d-n.y.) gave them two months ago: defeat in georgia would let democrats run everything in washington. if they're in charge, america will never be the same, a narrator says, as an image of a communist american flag dissolves into perdue walking with determination toward the camera.\n\nkelly loeffler, job to do. loeffler's version of the closing argument ad looks like perdue's, with a little more verve and guitar riffs. loeffler's remarks from last month's trump rally in valdosta, ga., are cut together with familiar warnings of how democrats would wreck the country. stop socialism in its tracks, a narrator says.\n\nyou are reading the trailer, the newsletter that brings the campaign trail to your inbox.\n\n\n\ndems in disarray\n\nthe 117th congress was seated sunday. mostly. a death in louisiana, a court fight in new york, and that little runoff in georgia have left three of 535 seats open, and an ongoing democratic challenge to a house race in iowa could add to the democrats' majority, or leave it as is.\n\ngeorgia's situation is unique: sen. david perdue's term expired at noon sunday, and he won't rejoin the senate unless he wins tuesday, a process that will take days or weeks to conclude. (even in a rout, it takes a while for a state to complete a final canvass of votes.) in louisiana, the death of rep.-elect luke letlow just weeks after his runoff win will keep the 5th congressional district vacant until a special election later this year. both republicans and democrats expect that to be bundled with a special election for the neighboring 2nd congressional district, which rep. cedric l. richmond (d-la.) is vacating to join the biden administration.\n\nthere's no more voting underway in new york's 22nd congressional district, but the seat remained vacant today as attorneys for rep. anthony brindisi, a democrat, and former congresswoman claudia tenney, a republican, fought over the validity of dozens of contested ballots. tenney ended the last count up by 29 votes, and the winner will be seated after challenges conclude. twelve years ago, when senate republicans objected to the seating of minnesota's al franken until challenges were exhausted, the democrat wasn't seated until july.\n\niowa's 2nd congressional district did get representation on sunday, when democrats seated republican rep. mariannette miller-meeks. but they did so provisionally, and their rules package, also passed sunday, provided funding for the challenge brought by democrat rita hart, who ended the state's official count down by just six votes, the closest house election anywhere in the country in this century.\n\non dec. 22, hart filed a challenge with the house committee on administration, arguing that 22 ballots had been disqualified even though they were cast by valid voters — and that counting them would put her ahead. miller-meeks has 19 more days to respond to that challenge, after which the committee will decide whether to take it up.\n\nrepublicans, even as they've argued for overturning presidential vote margins of 10,000 votes or more, have resolutely defended miller-meeks. the congressional leadership fund conducted a poll in the district, finding a majority of voters wanting the election over with miller-meeks seated, and iowa editorial boards have chastened hart for seeking relief in the house instead of courts. (hart's argument: relying on the court might have meant miller-meeks was seated before a final decision, at which point there would be no way to unseat her.) on new year's eve, the hart campaign gathered some of the affected voters on a conference call, such as sadie bromberg, a democrat who learned too late that her absentee ballot was rejected because she taped it closed.\n\ni was pretty disappointed, because voting is very important to me as a woman and as an american citizen, bromberg said.\n\nif the house committee rejects the challenge, it's over. if hart ends up prevailing, the democratic majority can vote whether to seat her. but either resolution is weeks away.\n\ncountdown
he once arm-wrestled an executive from another company to settle a legal dispute and never hid his fondness for cigarettes and bourbon. yet he was considered a visionary business leader whose record of sustained success at southwest led fortune magazine to ask on its cover: is herb kelleher america's best ceo?\n\nmr. kelleher, a onetime new jersey lawyer, won a court case in 1971 allowing southwest to begin operating in texas.\n\nad\n\nwith its innovative, no-frills approach, southwest became the country's most profitable and most imitated airline. once a feisty upstart, it is now the largest domestic carrier in the united states, with annual revenue approaching $25 billion.\n\nad\n\nmr. kelleher, who held top executive roles at southwest for more than 30 years, died jan. 3, at age 87. the dallas-based airline announced his death but did not provide details on where he died or the cause. he was treated for prostate cancer nearly 20 years ago.\n\nwhen asked whether his five-pack-a-day smoking habit may have caused his cancer, mr. kelleher quipped, i don't smoke with my prostate.\n\nmr. kelleher's instinctive, self-taught management style has been studied in business schools and emulated at countless companies.\n\nad\n\nherb kelleher is arguably the most transformative figure and character in the history of modern aviation, texas oil tycoon t. boone pickens said in a tweet.\n\nat southwest, mr. kelleher created what he called a culture of commitment, in which employees — not customers — came first. the idea was simple: happy workers would lead to happy passengers, thus giving the airline a competitive edge.\n\nad\n\nwhat's important, mr. kelleher told forbes magazine, is that a customer should get off the airplane feeling, 'i didn't just get from a to b. i had one of the most pleasant experiences i ever had and i'll be back for that reason.' \n\nhiring the right people, mr. kelleher said, was a leader's most crucial task. when other companies emphasized education and skills, mr. kelleher put a premium on temperament.\n\nad\n\nwhat we are looking for first and foremost is a sense of humor, he said.\n\nsouthwest flight attendants became known for telling corny jokes over the cabin intercom and for silly gags, such as awarding prizes to passengers with holes in their socks.\n\ngood morning, ladies and gentlemen, one flight attendant announced, after smoking was no longer permitted on commercial flights. those of you who wish to smoke will please file out to our lounge on the wing, where you can enjoy our feature film, 'gone with the wind.' \n\nad\n\nmr. kelleher invited longtime southwest customers to help screen job candidates. from pilot to baggage handler, attitude mattered. one pilot was rejected because he refused to put on a pair of casual shorts during a group exercise. another was dismissed for being rude to a receptionist.\n\nad\n\nif you don't have a good attitude, we don't want you, no matter how skilled you are, mr. kelleher told forbes magazine in 1991. we can change skill levels through training. we can't change attitude.\n\nas a result, southwest's employees had less turnover, more productivity and job satisfaction — and higher pay — than almost any other airline. the company has never had layoffs or pay cuts and is routinely ranked as one of the country's best places to work.\n\nnothing kills your company's culture like layoffs, mr. kelleher told fortune in 2001. you want to show your people that you value them and you're not going to hurt them just to get a little more money in the short term. not furloughing people breeds loyalty. it breeds a sense of security. it breeds a sense of trust.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nlabor-union contracts were written to allow workers to move from one task to another.\n\npilots sometimes helped clean the cabin, ramp workers collected tickets, counter agents loaded bags. mr. kelleher often worked alongside the baggage handlers on the wednesday before thanksgiving, the busiest travel day of the year.\n\nmr. kelleher despised the old hierarchical theory of management, he told usa today, which says you have to show you're in charge by walking around acting like a brick all day.\n\nsouthwest was founded in 1967, when mr. kelleher was working as a lawyer for texas businessman rollin w. king.\n\nthey sketched out a plan on a cocktail napkin, as legend has it, to open a short-haul airline with cheap flights connecting dallas, houston and san antonio. mr. kelleher chipped in $10,000 of his own money.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ntwo other airlines promptly filed suit, claiming texas was not big enough to support an upstart carrier such as southwest. after more than three years, mr. kelleher prevailed in the supreme court of texas in 1971, and the next day, the inaugural southwest flight took off.\n\nthe company lost money for two years and was forced to sell one of its three airplanes. but by its third year, southwest was turning a profit.\n\nwhen a texas competitor, braniff airlines, undercut southwest's fare by offering flights for $13, southwest fought back in a typically inventive way.\n\nwe'd offer customers a choice, mr. kelleher said in 2001. they could pay $13 — or they could pay $26 and we'd throw in a free bottle of whiskey. that made us the largest liquor distributor in texas for a couple of months.\n\nad\n\nin 1978, mr. kelleher moved from corporate counsel to board chairman and later added the title of chief executive, assuming day-to-day control of the business. southwest steadily expanded from texas to louisiana, arizona, california and, ultimately, nationwide.\n\nad\n\nthe company broke into the florida market in the mid-1990s by offering $19 fares between fort lauderdale and tampa. with frequent flights and low prices, southwest made air travel more affordable for millions of people.\n\nwe're competing with the automobile, not the airlines, mr. kelleher said. the traffic is already there, but it's on the ground. we take it off the highway and put it in the airplane.\n\nad\n\nfrom the beginning, southwest abandoned the conventional hub and spoke model of organizing airline routes. instead, the company focused primarily on point-to-point flights, usually without intermediate connections.\n\nto make repairs and pilot training easier, southwest used only one kind of aircraft — the boeing 737. mr. kelleher abolished reserved seating and first-class sections. passengers received plastic boarding cards, distributed on a first-come, first-served basis. after entering the cabin, they chose the first available seats.\n\nad\n\nclosets were removed from the front of the airplanes because passengers wasted time trying to hang up clothing. there was no cooked food on a southwest flight, only drinks and crackers or peanuts, which mr. kelleher sometimes served himself. (in 2000, the company removed three peanuts from each packet, saving $300,000 a year.)\n\nfor all his joking and bravado, mr. kelleher was a conservative businessman who understood that an airline could not make money if its planes were sitting on the ground. southwest became renowned for its fast turnaround times, with ground crews beginning their work seconds after a plane arrived at the gate.\n\none set of passengers filed off the aircraft while a second was waiting to board. within 15 to 20 minutes, or half the time of most airlines, southwest had its boeing 737 back in the air. a southwest aircraft spent 11 hours a day in flight, compared with the average eight hours at other airlines.\n\nad\n\nfor years, mr. kelleher personally approved any company expenditure exceeding $1,000 — not because i don't trust our people, he said, but because i know if they know i'm watching, they'll be just that much more careful.\n\nhis formula worked spectacularly well. as other carriers went out of business — eastern, pan am, twa — southwest kept flying and kept growing. the airline has earned a profit every year since 1973, and it made mr. kelleher a billionaire.\n\neven so, his office at southwest headquarters in dallas was relatively modest, with a standard-issue desk and ashtrays. on friday afternoons, he invited employees to join him at a weekly cookout on the company's patio.\n\nanybody who seeks wealth as an end in itself is always going to be disappointed, he said in 1995. what you really should be doing is seeking excellence in achievement.\n\nherbert david kelleher was born march 12, 1931, in camden, n.j. he was 12 when his father, an executive with the campbell soup co., died. an older brother was killed in world war ii.\n\nas the youngest of four children, mr. kelleher became close to his mother, who helped shape his approach to leadership.\n\nwhen i was very young — 11 or 12, he recalled to fortune in 2001, she used to sit up talking to me till 3, 4 in the morning. she talked a lot about how you should treat people with respect. she said that positions and titles signify absolutely nothing. they're just adornments.\n\nduring high school, mr. kelleher worked various jobs at campbell's, from cook to warehouse foreman, which he called the best education i ever had. you got to meet the people, see how good they are, how hard-working they are and see some of their eccentricities.\n\nhe graduated in 1953 from wesleyan university in middletown, conn., where he studied english literature and philosophy. he received a law degree from new york university in 1956.\n\nafter clerking for a new jersey supreme court justice, mr. kelleher practiced law for several years in newark. in 1961, he moved to his wife's home state of texas, joining a law practice in san antonio.\n\nmr. kelleher was an effective trial lawyer, but every day i went to work, he told people, i felt my shoulders droop a little more.\n\nat southwest, he worked 14-hour days, then often stayed up late, swapping stories and sipping 101-proof wild turkey bourbon. sleeping only four hours a night, he managed to read two to three books a week.\n\nsurvivors include his wife of 63 years, the former joan negley; three of their four children; and numerous grandchildren.\n\nmr. kelleher retired as southwest's chief executive in 2001 and stepped down as board chairman in 2008. over the years, other companies have tried to copy his business practices, but none has been able to replicate the man himself.\n\nmr. kelleher would ride into company gatherings on a harley-davidson motorcycle, sometimes singing blue suede shoes while dressed as elvis.\n\nbut his favorite stunt came in 1991, when southwest was threatened with legal action by stevens aviation, a small company in south carolina.\n\nat the time, southwest's advertising slogan was just plane smart.\n\nthe company said it was unaware stevens aviation already had the slogan plane smart as its motto.\n\nmr. kelleher proposed that he and stevens aviation chairman kurt herwald settle matters with an arm-wrestling match.\n\nrather than pay a team of lawyers, herwald and i decided to wrestle it out at the sportatorium in dallas, mr. kelleher said. it was a hoot. the whole world focused on it. bbc called to interview me in london. i told them i was too busy training.\n\nin photographs of his training, mr. kelleher was shown lifting bottles of wild turkey in both hands as a cigarette dangled from his lips.\n\nmore than 1,000 spectators attended the malice in dallas showdown.\n\nin the end, mr. kelleher said, i got trounced.\n\nbut all was not lost. he and herwald became fast friends, and they agreed both companies could share the plane smart slogan.
in a recent post, leading federalism scholar rick hills argues that foot voting in a federal system can't work effectively without major help from ballot box voting. he agrees that foot voting has many of the advantages i emphasize, but contends that it might be futile if ballot box voters cannot incentivize politicians to continue good policies:\n\nunless there is a feedback mechanism inducing local officials to care about attracting migrants, we argue that interjurisdictional migration will be nothing more than a trip from the frying pan to fire. foot-voters would either over-crowd the good jurisdictions or not bother moving at all, because they would have no guarantee that well-governed destinations would stay well-governed. this does not mean that foot-voting is pointless: it just means that migration should be regarded as a complement to ballot-voting, not a substitute. ilya's argument for foot-voting, in other words, becomes much more powerful if one recognizes that foot-voting actually improves local ballot-voters' incentives to cast an intelligent vote. one such incentive is the prospect of foot-voters' buying their houses. our criticism is offered, therefore, more as a friendly amendment than a refutation to ilya's outstanding book.\n\ni greatly appreciate rick's praise of my book, and i certainly agree that we cannot dispense with ballot box voting entirely. well-informed ballot box voting can make a federal system function much better than it would otherwise. rick outlines several plausible mechanisms by which foot voting can reinforce ballot-box voting, and vice versa. but effective foot voting is not as dependent on ballot box voting as rick suggests.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ni. the danger of killing the goose that attracted the golden egg.\n\nit is indeed true that foot voting does not provide guarantees against the reversal of the policies that attracted the foot voters in the first place. what a state or local government gives today it could potentially take away tomorrow. government officials with poor incentives might end up killing the goose that attracted the golden egg of foot-voting migrants in the first place.\n\nbut the risk is not as great as rick suggests. even if the governments in question are just selecting policies at random and do not care about their effect on foot voters, there is still a great deal of inertia in government, especially when it comes to changing long-established policy. interest groups, bureaucracies, and others who have become habituated to the status quo will not easily accept change. if a policy has been in place for a long time, that is some evidence that it is unlikely to be radically altered in the short to medium term future.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmoreover, at least in a system where subnational governmments must raise a large proportion of their own funding, they do in fact have strong incentives to adopt policies that attract foot voting taxpayers and businesses. otherwise, they risk losing valuable tax revenue that can be spent on projects they value, or on efforts to help keep them in power. additional tax revenue is valuable to officials even if voters remain poorly informed and do not directly reward them for it. if nothing else, it can be useful in enriching the officials themselves and their political allies. thus, competition can incentivize local and regional governments to cater to the needs of foot voters, even in the absence of electoral pressure to do so.\n\nii. crowding and capitalization.\n\nas rick indicates, crowding might at some point limit the ability of foot voters to enter attractive jurisdictions. however, such effects need not be a major problem in a system where there are hundreds or even thousands of jurisdictions competing with each other. while some may become crowded, others will not. moreover, crowding is not a fixed fact of nature, but often the effect of policy. it can be mitigated by changing such policies as excessively restrictive zoning, which artificially limits the amount of housing available to potential migrants.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe danger of artificially inflating land prices through zoning makes me skeptical of rick's and qiao shitong's proposal to incentivize good policy by rewarding local officials for increasing the relative value of the land within their jurisdiction. as rick himself has emphasized in other work, high prices often reflect exclusionary zoning rather than good policies.\n\nlike some other scholars, rick worries that foot voting may become pointless if the benefits of good government become capitalized into the value of land: housing in well-governed jurisdictions becomes more expensive to the point that there is no benefit to moving there from poorly governed ones. in my book democracy and political ignorance, i explain why this concern is overstated.\n\ncapitalization does not happen nearly as quickly as critics fear. if it did, we would not have had a long history of migration from poorly governed areas to relatively better ones. if capitalization were all that it is sometimes cracked up to be, we would never have had the recent migration of northerners to the sun belt or the great migration of african-americans out of the jim crow south. the relative advantages of these destination areas should have immediately been reflected in higher prices that would deter migrants in the first place. in addition, as noted above, capitalization effects can be diminished by adopting policies that make housing more available and thereby reduce the costs of migration.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nfinally, in a world where instantaneous capitalization does occur, we might indeed see little or no migration driven by foot voting. but the mere possibility of it is still likely to incentivize local governments to adopt better policies as i put it in my book:\n\nif local governments get a substantial proportion of their revenue from property taxes—as most in the united states do—they would have incentives to adopt policies that increase the value of land within their jurisdiction so that they could generate more revenue without raising tax rates. in such a scenario, the possibility of in-migration would serve to bid up prices, even if (by assumption) the changes in price occur so quickly that migrants are deterred from ever actually coming. indeed, the faster the increases in price happen, the faster local governments will be able to reap the benefits of better policies in the form of higher property tax revenue.\n\ni certainly do not contend that foot voting can solve all our problems, or that ballot box voting has no useful role. to the contrary, i have argued that foot voting cannot effectively address such issues as overexploitation of immobile assets by subnational governments, most notably property rights in land. for that reason, a system of decentralized foot voting needs to be supplemented with constitutional protections for property rights, for other immobile assets, and for people with unusually high moving costs. also, i recognize that there are some problems so large that they cannot realistically be dealt with at the regional or local level, and therefore must be addressed by national or even international ballot box voting.
the stakes were much bigger than usual. not only was clinton on trial for alleged crimes committed as a result of his dalliance with a former white house intern, but the senate was on trial as well, challenged to conduct a dignified proceeding that would not degenerate into the same partisan hash that prevailed last year in the house.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nsenator [thomas a.] daschle and i are not dictators, lott told reporters late yesterday. we are leaders that are getting some latitude . . . but we have to bring along 98 other senators. we're struggling very hard to do that.\n\ndaschle (d-s.d.), the minority leader, stood next to him and replied that i couldn't have said it better, completing an exchange that would have occasioned open-mouthed amazement in the deeply divided house.\n\ndespite their best efforts, consensus remained elusive yesterday, and there continued to be a real danger that the senate could collapse into the kind of partisan bickering lott and daschle have pledged to avoid. the house prosecutors want to call witnesses to help make their case. the white house doesn't want witnesses for fear they could introduce a new element of uncertainty and prolong a process it believes the public wants cut short. and many conservatives inside and outside the senate are pressing lott for a full trial.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nsenate democrats are standing firm with the white house and have rejected a compromise gop proposal to have opening statements from both sides and only then to vote on whether to call witnesses.\n\nsome capitol hill veterans saw the back-and-forth this week as part of the normal circuitous route to agreements in the senate. sen. fred d. thompson (r-tenn.) suggested there's an impasse – for the moment. the senate needed time: we've only been back here for a few days, and this is a very complex thing to rush through, he added. there's a natural ripening process.\n\nthe senate is almost never in a rush. in normal times, any one of 100 senators has the power to launch a filibuster at any moment. filibusters are not permitted during an impeachment trial, but conviction takes a two-thirds majority, an impossible threshold without an extraordinary degree of bipartisan cooperation.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbecause of such rules, the majority must be circumspect in its treatment of the minority, and the minority should be appreciative of this deference. parties often agree to disagree, but open breaches are rare. absent altogether is the perpetual partisan warfare that in recent years has marked the house, where the majority routinely rolls the minority on straight party-line votes.\n\nand besides, nobody wants to look bad. it was best to have a pretrial procedural agreement, sen. ted stevens (r-alaska) told reporters. even though we're not a courtroom, he said, we don't want chaos, anyway.\n\nfor several days now, lott and other senate leaders have been trying to head off such chaos – and their efforts seemed to fall apart and then revive by the hour.\n\nad\n\nby the time the senate convened wednesday, it quickly became apparent that one bipartisan plan to hold an abbreviated trial, with a quick vote to identify whether there were the votes to convict, was in trouble.\n\nad\n\nlott had appeared to favor it in the interests of bipartisanship and a quick end to an unpleasant task, but senate conservatives and conservative groups that make up a significant part of the gop's base voters were holding out for witnesses and an extended proceeding.\n\nhopes for a quick deal rose again wednesday night when republican and democratic negotiators for the senate met with the house prosecutors and white house lawyers at the capitol.\n\nad\n\nthe white house offered to stipulate to the evidence compiled by independent counsel kenneth w. starr in exchange for a quick trial without witnesses. but while both parties generally agreed to allow both sides to make opening remarks and allow for questioning within a few days, the gop insisted on leaving open the possibility of then calling witnesses. the democrats, by contrast, wanted to end the proceedings and vote on whether to acquit or convict.\n\nad\n\nby the time chief justice william h. rehnquist had sworn them in as jurors, democrats were openly discouraged. republicans had called a bipartisan caucus, but it fell through because they apparently forgot to notify the democrats.\n\ntempers rose. democrats charged the gop was in thrall to the hard-line house prosecutors. thompson said he was very disappointed in such remarks. lott and daschle announced the competing plans would go to the floor.\n\nad\n\nlott said later, we are in uncharted waters, trying to put together the first presidential impeachment trial in 131 years. indeed, the senate was trying out arcane and unique procedures on the ceremonial side, just as members were trying to craft a unique agreement on trial procedures.\n\nsen. charles e. grassley (r-iowa) explained that the senate is in its usual legislative mode, and not all senators have accepted the fact that the senate is a court of impeachment and that we took an oath to be jurors and to make decisions based on fact. the problem is all this political finagling going on.\n\nad\n\npositions seemed to be hardening during the day, and senators were starting to speak out. sen. james m. inhofe (r-okla.) said he wanted a full-scale trial with as many witnesses as necessary, and didn't care if other senate business took a back seat. one hundred years from now they're not going to care about what the nation's agenda was at the time, inhofe said. they're going to talk about the quality of the product.\n\nad\n\nstevens, who has been working behind the scenes for the republicans to try to craft a deal with the democrats, explained that the most ardent proponents of calling witnesses see that as the only way to unearth damaging new evidence that would improve what are now long odds for conviction.\n\nthey want to try to convince those people who already made up their minds to change their minds, he said. unfortunately, it is a political process and i don't envision the ability [of prosecutors] to get 67 votes to convict clinton.\n\nad\n\nmany democrats were adamant against having live testimony. we feel strongly that witnesses would lead to a spectacle, said sen. paul wellstone (d-minn.). there comes a point where you don't want to be used to legitimize something you don't believe in.\n\nad\n\nand sen. jack reed (d-r.i) said democrats believe that once one side calls witnesses, the other side would call witnesses, and the conduct of the trial would be taken over by the lawyers on either side. without some kind of upfront control, the trial takes on a life of its own.
there have already been an astounding number of discoveries made about ötzi, who never could have predicted his future fame the day he was killed in the alps, near the current border between italy and austria. after being shot in the back by an arrow, he was naturally mummified and preserved in a glacier until he was found by a pair of hikers in 1991.\n\nsince then, analysis of his body and belongings have helped researchers figure out not only how he was killed but also what he ate for his final meal (cooked grain and goat bacon), what he wore (a sensible outfit including a ­modern-looking bear fur hat) and what health problems bugged him (bad teeth, joint pain and more).\n\ndetails have continued to be revealed decades later because of technological advances, and peschel, a scientist, says he expects that trend to continue.\n\nwe will find things we're not even dreaming about now, he said.\n\nin just the next few months, ötzi is scheduled to undergo his first ct scan since 2013, and peschel predicts the images will lead to more findings.\n\nso it's peschel's job to make sure ötzi continues to look as though he's fresh out of his glacier — a place with no light, no dry air and no trouble around him — while on display at the south tyrol museum of archaeology in bolzano, italy.\n\nthe first thing peschel does during his checkups is take a peek at ötzi through the window museum visitors use. when someone stands on the viewing platform, lights shine on super skinny, brownish ötzi. he's lying faceup on a large glass plate, his left arm bent across his body. the walls around him are made of blocks of ice, kind of like an igloo. and ötzi himself is covered in a thin layer of ice, which is why there's a tiny piece of fabric under his hips. (otherwise, he could slide off the plate like an ice cube.)\n\nwhile most visitors just marvel at ötzi's sunken figure, peschel focuses on that ice layer. despite carefully climate-controlled conditions, ötzi has trouble keeping his cool. the glass plate is connected to a scale, which shows that ötzi loses about 2 grams of water weight each day. peschel says the right hand, which is the body part closest to the visitor window, sheds ice most rapidly. on a recent visit, he points out that the pinkie has no ice at all.\n\nthat means it's time for peschel to do a humidification process, a 15- to 30-minute shower that ötzi takes every eight weeks. ötzi is moved into another freezing room — there's an entire laboratory behind the museum walls, including a backup ice chamber in case of emergency — where peschel performs a complete examination, keeping an eye out for any discoloration and evidence of bacterial or fungal growth.\n\nthen peschel, dressed in sterile surgeon's clothes, uses a special water gun to get ötzi icy in all the right spots.\n\ni try to use less water and keep it on places i want him to have ice, he explains. i could do it for three hours and add 10 liters, and he would weigh more. but there would be gravitational pull that could affect the body.\n\nötzi's treatment has been relatively consistent since he arrived in bolzano 20 years ago, peschel says. that may change soon, however, because plans are being developed to create a larger museum. to prepare for the move, peschel and the rest of the technical staff have started a multiyear investigation into other ways to preserve him.\n\none option to consider is suspending ötzi in a giant block of ice. he'd still be visible, but access to scientists would be limited, says peschel, who's also in charge of evaluating requests to study ötzi. another idea is switching from an oxygen atmosphere to a nitrogen one, which would be less friendly to bacteria. or, peschel says, it would be possible to vacuum-seal ötzi like a steak. (but we don't want to eat ötzi, he clarifies.)\n\nno one has experience with these methods. so we can't ask anyone, says peschel, noting that ötzi is unique. other bodies have been discovered in melting glaciers, he explains, but what typically happens is they drift to the bottom and are destroyed.
it takes aim at domestic spending with cuts that are sure to be rejected by congress, including slashing the environmental protection agency budget by 26.5 percent over the next year, and cutting the budget of the health and human services department by 9 percent. hhs includes the national institutes of health and the centers for disease control and prevention, which will see a budget cut even as the coronavirus spreads -- although officials said funding aimed at combating the coronavirus would be protected.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe budget is a proposal to congress, and lawmakers have mostly rejected the white house's proposed cuts in the past. still, the budget plan sets up the trump administration's policy priorities heading into the november elections and are likely to draw scrutiny in washington and on the campaign trail.\n\nit would target the education department is for a nearly 8 percent cut, the interior department would be cut 13.4 percent, and the housing and urban development department would be cut 15.2 percent. the state department and u.s. agency for international development would be cut by 22 percent.\n\nthe proposed cuts stand in contrast to proposals by major democratic candidates to expand environmental, education and health care spending, setting up a clash between trump and his 2020 rivals over their major campaign priorities.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nnot all agencies would face cuts, though. trump proposes to increase spending for the department of homeland security, while keeping pentagon spending mostly flat. the national aeronautics and space administration budget would increase by 12 percent as trump has said he wants the agency to prepare for space travel to mars.\n\neven with all the proposed spending cuts, the budget would fail to eliminate the federal deficit over the next 10 years, missing a longtime gop fiscal target. instead, white house officials plan to say their budget proposal would close the deficit by 2035.\n\nbut it would only achieve this if the economy grows at an unprecedented, sustained 3 percent clip through 2025, levels the administration has failed to achieve for even one year so far. the u.s. economy grew 2.3 percent in 2019, the weakest level since trump took office.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nduring trump's first year in office, his advisers said their budget plan would eliminate the deficit by around 2028. this new budget will mark the third consecutive time that they abandon that 10-year goal and instead suggest a 15-year target.\n\nthis new trend shows how little progress the white house is making in dealing with ballooning government debt, something gop party leaders had made a top goal during the obama administration. trump's first budget projected the deficit in 2021 would be $456 billion. instead, it is projected to be more than double that amount.\n\ntrump has shown little interest in dealing with the deficit and debt, though some gop leaders say it remains a priority. the $4.8 trillion budget for 2021 would represent a $700 billion surge over levels from 2018.\n\nad\n\nwhite house officials have blamed congressional democrats for inaction on the federal deficit. however, trump has agreed to increase spending throughout the government because it was the condition on which democrats accepted a higher military budget.\n\ntrump's tax cut was not paid for — by medicare cuts or anything else. (the washington post)\n\nas a presidential candidate, trump said he would eliminate not just the annual federal deficit but all debt held by the united states after eight years in office.\n\ntrying to balance the budget in 10 years is very difficult, so having a longer time horizon makes a lot of sense, said marc goldwein, a senior vice president at the committee for a responsible federal budget, which advocates reducing the deficit. fifteen years is still very aggressive.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe deficit is the gap between spending and revenue, and this year it is projected to breach $1 trillion for the first time since 2012. white house officials are expected to try to emphasize on monday that their budget proposal would make progress toward reducing the deficit by 2030 but not eliminate the gap.\n\ntrump's budget aims to cut spending on safety-net programs such as medicaid and food stamps, cutting food stamp spending by $181 billion over a decade. it proposes to squeeze hundreds of billions of dollars from medicare over a decade through cost-saving proposals such as reforming medical liability and modifying payments to hospitals for uncompensated care.\n\nthe budget cuts medicaid spending by about $920 billion over 10 years, a change democrats and administration critics warn would lead to reductions in benefits and the number of people on the health care program.\n\nad\n\nad\n\na senior administration official defended the cut, noting it reflects a decrease in the rate at which medicaid spending would grow rather than a reduction from current spending levels. the official said the administration would save money on medicaid spending through new work requirements and recouping payments incorrectly spent by the federal government.\n\nliberal economists rejected that argument. this is a budget that would cause many millions of people to lose health care coverage. that is unambiguous, said aviva aron-dine, a former obama official and vice president at the center on budget and policy priorities, a left-leaning think-tank.\n\ndemocrats such as rep. john yarmuth (d-ky.), chairman of the house budget committee, said early reports indicate the budget includes destructive changes … while extending [trump's] tax cuts for millionaires and wealthy corporations.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nduring the last year president barack obama was in office, the deficit was less than $600 billion, but it has grown significantly since then.\n\nthe 2017 gop tax cuts and new domestic spending approved by bipartisan majorities in congress have widened this gap markedly. however, the trump administration's new budget summary contains the line: all administration policies will pay for themselves, including extending tax cut provisions expiring in 2025.\n\nwithout action by congress and the administration, tax cuts for families and individuals would expire at the end of 2025. budget experts have projected that extending those tax cuts would reduce revenue by roughly $1 trillion.\n\nad\n\nthe largest parts of the government's budget are mandatory spending programs that are automatically renewed each year without congressional approval, such as medicare, medicaid and social security. trump said on twitter saturday that the budget will not be touching your social security or medicare. in 2015, he promised not to seek cuts to medicaid as well, but his budgets have routinely sought big medicaid changes that would cut roughly $800 billion from the program over 10 years.\n\nad\n\nthose proposals have not gained traction in congress, however, and trump has not fought for congress to consider the changes as much as he's battled over some of his other priorities.\n\nthe budget is expected to request $2 billion in homeland security spending for the southern border wall — billions less than in past years and billions less than congress has agreed to. however, the administration has siphoned billions more from the pentagon budget ever since declaring a national emergency at the border following last winter's government shutdown.\n\nadministration officials say the wall has moved into a new phase, focused on execution of the project now that funding for it has been secured. the budget document says the administration expects to have completed 400 miles of new border wall by the end of 2020.\n\nad\n\nthe president's budget to fund the wall and border security [comes] with big increases for infrastructure, technology and law enforcement personnel, said a senior administration official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because the budget was not yet released. this request is based on what's required to gain operational control of the border.\n\noverall, the budget proposes 5 percent net cuts in domestic discretionary spending, the category of government spending that covers agencies like hhs and the education department, but does not include social security or medicare.\n\nthese proposed cuts fall well below spending caps that lawmakers and the administration already agreed to in a bipartisan budget deal for 2021. that all but ensures the budget will face bipartisan opposition on capitol hill.
who is that guy? andrew yang's presidential campaign draws crowds, money and an expected spot on the democratic debate stage.: an outsider has been a somewhat below-the-radar phenomenon, with help from social media and podcasts.\n\nyang is running on a platform to provide a universal basic income of $1,000 a month for every american adult. an entrepreneur and tech industry veteran, yang, 44, says he wants to protect the nation from the impending dangers he sees in automation. he has a prominent online following — and has surprised the many who doubted his long-shot run by ticking upward in the polls, qualifying for the third and fourth democratic presidential debates.\n\nclimate change yang's climate plan looks to set incentives for private companies and entrepreneurs to reduce emissions and contribute to renewable technology. he has applauded the vision and the ambition of the green new deal and called for a carbon tax; he has also stressed the importance of ending tax breaks for the fossil fuel industry. he supports building more nuclear power plants, saying on his campaign website that he wants to work to make it easier for new nuclear plants to open up in appropriate areas. yang says that the united states should rejoin the paris climate deal but that it doesn't go far enough in emissions reduction. see all candidates\n\neconomic inequality yang's key campaign proposal is a universal basic income of $1,000 a month for every adult american, which he calls a freedom dividend. he opposes some of his rivals' policies, including the wealth tax (he prefers a value-added tax, like a sales tax that's imposed at each step of production), a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage and a federal jobs guarantee. yang supports a guaranteed paid family leave of at least six months. see all candidates\n\neducation yang has proposals he says would keep down the cost of higher education, including rules on administrator-student ratios and maximum annual increase in costs. he also proposes the creation of a new university in ohio, funded by a portion of large university endowments. yang said he would work with states to improve teacher pay. see all candidates\n\nforeign policy yang supports pulling u.s. troops out of afghanistan but wouldn't commit to having them out by the end of his first term. he's open to engaging with syria and north korea. yang said he would consider keeping some tariffs on china, limited to targeting areas of bad acting, such as intellectual property theft. he also said he'd rejoin the iran nuclear deal and then negotiate a longer-term agreement. see all candidates\n\ngovernment although yang supports keeping the electoral college, he also calls for implementing ranked-choice voting, which lets voters number their choices and demands a majority, not just a plurality, from a winner. he's open to eliminating the legislative filibuster in the senate and to changing the makeup of the supreme court. see all candidates\n\nhealth care yang has called for moving toward a single-payer system to provide universal coverage but said he would not eliminate private insurance, expecting a public option to out-compete companies. he said he supports the spirit of medicare-for-all but that swiftly reformatting 18 percent of our economy and eliminating private insurance for millions of americans is not a realistic strategy. under a government-run plan, yang would allow undocumented immigrants who are on a path to citizenship to be covered. he also supports granting medicare the same drug-price-bargaining powers that medicaid has. see all candidates
he's not going to apologize for eking out a victory over philadelphia's third-string quarterback, who was inserted in the fourth quarter. he's not going to apologize for narrowly beating a team that was without more than a dozen key players.\n\napparently, that's what everybody wants me to do, is apologize for winning, rivera said monday morning after washington defeated philadelphia, 20-14, to clinch the nfc east. i'm not going to, because you play the game as it's set up. nobody complained when pittsburgh did what they did last night against cleveland. i mean, come on, this is just the way it is. we got in the playoffs. we're 7-9. i've been 7-8-1 in the playoffs. i was on an 8-8 team that was in the playoffs. and you don't apologize for getting into the playoffs.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nyou apologize for losing in the playoffs, or at least i believe you do. but you don't apologize for getting in.\n\nafter starting the season 1-5, with a young quarterback projected to become the franchise's future, washington has completed a turnaround that, even on paper, seems incomprehensible. it played four quarterbacks, found the most success with the one who returned from a life-threatening leg injury, watched its coach battle cancer as well as the franchise's recent history of losing and turmoil, lost veteran starters to injuries, took fliers on unproven players and tested its roster's depth to find gems for the future.\n\nand there were times over the past few weeks when even rivera worried that the injuries and critical losses would knock washington out of playoff contention — just as it had reached the doorstep.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ni mean, we played two games without our starting quarterback [alex smith], without our best wide receiver [terry mclaurin], without our best running back [antonio gibson] healthy, and honestly nobody cared, rivera said. that's the truth. nobody cared two weeks ago, and nobody cared a week ago. and so the concern was there. alex came in and did what we hoped alex would do, and lo and behold, we got into the playoffs. but, yeah, i was concerned, to be honest with you.\n\nrivera said his team arrived in philadelphia playing with house money — few, if anyone, believed at the start of the season it would make it this far. but only a chance was needed, he reminded. why not us? he asked.\n\nit doesn't surprise me based on the strong personalities that we have on this team, starting with our coaches and then our players, he said monday, citing smith and mclaurin as well as young pass rushers chase young and montez sweat and veterans ryan kerrigan and brandon scherff among the team's many positive examples.  … when you have those kinds of guys that are helping to hold it together, hold guys accountable, hold themselves accountable — that's big. that's huge.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbut after his team's victory sunday, he painted washington's improbable leap in year 1 with him at the helm as only the first step of many in his vision for a franchise-wide culture change.\n\nwaiting atop the next step is tom brady, the most successful quarterback in football whose career started when many of washington's foundational players were toddlers. washington will host the tampa bay buccaneers in an nfc first-round playoff game at 8:15 p.m. saturday while still uncertain about the health of some of its key players.\n\nsmith, who admitted his calf strain worsened throughout sunday's game, was visibly limited in the second half, when he threw two interceptions.\n\nad\n\nthe biggest thing is because we have a system, and the three quarterbacks we have i think are all interchangeable in their abilities, rivera said.  … we'll have one game plan. these guys will work on it. if alex can go, alex will go. if alex can give us one quarter, two quarters, three, whatever, that's great. if not, i believe taylor [heinicke] will be ready. if something happens, i believe steven [montez] will be ready. … until i get a chance to find out where alex is, i can't really predict anything. whatever the situation is, we'll play.\n\nad\n\nmclaurin played roughly 80 percent of the team's offensive snaps and caught a touchdown pass. how much the wear and tear of playing will affect his high-ankle sprain will be determined throughout the week.\n\ni'm pretty confident that he'll be a little further along than he was last week, rivera said. we should have a couple good days of practice, so i do anticipate seeing him out there in a limited role and taking specific reps more so than anything else. we'll have a plan for terry, as we'll have for alex, as we'll have for antonio gibson as well.\n\nad\n\nuntil then, rivera will not apologize for the regular season finale, choosing instead to focus on his team's next chance, against brady and the bucs. few expected washington to make it this far, and as rivera has clung to myriad sayings and mantras, he has held one especially close.
one year ends, a new one starts and change begins. last year was dry, in rainfall terms, but the first three days of 2017 have been wet. tuesday, a time of umbrellas and boots, was the second rainiest day here in more than three months.\n\nmonday, with its hours of light rain and drizzle, left .35 inches of water in the gauges at reagan national airport.\n\non tuesday, even more of the same created a total for the day of .86 inches.\n\nsince oct. 1, only dec. 6 had more rain, 1.03 inches.\n\nlast year's precipitation at national came to 31.70 inches, more than 20 percent below normal.\n\nbut in its first three days, this has been an achieving year in terms of atmospheric liquidity, with a total of 1.21 inches. that is more than four times as much as usually is measured in washington in the first three days of a year.\n\nearly rainfall does not mean a wet year, but neither can it be said to spell more drought. it is also reasonable to wonder whether it is saying anything about the prospects for snow.
bloomberg's campaign has been shadowed by criticism that as mayor he was insensitive to racial issues, including a highly controversial stop-and-frisk policy that he renounced last year. sunday's speech was notable for its sweeping pledges of direct aid to black voters and its laments about america's racial violence.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbloomberg bluntly acknowledged the advantages he received as a white businessman through his career, a departure from his typical description of himself as the embodiment of the american dream who had succeeded through hard work and skill. born to a working-class family, bloomberg is now worth more than $50 billion.\n\nas someone who has been very lucky in life, i often say my story would only have been possible in america — and i think that's true, he said to a crowd of hundreds who overflowed into a nearby room. but i also know that my story might have turned out very differently if i had been black, and that more black americans of my generation would have ended up with far more wealth had they been white.\n\nhe cited generations of discrimination in education, housing, employment and other areas that has held back black americans, joining a chorus of democratic presidential candidates who have similarly promised to make black economic empowerment a priority in the white house.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nto address the legacy of these injustices, bloomberg said he would go beyond modern-day ­attempts to legislate equal rights and would provide direct support for those who have historically suffered from discrimination. he would set a goal to help 1 million black families buy a home, nearly double the number of black-owned businesses and triple the net worth of the typical black family, which currently owns one-tenth as much as the typical white family.\n\nwithout explaining how he would pay for the plans, his campaign also announced a $70 billion program that would focus on ameliorating racial and economic inequality in 100 communities around the country. like other democratic candidates, bloomberg supports studying the concept of federal reparations for descendants of slaves, but has not endorsed any specific plan, his advisers said.\n\nbloomberg's unconventional path to the white house depends on attracting moderate and affluent white suburban voters as well as gaining significant support from black voters who now largely back former vice president joe biden. bloomberg has a long way to go among both black voters and the broader democratic electorate, according to current polls, which place him in fifth place nationally among all of the party's voters.\n\nad\n\nad\n\na recent washington post-ipsos poll showed him with 4 percent support of the black vote, well behind biden, who had 48 percent support, and sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.), who had 20 percent. sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.) registered 9 percent support with the group, and former south bend, ind., mayor pete buttigieg continued to trail with 2 percent among african americans.\n\nnearly half of black voters in the poll had no opinion of bloomberg or had never heard of him. of those who did hold an opinion, more had a favorable view than an unfavorable one.\n\nin recent weeks, bloomberg has received a number of high-profile endorsements from state and local black leaders, and his campaign schedule has been anchored by visits to majority nonwhite cities — little rock, ark.; jackson, miss.; stockton, calif.; and memphis, to name a few. in effect, bloomberg is seeking to counteract questions about his racial record by showing support from black leaders who know him, either through his stint as mayor or his activist and philanthropic donations.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nlast year, his campaign responded to an open letter to democratic presidential candidates written by four black southern mayors — including columbia, s.c., mayor stephen benjamin, a co-chair of the bloomberg campaign — outlining priorities they urged the candidates to embrace.\n\nour administration will turn the usual relationship between cities and washington — with the cities coming to the capital with tin cup in hand — upside down, bloomberg wrote on dec. 30. we will invest in progress that can be driven from the ground up.\n\ndespite his past support for unpopular policies such as stop-and-frisk policing, bloomberg aggressively courted black and latino voters in his three successful mayoral campaigns in new york city. stop-and-frisk is a policy of briefly searching individuals in an effort to prevent crime, but it has been criticized as encouraging police to inappropriately target minorities.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbloomberg outperformed former mayor rudolph w. giuliani's previous support among blacks in his 2001 campaign, according to exit polls, and he won the support of nearly half of black voters in 2005. when he faced a black democratic challenger in 2009, bloomberg received about 1 in 4 black votes.\n\nkenneth chenault, the former chairman and ceo of american express, said in an interview he had watched bloomberg, a longtime friend, educate himself about the nation's history of racial discrimination and shift his positions.\n\npart of the job of a leader is to define reality. and mike is defining the reality of the african american experience in this country and he is acknowledging the very important disparities, said chenault, who is black. but what i think is very important is he is providing the hope part, in terms of what is the game plan to bring about fundamental change.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin the speech sunday afternoon, bloomberg expressed shock that he only learned the details of the 1921 riot in the tulsa's greenwood neighborhood last year. he subsequently awarded a $1 million grant through his philanthropic arm to pay for a public art project to commemorate the event.\n\nthe tulsa riot, which occurred at a time of elevated racial tension in the city, began with an unverified and likely baseless claim in the tulsa tribune that a black shoe-shiner had tried to rape a white elevator operator, according to the oklahoma historical society. a subsequent editorial in the paper was headlined, to lynch negro tonight.\n\nad\n\nthe assault by a white mob that followed destroyed more than 1,000 homes and businesses in a relatively prosperous middle class neighborhood in the city. hundreds of black residents were arrested, and between 50 and 300 blacks were killed.\n\nad\n\ni remember thinking: how is it possible that high schools and colleges don't teach this? bloomberg said in the speech. but as i came to understand: it wasn't just greenwood. how many of us were taught in school about east st. louis in 1917, when a white mob killed more than two dozen black americans? or elaine, arkansas, in 1919, when a white mob slaughtered 200 black sharecroppers who dared to join a labor union? or rosewood, florida, in 1923, when a white mob burned the whole town down?\n\nbloomberg cast the horror of those events as a feature of the black experience in the united states that cannot be ignored.\n\nad\n\nfor black americans, there was nothing that white landowners, businesses, banks and politicians might not take: their wages and their homes, their businesses and their wealth, their votes and their power, and even their lives, he said.\n\nad\n\nbloomberg joins a growing shift of democratic candidates to more directly address historical racism at a time when the parties are ever more divided by race, with a growing percentage of the democratic electorate comprised of voters of color.\n\nwarren has promised $7 billion in grants for nonwhite entrepreneurs, more money for historically black schools and a large down-payment assistance program for people who live in communities that banks historically declined to serve.\n\nbuttigieg has issued a douglass plan on racial justice, including policies that attempt to triple the number of black entrepreneurs and regulations that would encourage diversity among teachers.\n\nalong with a $2.5 trillion housing plan, sanders has proposed a commission to establish relief for victims of bank discrimination. biden has highlighted environmental and health plans for communities of color, as well as increased funding for historically black education, but has so far stopped short of releasing housing or wealth plans specific to black americans.\n\nbefore the speech, bloomberg attended services at the vernon ame church, which is located in the greenwood neighborhood. the congregation's building was destroyed in the 1921 race riot, and members rebuilt at the current location seven years later.\n\nin a fiery sermon, pastor robert turner praised bloomberg for putting his actions behind his words by coming to the church and donating money last year to commemorate the 1921 riot. he contrasted bloomberg with what he called the hypocrisy of the broader nation, which he said has not yet given reparations to descendants of slaves or otherwise come to turns with the legacy of racism.
change the due dates for your bills. sometimes you have enough money coming in to pay all of your monthly expenses, but your paychecks don't match up with the due dates for your bills, said rachel schneider, co-author of the financial diaries, a book to be published in march about the detailed money habits of 235 households . try asking your creditors to see if they'll change your due date so that it will fall closer to your payday, schneider said. say you get paid twice a month, but your biggest bills, such as your rent and car payment, are both due at the beginning of the month. some credit card companies, utility providers or other creditors may be willing to let you change your due date or billing cycle to give your wallet some breathing room.\n\nnegotiate for a better deal. chances are that your wireless provider or your cable company are not going to call you up when they have lower rates available, said sue rogan, director of financial education for the maryland cash campaign, a group that works to help people become financially stable. you need to reach out to them, she said. call your cable, internet or cellphone provider roughly once a year to make sure you're getting the best rate possible, especially if you notice that your monthly bill increased. do some research on what competitors are charging and ask if they will match those rates for you. if they decline, you would at least know that there are other companies offering better deals.\n\ntreat yourself. (you read that right.) budgeting can be a lot like dieting — if you deprive yourself too much, you may be tempted to binge and undo a lot of your progress, financial experts say. it may be easier to stick to your saving goals if you work in treats and splurges that are important to you, says jonathan morduch, co-author of the financial diaries. that might be a monthly dinner with friends, a trip to the movie theater with the kids or the occasional happy hour. if you budget for splurges, the sacrifices you make everyday — such as having a sad desk salad for lunch — can feel a lot less painful.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nset a modest savings goal. if the traditional financial advice of saving enough to cover three to six months worth of expenses feels impossible, you should set a more modest goal. one month of savings, just one month, can be really really powerful, morduch said. having enough savings to cover roughly one month of expenses can still help families avoid costs such as overdraft fees and payday loans when emergencies arise, morduch said.\n\nand even if that goal seems too out of reach, start by saving what you think you can afford, schneider said. for some people, that may mean saving only $1 a day. don't get overly fixated on the benchmark, just do it, she said. some people may want to look into apps such as digit or acorns that can help automate the saving process. it can also help to set aside cash when a large windfall comes in, such as your tax refund to help with your savings goals, morduch said.\n\ntrack your spending. the word budget can make a lot of people cringe, said carlos moreno, a financial specialist at empath, a group in boston that helps people find a way out of poverty. but it becomes easier to manage your money once you know where your cash is going, he said. many consumers think they know how much they're spending on regular expenses such as groceries, but they are often surprised after they track their costs more closely, rogan said.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nsome third-party websites such as mint.com, you need a budget and others can help you track your cash flow. some people might prefer to sit down once a week and do the math themselves by reviewing their online statements. no matter the method, the point is to scan your spending to make sure it lines up with your expectations. also, look for any areas you may be able to cut back, rogan said.
supporters of sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.) at a caucus monday in des moines. (charlie neibergall/ap)\n\nwhat makes the iowa caucuses unique, besides serving as an inadvertent software beta-testing laboratory, is that they include voters' second picks in their calculus.\n\nyou'll remember how the caucuses work. those in attendance show up and stand with other supporters of the same candidate. if there aren't enough supporters of that candidate to hit a required threshold, those supporters need to lure other voters to their fold or go support someone else. usually, it's the latter option that occurs, and caucus-goers settle on a candidate other than the one they first supported.\n\nit can be hard to tell how that realignment worked across all of the precincts that held caucuses monday. in many precincts, supporters of multiple candidates were forced to change their minds and pick new candidates, but they often didn't all choose the same one. we know how many caucus-goers shifted away from former vice president joe biden among the precincts for which we have data, for example — about 2,400 — but we don't necessarily know where they went.\n\nexcept in places where we do. there are some precincts where biden was the only candidate to lose supporters, according to the data from the iowa democratic party. in those places, we can see which candidates benefited. if we apply that same calculus for all of the candidates in the mix in iowa — looking at precincts where only one candidate lost supporters — we can get an admittedly limited picture of how support shifted.\n\nit looks like this, with the candidates losing supporters listed vertically and those gaining support listed from left to right.\n\nthe biggest overall shift was from businessman andrew yang to former south bend, ind., mayor pete buttigieg. forty-seven yang supporters — not many! — identified buttigieg as their second choice. more on those two in a second.\n\nthere are interesting flows among the front-runners, too. about half of those forced to a second choice after initially supporting sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) moved to supporting sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.). but warren supporters pushed to another choice were about as likely to back buttigieg as sanders. sen. amy klobuchar (d-minn.) also did decently among those who had originally backed warren. klobuchar's supporters went mostly to biden and buttigieg. biden's also went mostly to buttigieg.\n\nyou see the pattern there: over and over, buttigieg was the second choice of choice, so to speak. tallying losses and gains across the field, buttigieg gained the most support as a second pick, followed by klobuchar. yang saw the biggest erosion of support — and didn't gain much support as a second pick.\n\ncandidate lost gained biden 68 83 buttigieg 30 179 gabbard 5 0 klobuchar 82 107 sanders 74 98 steyer 32 5 warren 120 78 yang 194 12\n\nthe data above, while representing only a sliver of what happened in iowa, seems to shed quite a bit of light. sanders had the most initial support in the caucuses, according to the limited data that has been released. but buttigieg leads in the calculus of how support translates into delegates. part of that is a function of where his support was distributed. part of it, too, is that he gained ground between the first choice and the final realignment. as of writing, sanders went from 24.4 percent support to 26.2 percent support between the two tallies. buttigieg jumped from 21.4 percent to 25.2 percent.\n\nthis doesn't do buttigieg much good in new hampshire, where the primary is a straightforward tally of votes. but it does suggest that buttigieg may have an edge moving forward if he remains the no. 2 choice for voters, as their first choices might give up on seeking the nomination.\n\nyang, on the other hand, might be justified in being a bit nervous.
when buttigieg took the microphone, he was forced to yell, doing his best to deliver his message without showing frustration that no one in a room full of black dignitaries seemed to want to hear it. when former vice president joe biden took the same stage later that afternoon, the room was raucous at his arrival, then rapt for his remarks.\n\nad\n\nthe episode captured the irony, and ultimately the downfall, of buttigieg's meteoric campaign. in an age of identity and representation, buttigieg, a married gay man, presented himself as a longtime outsider, one who understood what it meant to be shunned and who promised a politics of inclusion. but buttigieg could never convince african americans, a pillar of the democratic coalition and a group for whom representation has moved to the center of public discussion, that he understood their experience or how to fight for their rights.\n\nhe had more broad appeal in those early, mostly white states than any of the other candidates, said dan pfeiffer, a former adviser to then-president barack obama. but ultimately, he was never able to make any gains with nonwhite parts of the electorate. and there's no path to the democratic nomination and the presidency that doesn't include that.\n\nperhaps the greatest legacy of buttigieg's run is to broaden the nation's vision of the role of gay americans in the nation's political life, as the most successful openly gay presidential candidate ever grew increasingly open about his marriage and his struggles with his sexuality as the months went by.\n\nyet he found himself sunday in his hometown of south bend, ind., the city where his struggles with racial issues as mayor earned detractors and supporters, telling supporters that the path has narrowed to a close.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin the end, buttigieg appealed to enough voters to vault into serious contention but not enough to lift him higher. he built an improbably broad base that was not broad enough, and when the primary moved to more diverse states, he simply could not keep up.\n\nbuttigieg launched his presidential exploratory committee on jan. 23, 2019, with a video in which he wore a flannel shirt and sweater, his hair not yet as tightly cropped as it would be by the time he announced he would be leaving the race. the unmistakable flecks of gray hadn't bubbled up there yet. his face wasn't quite as gaunt.\n\nlater that day, curious reporters packed a conference room at the holiday inn in downtown washington, peppering buttigieg with questions about whether his candidacy implied he felt the older generation wasn't ready to handle the moment, about what being gay might mean to it all.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe same question seemed to underscore all of it: are you serious?\n\nbuttigieg was serious about trying — that much was clear. from the start, he pitched himself as a unique messenger for a new message: the rise of president trump had exposed the old ways of operating as flawed and unsustainable. a young mayor from the midwest might just be the person to handle what lies ahead — and in a field that included senators, former mayors and a former vice president, buttigieg wanted a chance.\n\nhe got more than that, outlasting senators, governors and others far more seasoned.\n\nhe's a very talented messenger with a very sophisticated understanding of how you communicate in this environment, pfeiffer said. his omnipresence in the media is something democrats can learn a lot from. . . . he ensured he was always part of the conversation.\n\nthat strategy, built by communications director lis smith, allowed buttigieg to rise to prominence in a field that didn't seem likely to have much room for someone like him. along the way, it underlined a key point about politics in the trump era: even without experience, money or organization, if a candidate — even an un­or­tho­dox one — knows how to play the media, he can catapult to prominence.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nas early favorites such as sens. kamala d. harris (d-calif.) and elizabeth warren (d-mass.) built multistate organizations, buttigieg and his husband, chasten, along with smith and another staffer, max harris, would pile into the car, drive west from south bend, and try to find iowans willing to listen to buttigieg.\n\nthe whole thing seemed like a lark to seasoned political analysts; buttigieg was 37, barely old enough to be president, and he had never even held statewide office. that changed on march 10, when buttigieg took the stage for his first nationally televised town hall on cnn. within the buttigieg campaign, staffers later referred to it simply as the cnn town hall, although he had since conducted many others.\n\nsomething about his delivery, his profile and his demeanor sparked nationwide interest. boyish and eloquent, buttigieg seemed simultaneously to answer some democrats' urgent desire for an anti-trump and their long-standing hunger for candidates who are fresh-faced and rhetorically agile, like john f. kennedy and obama.\n\nthat night also provided a moment of trailblazing, when buttigieg joked with cnn host jake tapper that he and his husband seemed to disagree on how to pronounce his last name. an openly gay presidential candidate had talked about his husband on national television as if it were nothing.\n\nthat husband, chasten, would emerge as something of a cult hero for buttigieg supporters, who often clamored for pictures with him. an active twitter account and numerous personal appearances showcased chasten's earnest, often humorous style.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nchasten had sat through buttigieg's speeches before. but after the cnn town hall, he and his husband were headed for something on a much different scale.\n\npolitical analyst david axelrod recalled hearing almost immediately from two donors asking how they could get in touch with buttigieg. by the end of the month, democratic megadonor susie tompkins buell had agreed to host a fundraiser for buttigieg.\n\nat the time, his campaign staff was just trying to push buttigieg within striking distance of the donor count needed to qualify for the debate stage. within 24 hours, he had reached a third of the 65,000 donor threshold. two days later, his campaign announced it had reached 55,000 individual donors.\n\nad\n\nthis thrust buttigieg into a whirlwind of attention and travel that spat him out in los angeles a week later, where he sat in the back of a black suv headed through west hollywood on his way to shake hands with stars such as greg louganis and billy eichner. buttigieg said that day he didn't think the rigors of campaigning for the presidency would require much of an adjustment, but he admitted, i don't love repeating myself.\n\nad\n\nbuttigieg would spend most of the next few months repeating himself, in television interviews and magazine sit-downs, on cnn town halls and sunday shows. from the earliest days of buttigieg's bid, mike schmuhl, a longtime friend turned campaign manager, acknowledged it was a long shot.\n\nmost people do not equate mayor of a town in flyover country as presidential material, but pete is special, schmuhl said then. once people get to know pete, they are intrigued, interested, supportive right out of the gate.\n\nad\n\nif the idea was to get as many people as possible to know him, buttigieg had a good person to help: smith. as frenetic as buttigieg was steady, as prone to expletives as buttigieg was averse to them, and as intolerant of stillness as buttigieg was dedicated to it, smith always seemed like an unlikely partner.\n\nad\n\nbut in the first months of his candidacy — and, as it happened, the last months, as well — smith made sure buttigieg was booked on every television show possible. he sneaked calls to broadcast stations on almost every drive, took reporters with him from one event to another, and talked to local cameras whenever they would have him.\n\nso the man who started the campaign without the hefty email lists of his competitors, almost entirely unknown to nonpolitical junkies, raised nearly $25 million in the second quarter of 2019.\n\nad\n\nwith money came staff and the need to scale his operation in less than half the time of some of his competitors. his iowa state director hit the ground in the first days of may. by september, the campaign was opening 20 offices in the state in 20 days. the buttigieg campaign had to find what talent was left in other early states, too.\n\nad\n\nsoon, new hampshire, south carolina and nevada operations sprung up, as well. he hired senior adviser and key strategist michael halle — one of the architects behind buttigieg's delegate strategy — in july. by august, he had a deputy campaign manager, hari sevugan.\n\nbut summer also brought tragedy — and with it, the kind of scrutiny buttigieg had largely avoided. in south bend, an unarmed black man named eric logan was shot and killed by a white police offer.\n\nbuttigieg left the trail and headed home, where he was confronted by anguished south bend natives arguing he hadn't taken the proper steps to console logan's family, nor to eradicate the systemic racism and bias that provided the backdrop. black residents of south bend shouted at him during a contentious town hall.\n\nthe south bend chapter of black lives matter began protesting buttigieg. national publications dug into his record on issues of race in south bend, and they found he had struggled to diversify its police force. a national narrative coalesced: black voters did not like buttigieg.\n\nad\n\nmore broadly, the shooting raised a crucial question: was buttigieg, a young, white, harvard-educated man from indiana, the right candidate to lead a diverse party? more to the point: could he really empathize with the black experience?\n\nsome argued that buttigieg was being unfairly painted as racially insensitive.\n\ni do know how it got started — the shooting and the town hall meeting, said gladys muhammad, a black south bend native who stumped on buttigieg's behalf. those of us who were not involved and just in the community, we decided not to speak. we decided to let the grass-roots people voice their concerns because they needed to be heard. we wanted that to happen. as angry as they were, they needed to say what they needed to say. we stepped back and didn't say anything.\n\nyet buttigieg continued to struggle to find answers to questions about race. when he said being gay helped him understand the importance of tolerance and acceptance, it provoked a backlash from those who argued he was equating two very different experiences.\n\nso even as white voters in iowa and new hampshire took to buttigieg, it became increasingly clear that he was winning almost no support among african americans in more diverse states.\n\nhis aides crossed their fingers, hoping success in iowa and new hampshire might convince a wider range of voters that buttigieg could win, could lead democrats to their urgent goal of unseating trump.\n\nbut buttigieg's stunning win in iowa got muddled in a way that some of his staffers think derailed the plan entirely. buttigieg took to a des moines stage and declared victory, but because of a disastrous series of glitches, it took days for the results to be finalized and buttigieg to be proved right.\n\nprivately, his advisers point to that as a key pivot point in buttigieg's campaign. instead of delivering a triumphant victory speech on national television to a party eager for a savior, he was slammed for declaring victory prematurely. instead of a week of coverage of his triumph, outlets focused on the reporting debacle.\n\nby the time the focus shifted to new hampshire, sen. amy klobuchar (d-minn.) was staging her brief but important rise: buttigieg advisers felt her surprise third-place finish there cost buttigieg a victory, as well as precious attention. he lost to sen. bernie sanders by less than two percentage points, falling short of would have been a stunning victory in the backyard of the independent from vermont.\n\nalong the way, younger, more liberal democrats progressives often saw him as a compromise. they felt he relied too much on high-dollar fundraisers to be trusted to change the system. they watched him struggle to amass minority support. and they felt his medicare for all who want it plan, his sliding scale for college tuition relief, and his relatively less expensive plan to combat climate change didn't go far enough.\n\nhe finished third in nevada, garnering just 2 percent support among black voters. not long after voting ended in south carolina, buttigieg's aides checked their polling models and realized he probably would fare poorly.\n\nhis senior advisers told him what they saw, knowing buttigieg wouldn't linger if the prognosis wasn't good. he didn't, and was out of the race less than 24 hours later, the upstart candidate so many democrats said they were waiting for who couldn't quite transform into the unifying force they were hoping for.\n\nchasten buttigieg was the first to take the stage sunday in south bend when buttigieg dropped out. he fought back tears as he told the crowd about the day his husband came home from work and asked him what he thought about running for president.\n\ni laughed, chasten said. not at him. just at life.\n\nsoon after, he turned things over to his husband, the first openly gay candidate to win delegates in a primary, a candidate who fared so well that he pushed out of mind notions of just how improbable his success was.\n\nsunday's announcement is hardly a conclusive end to his political career. if buttigieg were to run for president in 2056, after all, he would be younger than biden is now.
in a nutshell\n\nperson-to-person close contact is widely considered the dominant mode of infection, because those infected expel droplets carrying virus particles when they speak, sing or just breathe normally. hence the advice to keep your distance. there are other pathways which are considered less common. scientists have implicated smaller particles called aerosols, which can float farther and for longer, adding to evidence that suggests good ventilation and face masks reduce the risk of infection. all such particles can contaminate surfaces when they land, creating fomites. people who touch the fomite can transfer virus particles to their own nose, mouth or eye and become infected. frequent and thorough hand washing and cleaning of high-touch items like doorknobs mitigate that risk. standard disinfectants kill the virus, as do sunlight and other sources of ultraviolet light.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nsome scientists use a swiss cheese model to illustrate how several layers or defenses are needed to minimize opportunities for the virus to find a new host.\n\nhere's a more detailed look at these individual pathways.\n\nclose contact\n\nspending at least 15 minutes near an infected person, or even briefer periods with someone who is coughing or sneezing, is risky because they are spewing virus-laden particles. living with other people increases the prospect of prolonged, high-intensity interaction, and that makes households and other residential settings, such as nursing homes and prisons, among the most likely places for sars-cov-2 infections to occur.\n\nad\n\nthe u.s. centers for disease control and prevention recommends a distance of at least 6 feet, which is roughly how far such droplets usually can fly. the world health organization says at least 1 meter (3 feet, 4 inches) and an even greater distance indoors. public health authorities also recommend people wash their hands frequently and forgo shaking hands, hugging and kissing. infected people may be most contagious a day or two before starting to feel sick, and they may continue to be infectious as long as 15 days after symptoms emerge. people who experience very mild or no symptoms may also transmit sars-cov-2, which is why testing has been promoted as a way of detecting hidden carriers, who need to be isolated until they are no longer contagious and monitored for symptoms.\n\nad\n\nfor households with a suspected or confirmed case of infection, doctors suggest keeping that person separated from others as much as possible and cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces in common areas -- such as switches, tables and remotes -- daily. where people are crowded together, such as on buses and subways, health authorities across the world are telling them to cover their faces. if medical masks are in short supply, many suggest using home-made versions.\n\nwhile humans are the biggest source of sars-cov-2, some pets, farm animals, zoo exhibits and bats are susceptible to the infection. health authorities say there's no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus, however, and consider the risk of them doing so to be low.\n\nad\n\ninhaled particles\n\nwhile the biggest respiratory droplets fall to the ground fast, aerosols can be carried farther and stay aloft longer, especially if they attach to other fine particles such as dust and pollution. their small size increases the odds of them being inhaled deep into the lungs of a bystander, which can cause a more severe infection. a cough can disperse virus particles 4-to-5 meters and a sneeze can project them as far as 8 meters away, depending on humidity, temperature and airflow. speaking loudly is also associated with increased particle emissions.\n\nad\n\nindoor environments without adequate ventilation or air filtration exacerbate the spread of virus-laden particles. nightclubs, bars, restaurants, exercise classes, call centers, and choir practice -- where people are crammed together in a confined space -- have spawned clusters of cases. cold and stale air in meat-packing plants can also be hazardous, as can intensive-care units where patients may be undergoing certain procedures and treatments including inserting and removing airway tubes. the use of face masks, especially the more protective type known as n95 respirators, and ventilation systems that change the air at least 12 times an hour have been found to mitigate airborne transmission.\n\nad\n\ninfectious particles on surfaces, clothing, and other objects may also become airborne if they are agitated, making walking on a contaminated floor or removing contaminated clothing a potential risk. since the virus can invade the gastrointestinal track and be shed in fecal matter, there is also potential risk that the virus might spread via aerosols generated by toilet-flushing and trapped air in sewage pipes and drain traps. in guangzhou, china, viral traces were detected in the bathroom of a vacant apartment directly above one where five people had been confirmed as having covid-19, and airflow and dispersal experiments found the pathogen may have wafted upward through drain pipes after a toilet was flushed.\n\nfomites\n\nad\n\nalthough there are no specific reports directly demonstrating fomite transmission, the who considers this a likely pathway, given consistent findings about environmental contamination in the vicinity of cases of infection. a study published in october found a person was infected by touching an elevator button that had been contaminated by virus-laden snot on the same day. the virus can be highly stable in favorable environments, lingering for weeks in cool temperatures on solid surfaces, such as glass and banknotes. some scientists have hypothesized that that characteristic makes sars-cov-2 more difficult to control in the winter than summer. that's a feature of other coronaviruses and respiratory viruses. transmission of sars-cov-2 through feces or urine hasn't been proven, though it may be relevant in areas with poor sanitation.\n\nad\n\ncovid-19 outbreaks have occurred in meat-processing plants or those preparing ready-made meals, but virus transmission via contaminated food or packaging is contested. the chinese center for disease control and prevention in october detected potentially infectious, or active, virus on a package of frozen cod that had been handled by two port workers in qingdao who tested positive five days later. the finding suggested they may have gotten infected from the package, although that wasn't confirmed. experiments with salmon indicate the virus can survive up to eight days in the cold-chain conditions used to export fish, scientists in china said in a report ahead of publication and peer review. those results, which match laboratory experiments conducted in singapore, support the chinese government's rationale for testing imported meat, packaging and containers and blocking goods deemed potentially infectious. no live virus had been isolated out of almost 3 million samples tested until the qingdao case. only 22 came back positive as of mid-september, but none was suspected of posing an infection risk. the who has said transmission by such means is highly unlikely, but recommends people who handle food practice good hygiene, including frequently cleaning and disinfecting work surfaces, to minimize the risk of contamination. dale fisher, an infectious-diseases physician in singapore who has studied the durability of the sars-cov-2 virus, has said that, although infections from contaminated food and packaging may be freakish events, the scale of the global food trade increases the chances of them occurring in settings where large volumes of potentially contaminated goods are handled. that's in contrast to supermarket shelves, which don't represent an infectious hazard.\n\n(adds social media

under lopes, working within former manager dusty baker's aggressive mind-set, the nationals stole the third-most bases in the national league last year — 108, thanks in large part to the contributions of trea turner. the year before they stole the fifth-most bases (121) in the national league, also due in part to turner and an organization-wide emphasis on increasing contact and athleticism. how will that emphasis, and the nationals' recent propensity for theft, change in a post-lopes era, with new manager dave martinez leading the way?\n\nwhile the nationals stole 229 bases over the last two seasons — a mark that would have been even higher had turner not missed months with a broken wrist last year — the joe maddon-led (and by extension, martinez-led) chicago cubs stole 128 (62 in 2017 and 66 in 2016). that disparity results mostly from maddon's well-documented, clearly spoken aversion to pushing the issue on the bases. will martinez be the same?\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmartinez hasn't spoken much about the run game, and has no managerial track record of his own to analyze. his first base coach, tim bogar, will probably emphasize different responsibilities than lopes did.\n\nmy job is to make sure they're prepared when they get to first base to get to second base, bogar said. it's not my decision whether to tell them to go or not. it's just so if they do have an opportunity, i'm there as a resource for them.\n\nturner seemed to think little would change when he spoke to reporters in december, though in fairness, he had yet to have any significant conversations with anyone involved.\n\n[bogar] basically told me, whatever works for me, he'll help me and we'll communicate with that. i haven't talked to him much more than that, turner said. but i think it's just a matter of being confident. i think that's one thing i took away from [lopes]. he was always running no matter what, and he got mad at you if you didn't. i've told you guys that time and time again. it goes a long way, and i think that's kind of what i'm taking away from him, his aggression and confidence.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nexactly how much the nationals front office will dictate the state of their run game remains to be seen, but martinez is taking over an organization whose priorities recently shifted. over the last two to three seasons, nationals general manager mike rizzo and his staff have tried to make the nationals a more contact-heavy, athletic offense that can push the issue in multiple ways, instead of sitting back and waiting for big swings.\n\nwith turner at the top of the order, and adam eaton returning from injury, the nationals have two proven base stealers at the top of the lineup. michael a. taylor, who seems likely to be the every day center fielder, is a 20-20 candidate. wilmer difo, who will fill in for daniel murphy until murphy's knee heals — and will likely spell him at second base more often than he did last year for the same reason — is as speedy as anyone but turner. the nationals' up-and-coming young outfielders, such as victor robles, also boast elite speed. the manager has changed. the organizational philosophy, as implemented by those building the roster, hasn't.\n\nsure, the nationals' only free agent signing of the offseason — hulking first baseman matt adams — doesn't exactly fit the speed-and-contact mold, but neither did the man he is replacing, adam lind. matt wieters is another who bucks that self-imposed trend, but he was an uncharacteristic signing, made more out of opportunity than as part of the initial plan. the nationals' interest in athletic miami marlins catcher j.t. realmuto, and affinity for young, relatively speedy pedro severino, shows a lean toward agility, even at a position rarely known for containing much of it.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nso martinez inherits a lineup built to run, with elite speed at three positions (left, center, shortstop) and in utility man wilmer difo, and strong speed in bryce harper and anthony rendon. harper seems unlikely to risk injury in his all-important contract year, but he has the ability to take the extra base in big moments. rendon can run, too, though his moves on the bases will likely be dictated more by where he's hitting in the lineup.\n\neither way, despite coming from an organization decidedly unconcerned with aggressive base running and stolen bases, martinez likely won't slow the nationals much this season. the roster is built to gain advantages on the bases, and to the extent its members are willing to impose this desire on a rookie manager, their front office will probably want to seize every advantage the nationals can get.\n\nread more on the nationals:\n\nad
the idea was raised in an internal metro report in may as one way the transit agency could increase ridership, noting that subways in san francisco, new york and atlanta allow people to bring bikes on trains at all times.\n\nad\n\nwe believe this change supports ridership growth, metro chief operating officer joe leader said in the release.\n\nad\n\nthe move was hailed by washington area bicyclist association executive director greg billing.\n\nbicycling extends the reach of metrorail for customers at the beginning and end of their trip, he said in metro's release.\n\nwhen metro first opened, it didn't allow bicycles at all. however, it began permitting bikes in 1982 with a paid permit and only on weekends. in 2001, the permits were eliminated and bikes were allowed on weekdays, except during rush hour.\n\nmetro asked riders with bikes to not use the center doors of trains to avoid blocking doors or aisles.\n\nad\n\nthe agency said it will monitor whether the policy needs to be modified. metro also said it could restrict bicycles on trains during busy events like the july 4 fireworks and inauguration day.\n\ngot a story about riding metro or have a question? send it to kery.murakami@washpost.com or @thedcrider.
populist elected in venezuela populist candidate for president of venezuela, hugo chavez, waves to supporters after voting in a school on the outskirts of caracas on sunday (reuters)\n\nby serge f. kovaleski\n\nwashington post foreign service\n\nmonday, december 7, 1998; page a19 hugo chavez, a radical populist and former paratroop who led a failed coup attempt six years ago, was elected president today in a landslide. his victory reflected the discontent among venezuela's poor with the political establishment and created uncertainty about the future of the nation's 40-year-old democracy and latin america's fourth-largest economy. with 78 percent of returns counted, chavez had received 56.4 percent of the ballots cast, compared with 39.5 percent for his challenger, henrique salas romer, a yale-educated economist and former state governor who was considered more moderate. chavez will succeed rafael caldera, 82, who was constitutionally prevented from seeking another five-year term. venezuela is being born again, chavez, 44, declared as soon as the election results were reported. as his supporters blared car horns and set off fireworks in the streets of this capital, he made an appeal for calm and vowed to pursue prudent economic policies. throughout the day, balloting was reported to be peaceful around the country, although security forces were placed on high alert. once again the people of simon bolivar have shown themselves to be a grand people, chavez, who frequently invokes the south american liberation hero in his speeches, told the venevision television network. salas quickly conceded defeat, telling reporters: i accept the victory of my adversary and wish him a lot of luck. long live chavez. the people have finally won something, said jose cortes, who is 26 and unemployed, as he ran down a street in central caracas with a group of chavez supporters waving a venezuelan flag and wearing a red beret, a trademark of chavez's followers. today's election marked the first time in four decades of democracy that venezuela's two traditional parties -- democratic action and the social christian party -- did not field a presidential candidate. chavez's victory will reshape the nation's political landscape by ending four decades of domination by the two parties, which have been assailed for corruption, mismanagement of the country's oil wealth and catering to a small elite. chavez, who attempted to overthrow the democratically elected government of carlos andres perez in 1992, drew his support largely from among venezuela's poor majority, waging an anti-establishment, anti-corruption platform that called for radical political and economic reforms. the former paratroop's campaign rhetoric was interpreted as critical of free-market economics -- and sometimes dictatorial -- at a time when the region has been embracing more liberal economic policies and greater democracy. chavez vowed to fire the head of the state-run oil company and proposed restricting the expansion of venezuela's petroleum sector and foreign investment in the industry. venezuela is the world's fifth-leading petroleum producer and is leading exporter of total oil products to the united states and the second-leading supplier of crude oil to u.s. markets after saudi arabia. he also suggested declaring a moratorium on repaying the country's $22 billion foreign debt and vowed to create a constituent assembly that he said would be more representative of the people than the venezuelan congress and would root out government corruption. in a wide-ranging news conference tonight, chavez emphasized his agenda for political and economic change. but he also cautioned, i don't think the venezuelan people think that [chavez] is a messiah and a type of magician who is going to . . . solve all the immense social, economic, political and moral problems that are weighing on this country. striking a conciliatory note, he added: i say to the venezuelan people, i don't consider anyone political enemies . . . i extend my hand to everyone. but chavez also paid homage to those who participated in two attempted coups in 1992. with all my feeling and all my soul, i send greetings out to the rebel boys of feb. 4 and nov. 27, chavez said. boys, it was all worth it . . . for your honor, for your sacrifice and for the honor of the nation we all love. chavez's opponent, salas, considered more amenable to free-market principles, also tried to distance himself from the establishment during the campaign, although the two major parties officially backed him last week after dumping their original choices in a desperate effort to head off chavez. these are historic elections. nothing like [them] has happened in venezuela's political history, u.s. ambassador john f. maisto said before the vote. no matter who wins, starting [this week] the issue is governability -- what they are going to do to make this country work. venezuela has a competitive advantage over other latin american countries because of oil, but they are not fully competitive in the non-oil trade sectors. venezuela will continue to need investment. the possibility of a chavez presidency had already made many investors uneasy, prompting some to sit on the sidelines while awaiting the outcome of the election and others to pull out of the country outright. chavez must now contend with the deepest financial crisis venezuela has faced in more than a decade. the government is strapped with a $5 billion budget deficit, and the economy has been battered by slumping oil prices, leading to the erosion of health care, education and social services. inflation stands at 65 percent, and an estimated 75 percent of the nation's 23 million people live in poverty. among his core supporters, however, anxiety was not an issue. after casting his ballot for the winner, construction worker alfredo calderon exuberantly said: nobody here is afraid of 'el comandante.' everybody here is in favor of him because he is someone new -- the only one who can save us from 40 years of democracy that has not done anything. the breadth of chavez's popularity had been clear since november's legislative and gubernatorial elections in which the patriotic pole, the coalition that he heads, won 35 percent of the seats in congress and 8 of 23 governorships, making it the dominant political force in the country and prompting the two main parties to back salas. many of those who did not vote for chavez said they were worried about his history of violence and distrustful of his promises, and concerned that as a political leader he is an unknown quantity. others contended that salas was less extreme and had more leadership experience. chavez goes down to people very low in culture. he offers a series of things that are dreams. . . . but are not easy to deliver. for example, he said he is going to give them houses of the elites and cars from people who have more than them, said gabriella hoffman, 31, an administrator who voted for salas. chavez, she said, will bring a new form of corruption. what is happening is that the people do not realize it. he knows how to sell himself well. this country is now on a road to disaster, not change in the better sense of the word. it really feels as if we are in the midst of a revolution, said mauricio de armas, 51, a physician. my biggest fear is that everything is now up for grabs, democracy, our freedom and free enterprise. this shows a downside to democracy. but lisbebh castellano, 18, a lottery worker, was firm in her conviction that chavez is the best choice for venezuela. he is the best alternative to the lack of character and principles of the government and things like the bad education and hunger that we have to face every day, she said as she left a voting station in the poor caracas neighborhood of carapita. he is not the same as the old parties. we can put hope and trust in him.

scale and get a printer-friendly version of the recipe here.\n\nperhaps the biggest change has been at lunchtime. i rarely, if ever, cooked for desk lunches. when i was on top of my meal planning, i might earmark leftovers to take to work, but more often than not, the question i asked by about noon every weekday was: where am i getting takeout?\n\nad\n\ni wasn't alone: more people purchased lunch out of the house than any other meal in 2018, according to the bureau of labor statistics. we won't know how 2020 fared in this survey for another couple of years, but it seems obvious that one of the biggest changes in home cooking has revolved around lunch.\n\nad\n\nnow that i'm cooking lunch or eating leftovers almost seven days a week, i've been looking for strategies to help me pull something together for my husband and me that's quick, satisfying, plus relatively light and healthy. in the summer and much of the fall, it was big salads from our backyard garden. then as the greens started to fade, i looked to my instant pot and started making soups at least a couple times a week.\n\nin my lunch rush, i've rarely made time for an actual recipe. instead, i turn to whatever raw vegetable i have around, which this time of year includes cauliflower, broccoli, brussels sprouts, carrots, beets, winter squash and potatoes (white and sweet).\n\nad\n\nmy add-ins varied at first, but i soon settled on a formula, using coconut milk and water, plus a little lime juice, garlic, onion and ginger. about 20 minutes later (10 minutes for the pot to come to pressure and another 10 to cook), i blend the contents into a rich, aromatic puree and start scouring for garnishes.\n\nas i've written before, even when pureed soups are as full of flavor as these, they need generous garnishes or they get tiresome to eat. so i chop up leftover roasted vegetables (or meat for my husband) and pile on herbs, nuts, maybe some canned or precooked beans, a drizzle of more coconut milk or yogurt. if i have a baguette getting stale, i saw off chunks into irregular croutons. or if i'm thinking ahead, i use some of the base vegetable — grating some raw carrot or beet before putting the rest in the pot for the soup, for instance, or thinly slicing carrot tops or beet greens. i roast the seeds i pull out of a butternut or acorn squash, turning them crispy and browned in about the time it takes the soup to cook.\n\nad\n\nmy instant pot soup strategy — which i hope might become yours, too — lets me cook fairly mindlessly, as the formula is so easy to remember, while the varying vegetables and garnishes keep the soups interesting. plus, i make enough to bank one or two meals for the fridge or freezer.\n\nad\n\nat lunch, with the clock counting down and work tasks mounting during my break, a quick path to a hot bowl of soup, whether it's left over or not, is a blessing.\n\nnote: this recipe was tested using a 6-quart instant pot; the volume and amount of liquid are enough for it to work in an 8-quart model, but you'll want to halve it for a 3-quart model.\n\nstorage: the soup can be refrigerated for up to 1 week and frozen for up to 6 months. thaw and reheat gently on the stove top.\n\ningredients\n\n2 pounds vegetable or combination of vegetables of your choice (see note below)\n\n1 (13-ounce) can coconut milk\n\n1 1/2 cups water\n\n1/2 medium yellow onion, chopped (about 5 ounces; 1 cup)\n\n4 garlic cloves, smashed\n\n1 tablespoon fresh lime juice, plus more to taste\n\n2-inch piece ginger, peeled and chopped\n\n1 teaspoon fine sea salt, plus more to taste\n\nfreshly ground black pepper (for serving)\n\nabout 1 1/2 to 2 cups assorted garnishes of your choice (see note below)\n\nstep 1\n\nin an instant pot combine the vegetables, coconut milk, water, onion, garlic, lime juice, ginger and salt. close the lid. make sure the steam valve is sealed. select pressure (high) and set to 10 minutes. (it takes about 10 minutes for the appliance to come to pressure before cooking begins.)\n\nad\n\nad\n\nrelease the pressure manually by moving the pressure-release handle to venting, covering your hand with a towel or hot pad. never put your hands or face near the vent when it's releasing steam.\n\nstep 2\n\nuse an immersion (stick) blender to puree the soup until smooth. (alternately, you can puree the soup in batches in a blender: to prevent splatters, be careful to not fill it more than halfway, remove the center ring from the lid, and hold a kitchen towel over the lid as you blend.) reheat if needed by returning the soup to the instant pot and heating on saute. taste, and add more salt and/or lime juice if needed.\n\nstep 3\n\ndivide the soup among serving bowls, add about 1/3 cup garnishes of your choice to each bowl, grind black pepper on top and serve hot.\n\nad\n\nnote: here are some possibilities for vegetables and garnishes that work well with them:\n\nad\n\ndouble celery\n\n1 1/2 pounds celery root, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks\n\n8 ounces (5 to 6 ribs) celery, cut into 1-inch chunks\n\ngarnish: chopped celery and leaves, toasted baguette croutons\n\nbroccoli and brussels sprouts\n\n1 1/4 pound head broccoli, trimmed and cut into 1-inch chunks (stem cut into 1/4-inch slices)\n\n12 ounces brussels sprouts\n\ngarnish: shredded brussels sprouts and whole leaves; roasted chickpeas\n\nbeet and carrot\n\n1 1/4 pounds beets, scrubbed but not peeled, and cut into 1/2-inch chunks\n\n12 ounces carrots, scrubbed but not peeled, and cut into 1/2-inch chunks\n\ngarnish: thinly sliced beet greens plus any whole small leaves; finely chopped carrots; drizzle of coconut milk\n\nwinter squash\n\n2 pounds acorn, butternut or other winter squash, peeled, seeded and cut into 1-inch chunks\n\ngarnish: pumpkin seeds, cilantro or parsley, chopped roasted red pepper\n\nnutrition information\n\ningredients are too variable for a meaningful analysis.\n\nrecipe from and tested by joe yonan; email questions to voraciously@washpost.com.\n\nscale and get a printer-friendly version of the recipe here.\n\ndid you make this recipe? take a photo and tag us on instagram with #eatvoraciously.
if you're doing any cargill-related business – if for example you have a conference call and you think you should take it from home on your commute into work in the morning — that's absolutely not acceptable, company spokeswoman april nelson said. she said gps devices necessary for navigation may be used so long as they are programmed before travel and mounted for hands-free use.\n\nad\n\nthe minnesota-based company, whose new policy applies to about 150,000 employees worldwide, is not the first or the largest to institute such a strict ban. but advocates at the national safety council believe cargill is the largest privately held corporation to do so.\n\nad\n\ndeborah a.p. hersman, president and chief executive of the national safety council, welcomed the measure, saying history has shown that changing the corporate culture can help shift attitudes in the rest of society. it's also another sign of how many corporations have been trying to do what government – loosely defined – has been ineffective or unwilling to do since mobile phones first appeared 30 years ago, she said.\n\nthey're really just looking at their risks and looking at the data, hersman said.\n\nthe national safety council says motor vehicle crashes are the most frequent cause of work-related fatalities and account for about 24 percent of all work-related injuries. the nonprofit organization, using 2010 data, estimates that at least 24 percent of all fatal crashes involved drivers using cell phones and that at least 160,000 crashed involved drivers who were texting.\n\nif anything, driving while texting or talking on a mobile device has become ever more widespread since then. some experts believe that recent statistics showing a dramatic increase in traffic deaths can be blamed at least in part on the widespread habit of texting or talking while driving.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ncargill — whose businesses range from agriculture to financial services — decided to act because of the ubiquity of smartphones and a growing number of statistics suggesting that these devices are too often the culprits in traffic crashes, nelson said. there was no specific incident that caused the company to to implement the policy, she said.\n\noverall, it's making sure employees know of the dangers of driving while distracted and how important that cargill feels that safety is first, nelson said.\n\nemployees could be disciplined for infractions, with actions ranging from a talk with the boss to termination, but that will be decided on a case-by-case basis, nelson said. she said the company is relying mostly on an honor system and peers to monitor and enforce the new policy.\n\nad\n\nright now, we are focused on stopping distracted driving and less on what the punishments will be for violating the policy, nelson said. we will look at factors such as how egregious a violation is, if someone is doing it repeatedly, if they have received warnings in the past, and other factors to determine the appropriate consequences.\n\nad\n\nthe national safety council, again citing 2010 figures, says 20 percent of the fortune 500 companies imposed total bans. some go so far as to conduct electronic sweeps of company-issued mobile phones to make sure that distracting apps, such as pokemon go, are not on them, hersman said. and a survey cited by the council found in 2009 that of 469 companies that enacted total mobile phone bans, only 1 percent believed productivity declined.\n\nthere's some irony in corporations have reined in the use of mobile phones in vehicles. hard-charging business people were among the first to see that drivetime didn't have to be downtime with a mobile phone in the car. some companies still shy away from imposing total bans for fear that productivity might suffer if employees couldn't take business calls in the car with a hands-free device.\n\nad\n\nbut a corporation can be held vicariously responsible for the negligent behavior of an employee if the employee was engaged in work-related activity at the time of a crash. over the past decade, many companies learned the hard way that they cannot expect employees to be in constant contact without also putting them at risk when they're on the road.\n\nad\n\none company was held liable in a crash involving an employee making work-related cold calls while driving to a private event on a saturday night. in a 2010 case in texas cited by the council, a jury awarded a $21 million verdict against a company whose employee was using a hands-free device to talk on a mobile device when she hit another vehicle.\n\nso it's tempting to think that companies are just doing this to cover their fannies in the event that someone takes them to court over a crash. a national safety council white paper on the topic notes that if employers can show that they implemented a total ban, educated employees about the policy, monitored their compliance and enforced the policy, they will be in a more defensible position should someone sue them.\n\nad\n\nbut at some level it doesn't matter what the motivation is if it keeps people safe. hersman said she simply hopes that steps taken by corporations such as cargill will do for distracted driving what workplace smoking bans did for tobacco use. at one time, smoking was accepted almost everywhere, and now it's not. and people are no longer shy about asking others to put out the cigarette. hersman said she hopes that eventually, more americans will no longer view texting while driving as acceptable behavior, either.\n\nad\n\nyou really have to change your mindset to put your employees' safety and the safety of others on the road first, she said.
as three oregon football players remained hospitalized tuesday morning, a disquieting thought struck ramogi huma, the president of the national college players association. had they received a few bucks for signing an autograph, huma said, the ncaa would have launched an investigation. but the physical endangerment of three players, a direct result of following orders from coaches, would result in no action from college sports' governing body — no investigation, no rebuke, no infractions penalty.\n\nthe three players — doug brenner, sam poutasi and cam mccormick — checked into peacehealth sacred heart medical center at riverbend in springfield, ore., late last week, as the oregonian first reported monday. they arrived after an arduous offseason team workout left them with symptoms of rhabdomyolysis, a condition that causes muscles to break down and the resultant fluid to leak into the bloodstream. by tuesday morning, the players had been upgraded from fair to good condition while being monitored for possible kidney damage.\n\nlater tuesday, the school suspended strength and conditioning coach irele oderinde for a month without pay.\n\n[oregon suspends strength coach for one month after three players hospitalized]\n\nthe ordeal underscored the vulnerability college athletes face in an unbalanced power dynamic. the stakes extend beyond the typical debates. as northwestern football players pursued the option to unionize in 2014 and 2015, the majority of headlines focused on the third-rail topic of whether such action would lead to student-athletes being defined as employees and receiving compensation beyond scholarships.\n\nthe people at the fore of the movement had other priorities, starting with the jarring lack of recourse for players subject to medical mistreatment from coaches or schools. the ncaa either cannot or does not force schools to abide by its medical guidelines, which cover everything from lightning safety to immunizations. no organization exists to pressure schools regarding potential medical neglect.\n\nthat was my primary motivation when trying to help launch that movement, huma said.\n\nannually, the ncaa publishes a sports medicine handbook. the 2014-15 version was 140 pages. in the section titled preseason preparation, the ncaa instructs schools that conditioning should be phased in gradually during transitional periods, such as january when players are returning from winter break.\n\nthe oregonian reported that the players went to the hospital after performing an hour of military-style up-downs and push-ups. the ncaa has rules pertaining to practice time, but none regarding its own set of best medical practices.\n\nthe current structure does not enforce health and safety mandates, huma said. the ncaa has plenty of guidelines, but they don't enforce any of them.\n\n[oregon law could be college football's version of the rooney rule]\n\nwhat happens when a school puts players at risk through unduly harsh practice methods? iowa recently closed such a case. in 2011, 13 iowa players were hospitalized with rhabdomyolysis after they endured an intense regimen of squats during a team workout, then returned the following day for another intense session, this time for upper-body muscles, despite players' complaints of dark-colored urine, a sign of rhabdomyolysis.\n\niowa investigated the workout and determined there had been no wrongdoing. the school recommended — but did not require — that the football program should halt the workout, which it did. three months after the controversy, iowa's strength coach, chris doyle, received an award for most valuable assistant coach from coach kirk ferentz.\n\nin 2014, cornerback william lowe, one of the 13 affected players, filed suit against the school, alleging iowa had subjected him to unnecessary bodily harm and had failed to properly monitor the workouts. lowe, who never returned to the team, said in the suit that he experienced subsequent weight loss, headaches, high blood pressure and continued lower back pain.\n\nlast year, nearly six years after the workouts, iowa settled with lowe for $15,000. none of the other 12 players sued, and none have received payments from the school.\n\nif college athletes could organize, they might have a stronger tool to prevent harm. huma pointed to the nfl's concussion protocol. teams now bear responsibility for pulling potentially concussed players from games. in a new rule instituted this year, the nfl can investigate cases and fine teams for violations.\n\nthat didn't happen because the nfl woke up one day and decided to do it, huma said. that happened because the nfl players association fought for it. the players need a voice that has the players' best interest as a priority, not as an afterthought.\n\nthe players' best recourse for assistance now comes from courts, which huma said poses challenges. he is currently opposing a settlement proposed by a u.s. district judge in chicago in the class-action concussion lawsuit against the ncaa brought by former eastern illinois player adrian arrington. the settlement, huma said, would pay zero dollars to former players affected by brain injuries, instead giving players medical monitoring that may be covered by their health insurance.\n\nthe courts don't want to do anything that forces the ncaa to change what it's been doing for decades now, huma said. the settlement is a sham, and the court is about to bless it.\n\nthe issue most often debated regarding the welfare of college athletes is whether schools exploit their work. but players have little to no power in solving issues well beyond compensation. three oregon football players who remained in the hospital tuesday could attest.
i am far from thinking that this ascendancy of women is a harm in itself. it is a gift bestowed upon them by nature for the happiness of the human race: better directed, it might produce as much good as today it does harm. we are not sufficiently aware of what advantages would arise from giving a better education to that half of the human race that governs the other. men will always be what is pleasing to women: if then you want them to become great and virtuous, teach women what greatness of soul and virtue is. the reflections this subject provokes, and which plato made in bygone times, greatly deserve to be better developed by a pen worthy of following such a master and of defending a cause so great.\n\nthe reflections to which rousseau refers are found primarily in plato's laws, and they were developed several years later by rousseau himself in his letter to d'alembert on the theater.\n\nthe laws shows how a philosopher who wanted to influence practical politics might go about it. in the dialogue, an old man known only as the athenian stranger talks at length with two other old men, a cretan who is charged with helping to draw up new laws for a new polity and a spartan who is visiting crete.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthese two dorians are children of a culture in which manliness is celebrated as the highest human virtue. one of the stranger's most important tasks, and perhaps the most indispensable, is to cure his interlocutors of that prejudice.\n\nthe difficulty of this undertaking can be glimpsed by considering a few of the novel laws that the stranger recommends. girls are to be given the same education as boys. that includes mandatory military training, and women will be required to serve in combat when they are needed. the women will take their meals together in public, just as men do in crete and sparta.\n\nin addition, male homosexuality (an important bonding mechanism in the warrior culture of the dorians) will be outlawed, and women will have substantially equal rights in marriage. adultery during the childbearing years will be punished in both sexes, while adultery after the childbearing years will be tolerated in both. women will be eligible for nearly all public offices, including the most powerful.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe stranger openly criticizes the dorian conflation of manly virtue with human virtue. he implicitly criticizes the athenian view of feminine virtue, which assigns women to manage the household but allows them to take no part in public life. the stranger never purports to say what human virtue is, and the dialogue ends with the suggestion that the rulers of the new polity will need to promote civic harmony and the happiness of the citizens by undertaking a search for the truth about human virtue.\n\nrousseau returned to the laws for guidance in a most surprising situation. members of his intellectual circle in paris publicly proposed that a theater be established in rousseau's native city, the republic of geneva. this would require a change in the sumptuary laws, and rousseau foresaw a cascade of harmful consequences for the moral climate of the city. his lengthy and detailed critique was both philosophically subtle and politically effective in helping to defeat the proposal.\n\nunlike the stranger, rousseau is not proposing new laws for a new city but defending the existing laws of what he regards as an exceptionally healthy modern polity. unlike the stranger, rousseau is not seeking to moderate excessive manliness, but to warn the genevans against an unhealthy ascendance of women and feminine tastes, which would inevitably accompany the introduction of a theater into their city.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nnotwithstanding many important dissimilarities, the laws and the letter to d'alembert are fundamentally akin. the common ground on which rousseau and the athenian stranger stand emerges from an understanding of the advantages that would arise from giving an appropriate education to women.\n\nin ancient greece, that required a more masculine education for women and a moderation of the domineering masculinity of their men. in geneva, it meant defending bourgeois manliness and educating women to seek their happiness primarily in the role of wife and mother. the differences in the prescriptions, which are striking enough, reflect different applications in different circumstances of insights the two philosophers shared.\n\none of the interesting suggestions we find in the laws is that even the hypermasculine men of crete and sparta were ruled by their women to a far greater extent than they realized, which is why it was a mistake for the legislators in those polities to neglect the education of women. although rousseau was obviously aware that women are also affected by what men want them to be, he did not believe that the effects are symmetrical. men are always much more likely than women to believe they are ruling precisely when they are being ruled, which is why the education of women is especially important and especially likely to be given too little serious attention.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe prejudices that plato attacked have largely gone underground in modern america, while the parisian sophistication that alarmed rousseau has become ever more pervasive. rousseau gave detailed reasons for his dissent from what has become the orthodoxy of our age, and for his decision to look to plato as a guide in promoting a better education for that half of the human race that governs the other.\n\nif more people were to think carefully about the arguments of both plato and rousseau, fewer minds would be imprisoned by politically correct pieties enforced by intolerant proponents of strident feminism, of unrestrained sexual license, and of redefining marriage and even sexual identity itself.\n\nliberating our minds from these fashionable pieties cannot tell us exactly how we should manage relations between the sexes in circumstances that differ significantly from ancient greece and 18th-century geneva. plato and rousseau can help us to think more clearly about that question than we otherwise might, but they cannot do our thinking for us.
the israeli people have the right to live in peace and security. so do the palestinian people, sanders tweeted. i remain concerned about the platform aipac provides for leaders who express bigotry and oppose basic palestinian rights. for that reason i will not attend their conference.\n\nad\n\nhis announcement cranked up to a boil a simmering left-right divide among american jews over his candidacy.\n\nad\n\nthe split spans questions of whether and how to support israel and what qualifies as anti-semitism, those who study the community say. it includes a debate over whether jewish ideals of justice are most urgently expressed through issues like universal health care, wage gaps and the environment, or by supporting and defending the jewish state.\n\nsanders is, for some jews, the encapsulation of what they see as jewishness. and to some he's the antithesis, said yehuda kurtzer, who studies jewish identity as president of the shalom hartman institute of north america.\n\nad\n\namong involved jews, i think he created a bigger problem for himself than he needed to, kurtzer said of sanders's decision to skip the annual washington gathering of nearly 20,000 people. he's catering to a small percentage of his jewish base that wants him to declare war on aipac.\n\nad\n\naipac called sanders's tweet truly shameful and said its conference — which focuses on preserving u.s. support for israel's security — is mainstream, bipartisan.\n\nsuch debates are most important to affiliated jews — the community center directors, synagogue presidents and rabbis from across the country who regularly attend the conference.\n\nbut american jews are changing. and aipac's bipartisan status is as well, with the lobbying group's strong defense of israeli security policies and embrace of prime minister benjamin netanyahu increasingly drawing criticism from palestinian advocates and liberal democrats.\n\na may pew research poll showed 42 percent of jews believed the trump administration favors israel too much compared with the palestinians. forty-seven percent said the balance was about right. in 2013, a major pew poll of u.s. jews found 43 percent said caring about israel is an essential part of being jewish. but 38 percent of jews under 30 said they were not very or not at all attached to israel, compared with 23 percent of jews over 50.\n\nad\n\nad\n\njews who do focus on israel had strong reactions to sanders's move on aipac.\n\nmairav zonszein, a writer who splits her time between israel and the united states, tweeted that sanders is literally a hero for saying f--- you to aipac. the post was liked 8,100 times as of tuesday night.\n\nwhen he first started to rise in the polls, i thought — he should be the jewish community's favorite. you'd think: finally someone who has all these social justice values, zonszein said. but he represents the battle over what jewish american values are on israel. he represents this civil war.\n\njonathan greenblatt of the anti-defamation league tweeted that sanders's announcement was offensive, especially given a national spike in anti-semitism.\n\nad\n\nat a time when we see a surge of real hate across the us, it's irresponsible to describe aipac like this. @adl proudly will be there, his tweet said.\n\nad\n\nsanders was asked in tuesday night's debate what he would say to jews concerned by his choice. i am very proud of being jewish, he answered, before calling netanyahu a reactionary racist.\n\ni happen to believe that what our foreign policy in the mideast should be about is absolutely protecting the independence and security of israel. but you cannot ignore the suffering of the palestinian people.\n\nsanders has also taken heat from some jewish leaders for his welcoming of support from freshman reps. ilhan omar (d-minn.) and rashida tlaib (d-mich.), strong critics of israel who support a controversial boycott movement. sanders does not support the boycott effort.\n\nad\n\nmultiple jewish groups reacted to sanders's aipac decision by emphasizing unity and dialogue.\n\nif sen. bernie sanders wants to lead the democratic party and the nation, i hope he can speak to, engage with, and even debate everyone, tweeted rabbi rick jacobs, head of the reform movement, the largest denomination of judaism in the united states.\n\nbut u.s. jews are less affiliated with denominations and institutions than other faith groups. one third say they are not part of any jewish denomination, pew found in 2013. they may not particularly care whether sanders, a frequent critic of israel's treatment of palestinians, speaks at aipac.\n\nthe organization in previous decades was seen as less partisan. but its strong support for netanyahu during the obama administration, even as the two leaders clashed over settlements and the iran nuclear deal, thrilled republicans and offended many democrats.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin 2016, some conference attendees gave a raucous welcome to then-candidate donald trump, who slammed both president barack obama and hillary clinton in his remarks. hundreds had walked out in protest when trump took the podium.\n\nsanders, who was also a candidate that year, declined to attend the conference but sent a video. aipac had allowed candidates in the past to address the conference that way. but the group said it had changed its policy and declined to play sanders's message.\n\nliberal groups critical of israel have pressured democratic candidates to skip this year's conference. sen. elizabeth warren (mass.) told a questioner before the new hampshire primary that she is not going; sen. amy klobuchar (minn.) and former south bend, ind., mayor pete buttigieg say they have scheduling conflicts. former new york mayor mike bloomberg, who also is jewish, will speak at the conference. it was not clear wednesday whether former vice president joe biden will attend.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nsanders has been reluctant to discuss his personal life on the campaign trail, though he has opened up recently about his jewish heritage. he ties the deaths of relatives in nazi europe to his fight for immigrants and his stance against white nationalism since president trump took office.\n\nhis campaign did not return an email request to discuss the aipac decision. but he has styled himself as an insurgent, calling for radical change. so upsetting some jewish leaders and institutions may not be a major concern to him.\n\nnor do jews appear to be a key part of sanders's base. the most recent data, from pew in january, had just 11 percent of u.s. jews picking sanders as their top choice.\n\nad\n\njeremy burton, head of the jewish community relations council of greater boston, said he's heard responses to sanders's decision that are all over the map.\n\nad\n\nthe one common theme, he said, is anxiety among jews about having a jewish nominee or president. that's true whether the person is sanders or bloomberg.\n\nat the end of the day, jews know anti-semitism is part of the dna of western civilization, burton said. and when people are despairing or feeling at a loss, somehow jews will get blamed.\n\ncorrection: an earlier version of this story misstated the findings of a may pew research poll on the percentage of jews under 30 who said they were not very or not at all attached to israel. the story has been corrected.
his name, of course, is zorro.\n\nwhile wonder woman has lately been commanding media attention with her gaudy, sentimental take on the power of positive thinking, zorro commits to social action without losing his nimble sense of humor. he's just the kind of unifying hero that this new year calls for: the key creation of a man who mastered chaos with laughter — the king of silent hollywood, douglas fairbanks sr.\n\nit was fairbanks who first turned this creature of the pulps into a towering legend. fairbanks was the producer-star and uncredited co-writer of the box-office smash, the mark of zorro, which opened throughout the country in december 1920.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nfairbanks introduced moviegoers to a spanish aristocrat in 1820s california — a blue blood who believes in blue-state values: fair play for the poor and protection of the innocent. he flouts arbitrary laws and challenges corrupt and sadistic officials.\n\nthe tale is simple: girl meets outlaw and outlaw brings down government. the villain is an ambitious commandant who executes an amoral governor's orders by torturing priests, native americans and peons, terrorizing the underclass and ruining righteous families, including the heroine's. he longs for her; she yearns for zorro. out of disguise, the masked outlaw who duels with a grin and woos with ardor, morphs into blasé upper-cruster don diego vega, who suffers from overrefinement and chronic fatigue.\n\nfairbanks and his collaborators (director fred c. niblo, co-writer eugene miller) alchemized anglo pulp writer johnston mcculley's 1919 serial, the curse of capistrano, into a jaunty epic about a master swordsman who funnels puckish humor and outrageous acrobatics into idealistic quests. formulaic action scenes became riotous steeplechases as zorro surmounted obstacles with somersaults and handsprings, sometimes pausing for a snack.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nlike tennyson's sir galahad, zorro has the strength of 10 because his heart is pure. he's also irreverent and mischievous. his sparkle exudes hipness: he embraces the new world's egalitarian ethos while his enemies defend the feudal past.\n\nzorro lifted spirits in the 1920s. in the 2020s, his ebullience can generate ecstatic highs.\n\nduring fairbanks's previous run as the parody hero of contemporary action comedies like his picture in the papers, fans came to think of him as doug, a tribute to his offhand elegance — like fred astaire's, a triumph of talent and willpower. doug transports this knockabout grace into the mark of zorro. with his light heart and can-do demeanor — qualities the world embraced as quintessentially american — zorro soon dominated action-film iconography. cinema would never be the same.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nas the pioneer of two gigantic genres — the swashbuckler and the superhero movie — the mark of zorro earned its entry into the national film registry in 2015. the only wonder is why it didn't place sooner. it both set a cinematic template for timeless champions like robin hood and pumped blood into the brave new pop-art form of adventure comics.\n\nfor a century, a steady succession of live-action and animated, big- and small-screen zorros of multiple nationalities, including antonio banderas, tyrone power, alain delon and guy williams, have stoked zorro's popularity from the midwest to the far east, from iceland to africa. he has conquered the imaginations of figures as different as the chilean-californian novelist isabel allende, who created an indigenous origin story for him in zorro (2005), and quentin tarantino and matt wagner, whose comic book django/zorro (collected as a graphic novel in 2015) depicts black bounty-hunter django and an aging diego teaming up to defeat a despotic arizona empire-builder. (actor-comedian-writer jerrod carmichael has reportedly been working on a django/zorro script, though it hasn't yet been tied to a studio.)\n\nzorro has outwitted avaricious governors, truculent men-at-arms and evil oligarchs trying to seize california's riches and foment discord between mexico and the united states. he has even withstood charges of cultural appropriation. in 1998, chicano writer-director luis valdez (zoot suit), in a salon broadside headlined the face of zorro, dubbed fairbanks's zorro a defender of white, wealthy californios. valdez lampooned 1998's the mask of zorro for selecting an englishman, anthony hopkins, to play diego/zorro, and a spaniard, antonio banderas, to portray his mexican successor, a fictional brother of the legendary rebel-bandit joaquin murrieta. culture clash's herbert siguenza also criticized zorro, in a 2005 los angeles times article, as a eurocentric reimagining of real bandidos [like murrieta] defending the rights of native californians. but he still admires zorro's liberation ideology: fighting for the rights of the oppressed . . . the same philosophy as zapata and che guevara.\n\nthe movie-mad writers and artists who created the first comic books patterned superheroes after fairbanks's dual protagonist. when superman and batman doffed their costumes to become clark kent or bruce wayne, they revealed personae as ineffectual as don diego, the ennui-ridden, apolitical dandy who delights in playing parlor tricks with his handkerchief. batman co-creator bob kane wrote in his 1998 autobiography batman and me: the rich foppish don diego, zorro's alter ego, inspired bruce wayne's facade of being a bored, wealthy idler and playboy.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbill finger, the silent partner who wrote batman's scripts, reportedly said he wanted to combine fairbanks with sherlock holmes, the shadow and doc savage. in action, superman and batman resembled the zorro who is both an indefatigable crusader and an ebullient comic artist: in zorro's case, that means turning duels into witty improvs, then signing them with a z slashed on a wall, a door, a villain's cheek or the seat of a buffoon's pants.\n\nwhen superman artist joe shuster and writer jerry siegel gave a rare joint interview in 1983, siegel said, i loved 'the mark of zorro.'  shuster confessed that he borrowed fairbanks's attitude for superman: he always stood with his hands on his hips and his feet spread apart, laughing — taking nothing seriously. doubtless fairbanks would have preferred robert downey jr.'s iron man to today's glum supermans and batmans.\n\nin the mark of zorro, fairbanks has fun with the narrative mechanics that would change america's pop landscape. lois lane spurning clark kent for superman echoes beautiful noblewoman lolita pulido rejecting don diego and swooning for zorro. watching zorro lead his stallion through camouflaged storm-cellar doors to an underground lair that connects via hidden passageways to diego's hacienda, it's impossible not to think of bruce wayne speeding his batmobile into a subterranean batcave beneath wayne manor, or the green arrow setting up his arrowcave in an abandoned warehouse.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nfairbanks understood the need to surround a hero with archvillains like the cruel and petty captain ramon, allies like his swaggering fellow caballeros and semi-farcical characters in between, such as the bombastic sergeant gonzalez (who became endearing sergeant garcia in the disney tv version). the star also saw the commercial and artistic possibilities of offering new gimmicks each time out, adding the whip to zorro's arsenal in don q, son of zorro (1925), then using it to flick out the flame from a cigarette, slice a royal invitation into note cards, trap a stampeding bull and lasso opponents or swing over them like tarzan.\n\nin 1919, when mcculley conceived zorro (spanish for fox), the writer drew on fact-inspired legends like (of course) robin hood and the avenging bandido murrieta, as well as novelist baroness orczy's entirely fictional scarlet pimpernel, the secret identity of the british popinjay who saves french aristocrats from the reign of terror. fairbanks put an american spin on those influences. his zorro dedicates himself to the equitable treatment of every citizen and rouses his fellow caballeros to practice a democratic form of noblesse oblige.\n\nthe emotional and moral bandwidth fairbanks built into the part gave creative leeway to spirited successors like banderas and director martin campbell, and guy williams and the disney tv team. from 1936's the bold caballero (the first zorro talkie and the only zorro film without zorro in the title) to 2005's the legend of zorro, zorro has never required oversized bodysuits and digital enhancements to give audiences a charge. (fairbanks's and tyrone power's costumes were as tight as matadors' taleguillas.) the character exudes gusto and sex appeal, and a churning, forward-leaning drive.\n\nbanderas brings fairbanks-like zest to the mask of zorroas the fictional alejandro murrieta, who becomes diego's zorro-in-training to avenge his brother joaquin's death (making banderas the first spanish actor to play zorro). when seething peasant murrieta takes up the man-in-black's twin role — with an aristocratic nom de guerre and mask, sword and whip — hilarity ensues. he barely keeps passion from bursting out of his frilled shirt and tapered suits.\n\nin tarantino's introduction to django/zorro, he calls diego a man who has learned to love his own foppish mannerisms. tarantino says, the days are gone of diego pretending to be effete. but they were gone back in 1925, when fairbanks made his only zorro sequel. in don q, son of zorro, fairbanks stars as both the aging champion and his son, cesar de vega — a daredevil by instinct who unites the best parts of zorro and his father's diego identity.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nguided by zorro's seamless knitting of savoir-faire and moral uplift, the producers of the disney tv series made it one of the cleverest and most well-crafted, family-targeted shows of the 1950s. williams, a former model of sicilian heritage (and thus the first latin, if not latino, in the role), played zorro as if to the lair and manor born, embodying a happy-go-lucky élan vital. the series ran for 78 regular episodes, plus four one-hour specials on disney's anthology series in 1960 and 1961. (an unrelated family channel series in the early 1990s ran for 88 episodes.) disney reinvigorated the hero as a global juggernaut, with deep followings in latin america and europe, where alain delon was debonair and flamboyant in 1975's zorro, filmed in spain. (a half-dozen zorros, including fairbanks; powers and frank langella, who headlined mark of zorro remakes in 1940 and 1974, respectively; plus delon, banderas and williams, are available today on multiple streaming services worldwide. mcculley kept publishing zorro stories until he died, in 1958.)\n\nthrough much of the 20th century, zorro served as the spanish poster boy for the melting pot — once the ruling image of a liberal america, in which each racial and ethnic group contributed to the country's cultural stew and subscribed to its ideals. the rise of multiculturalism and the concept of america as the salad bowl has led to more nuanced interpretations of zorro's origins, both in banderas's movies and in allende's sprawling novel, zorro, where he's the son of a female shoshone warrior and a spanish military man.\n\nthe disney theme song crystallizes the core appeal of the fox so cunning and free, calling him a bold renegade and friend of the weak, and the poor and the meek; this very unique señor zorro. he epitomizes the old-fashioned swashbuckler whose stories stress, in the words of film historian brian taves, the purity of the hero's motives, his physical and mental agility, impeccable manners and often witty speech.
for the first time in nfl history, a team will play the super bowl in its home stadium: the buccaneers will battle the kansas city chiefs in tampa for super bowl lv.\n\nthis postseason, tampa bay became the first team in a decade to win three road games en route to the super bowl. the bucs were led by tom brady, 43, in his first season outside new england in his two-decade career. a win could solidify his legacy as perhaps the greatest quarterback of all time, as he has proved he can succeed without patriots coach bill belichick.\n\n[super bowl live updates: tom brady, buccaneers set to face patrick mahomes, chiefs in tampa]\n\nkansas city is trying to become the eighth nfl franchise to win back-to-back titles. the chiefs are led by coach andy reid and 25-year-old quarterback patrick mahomes, the defending super bowl mvp. a win would cement kansas city as the nfl's preeminent modern dynasty.\n\nthat the game will happen on time is reflective of the league's commitment to forging ahead despite the coronavirus pandemic. the nfl tested daily, shuttered team facilities after positive results, postponed games, shuffled schedules, endured outbreaks, forced teams to play on short rest and without key players — and managed to complete its regular season as scheduled. this was all in service to the steady march to the super bowl.\n\nwhen is the super bowl?\n\nsunday, feb. 7, at 6:30 p.m. eastern.\n\nwhere is the super bowl?\n\nraymond james stadium in tampa.\n\n[this odd super bowl will bring us together for a day. let's not take that for granted.]\n\nwhat channel is the super bowl on? is it streamed?\n\ncbs, with free streaming on cbssports.com and the cbs sports app.\n\nhow is the nfl handling the coronavirus?\n\nthe league, like everyone else, is going digital. most super bowl week events will be virtual or canceled. news conferences with players and coaches will be online, including monday's media night — a circuslike staple of super bowl week.\n\nteams would usually get to tampa one week before the game. but this season, the league mandated they arrive no earlier than friday, two days before the game. this turns the biggest event of the year into, logistically, just another game for the teams.\n\n[superspreader sunday? experts worry super bowl parties could trigger coronavirus explosion.]\n\nwill there be fans in attendance?\n\nyes, about 22,000, or 30 percent of capacity at raymond james stadium. the league will give about 7,500 free seats to health-care workers whom the nfl said will have been vaccinated. most will be from tampa, the league said, but it will allot some tickets to those from other nfl cities.\n\nthe nfl plans to sell the other 14,500 tickets. buyers will be selected by lottery, as usual, with designations for every team. there will be about 2,000 more fans in luxury suites. the non-health-care-worker fans will not be required to be vaccinated.\n\nwho will perform the halftime show?\n\ncanadian r&b singer the weeknd was selected toward the end of a particularly successful year, given that his album after hours, released in march, debuted at no. 1 on the billboard 200 and held the spot for four weeks straight.\n\nperforming on the iconic stage, he tweeted alongside the announcement. annual sponsor pepsi wrote, when your talent is limitless, you belong on the world's largest stage.\n\n[an illustrated history of the super bowl halftime show]\n\nafter hours and its chart-topping lead single blinding lights were snubbed by the grammys. the weeknd accused the recording academy of being corrupt, and an unidentified source told rolling stone that his team had been given an ultimatum over his performing at the super bowl in proximity to the originally scheduled grammys ceremony. the academy denied that they snubbed him as retaliation. — sonia rao\n\nhave the buccaneers played in the super bowl?\n\nyes, tampa bay won its only super bowl appearance in the 2002 season. coach jon gruden and quarterback brad johnson were helped by a fearsome defense to beat the oakland raiders, who had traded gruden to the buccaneers before the season.\n\nmost of the players on this year's buccaneers roster hadn't made the playoffs before this season. but quarterback tom brady will appear in his 10th super bowl, a seemingly unbreakable record. this will be bruce arians's first super bowl as a head coach, though he was the offensive coordinator when the pittsburgh steelers won the title for the 2008 season.\n\n[bruce arians is known for 'letting players play.' for the bucs, it has been the right approach.]\n\nwhat about the chiefs?\n\nyes, last season the chiefs beat the san francisco 49ers, 31-20, to win the franchise's first super bowl in 50 years. in the fourth quarter, mahomes led a 21-point barrage to cement the stunning comeback. most of the team's key pieces remain, including wide receiver tyreek hill, tight end travis kelce, defensive tackle chris jones and safety tyrann mathieu.\n\nlast year was the chiefs' first super bowl appearance since they won super bowl iv on jan. 11, 1970, defeating the minnesota vikings, 23-7, in new orleans.\n\n[in tragedies' wake, andy reid and the chiefs found success through second chances]\n\nhow do the teams match up?\n\nthis is a battle between high-octane offenses headlined by one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time (brady) and a young passer who could one day join him in that echelon (mahomes). the embarrassment of offensive riches on the field will include receivers (hill, chris godwin, mike evans) and tight ends (kelce and rob gronkowski).\n\nin november, mahomes outdueled brady as the chiefs edged the bucs, 27-24, in tampa. brady played well — three touchdowns, two interceptions — but mahomes was superlative, throwing for 462 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions. hill recorded 13 catches for 269 yards and three touchdowns in perhaps the best receiving performance of the season.\n\n[the inside story of how patrick mahomes landed with the chiefs]\n\nthose fireworks could prove to be prologue. to contain the chiefs, tampa bay defensive coordinator todd bowles is likely to rely on exotic blitz packages. his unit is the nfl's top-ranked run defense and often forces opponents to throw, but the bucs lack a top-flight cover cornerback and their secondary is liable to allow big plays.\n\nyet the chiefs' defense is perhaps a bigger concern: it was a bend-don't-break unit for most of the season. it's possible brady could take advantage of mistakes in ways others couldn't, as he did on a long touchdown pass against the green bay packers just before halftime in the nfc championship game.\n\nhave they met in the super bowl before?\n\nno, this will be the first meeting.\n\nhow did the teams reach the super bowl?\n\nthe bucs, the nfc's fifth seed, won at the washington football team, at the nfc south-winning new orleans saints and at the top-seeded green bay packers. tampa bay was the first team in a decade to win three straight road playoff games, and it was helped by the minimal crowds in new orleans and green bay.\n\nthe chiefs, the afc's top seed, received the conference's only first-round bye, an even more valuable advantage this season because the nfl added another playoff team. kansas city beat the cleveland browns in the divisional round even after mahomes left with a head injury in the second half, and then the buffalo bills, who could prove to be a top threat in the afc in the coming years, in the conference final.\n\n[brady vs. mahomes is one of the greatest super bowl qb matchups ever. we ranked all 55.]\n\nwhy does the super bowl use roman numerals?\n\nto avoid confusion as it plays the super bowl the calendar year after the regular season, according to the nfl. this is super bowl lv, or super bowl 55.\n\nwhat does the super bowl winner get?\n\nthe vince lombardi trophy — a 22-inch-tall, seven-pound, sterling silver football on a stand. each member of the winning team also gets $130,000.\n\nwho is singing the national anthem?\n\njazmine sullivan and eric church. sullivan recently released the critically acclaimed r&b record heaux tales; church, deemed entertainer of the year at the 2020 country music awards, announced he would be releasing three albums this spring. grammy winner h.e.r. will perform america the beautiful.\n\n[the best super bowl recipes to deliver big flavor for a smaller watch party]\n\nwhy is it called the super bowl?\n\ngood question. the origin is somewhat unclear, but it came shortly after the established national football league merged with the upstart american football league in 1966. the contest between the league winners was, for a few years, called some variation of the afl-nfl world championship game. but the nfl knew it needed something catchier.\n\none popular legend is that lamar hunt, owner of the chiefs, suggested super bowl because his children loved the super ball, a bouncy and popular toy. he said bowl was a phonetic confusion with ball.\n\nhow much is a ticket to the super bowl?\n\nthe average ticket typically costs between $4,000 and $5,000, according to seatgeek.com. but this year, with fewer seats, the cheapest ticket on the resale market is about $6,000. better seats cost multiples of that.\n\nhow did super bowl commercials become a thing?\n\ncommercials became more expensive after apple's famous 1984 ad. super bowl commercials were popular before — especially mean joe greene tossing a kid his jersey in an ad that aired during super bowl xiv in 1980 — but after apple's ad, the value of the 30-second spots exploded. last year, they reportedly sold for a record $5.6 million each and were seen by nearly 100 million viewers.\n\nwhich teams have never won the super bowl?\n\ntwelve total. eight have played in the super bowl but lost: the minnesota vikings (four times), buffalo bills (four), cincinnati bengals (two), carolina panthers (two), atlanta falcons (two), los angeles chargers (one), tennessee titans (one) and arizona cardinals (one).\n\nfour have never appeared in the super bowl: the cleveland browns, detroit lions, houston texans and jacksonville jaguars.
there are a few differences in the models for friday, jan. 20, but they're not so outrageously divergent that i can't use them to draw conclusions. the most encouraging thing i can say is neither of our trusted global models (the gfs and the euro) are predicting something major like a nor'easter at the end of next week.\n\nad\n\nforecast models are notorious for churning out big, honkin' low-pressure systems when they get out to 10 days, but we're not seeing that on the east coast in this forecast. (forecasts include the current day in the count.)\n\nad\n\nthere's a big storm over the northern plains/great lakes in both the euro and the gfs, but it looks like we'll be on the warm side of those storms.\n\nin fact, if we look at the average forecast from the 50 european model ensembles, chances are we're going to be in relatively high pressure, meaning warmer temperatures than average and not much precipitation. good news for people who will be outdoors for hours that day.\n\nthat all being said, i don't want people to think that the weather is going to be tremendous. temperatures may be warmer than average, but it's still the end of january and average temperatures are pretty cold.\n\nad\n\ngiven what i'm seeing today, i'd forecast highs of about 50 degrees with a 20 percent chance of rain (with low confidence).\n\nthe wrench is that temperatures will be starting out at about 40 degrees at sunrise, so you need to prepare to be cold for most of the day. the high temperature is just a single moment in time. for all of the other minutes in the day, it's going to be colder than 50 degrees, and if you're standing outside with temperatures in the 40s for more than 30 minutes, it's not going to feel warm. ideally, the sun will be out — that would actually be tremendous.\n\nad\n\nthis is obviously something you'll want to check on over the next week. things change rapidly during the winter season, and this forecast is anything but a sure bet.\n\nad\n\nhere's what some other digital forecast outlets are predicting . . .\n\nweather underground\n\nas we get closer to the date, it will be nice to check weather underground's hourly forecast for an idea of what you need to prepare for. if you know what time you're going to be outside, you won't have to guess what the weather will be like.\n\nhigh: 52 degrees\n\nchance of rain: 25 percent\n\naccuweather\n\nour friends in state college are predicting much warmer temperatures. it would be great if they are right.\n\nhigh: 60 degrees\n\nchance of rain: 0 percent\n\nnational weather service
up and down the western united states, protests have devolved into violent clashes replete with thrown rocks, exploding fireworks and streams of chemical irritants.\n\nbut the nation's capital — with its strict gun laws and history of orderly, peaceful protest — has largely avoided these violent conflicts.\n\nad\n\nuntil now.\n\nextremism experts who study the far-right warn that d.c. is on a path to become the next battleground in increasingly violent confrontations with left-leaning counterdemonstrators.\n\nthousands of people marched in support of president trump two days before the electoral college confirmed the 2020 election. (the washington post)\n\nin the weeks since the 2020 presidential election, a coalition of loyalists of president trump, conspiracy theory adherents, white nationalists, self-proclaimed militia members and other fringe figures have flocked to the nation's capital to support the president's baseless claims of election fraud. as trump's hopes of reversing the election results have faltered, those who falsely believe the election was stolen or fraudulent have grown increasingly angry and desperate.\n\nextremist groups intent on sowing chaos and division have capitalized on these feelings to recruit members and spread disinformation, experts say. in online chat groups and forums, political rage and disbelief metastasizes into calls for violence.\n\nthey feel trump won the election and that the country is being stolen from them, so this is their last chance to save america, said heidi beirich, co-founder of the global project against hate and extremism and the former director of intelligence at the southern poverty law center. they're a lot angrier now, and that worries me. it worries me that now they're deciding if they're going to bring guns to the street fight.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nduring two weekends of pro-trump demonstrations in november and december, violent melees spilled into the streets of downtown washington.\n\nlongtime d.c. protesters, many of whom have been demonstrating since the may police killing of george floyd in minneapolis, have called for d.c. residents and supporters to join them to stand against groups they see as an existential threat. both times, they have been outnumbered.\n\nd.c. is not exactly a proud boy-friendly city, said eric feinberg, who monitors online activity from extremist groups as vice president of content moderation at coalition for a safer web. activists are in a more defensive position here. they see it as protecting their turf. but what happens is then you get these other groups like the proud boys that want to cause violence, and they know that if they come to d.c. they'll be confronted by these left-wing activists — that's where it gets dangerous.\n\non wednesday, trump's supporters and a litany of far-right groups who believe the president's baseless claims of voter fraud will again converge in d.c. to demand that congress overturn the results of the election. that same day, congress is set to convene to certify electoral college votes, declaring president-elect joe biden the winner.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ntrump continued on friday to publicize the right-wing demonstrations on twitter. the big protest rally in washington, d.c., will take place at 11.00 a.m. on january 6th, trump tweeted, although none of the organizers requesting permits gave that start time. locational details to follow. stopthesteal!\n\nd.c. is no stranger to protests. the city has averaged more than 800 permitted demonstrations annually in recent years and many more that gather without permits. while arrests have increased as protesters have sought to use civil disobedience to make a point, the arrests often are planned and choreographed.\n\nwhen violence has erupted, it has largely targeted property — not people.\n\nad\n\nbut security experts who study extremist movements and terrorism threats say street brawls are part of the ethos of far-right agitators. experts said these groups will continue to return to washington well after biden is sworn into office.\n\nad\n\ntrump's far-right supporters have announced plans to return to d.c. on jan. 17 and in the days around biden's jan. 20 inauguration, during which some militants are touting a million militia march.\n\nthis is where people come to march. historically, this is where hate groups have come to march, as well, beirich said. washington is a far better target for them than [the west coast]. you get better press coverage, there's a lively anti-fascist movement in d.c. so you're almost guaranteeing you'll get some clashes in the streets. that's what they thrive on.\n\non wednesday, four simultaneous rallies are expected to draw pro-trump demonstrators to areas around the washington monument, freedom plaza and the capitol to hear speeches from prominent conservatives, including trump ally roger stone and incoming rep. marjorie taylor greene, who has endorsed the baseless qanon conspiracy.\n\nad\n\nad\n\npermit applications estimate thousands of attendees will spread throughout various sites downtown, chanting and waving flags. but in encrypted chat apps and online message boards, a different kind of day appears to be taking shape.\n\nfor weeks, anonymous users have posted tips and strategies for smuggling firearms into d.c., where carrying without a permit is prohibited and guns are banned at protests. organizers on the left and right have warned their followers to prepare for violence.\n\nneo-nazis took to telegram, an encrypted chat app that allows users to broadcast to a channel of subscribers, to encourage followers to attend, saying they need boots on the ground to intimidate lawmakers and push for a nationalist agenda.\n\ncomments on a youtube video announcing the hotel harrington's decision to close during the days leading up to wednesday's protest — after a washington post report on how d.c.'s oldest continuously running hotel became a proud boys rallying spot — devolved into calls for violence and an armed takeover along the mall.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nat what point do armed americans seize dc and start hanging politicians? it's an honest question that is not without merit or precedence, wrote a user in a post that was up-voted by other contributors more than 1,100 times.\n\na number of commenters indicated they believed — or hoped — a civil war may soon begin against a perceived band of enemies that includes communists, socialists and anyone deemed a member of antifa.\n\nmembers of the proud boys, an all-male far-right extremist group with ties to white nationalism, boasted about their plans to break off into smaller groups to roam the streets looking for counterprotesters to confront.\n\nenrique tarrio, the leader of the proud boys, who did not respond to a request for comment for this article, wrote in a post that was widely shared on parler and telegram that the group will turn out in record numbers on jan. 6, promising 1,000 boots on the ground.\n\ntarrio and other proud boys leaders also told followers to ditch their signature black and gold dress in favor of all-black clothing — an apparent attempt to make far-right agitators harder to pick out in a crowd of black-clad anti-fascist and anti-trump demonstrators.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwe will be incognito and we will spread across downtown d.c. in smaller teams, tarrio posted on parler.\n\nother likely attendees include members of various armed groups, such as anti-government groups like the three percenters and oath keepers. members of the youth-led groypers, a white-supremacist group, are also likely to return. on dec. 12, they cheered as bands of proud boys carried a black lives matter sign torn from outside a historically black church, then set it on fire.\n\nexperts say far-right groups have used telegram channels and other social media to exchange taunts and threats with left-leaning activist organizations. supporters of the proud boys gleefully reposted and highlighted videos in recent days of black-clad demonstrators being punched and pushed to the ground at previous rallies.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthey're putting this stuff online to taunt each other, to try and get the other side riled up, feinberg said. it's memetic warfare.\n\nonline fundraisers have cropped up to solicit donations for travel, communications equipment — such as earpieces, microphones and radios — and help covering the medical bills of proud boys who were hospitalized after dec. 12 stabbings in a chaotic altercation across from harry's bar, the in-house pub at the hotel harrington.\n\nstreet medics, who volunteer to treat those wounded at protests, and members of left-leaning groups have launched similar fundraising campaigns. some money goes to purchase radios to track real-time movements of the opposition and to send warnings, or marching orders, to their allies.\n\nduring the dec. 12 rally, men dressed in proud boys colors pressed radio receivers into their ears as they awaited instructions.\n\nad\n\nthey found antifa — we have to get to e street, a man said to a small crowd gathered around him.\n\nthese small, roving gangs often did not unearth antifa — a loose collective of activists who identify as anti-fascist — but instead were involved in violent attacks on passersby.\n\none man caught in the fray was 25-year-old christopher langley, a u.s. army specialist who said he had stopped in d.c. for sushi after spending the warm december day at six flags america with his siblings and a friend.\n\nas he walked through crowds downtown, langley said, he was attacked by men wearing vests marked with the yellow letters pb. he was punched in the head, knocked to the ground and surrounded by at least four proud boys, he said.\n\nlangley said he received four stitches at george washington university hospital to close a cut on his lip.\n\nit was surprising in that i didn't do anything to provoke them, he said. i wasn't wearing anything they disagreed with.\n\nexperts say this escalation — marking anyone who is not with them as the enemy — indicates that far-right groups are growing more volatile and less concerned about appealing to mainstream americans.\n\nrita katz, executive director of site intelligence group, which tracks extremism and terrorism threats, said the posture of many far-right groups changed after trump's election loss.\n\nbefore that, they were trying to create an image that they were the victims, that antifa was attacking them, that antifa was the real threat, katz said. they still hold this victim mentality, but their message has evolved to suggest that it's now their turn — if not their 'duty' — to spark confrontation. essentially, 'this is it; be prepared and bring whatever you need to fight.' \n\nincoming d.c. police chief robert j. contee iii, who will oversee the police response on wednesday, said violence will not be tolerated at protests. he said he was on the ground during the last visit from the proud boys and saw the kind of violence that night wrought.\n\nhe said violent protests are not an anomaly in d.c. and compared the last two far-right demonstrations to racial justice protests in late may after george floyd's death. at that time, swells of angry and grieving demonstrators converged downtown for weeks. at times, confrontations with police escalated as protesters threw rocks and water bottles or shot fireworks at the police line. federal police officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets into crowds of protesters.\n\non dec. 12, tight lines of d.c. police officers denied roaming clusters of proud boys — some wearing helmets and body armor, or carrying clubs and shields — entry to black lives matter plaza for much of the night as clashes exploded nearby. frustrated, members of the group yelled at officers, telling them to do your job.\n\nin online discussion groups this week, posts from far-right demonstrators showed a growing disillusionment with police officers. some called for police to stand back, while others called for violence to be exacted against corrupt police.\n\nthe optics aren't pretty any time you have 200 to 300 people brawling in the street and you're trying to arrest those involved in violent behavior, contee said. it's totally unacceptable. when we see and we are safely able to take people into custody, we will do so.

domesticity takes many guises in daniel wickerham and malcolm lomax's towering assemblages, which rely heavily on photographic images but also include 3-d objects. among the homey motifs are pets, tv shows, cocktails and baltimore places and pals. the assemblages's see-through portals include a doggy door and intricate cutouts, but some possible passageways are blocked by wooden 2-by-4s or slabs of blank plywood. these barriers suggest containment and isolation, and also provide a breather from the profusion of pictures and items.\n\nsometimes the duo's domestic concerns merge, as in several pieces that include silver dog bowls filled with presentation (that is, fake) liquid, ice cubes and fruit slices. a plastic mocktail is just one absurdist touch in an array that offers a rattlesnake as a possible house pet and names half the artworks after people who appeared mtv's the real world: seattle. (the show ran in 1998, the year both wickerham and lomax turned 12, an impressionable age.)\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe artists are influenced by queer theory, speculative fiction, human geography and the sociopolitical as it relates to urban space, their biography notes. black vulcan sleeping aid, which includes black star trek characters and a playful simulation of the solar system with various everyday round objects, was inspired by a controversial (and thus unproduced) aids-themed script for star trek: the next generation. two other pieces, an invitation between the door and bed and nathan blackburn, are symbolic self-portraits of lomax and wickerham, respectively.\n\nwithout the glossary, domestic qt is hard to read. but clearly legible are the duo's aesthetic hyperactivity, neo-baroque sensibility and simultaneous attraction to and dissatisfaction with digital image-making. if free-associating collages are the equivalent of random web-surfing, the tidiness of the compositions is offset by surrounding them with found objects, blocks of lumber and strands of beads. transforming digital pictures into free-standing sculpture, wickerham and lomax reveal a yearning to escape virtual reality and live in the real world.\n\nwickerham & lomax: domestic qt and the spatial anomalies through jan. 17 at von ammon co., 3330 cady's alley nw.\n\nsparkplug\n\nevery two years, the district of columbia arts center musters a group of local artists as the latest sparkplug collective. the closing exhibition of the current cohort, states of being, has a theme well suited to 2020: uncertainty. a few of the nine artists in the show, curated by fabiola r. delgado, offer pieces that are somewhat in flux. but most of the artworks are permanently fixed objects that take uncertainty as a subject or an element of a technique.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nalexandra silverthorne photographed new orleans landscapes threatened by climate change, then processed the black-and-white negatives in mississippi river water to yield unpredictably degraded images. tom greaves took a photographic portrait, cut it into strips and reassembled it so it appears whole yet fragile. elizabeth sampson painted small realist pictures of scenes, devastated by natural or man-made disasters, in which people are framed by the remains of ruined structures.\n\nmuch of the work involves design, assembly and place-making. sarah j. hull's stasis is a large fabric square made of smaller squares, neatly geometric yet intentionally rough in execution. alanna reeves's embroidered monoprints contrast grids and organic forms. madeline a. stratton's cartoonish, candy-colored domestic interiors are smaller versions of the work reviewed in this column in november.\n\nlight, shadow and dangling materials make the work of shana kohnstamm, sarah stefana smith and steve wanna the show's most mercurial. made of wool, wire and resin, kohnstamm's gravitas suspends three organic-looking sacs from metallic discs in exquisite tension. smith's flag to the abyss is a banner of black fabric and plastic, evoking death but also infinity. wanna's christo-like within without encloses the stairway entrance to the second-floor gallery in gossamer fabric, outlined by floor-level light strips. the installation, accompanied by its own discreet soundtrack, retains the right angles of the space it defines, yet its hard lines are gently blurred with every ripple of air.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nsparkplug: states of being reopening jan. 15 and running through feb. 7 at district of columbia arts center, 2438 18th st. nw. open by appointment.\n\ndwayne eugene martin\n\nhands and hand prints, usually red but in one notable instance white, are motifs in dwayne eugene martin's paintings. these images might symbolize many things, but among the unambiguous meanings is work. the artist's honfleur gallery show, rise, features pictures of african american exploitation, rendered by martin with evident struggle and even anger. for the d.c. native, painting is a form of physical exertion, akin to the toil of the black people whose efforts are suggested (but not literally shown) in the hands that built america.\n\nad\n\nfar from a realist, martin combines graffiti's childlike directness with abstract expressionism's spontaneity. the paintings' backgrounds feature hard-edge, bright-colored patterning, punctuated by looser gestures and occasional text. when martin does depict a full human body, such as the manacled one in the potent enslaved, it's in the form of a black or brown stick figure with a circular head.\n\nenslaved is one of four large paintings on unstretched canvas that hang freely rather than hug the gallery wall. the informal presentation complements martin's style, which is visceral and improvisational. the way the paintings ripple in space suits their open-ended energy.
we should open schools not because it would be risk-free, but because schools are important, and the risks can be managed.\n\nclosing schools does help slow transmission of the virus. multiple studies in the united states, europe and elsewhere have shown that school closure has been associated with substantial reductions in community spread of covid-19. in many places, school closure had the strongest associations with reduced transmission of all control policies.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nit is likely that these strong associations have a lot to do with things other than transmission in schools themselves. early in the pandemic, school closure was one of the strongest markers of when communities started taking the threat of the virus seriously, and closing schools was usually one of the first interventions implemented. once closed in the spring, schools remained closed for in-person learning in most places in the united states throughout the summer, thanks to the usual vacation schedule. but because school closure is a marker of how seriously communities were taking the virus, they first closed right around the time that people started making a lot of other non-mandated behavior changes that helped to contain virus spread. closing schools itself also leads to behavior change, of course, as the need for people to stay home with children changes their patterns of social interaction in ways that can limit transmission.\n\nbut even if these factors explain some of the association between school closure and reduced transmission, the association is so strong that it strains credulity to claim that schools play no role in driving viral spread. not only is there a strong association between school closure and reduced transmission in almost every study, there have also been numerous outbreaks associated with schools, day cares and camps. schools are already known to drive transmission of other respiratory viruses, such as the flu and measles, both because of the frequency and closeness of interactions in school buildings and the ways in which schools bridge communities that might not otherwise interact. for schools not to be a major driver of sars-cov-2 transmission, something would have to be very different about this virus.\n\nthe thing people often point to as being different about sars-cov-2 is that children seem to be less likely to be infected with and transmit the virus than adults. most studies support this conjecture, and young children appear to be about one-half to one-third as likely to be infected by an infectious household member as working-age adults are. the evidence about transmission is less clear, though children are less likely to have symptoms and asymptomatic individuals are less likely to transmit. but even so, while they're in school, children have many more interactions than typical in adults. without effective mitigation measures, that could wash out their reduced susceptibility — potentially explaining similar or higher attack rates in young children in some school and camp outbreaks.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmany have seized on these moderate reductions in susceptibility and the relatively low number of reported super spreading events in schools to argue that schools are not major drivers of community transmission. but schools can still be the home of outbreaks and drive community transmission. even if attack rates in schools and the community appear to be similar, schools play an unique role in u.s. social life, and they link households and communities that may otherwise be unlikely to interact, providing opportunity for the virus to jump between them.\n\nand yet despite these risks, we strongly believe every effort should be made to keep schools open for in-person classes. not only have studies repeatedly shown the importance of early-childhood education for success in life, but in many communities, schools are the primary way in which food and other essential services are provided to poor students — the same students who are often worst-positioned to take advantage of online education. school closures have also placed a disproportionate burden on lower-income families and communities.\n\nthe trick is to open schools safely. mitigation measures such as required masking, class cohorting and physical barriers between desks can go a long way in reducing covid-19 transmission. different strategies should be developed for elementary-age children than for older students, because there are differences in the importance of schooling by age and because older children appear to be more susceptible to the virus compared with younger ones. critically, teachers need to feel safe and supported — without their buy-in, in-person learning is impossible. in particular, teachers should be near the front of the line when it comes to vaccination.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ndoing all that requires planning and resources — investments that have been inconsistently made across school districts. and it also requires frank and open conversations among stakeholders, which might be even more difficult than finding time and money for mitigation efforts. the barriers to doing so became evident to us even as we worked on this essay. a teacher who saw an early draft thought some of what we said would be used to justify opening schools without proper safety measures in place, while a parent who saw the same version felt that it would be used to justify closing schools until the virus is completely gone. we can only move forward safely with in-person learning by being honest about the risks posed by covid-19 in schools and the ways in which we can overcome them. if we fail to find a balanced path forward, we will be forced to either put teachers, students and families at risk from the virus or force them to suffer the costs of closed schools for many more months while we wait for the vaccine to curb transmission.
i know i am. as a freelancer in the gig economy, i try to be prepared for money hiccups. when i lost my biggest client late last year, i told myself not to panic. this is what my emergency fund is for. then a surprise five-figure tax bill slipped through my mail slot and swallowed that money, six months of living expenses, whole.\n\nlike most americans, when i look at my expenses, most of them are fixed. i can't cut back my monthly mortgage, health insurance or student loan costs. i don't have cable tv or other low-hanging fruit in my budget, so the need to save money leaves me staring down one big adjustable line item: food.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nafter taking the obvious first step of cutting way back on restaurants and prepared food, i had to look at my grocery receipts. as a writer and recipe developer, food is central to my work. but even if it weren't, i would still spend a lot of time in the kitchen because i love to cook. and when i'm not careful, i can really overspend on groceries. last year, $14-per-pound exotic mushrooms, $20 pastured chickens and $50 bottles of olive oil were not uncommon purchases. coming into 2019, i know this can't go on.\n\nin america, we don't have what the italians call cucina povera, a shared poverty cuisine passed down over millennia (though we certainly have regional cuisines shaped by slavery and economic inequality, like those of the reconstruction-era south and appalachia). there isn't a long history of famine here. but most other places in the world, across europe and china, people know how to eat well with less, said andrew coe, a food historian and co-author of a square meal: a culinary history of the great depression.\n\nduring the depression, he said, most americans, accustomed to a bland, meaty diet, followed the advice of the new bureau of home economics. they advocated a whole new way of eating that focused on getting the most bang from your buck nutritionally, he said. flavor, however, was not a consideration. recipes published by the bureau included baked onion stuffed with peanut butter.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nimmigrants, on the other hand, leaned hard on their traditional food cultures to enjoy meals even without much cash for ingredients. italians gathered wild dandelion greens from vacant plots, stewed them with olive oil and garlic, and served them over toast, coe said. sounds like a 2019 restaurant dish to me.\n\ni've always been inspired by my italian roots. my mother-in-law recalls her own italian grandmother foraging for greens. so it's no surprise that as i started meal planning on my new budget, the dishes i made skewed toward cucina povera.\n\nthough my food budget has, ahem, changed, i don't feel deprived at mealtime. fancy ingredients are wonderful, but i haven't always had them. as i started to shop on a newly strict food budget — $80 a week for my family of two, the u.s. department of agriculture's thrifty plan — it brought me back to my first journalism job, when my husband and i moved in together. we lived on our entry-level salaries making those early, painful student loan payments. we were on the thrifty plan without even knowing it, and it never occurred to me to feel deprived.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthis was the time i first fell in love with food, in fact. we shopped at discount grocery stores and cooked special dinners from scratch together. when i started to cut grocery spending in late 2018, i reverted to meal plans that mirrored what i cooked in my first kitchen back in 2003: simple, mostly vegetarian comfort food.\n\nback then, our date nights revolved around homemade pizzas. everyone loves pizza, but it is a special favorite of experts in thrifty treats, including beth moncel, author of the blog budget bytes and the book budget bytes: over 100 easy, delicious recipes to slash your grocery bill in half.\n\nwith a degree in nutritional science, moncel said healthy cooking and budget cooking overlap more than most people think. pizza is the perfect example. you want to really control how much of the expensive stuff you use, she said. with homemade pizza, you can use half the usual amount of cheese and not even notice.\n\nmy homemade pizza indeed calls for less cheese than many other recipes i've seen. the dough i make is nearly half whole-wheat flour, and i like plenty of vegetables for toppings. all these choices make pizza night an affordable, wholesome way to splurge.\n\nhere are other ways to cook well on a budget:\n\nad\n\nad\n\ncut down on food waste. it costs the average american $38 a month. when it comes to making pizza, i strategize to ensure that any leftover ingredients are portioned for long-term storage. for example, i buy decent mozzarella by the pound from a cheesemonger. i cut the block into five roughly 3-ounce pieces, using one for pizza now and wrapping the remaining four tightly and storing in a zip-top bag in the freezer for later.\n\ni start with a 28-ounce can of whole tomatoes, blitz them with my stick blender, and divide into five one-cup containers, using one and freezing the rest. even my dough recipe makes a spare ball to freeze for later.\n\nover the years, i have come to refer to this as the pizza system. it means i almost always have what i need to put a cheese pizza on the table without a trip to the store, and i never throw ingredients away. i try to apply this systematic, use-it-up thinking to all my meal plans.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbe flexible. pizza is adaptable, and if you have stray veggies in the fridge, chances are they will taste good on a pizza. but if i don't have anything on hand, i follow moncel's advice in the produce section. stick to hearty vegetables that don't spoil fast, she says. delicate, tender basil, arugula and baby spinach are out; robust kale and stout button mushrooms are in. but a bunch of kale and an eight-ounce package of mushrooms are more veggies than even i can fit on a pizza.\n\nenter the frittata, a dish that will run you about $1.25 per serving. this easy, economical, open-faced omelet rescues a wide variety of crisper rejects from the compost bin. frittata is good for breakfast, lunch or dinner; hot or cold; alone, with a salad, or in a sandwich. i don't think one bite of frittata has ever gone to waste on my watch. almost anything you like on top of pizza, you will like married with eggs in frittata form.\n\nenjoy making the best of things. another budget meal very close to my heart and heritage is pasta. i often think about the prison dinner scene ray liotta's character described in the movie goodfellas. it made me realize that, in movies at least, good meals are a kind of shorthand for a good life no matter what else is happening. each inmate brought a level of technique to their cooking. garlic was shaved to translucent thinness with a razor blade as the proper ratio of onions in sauce was debated. even in jail, characters made the best of their situation and enjoyed themselves

in some states, the sole surviving heir has the ability to convey title to buyers by working with the settlement agent, delivering additional documentation and delivering a deed to the buyer with the sole heir signing the document. but not all jurisdictions allow that process. your friend will have to talk to an attorney, settlement agent or title company where she lives to find out the best way to handle the title change.\n\nif your friend's mom died and had a will, she might have to probate the will. that means she would have to go to court and present the will before a judge. the judge would then accept the will as the document that would govern how your friend's mom's assets would get distributed. the first thing the judge might do is appoint or approve the executor of the will. once the executor is appointed, the executor can take actions to sell the assets of the estate.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin some circumstances, the probate court might require an appraisal of the property to sell the home, but if the will gives the home to your friend, the court would authorize the transfer of the home from the estate to your friend.\n\nthere are many other ways this could play out and we're just giving you a brief snapshot. what you face may be either easier or much harder. without more information, it's tough to know which way this will turn out.\n\nif your friend simply wants to sell the house, depending on the process that she needs to go through, she might just want to sell the property directly from her mom's estate to the intended buyer. a direct sale may save some costs and expenses. in places where recording documents and the process of conveying title is more cumbersome, taking care of the sale in one transaction might be more desirable than in a two-step process: transferring title from her mom to your friend and then from your friend to the intended buyer.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nanother thing to consider is the federal income tax consequences to the sale. given that your friend's mom recently died, your friend would inherit the home at its value at or around the time of her mom's death. so, we wouldn't expect your friend to pay any federal income taxes on the sale of the home. your friend's mom probably doesn't have to pay taxes on her estate unless her estate is in the millions of dollars. (currently, you only pay estate tax if the value of your estate is over $5,490,000 at the time of death.)\n\nhave your friend talk to an attorney where she lives to get a bit of guidance on how she should proceed to minimize the time and expense of selling the home.
ahead of the vote on rejecting the president's veto, senate republicans blocked a trump-endorsed effort to increase the size of stimulus checks from $600 to $2,000.\n\nthe move on checks prompted an angry response from the president. pathetic!!! trump tweeted. now they want to give people ravaged by the china virus $600, rather than the $2000 which they so desperately need. not fair, or smart!\n\nad\n\non jan. 1, the senate voted to pass a $741 billion defense authorization bill, ultimately overriding president trump's veto on the legislation. (the washington post)\n\nad\n\ntrump's last-minute push for larger pandemic relief checks had aligned him with senate democrats, who seized on the president's support to advocate for the increased payments, at a total cost of $464 billion.\n\nthe senate can start off 2021 by really helping the american people, senate minority leader charles e. schumer (d-n.y.) said. we can start off 2021 by sending $2,000 checks to struggling american families to carry them through the darkest and final days of this pandemic.\n\nbut senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) refused to bring the package passed by the house to the senate floor, dismissing it as socialism for rich people.\n\nfor months, trump's objections to the defense bill cast a shadow over negotiations between the house and senate over the measure, despite the fact that veto-proof, bipartisan majorities had voted in favor of earlier versions of the legislation.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin particular, sen. james m. inhofe (r-okla.), chairman of the senate armed services committee, argued that lawmakers would have to excise provisions ordering the removal of confederate names from bases in order to pass the bill. but by early december, inhofe gave up his protest and on friday, he cheered the passage of the defense bill over trump's objections.\n\nthe veto override also came as senate gop leaders were urging rank-and-file republicans not to join an effort to contest the 2020 election results when congress meets jan. 6 to certify the electoral college. earlier this week, sen. josh hawley (r-mo.) announced he would object to the results, delighting trump and paving the way for others in the senate to join him.\n\nwhile gop leaders have said they will let members vote their conscience, they also signaled their disquiet. i don't think anybody is anxious to do this, senate majority whip john thune (r-s.d.) told reporters friday, adding that in the end i don't think it changes anything.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe strong bipartisan majorities supporting the defense bill in both chambers represented a significant rebuke of the president, as it contains several repudiations of his policies as commander in chief.\n\nthe bill contains new restrictions on how much of the military's construction budget the president may move by emergency order — a direct response to trump's efforts to divert billions of the pentagon's dollars toward the border wall. it also limits the president's ability to draw down troop levels in germany, south korea and afghanistan — a move trump had planned over the objections of members of his own party.\n\nin his veto statement last month, trump included the measure's restrictions on troop deployments high on his list of grievances with the legislation. he also objected to the bill's mandate to the pentagon to change the names of installations honoring members of the confederacy. and he complained that the legislation did not include a repeal of a completely unrelated law — section 230 of the communications decency act — that gives technology companies certain liability protections from content third parties post to their websites.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ntrump has taken aim at section 230 as part of a larger campaign against social media companies like facebook, twitter and google, which he has accused of harboring anti-conservative bias.\n\nboth democrats and republicans agree that section 230 is flawed and in need of modification, but most lawmakers have bristled at trump's efforts to repeal it as part of the defense bill.\n\nin recent days, as the debate over stimulus checks threatened to hamper the defense bill override, mcconnell sought to short-circuit the debate by tying any increased checks to a repeal of section 230 and a commission to examine the 2020 election. neither that measure nor the original house-passed bill was ever brought to a floor vote in the senate. the combination, radioactive to democrats, quickly divided whatever support existed for the $2,000 checks proposal along political lines.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe national defense authorization act is now the first such bill in 60 years to become law by a congressional override vote, instead of the president's signature.\n\nthe defense bill also establishes new mechanisms for countering china and cyberthreats. it creates a pacific deterrence initiative to bolster efforts to counter china in asia, with an emphasis on containing chinese maritime forces. that initiative is modeled on a measure congress established in 2015 to counter russian aggression.\n\nthe legislation also establishes a new cybersecurity director position to better coordinate such activities government-wide. that effort follows a major breach of private companies and u.s. government agencies, including the treasury and state departments, by russian hackers working for the svr, russia's foreign intelligence agency.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ntrump has dismissed the defense legislation as a gift to china, complaining that it does not do enough to encourage the development of next-generation 5g networks in the united states.

it is not the senate's job to leap into the breach and search desperately for ways to get to 'guilty,'  mcconnell said. that would hardly be impartial justice. . . . if house democrats' case is this deficient, this thin, the answer is not for the judge and jury to cure it here in the senate. the answer is that the house should not impeach on this basis in the first place.\n\nfox news watchers are more committed to president trump than other americans. post media critic erik wemple went to fox nation's patriot awards to find out why. (the washington post)\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmcconnell criticized the house process as rushed and harked back to the good old days of 1999 and the trial of then-president bill clinton as the correct model to follow. no witnesses testified in person then, either, though mcconnell advocated it and three witnesses were deposed at the senate's request. as schumer has pointed out, the witnesses republicans wanted to appear in 1999 had already given grand jury testimony.\n\nin contrast, this time around, none of schumer's requested witnesses have been heard from in any form or forum. what's clear is that republicans fear what white house officials might say about trump and ukraine; democrats fear that trump will not only walk away from the impeachment but also win reelection. be afraid, be very afraid.\n\nit's a virtual certainty that trump will emerge relatively unscathed and, credibly, unfazed. not only are his supporters more stalwart than ever but, ahem, as i predicted a couple of columns ago, his base is expanding. since the impeachment proceedings began, 600,000 new donors have contributed to the republican national committee, according to axios. last week alone, just as the house judiciary committee adopted two articles of impeachment, the trump campaign and rnc together took in more than $10 million in small-dollar donations.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe democratic national committee made no such commensurate gains, though some democrats running against designated republican villains, such as rep. devin nunes (calif.), did see an uptick in fundraising.\n\nsuffice to say, the democrats have probably damaged themselves more than they have trump, whose approval ratings have remained relatively steady between a low of 35 percent in 2017 and a high of 46 percent in april 2019 — no matter what he does to whom, according to gallup. the latest realclearpolitics poll average has him at 44 percent approval, which is slightly higher than in early october.\n\nmeanwhile, the handful of democratic presidential candidates still clinging to variations of hope and change face off thursday at loyola marymount university in los angeles after barely dodging a close encounter with their own petards. a week-long cafeteria workers' strike at the school had threatened to shut down the debate, as no self-respecting democrat would cross a picket line.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nfortunately, negotiators were able to wrap things up, and the debate is on. you can feel the excitement. i confess, however, to minor disappointment. not that i have plans that night, but i had looked forward to these potential presidents joining the strikers.\n\nin my daydream, avuncular ol' joe biden would embrace every single worker. pete buttigieg would tell about the cafeteria lady he helped cross the street that time at harvard. andrew yang would skip the line and negotiate a universal basic income. warren would show up wearing a food worker's hair net in solidarity. bernie sanders would call larry david to stand in so he could go home and rest.\n\namy klobuchar would ask one of the strikers whether she could borrow a comb, having brought along her dinner salad. and, finally, billionaire tom steyer would walk the line shaking hands and muttering, i'm sorry, i'm sorry.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwhich is to say: unless a photo surfaces showing latecomer mike bloomberg shooting a polar bear while slurping an extra-large, sugar-laden soda, you can expect a trump sequel in 2020. sorry for the spoiler.
this will greatly slow what should be a straightforward process, but the bottom line is clear: unless vice president pence, in his presiding role as president of the senate, were to unexpectedly deviate from the procedures established by congress in 1887 — a truly lawless move that would be swiftly resisted by senators and representatives of both parties — the outcome remains inevitable.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nnonetheless, the fact that a dozen senators and senators-elect, along with apparently more than 100 house members, want to disrupt congressional ratification of the electoral college result is one more horrendous sign of the severity of the disease afflicting the united states' democratic system. it will make it even harder for biden to heal this pathology of partisan polarization, as he has promised to do.\n\nspecifically, cruz's group proposes a commission, modeled on the one used for the disputed hayes-tilden election of 1876, to investigate baseless allegations of election fraud raised by president trump and his allies since nov. 3. the senators would have the commission conduct a 10-day audit with full investigatory and fact-finding authority, and afterward individual states would evaluate the commission's findings and could convene a special legislative session to certify a change in their vote, if needed.\n\nfive problems with this idea:\n\nad\n\nad\n\nfirst, the analogy to the hayes-tilden dispute is altogether inappropriate. in 1876 there was a genuine basis for contestation. republican supporters of rutherford b. hayes were correct to claim that democrats in the south had terrorized and disenfranchised black voters; hayes clearly would have won if the equal right to vote, as guaranteed by the 15th amendment, had been enforced. democrats, in turn, defended samuel j. tilden's claim to victory in the disputed states by correctly observing that republican canvassing boards had carried out vote-counting fraud to yield higher totals for hayes.\n\nnothing remotely approaching those circumstances occurred in any state this year; just because trump keeps tweeting false allegations does not mean there is something to investigate. and as for the group's contention that the u.s. supreme court didn't consider trump's fraud claims, well, that's irrelevant: state courts were the proper venue for those claims, and they all dismissed them as baseless, as sen. patrick j. toomey (r-pa.) observed in his own condemnation of the cruz-led move saturday.\n\nsecond, congress needed a commission for the hayes-tilden election because congress itself was deadlocked: the senate backed hayes; the house, tilden. there is no such deadlock now: majorities in both the senate and house are sure to uphold biden's victory. cruz's call for a commission is just a ruse to prolong trump's attempt to sow doubt on the result when there should be none.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthird, cruz is incorrect to suggest that the hayes-tilden commission had full investigatory and fact-finding authority. the congress that created that commission was careful to avoid doing that, because it was hotly contested whether congress itself had the constitutional power to go behind the returns of a state's electoral college votes, and congress did not want to give the commission any powers that congress itself did not have. the commission itself resolved the dispute in favor of hayes by scrupulously avoiding fact-finding.\n\nfourth, congress cannot create a new commission in the context of the proceedings planned for jan. 6. the existing 1887 statute rejected the commission model, and instead wanted congress itself to handle any issues that might arise concerning a state's electoral votes — based on a set of rules that make conclusive whatever final determination a state's own courts reach. congress would need to repeal and replace the existing statute, which obviously won't happen before wednesday.\n\nfifth, cruz's idea that a state legislature could change its electoral votes based on a commission's work is especially unconstitutional — and also ironic given his reliance on the hayes-tilden precedent. that commission ruled for hayes in part because article ii of the constitution requires electors in all states to vote on the same day, and thus a state cannot change the appointment of its electors after they have voted. the electors voted on dec. 14, and it's too late for a change according to cruz's own example.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ncruz's statement purports to pay lip service to the values of democracy. but in fact it brazenly seeks to subvert those values.
sprawl in the chesapeake bay watershed, despite efforts at smart growth, continues at an unprecedented rate. growth occurs principally along transportation corridors; the main culprit is the federal highway system, which has been the silent ally of real estate development and urban sprawl.\n\ninterstate 81 in maryland, west virginia and pennsylvania has seen the growth of exurban developments, often with populations far larger than the town or village with which they share a zip code. increasingly, countryside is being replaced by mallside, with homogenized stores from coast to coast.\n\nin virginia and west virginia, sheep and cattle farms have given way to burgeoning neighborhoods of commuters who clog country roads and drive two hours each way to their workplaces.\n\nthe orchard belt of the chesapeake that once included hundreds of peach and apple farms in pennsylvania, maryland and virginia is being swallowed by development, noticeably on maryland's eastern shore. land is worth far more than the fruit it produces. as the suburbs spread outward in all directions from washington and baltimore, farmland is increasingly in demand for development.\n\nbut our countryside is not alone in being transformed out of existence. the u.s. geological survey says our rivers and seascapes are being changed by pollution and deforestation. the connectivity of wetlands, forest and wildlife habitat is being ruined through loss of vegetation and open space. small wonder that suburbanites are surprised at finding hungry black bears foraging in their garbage and deer eating their flowers.\n\nthe once-sleepy docks lined with oyster-packing houses in crisfield, md., give way to fancy, expensive high-rise condominiums owned by people who neither care about nor understand the local maritime culture and what is being lost.\n\nthroughout the chesapeake watershed, collectors are scooping up the remnants of maryland's oyster industry: packing cans, dredges, photographs, shucking tools. what was once a vibrant industry on the chesapeake has succumbed to disease, pollution, overharvesting and development. hundreds of packing houses from kent island, md., to oyster, va., have disappeared. oysters, which sold for $1.50 a gallon in 1974, now sell for more than that each in d.c. restaurants. soon, people will have difficulty trying to understand why a town in maryland was named bivalve.\n\neconomic change also adds to the ongoing transformation of our land. with tobacco fast fading from the chesapeake landscape, the old tobacco-curing barns become relics. tobacco reigned for four centuries as southern maryland's cash crop. now with that staple's disappearance, the tobacco barns have become an endangered species. since the state bought out maryland's tobacco farmers, their number has diminished from 1,000 to about 100.\n\nin the middle of the shenandoah valley or up the susquehanna river, one can get into traffic jams that resemble urban gridlock.\n\nit is neither change nor technology that threatens our lifestyle. it is political power, the force of domination. when a chesapeake waterman finds his crabs or oysters overwhelmed by toxins and effluents unleashed by corporations, he feels the rough hand of lobbyists who have worked behind the scenes to rewrite the sanitation laws. when orchard owners discover that their aquifer is being hijacked by new zoning regulations and developments so that they can't irrigate their trees in summer during drought, they feel the blunt instrument of real estate interests that want to grow money rather than crops.\n\nnot everything that is disappearing is just quaint or archaic. in the process of changing our landscape and seascape, we risk losing the essence of what defines us as a culture. as social critic james conaway wrote in his book vanishing america, we have to protest against our seeming national willingness to wreck nature and neighborhoods.\n\njohn wennersten is author of the chesapeake: an environmental biography and emeritus professor of history at the university of maryland at eastern shore.
but as cook acknowledged, apple's woes extend beyond shifting preferences in foreign markets. not only does apple's warning highlight the consequences of a slowing global economy, it brings to center stage enduring concerns about the company's ability to innovate and maintain its position as a cutting edge technology company despite crucial changes in the smartphone market and the relationship people have with their costly devices.\n\nin the modern iphone era last night was clearly apple's darkest day in our opinion and represents a challenging growth period ahead for the company (and its investors), daniel ives, an analyst at wedbush securities, said in a note to clients thursday. the biggest fear for apple investors, ives said, is a customer base that stalls out, failing to grow over the next few years and triggering a nightmare scenario decline. to stave off that possibility, apple could bank on future iphone redesigns and hope that more people choose to upgrade, or it could slash prices ahead of the next iphone release, with aims to boost demand in china.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbut cook's warning was alarming to investors for reasons that hit closer to home. in some developed markets, iphone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be, he wrote. cook went on to describe factors broadly impacting sales of its flagship product, including fewer sweeteners from carriers to reduce the cost of buying a new phone, higher prices and the tendency for iphone owners to hold on to their devices for longer periods of time, instead of indulging the latest upgrade.\n\nas the washington post's geoffrey fowler and andrew van dam wrote last month, apple extracts more money from frequent upgraders, but as product innovation slows, people are holding on to their iphone for three years or longer. that's a drastic change from just four years ago, when american consumers would pony up for the newest phone after about 24 months, according to the mobile analytics firm baystreet research. and when apple offers cheaper versions of the iphone, american consumers tend to pick the more expensive option.\n\nto make up for flat iphone sales, apple has simply started charging customers more money on average for newer models.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nperhaps in part because there are no easy fixes, apple failed to acknowledge the possibility that current iphone prices are simply too high, toni sacconaghi, an analyst at bernstein research, said in a note to investors thursday. the other real issue that apple's news release did not mention explicitly is that the high-end smartphone market is increasingly mature (having declined for 3 straight years) and the overall market contracted for the first time in 2018.\n\nthis insight is perhaps more concerning to apple and says more about the company's trajectory than the immediate impacts of slowing growth in china and washington's trade battle with beijing. if people who want a newish iphone already have one, and don't intend on buying the next one, then cook's ominous note isn't alarming because it came with unexpected urgency, it's alarming because it arrived so late. it's possible conditions in china changed quickly, but the broader trends in smartphone activity are not new. why didn't cook make any of these admissions before now? wrote bloomberg's shira ovide.\n\nin addition to consumers holding onto phones longer, cutting into apple's revenue, the company is also losing market share to rivals. according to november data released by the research firm idc, the chinese electronics manufacturer huawei commands 14 percent of the global smartphone market compared to apple's 13.2 percent, continuing a two-quarter streak of besting apple as the world's number two smartphone supplier. south korea-based samsung, the top smartphone company, has yet to disclose its full 2018 figures, but its market share is also sliding as chinese companies including huawei, oppo and xiaomi are on the rise, according to idc data.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ncook, who appeared on cnbc to play damage control after disclosing the revenue shortfall, was not that convincing, ross gerber, the president and chief executive of gerber kawasaki, said on twitter. gerber described cook's leadership at apple as a series of risks not taken, as other tech companies have soared by on genre-defining innovations or are betting on breakthroughs to come: lost iot in the home to amazon. no # ev future, missed tesla. no streaming future. missed netflix. still could pick up some disney. time for tim to go, he said, referring to the idea of apple taking the bold step of buying disney.
did you pause? are you considering how to change a little habit or overall philosophy in the way you parent? will you put your phone down more? get outside with them? make sure you have family dinner at least twice a week, or play a board game after school every other night? maybe you'll try to let go of the small things and stop nagging so much, or you'll finally work on getting that morning routine down. or, like my colleague terri rupar, perhaps it's time to draw a distinct line between work and family time (she's calling it uni-tasking, a phrase i might need to adopt).\n\ni'm not sure what my pause will result in, but so far i'm working on things like simply looking my children in the eyes when we speak more often, instead of half listening to them while i'm thinking about work, looking at the pile of laundry, wondering whether they finished their homework. that seems simple enough, right?\n\nad\n\nad\n\ni know making resolutions at this time of year can get a bad rap. but what's wrong with taking a moment and thinking about how to be a better, more engaged, less hovering parent? let us know what you're thinking in terms of parenting in the new year in the form here.\n\nif we collect enough interesting comments, we'll share them in a separate post here in a few days, and maybe we all can learn from each other.
more than most potential candidates for the president, warren seemed to be ready for the brickbats. the senator from massachusetts is the first high-profile democratic contender, with preexisting grass-roots support, a national fundraising network and credible poll numbers in early-voting states. four years ago, warren rejected a campaign to draft her into the presidential primary; since then, she has grown more influential in the party, introducing bills that would give workers more control of corporations, shrink the influence of lobbyists and turn the federal government into a generic-drug manufacturer.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwarren's also the first 2020 contender with a serious army of political enemies, most of them on the right, who have spent much of the past decade trying to stop her rise. it's not easy to be rep. john delaney (d-md.), who has toiled to raise awareness of his presidential campaign since july 2017. but he's been able to do so without republicans sending trackers, filing requests for public information and asking for ethics investigations. warren's most controversial decision of 2018 — to take a dna test and release the results — was spurred by six years of questions about why she once identified as native american.\n\nwarren's announcement can be fairly seen as the start of the 2020 democratic primary. the question for democratic voters is whom to nominate; the question for the press is whether we've learned anything from a 2016 campaign that made fools out of many experts. plenty of first-look commentary on warren is repeating the mistake that led many to suggest that donald trump could not win the 2016 republican nomination, or that sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) would be, at best, a token challenger for hillary clinton.\n\nso, we don't know who's going to win this thing. but we have a better idea of what is and isn't going to matter when democrats start piling in.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nfirst, the party in power is not great at guessing whom it should run against. it's an open secret that republicans consider warren to be the weakest top-tier democratic candidate. the arguments for that run from the sensible (president trump has defined her effectively as pocahontas) to the fanciful (she's a female baby boomer and trump already beat one of those). early polling backs some of this up; quinnipiac's pre-christmas survey found that 37 percent of voters already viewed warren negatively, more than any other democrat.\n\nthat would be compelling if not for two small details: barack obama and donald trump. both entered their primaries as underdogs seen by the other party's front-runners as beatable. in trump's case, democrats were literally rooting for him to succeed; a memo published after the hack of clinton campaign emails revealed that the democratic front-runner wanted far-right candidates such as trump to serve as pied pipers, serenading the rest of their party off a cliff.\n\nwe need to be elevating the pied piper candidates so that they are leaders of the pack and tell the press to [take] them seriously, the campaign wrote.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthat email was sent in april 2015. one month later, a quinnipiac poll showed clinton leading trump by 18 points.\n\nsecond, the establishment isn't operating the way it used to. one of the great paradoxes of the last democratic primary season is that the forces that lost — supporters of sanders — routed the forces that won. for more than a year, they fought for, and won, changes to the democratic primary rules that eliminated the voting power of superdelegates on the first ballot at any convention. at the same time, they won commitments from the democratic national committee that set up earlier debates and prioritized candidates with grassroots fundraising. the rules that infuriated sanders supporters in 2016, allowing clinton to build a huge delegate lead before facing her opponents, have been overturned.\n\nbut the party is not behaving the way it did in 2016. by this point in the previous cycle, 63 democratic members of congress had already endorsed clinton, who was months away from announcing her campaign. as of right now, no democratic member of congress has endorsed a potential presidential candidate. the idea of candidates jumping in to prevent a rallying effect for someone else is, for now, defunct, and the results in 2016 (such as sanders's landslide win in new hampshire) cut against the idea that endorsements from prominent democrats can move votes.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwhat don't we know? well, for the first time since 2004, democrats have a wide-open primary field with no establishment favorite, and not much of an establishment to decide on one. the 2008 and 2016 primaries eventually settled into battles between clinton, representing the old party leadership, and a candidate who could define himself as a change agent. some democrats see joe biden potentially filling that establishment role, but none see him consolidating party support the way clinton did.\n\nthird, the two parties' voters are different. the most interesting aspect of warren's launch video was how it diverged from the messaging of every recent democratic nominee for president. in 2016, republicans got behind a candidate who argued that there was no compromise with the political class and that a strong leader was needed to dismantle it. democrats have generally argued that good people can differ and unite against the minority of special interests keeping the government from answering voters' needs.\n\nwhat's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics — the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems, obama said in the first speech of his 2008 campaign.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwarren's first message to voters is different, identifying the economic anxieties of voters and then immediately assigning blame. these aren't cracks families are falling into — they're traps, she says in her launch video. america's middle class is under attack. how did we get here? billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie. and they enlisted politicians to cut them a bigger slice.\n\nlike sanders, who may end up joining the race, warren simply does not use the language of compromise or national unity; she uses the language of resistance. as they pile into the race, some democrats will find themselves arguing for a return to the less divisive politics of the pre-trump era, while others, such as warren, will call for a president to dismantle the financial forces that made trump's win possible. to those in the latter camp, trump never could have won had he not been able to define himself as a blue-collar billionaire against clinton's wall street supporters; for them, in 2020, the job will be giving him an opponent who can make a populist case against him.\n\nwhat we don't know is how much democratic voters crave that. for a very long time, democratic voters told pollsters that they wanted leaders who could compromise with the other party. from 2017 to 2018, according to pew research, the proportion of democrats saying that fell from 69 percent to 46 percent.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthat's still a substantial bloc of voters, and in interviews with iowa democrats last month, the post found plenty of them worrying that a divisive candidate could not win the presidency. the forces that ended up giving the republican nomination to trump do not exist on the left. what is motivating democratic voters? thanks to warren, we'll find out pretty soon.\n\nwhat i'm watching\n\nwhat will the left do? there has been a clamor for elizabeth warren to run for president since the day she arrived in the senate. now that she's in, some of the first notes of skepticism came from people who had pined for her to do this four years ago. the reason: the left found a champion in 2016, and few people who consider themselves part of the left want to see warren face off against bernie sanders.\n\nif bernie does or doesn't get in, my concern is whether the progressive vote splits up and we have the same kind of nominee we had last time, said one early-state operative who was still deciding which candidate to work for. it would be great to have one strong, progressive voice. it's not going to happen.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthere's plenty of overlap between warren and sanders on policy, and both are likely to get rounded into one of the press's lanes or tiers as the left's potential candidate. but one of the most interesting debates inside the democratic party right now is between sanders's democratic socialism and warren's reformed progressivism. by doing so well in 2016, sanders exploded the popularity of a political philosophy that had been sidelined in the united states for 100 years; warren hasn't had the same platform to spell out what she stands for.\n\none of the best elucidations of the two politicians' differences came last year from david dayen, who's set to become the editor of the liberal magazine the american prospect. warren, wrote dayen, wants to make capitalism work for everyone, while sanders does not think it can.\n\nyou can restructure markets so everyone benefits, or you can break down the market system, either eliminating the profit motive or giving everybody a public option, dayen wrote. the impulse is the same: the game is rigged and must be fixed. but there's a long gap between re-writing the rules of the game, as warren wants, and turning over all the chess pieces, as sanders does.\n\nad\n\nad\n\njacobin founder bhaskar sunkara, who (as noted above) was skeptical that warren could win her state's primary, has warned that socialists can't depend on her to deliver systemic change. sanders's politics grew out of the fading socialist movement; warren's grew out of research into bankruptcy.\n\nshe'll have the problems sanders had early on in 2015, and i don't see her catching fire, sunkara said.\n\ndems in disarray\n\ndemocrats now expect rep. nancy pelosi to become the next speaker of the house after she put down several small rebellions by centrists. but at least one house democrat is already facing a primary challenge over her refusal to back pelosi (d-calif.), and at least nine more are being looked over by left-wing groups that want to continue moving the party in their direction.\n\nnew york activist siela bynoe is considering a challenge to rep. kathleen rice (d-n.y.), one of pelosi's most persistent critics, and her supporters are circulating a poll that suggested the pelosi issue could make rice vulnerable. while rice's personal approval rating in her long island district was 70 percent — higher than pelosi's — the pollster found a slight majority of democrats open to opposing rice once informed that she opposed the democratic leader.\n\nkathleen rice has fatally misjudged democrats in her district, said evan roth smith of slingshot strategies, which conducted the poll. sixty-five percent of primary voters want to see unity among democrats, and less than half say they're likely to vote for rice again after her opposition to pelosi. rice may think she's taking a principled stand, but primary voters see it as craven political grandstanding and are punishing her accordingly.\n\nrice's 4th district is not quite as blue as the typical democratic primary battlefield. republican candidates for president regularly win around 44 percent of its vote, more than double their support in rep.-elect alexandria ocasio-cortez's 14th district. but sean mcelwee of data for progress is conducting polls in 10 districts, a mixture of places where moderate incumbent democrats represent much more liberal electorates and places where certain votes or issues could create an opening for a challenger.\n\n2020\n\nbernie sanders. dozens of veterans from his 2016 campaign are seeking a meeting on sexual harassment policy — a meeting that broke into public view thanks to alex thompson at politico.\n\nmichael bloomberg. the billionaire said on meet the press that he'll make a decision on a 2020 run in january or february and that any serious candidate needs to focus on climate change.\n\nterry mcauliffe. the former virginia governor told cnn that he is obviously looking at a presidential bid, then distinguished his support for universal health care from the versions endorsed by liberal democratic senators: we have to actually pay for what we're actually promising.\n\nelizabeth warren. she's en route to iowa for the first time in years, barring any complications with the senate's schedule. a tentative itinerary reviewed by the post has her in council bluffs, sioux city, storm lake and des moines.\n\nreading list\n\nhow elizabeth warren is courting black voters and their leaders, by annie linskey\n\ncan a candidate like warren break through in a race with a credible, female black candidate? she's finding out.\n\nhe doesn't exactly have the president's ear, but buchanan's political thinking neatly lines up with trump's. here he makes an argument you might hear a lot of on the right — that the growing diversity of the democratic party's coalition will weaken it ahead of 2020.\n\nthe 2020 book primary is on, by david siders\n\na funny (or at least laugh so you don't cry) look at the unmemorable memoirs that democrats are going to force every reporter to read ahead of the primaries.\n\ncountdown
it'll be a joyous day, jifunza said of the trip to the sarasota county supervisor of elections office, a journey made possible when voters in november overturned florida's 1868 ban blocking residents with felony convictions from automatically having their voting rights restored once they served their sentences.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin the run-up to tuesday, the organizations and volunteers who worked for the past decade to pass the amendment to the state constitution have been ramping up their efforts to encourage ex-felons to quickly follow through. there's a toll-free number, 877-my-vote-0, and a website with tips.\n\nwe're kicking this into a higher gear now, said neil volz, political director of the bipartisan florida rights restoration coalition. pro-bono attorneys will be on call in case problems crop up in the coming weeks.\n\nat a strategy meeting in sarasota in december, a small group of returning citizens — the term many people prefer over ex-felon — hashed out ideas on getting people motivated. it was one of more than a dozen such meetings across the state held by coalition members, which were made more urgent after some lawmakers suggested that amendment 4 should not take effect until the legislature can review it.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nsupporters insist the legislature does not need to do a thing.\n\nthe amendment was written to be self-executing. it goes into effect on jan. 8, and we can register that day, volz stressed. he will be in line himself in lee county, a dozen years after he pleaded guilty to felony conspiracy in the jack abramoff lobbying scandal in washington. my supervisor of elections assured me that my registration form will be accepted.\n\nthe sarasota meeting was held on the same day that gov.-elect ron desantis (r) backed a delay so that lawmakers could consider how ex-felons' registration should be implemented. to many, the timing is suspect: the legislature does not convene until march, but municipal elections in florida begin in february. all democratic candidates running for statewide office in november endorsed the amendment. republican candidates largely did not, including desantis and gov. rick scott (r), who beat incumbent bill nelson (d) in the u.s. senate race.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nat the polls, the measure was approved by nearly two-thirds of voters. we view this as a delay tactic, volz said of desantis's comment.\n\nbut the amendment may prove an unexpected political boon for the state's gop. many republicans opposed granting voting rights to ex-felons because they assumed most would register as democrats. it's a reasonable assumption because more than 21 percent of african americans in florida can't vote given felony convictions, and blacks are a much stronger presence in the democratic party here. (they represent 29 percent of registered democrats, vs. only 1 percent of registered republicans.)\n\nstill, if democrats expect to see an immediate windfall of new party voters, they should take a closer look.\n\nad\n\nmany ex-felons involved in the movement to restore voting rights did not want to reveal their political preferences while they were pushing amendment 4, but they are much more relaxed about discussing those now. a lot are conservatives who say they will register as republicans. even more are planning to register as npa — no party affiliation.\n\nad\n\nlance wissinger, 39, of fort myers, wants to be able to vote for president trump in 2020. i'm a huge donald trump fan, he boasted after the meeting in sarasota.\n\nwissinger, who runs a drone operations business, was found guilty of a felony in a dui accident that killed his best friend. he served his time, paid his fines and now wants to be treated like any other citizen.\n\nad\n\nmy business has contracts with the city, but i can't vote for the city council members, he said.\n\nadam knight also favors trump — and most republicans — though he may register as an independent. the 32-year-old, who manages a conference center in labelle in hendry county, was convicted of drug charges in washington state when he was a teenager. he served his time there, moved to florida and found out he could not vote unless he went through a lengthy process involving the state's clemency board. had he stayed in washington, his voting rights would have been restored automatically after he completed his sentence.\n\nad\n\nknight wants to see changes in the criminal justice system so that defendants will be treated more fairly. he says politicians of both parties should be aware that newly registered voters like him will be watching them carefully.\n\nad\n\nwe'll be paying attention to these issues, he said. judges, state attorneys — if they're handing out harsh sentences for drug offenders, they're going to have to change some of the stuff they do.\n\nand then there's allan rhyelle, a vietnam veteran and purple heart recipient who lost his right to vote in 2008 after being sentenced to probation and community service for a felony charge of cultivating marijuana.\n\na video produced by the florida aclu in support of amendment 4 featured rhyelle, 72, talking about how veterans have defended the right to vote around the world. we need to defend it in florida also. now that the measure has passed, he wants vets who have been through the criminal justice system to register — and politicians to take note of them as a new voting bloc.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ntuesday morning, his wife will go with him to the sarasota county supervisor of elections office. he intends to sign up as an independent. i've become so embittered with the whole system and the way they all treat veterans, he said. but i'll be there registering. i'm very excited to get to vote again.\n\nyet one ex-felon who campaigned for amendment 4 and would love to cast a ballot as a democrat will not be registering.\n\nkaren leicht, 61, is a senior paralegal in miami who was released from prison in 2013 after serving 28 months for insurance fraud. a lifelong republican from a republican family, her political views changed when she was behind bars.\n\nad\n\ni saw what most of those women were in for, she recounted from her office. minor drug offenses, small things they had done to try and feed their kids or keep their family together. and when they get out, they're not full citizens. . . . we all deserve a second chance. and i saw the republican machine try to destroy the voting rights of these people. it made my stomach churn.\n\nad\n\nuntil leicht completes every part of her sentence, however, she is still blocked from registering. the amendment requires that all fines first be paid, and leicht's conviction came with a $52 million restitution order, an amount far beyond her means. her only hope is to someday get that dismissed; until then, she's not going to risk anything. and she understands why other ex-felons, even if they have satisfied all aspects of their sentences, might hesitate to register.\n\nthe state's elections website still has not been updated to reflect florida's new reality, and leicht fears the old language could scare some people off. amendment 4 covers ex-felons except for those convicted of murder and sex offenses.\n\nhere's the thing about returned citizens, she said. a lot of them are gun-shy. they don't want to do anything that could cause any kind of issue.\n\nad\n\noutgoing secretary of state ken detzner said in december that the measure should not take effect until lawmakers could provide guidance. but incoming elections chief michael ertel, a desantis appointee, told the orlando sentinel just days ago that he does not see why voter registration for ex-felons who have finished their sentences can't begin tuesday.\n\nlongtime civil rights leader howard simon agrees and notes that eligible individuals do not even have to go to an office to do it. he recommends registering online, right after the law kicks in at 12:01 a.m. tuesday and before anybody can try to stop sign-ups.
baker, who turns 68 in june, will return in 2017 seeking his first world series title in his 22nd season as a manager. but his future beyond 2017 is unclear because his contract is slated to expire after the season. he is, essentially, a lame-duck manager at the moment. but that could change before opening day, because the nationals are willing to talk to baker about extending his contract. the two sides haven't broached the topic yet, however, according to people with knowledge of the situation.\n\ni don't know, baker said at the winter meetings last month when asked about his future beyond next season. tell you the truth, the way i look at it — between my family, my hunger, between, you know, the prayers that i send up looking for answers and looking for clues — it will come to me, you know? some of it's in your control, and some of it's out of your control. if it was in my control, i wouldn't have been out two years in the first place, but you can't hire yourself.\n\nbaker signed a two-year contract with $4 million guaranteed, plus another potential $3 million in incentives, in november 2015 after the nationals initially offered the job to bud black and had contract negotiations deteriorate. the black episode wasn't the first odd incident the nationals have experienced with managers in their short history; in 2011, jim riggleman abruptly resigned in late june because washington wasn't prepared to exercise his option.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwashington could avoid any messes by extending baker — if baker wants to continue managing in 2018, a quarter-century after his first season as a skipper with the giants in 1993. baker is the second-oldest manager in the majors — he's a couple weeks younger than mets manager terry collins — but insists that age didn't slow him after an unexpected two-year hiatus from the dugout.\n\npeople put too much credence on age, baker said. a lot of my friends are musicians, and most of them have young musicians tutoring under them. instead of the young musicians trying to get them out of there, they trying to hang with them and learn some chords from them while they're still on this earth and get some knowledge from them.
but the partial government shutdown has deepened the lull.\n\nbusiness owners, taxi drivers and others who rely on foot traffic have watched revenue slump as parts of the government ground to a halt. should the shutdown persist for months or even years, as president trump said it could friday, its effect on the district will only worsen.\n\nad\n\nthis isn't the district's first go-round with a government shutdown, though it's already one of the longest.\n\nad\n\nin 2013, the federal government suspended operations for 16 days as congress sparred over the affordable care act. the longest shutdown was in 1995. it lasted three weeks.\n\nprevious standoffs have taught business owners and tour guides how to adapt.\n\nsix years ago it was like, 'oh my god, the city's shut down. we're going to have to cancel our trip.' but now, we've all been here before and people are realizing a lot of what d.c. has to offer has nothing to do with the federal government, said elliott ferguson, president of destination dc, the city's tourism arm. they've realized a government shutdown doesn't mean we've put a padlock on new york avenue.\n\nhotels are seeing fewer cancellations than in past shutdowns, ferguson said, and fewer tour groups have called destination dc in a panic. two conventions scheduled this month are expected to bring about 27,000 people and $33 million to the city.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nright now, we're all hoping that this will end soon, ferguson said. but in the meantime, we want everyone to know d.c. is open for business.\n\ngetting that message out has been a challenge for small businesses, especially those near closed attractions.\n\nyael krigman, owner of baked by yael, a bakery across from the national zoo, said she's leaned more heavily on catering and cake pop parties in lieu of the usual zoo-goer foot traffic.\n\nit hasn't been easy.\n\nit's not as though january was going to be our best season anyway, but that's why we really rely on the zoo even more than in other months, because people aren't sending gifts and throwing parties as much as they do in december or february, krigman said. but people still go to the zoo — when it's open.\n\nad\n\nprivate museums have worked with tour guides to fill gaps in tourists' schedules left by shuttered public attractions. the newseum and madame tussauds wax museum are offering free admission for furloughed federal workers.\n\nduring shutdowns, we always see an increase — especially of tour groups who are trying to change their itineraries at the last minute, said sonya gavankar, director of public relations for the newseum.\n\nthe national geographic museum isn't fully operational, with two rotating exhibits closed for construction, but spokeswoman lexie de los santos said the museum also has seen a significant increase in the number of people visiting.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nstill, museum officials and city leaders say no one wants to see the shutdown persist.\n\nduring a shutdown, there are no winners and our nation's federal workers, including the 170,000 federal employees who work in washington, dc, pay the highest price, d.c. mayor muriel e. bowser wrote in a letter to trump last week.\n\ndawit kassa, 41, a full-time lyft driver from arlington who works primarily in downtown washington, said his earnings have been halved since the shutdown began.\n\nduring periods that would normally be busy, kassa has sat idle up to 40 minutes between calls. usually, he said, he has another ride lined up by the time he's dropping a customer off.\n\nad\n\nit's so slow, he said. and it's not just me. you know, drivers talk. we call each other. i have friends who drive taxis and uber and we all call each other to ask, 'hey, do you have a ride?' everyone who works out here on the street is suffering.\n\nad\n\nunemployment claims in the district since the shutdown began exceeded 1,200 as of friday, which marked a full pay period for unpaid federal workers.\n\nclaims typically spike during shutdowns because federal workers are not guaranteed back pay and government contractors lose their source of income.\n\nduring the 16-day shutdown in 2013, the city processed about 5,000 unemployment claims. district officials expect to meet or exceed that number, depending on how long the present shutdown lasts. about 800,000 workers around the country are affected, with about a quarter of the federal government shuttered.\n\nad\n\nas the sun set friday, a smattering of tourists posed for pictures on the mall outside wrought iron fences.\n\nminwa and khafe oshingbemi, a married couple from nigeria, took turns taking photos that appeared to show each being pricked by the top of the washington monument. it was their first time in washington.\n\nad\n\nwhat are we going to do? minwa oshingbemi said with a shrug. we're here now.\n\na few feet away, a tour guide on a segway rolled past, trailed by a line of visitors.\n\nusually, this is just overflowing with people, he said. not today.
casino mogul sheldon adelson at the republican national convention in 2016. (ricky carioti/the washington post)\n\njust 11 donors have injected $1 billion into u.s. political races in the past eight years through super pacs, the big-money entities that have given wealthy contributors a powerful way to influence elections.\n\nthe donors — a bipartisan collection of hedge-fund billionaires, entrepreneurs, media magnates and a casino mogul — together contributed more than one-fifth of the $4.5 billion collected by these types of political action committees since their inception in 2010, according to a washington post analysis of data from the federal election commission and the nonpartisan center for responsive politics.\n\nthe list of the 11 biggest super-pac donors comprises five republicans, five democrats and former new york mayor michael bloomberg, who previously had declared himself a political independent and this month registered as a democrat.\n\nthe intense concentration of money shows how a tiny group of super-rich individuals has embraced these political groups, which have emerged as indispensable allies of candidates and political parties since the supreme court's landmark citizens united decision in 2010. that ruling helped give rise to super pacs, which are allowed to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money on political activity.\n\nthe massive sums coming from just a handful of donors illustrate how candidates and parties are now dependent on billionaires to support their efforts — and demonstrate the successful circumvention of efforts to curtail big money in politics that followed the watergate and 1996 democratic national committee fundraising scandals.\n\nthe big donor is not just a donor who gives to politicians and parties, said robert e. mutch, a campaign-finance historian. the big donor has become a political actor in his own right.\n\nmany of the top 11 super-pac givers since 2010 are now well-known protagonists in u.s. politics. billionaire hedge-fund founders george soros (no. 10) and tom steyer (no. 2) were among the mrore than a dozen critics of president trump targeted with explosive devices this week. and bloomberg (no. 3) and steyer are viewed as positioning themselves for possible presidential runs.\n\nbig money has continued to balloon in this year's midterms, even amid a surge of small-dollar donations. in some races, huge super-pac contributions are bolstering candidates who are touting their grass-roots support. for example, katie hill, a first-time democratic candidate in california's 25th congressional district and one of the most successful fundraisers this election, is also being buoyed by $4.5 million in ads in the final stretch of the campaign, thanks to independence usa, bloomberg's super pac.\n\n[meet the wealthy donors pouring millions into the 2018 elections]\n\nthe largest super-pac contributors are casino mogul sheldon adelson and physician miriam adelson, the married couple who have given $287 million to conservative super pacs, records show.\n\nin the 2016 elections, the adelsons gave nearly $78 million, including $20 million to bolster then-gop nominee donald trump, who as president backed an action the couple had long sought — moving the u.s. embassy in israel from tel aviv to jerusalem.\n\nthis cycle, the adelsons have given $112 million to super pacs, largely to groups working to help the gop retain control in congress.\n\na representative for the adelsons did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nin second place behind the adelsons is steyer, who has given $213.8 million. he is followed by bloomberg ($123.4 million), democratic media executive fred eychaner ($68 million), democratic hedge-fund executive donald sussman ($62.9 million), republican shipping-supplies magnate richard uihlein ($59.9 million), democratic hedge-fund founder james simons and his wife, marilyn ($57.9 million), republican hedge-fund executive paul singer ($41.9 million), republican hedge-fund executive robert mercer ($40.9 million), soros ($39.4 million) and republican backer and td ameritrade founder j. joe ricketts ($38.4 million).\n\ntheir total giving could be substantially more. while donors to super pacs are disclosed, public filings do not reflect contributions to politically active nonprofit groups that are not required to reveal their donors.\n\n\n\nhedge-fund founder tom steyer at a march event in largo, md. while he is a top decmocratic super-pac donor, he calls the rise of big money in politics corrosive and corrupting. (jahi chikwendiu/the washington post)\n\nsuper pacs are prohibited from coordinating with campaigns and party committees. but they often act on parallel tracks, and with each election these groups have found ways to work even more closely with the candidates they are backing. by 2016, super pacs of presidential contenders were conducting their own advertising campaigns, research, polling and voter turnout activities in support of their favored candidates.\n\nsuper pacs have stepped in to take over a lot of the campaign functions that we used to expect from candidates, said david magleby, a brigham young university political-science professor who studies super pacs. they're playing a very large role in virtually every part of the american democracy.\n\ncritics say super pacs allow wealthy donors to have a disproportionate influence on politics.\n\none thing is clear — super pacs are a rich man's game, said meredith mcgehee, executive director of issue one, a nonpartisan group that seeks to lessen the influence of big money on politics. they're trying to exert influence because they believe whatever particular party they are supporting is either in ideological agreement with the donor or because they have business or other interests that they believe those particular sets of candidates will be sympathetic to.\n\ndavid keating, an opponent of campaign finance restrictions who helped bring a case, speechnow.org v. fec, that led to the creation of super pacs, said the groups help political donors exercise their right to free speech.\n\nrich people have first amendment rights, too, keating said.\n\n[democratic candidates in competitive senate, house races see infusion of cash in final stretch of midterms]\n\nsteven law, president of the senate leadership fund, which is aligned with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) and has received big checks from the adelsons, said he could not speculate on what motivates individual donors.\n\nbut law said that the recent supreme court confirmation battle over brett m. kavanaugh highlighted for our donors the importance of the supreme court and the lengths to which democrats would go to block all future nominations if they got control of the senate.\n\n\n\n\n\nafter initially shunning super pacs when they came on the scene in 2010, democrats have since embraced them with gusto.\n\nin an interview, steyer said he agrees with the critics of citizens united and said the rise of big money in politics is corrosive and corrupting and has led us to a terrible place.\n\nhe said he views his super-pac contributions — more than $50 million this cycle, largely to two super pacs he started — as a way of fighting fire with fire.\n\nif you look and see where the overwhelming bulk of our money has gone, it's to try to organize and engage people in the political process around the country, steyer said.\n\nbloomberg — who has spent more than $61 million supporting democrats this cycle, a figure that could soar to $100 million — is working for a change of direction in washington, according to a spokesman.\n\nmany of the top super-pac donors on the left have plowed their money into the main party-aligned super pacs — priorities usa action, senate majority pac and house majority pac.\n\njeb fain, spokesman for house majority pac, said the group is proud to have strong and continuing support from its donors. their contributions have helped the group launch a barrage of advertisements and fill spending gaps by working with our allies to ensure total democratic spending matches or exceeds republicans in the critical races we need to win in order to flip the house, he said.\n\ndemocratic strategists said that accepting large donations is necessary to combat the money on the right — particularly the resources of the koch network, a well-established constellation of organizations and donors, notably billionaire industrialists charles and david koch, that is unmatched by any network on the left. (david koch retired from business and political life in june amid declining health.)\n\nsince 2010, democrats have scraped and clawed to compete with the koch brothers, sheldon adelson and richard uihleins of the world that have contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to republican election efforts, said j.b. poersch, senate majority pac's president. donors give to senate majority pac because they know we give them the best opportunity to cancel out the koch brothers and elect democrats to the senate.\n\nanu narayanswamy contributed to this report.
before i go any further, i need to say i am a conservative white male, he wrote in the second paragraph.\n\nwhat followed was not what you might expect: a belittling of my beliefs and an extolling of his. this was not that type of email.\n\nthis was an extended hand from a man i have come to think of as my politest critic.\n\nwe are beginning this year with our country so divided and our leaders so firmly split that the government is partially shut down. museums are closed. trash is overflowing in national parks. and people are going unpaid. this should indicate to all of us that conversations are not going to get easier in the coming year, which leaves us with a choice. we can avoid talking to people who make us uncomfortable, even outraged. or we can try to listen to them and hope they will listen to us, too.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe latter won't necessarily change minds — nothing will convince me that a wall between the united states and mexico is a good idea — but it might improve how we treat one another and, if nothing else, it will move us away from name-calling and snark and force us to analyze and sharpen our own arguments.\n\ni can say this with some confidence, because i recently read through all the exchanges i had last year with readers who sent critical emails. a less masochistic person would have probably deleted them.\n\nthis is what i learned from scrutinizing them:\n\nthere are some people who want to spew hate at someone for no reason other than their own gratification. their emails are usually filled with a lot of obscenities and no substance. one man likes to send me pictures of bill clinton flicking me off. i can't tell if that man is a republican or a democrat. another man curses at me in spanish. i still don't know if it's his native language or if he thinks it's mine.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthere are other people who have grown so used to being ignored, they are surprised when they get a response. here are highlights from one exchange i had with a man who didn't agree with a column i wrote about harvard's affirmative action case:\n\nhim: your article will line the cages of dozens of parrot and small birds but will not have much more of an effect on society than to absorb poop, ironic because that's what i felt after reading your dumb work — that i had absorbed poop. ivy league just took away what little sense you had and left you talking like an idiot.\n\nme: it's obvious from your email that you feel strongly about this issue, which is why i'm taking the time to write you back (and overlooking that you called me an idiot).\n\nad\n\nhis reply, after explaining that he felt he was writing into a vacuum, expecting no response or one that painted him as a racist: this explains my crudity; writing emails to post authors is kind of like a combination of orwell's two minutes of hate and screaming into the grand canyon for me. so all of that to say, thanks for writing back with such civility.\n\nad\n\nthen, of course, there is my politest critic.\n\ni have never met him. i know only that he is a 58-year-old father of two who attended one year of community college and has been married for more than 30 years.\n\nin that first email, he wrote that my columns seemed to at least try to include a look at the perspective from the other side and suggested that if we ever met, we'd probably have an enlightening discussion.\n\nad\n\nwhile i generally disagree with the liberal viewpoint on what's wrong and how it should be fixed, i do understand it comes from an admirable place of caring, love and respect for everyone, he wrote. i also feel a conservative view can come from the same place, and it's time we allow that to happen. i would love to be able to be more vocal myself on today's issues, but it seems any thoughts outside of the liberal view puts you at risk of ridicule, losing friends and/or employment.\n\nad\n\ni wrote him back, because i try to reply to everyone who emails, unless they are blatantly sexist or racist. and even then, i sometimes reply. but i also wrote him back because a line in his email struck at the core of why i became a reluctant columnist last year and my hopes for the upcoming year.\n\nhe had written, i firmly believe there is no way we can move forward without reasonable acceptance of dialogue from other viewpoints.\n\nad\n\nsince then, he has written me more emails, and i have come to expect, and value, them because they have forced me to think harder about my own beliefs and look at issues through eyes outside of my own.\n\nafter the column on affirmative action, he wrote to share his own experience of earning a place in a class of new recruits for the fire department, a dream of his, and then having that offer rescinded when someone realized all the top recruits were white.\n\nad\n\nit's important to remember for everyone who is lifted by any form of affirmative action, there is someone who gets screwed and it affects their life, he wrote. some are able to move on. some turn republican. some turn quietly racist. some do worse. i don't know what the answer is, but actions based solely on race are not the solution and divide us. we need to have reasonable discussions with everyone invited to the table.\n\nad\n\nhe then added, because he's polite:\n\nthanks for taking the time to read this. like i said before, even though i believe you and i would disagree on many issues, i do believe you are open to those who do not think like you. i hope i am too.
to explain the impeachment inquiry, the gop has promulgated a flurry of baseless conspiracy theories about the forces arrayed against president trump. it has been surreal to hear some of the nation's most influential elected officials spouting ideas basically concocted from thin air. the house intelligence committee's ranking republican, devin nunes (calif.), denounces ukrainian election meddling in 2016 . . . aimed against the trump campaign. the judiciary committee's louie gohmert (r-tex.) claims that if congress could only talk to a certain three democratic officials, then every fact of this investigation would be unearthed. conservatives online hold that former white house aide fiona hill was a mole planted by george soros.\n\nof course, no one purveys these theories with as much verve as trump. the president has suggested that the nation's first african american president was born abroad (he wasn't), that the father of sen. ted cruz (r-tex.) had a part in jfk's assassination (he didn't), that ukraine rather than russia was responsible for election interference (it wasn't), that the mueller investigation empaneled by his own administration was a democratic plot against him, that the clintons orchestrated the prison killing of accused sex trafficker jeffrey epstein (who committed suicide, according to an autopsy) and that the obama administration spied on his campaign, a claim most recently debunked by the justice department's inspector general.\n\nit certainly appears, more than ever, that the truth itself is on trial, as peter baker recently wrote in the new york times. some conservatives say trump, and trumpism, represent a new frontier of conspiratorial politics — that the theories are unique to trump's sensibility and peculiar to his paranoid white house. our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication, former president george w. bush said in a 2017 speech. the main problem behind the proliferation of political conspiracy theories is a president who is also a self-invented fabulist, argued washington post columnist michael gerson.\n\nbut in truth, the stew of alternative facts has been simmering for more than half a century on the right fringe. the gop had endless opportunities across the decades to banish these theories — about scheming bureaucrats, jews, the federal reserve, the united nations — and its leaders often saw them as absurd. but they were also useful, helping to rally support from an aggrieved government-hating base. so the party's mandarins allowed them to fester and grow until they spread from the toxic fringe to the mainstream, which they have finally overtaken. it's no wonder someone who embraced those ideas would become successful; trump validates notions that his voters have long believed, ideas that the party refused to condemn and failed to repudiate.\n\ntrump, then, isn't what caused these conspiracy theories. he's what happens when nobody stands in their way.\n\nthe intellectual life of the american right since sen. joe mccarthy's rise to prominence in 1950 can be seen partially as a series of flirtations with conspiracists and a dedicated reluctance to read fringe crackpots out of its ranks. yes, william f. buckley jr.'s national review attacked john birch society founder robert welch, who called dwight eisenhower a dedicated, conscious agent of the communist conspiracy, in an iconic moment of movement history.\n\nbut conservative leaders more typically embraced the passion and support of the birchers at the grass roots. at its 1964 national convention, the gop rejected a plank condemning the society, along with its conspiratorial beliefs. birchers such as john rousselot and john schmitz served in congress as republicans in good standing, while conservative oilman and family patriarch fred koch was a founding member of the society. birchers took active part in republican election campaigns and ran right-wing bookstores packed with conspiratorial treatises such as john stormer's none dare call it treason (about soviet infiltration of american government) and fred schwarz's you can trust the communists (to be communists). they served as members of local school boards and state legislatures. other republicans rarely spoke up to debunk the birch view that fluoride in drinking water was part of a communist plot to cause cancer or control americans' minds.\n\nat times, the wild-eyed conspiracism came from the top. vice president spiro agnew delivered speeches identifying a cabal of washington- and new york-based power brokers who supposedly controlled the news media, whipping up what journalists at the time considered a frenzy of anti-semitism on the far right. (in 1976, a few years after he'd been indicted on bribery and other charges, agnew published a novel pushing the anti-semitic trope that the media's zionist lobby was controlling america's foreign policy in the middle east.)\n\nat other times, understanding that they had to court the conspiracy-minded activists of the base, the party's leaders went out of their way to confer legitimacy on extremists. take the gop's relationship with christian coalition leader pat robertson, who won four states in the 1988 republican presidential primary contest. in 1991, robertson published the new world order, holding that scheming government pooh-bahs were working to set up world government, a world police force, world courts, world banking and currency, and a world elite in charge of it all. he even suggested that president george h.w. bush was complicit in establishing this new world order. still, republicans wanted votes and donations from robertson's acolytes, so newt gingrich, oliver north, william bennett, jack kemp, jesse helms and dinesh d'souza all happily spoke at his road to victory conferences. sen. bob dole, a pillar of the republican establishment and at the time a presidential candidate, told robertson's followers in 1995 that i am proud to stand up here and say that i've been awarded a 100 percent voting record in '93 and 100 percent in 1994 and 100 percent in 1995 from the christian coalition.\n\nduring the clinton years, the crackpot theorizing became harder and harder to distinguish from the republican party itself. conservative billionaire richard mellon scaife sent investigators to arkansas to dig up dirt on the president's past, and when they failed, they settled for salacious fabrications that bill clinton was part of a drug-smuggling ring. scaife became what the washington post called a guiding force behind gingrich's contract with america and a later generation of tea party activists. the rev. jerry falwell, a leader of the religious right (his son is a big trump supporter), started selling a $43 videotape that, among other charges, said clinton was responsible for the deaths of countless people.\n\nof course, republican leaders didn't always or uniformly tolerate gonzo conspiracy theories. presidential nominee john mccain, for instance, contradicted one of his supporters at a 2008 campaign event, telling her that barack obama was not, in fact, an arab. onetime senator and 1996 presidential hopeful arlen specter (pa.) also stuck up for the truth when he assailed two leading gop conspiracy theorists, robertson and pat buchanan, as leaders of the intolerant right.\n\nyet over the past seven decades, such voices — pro-fact, pro-science and pro-reason — lost the internal debate over how to treat the tinfoil-hat folks. and such moments of truth-telling by republicans at all levels have been fleeting and rare.\n\nhouse intelligence committee chair, adam schiff (d-ca) looks on as u.s. representative devin nunes (r-ca) speaks as david a. holmes, department of state political counselor for the united states embassy in kyiv, ukraine and dr. fiona hill, former national security council senior director for europe and russia appear before the house intelligence committee during an impeachment inquiry hearing at the longworth house office building on thursday november 21, 2019 in washington, dc. (matt mcclain/the washington post)\n\nwhile the gop was actively courting allies who propagated conspiracy theories, the democratic party took much the opposite tack — mostly rejecting the outlandish left-wing theories that surfaced from time to time. although some research has found a recent uptick in democratic support for conspiracy theories (a jump caused by a lack of political power), elected democrats have typically fenced their party off from wild-eyed claims promulgated on the left. they never embraced the theory that the 9/11 attacks were an inside job carried out by the bush administration, for example. during the 2004 presidential primary race, even the most lefty antiwar candidates — dennis kucinich, howard dean, carol moseley braun — largely eschewed conspiracy theories that president george w. bush and vice president dick cheney had gone to war for oil or to enrich their friends in the construction business. the left has its share of anti-vaxxers who believe that vaccines cause autism, yet democratic officials have battled that lie (which trump himself has promoted).\n\none reason is that democrats have been reluctant to use anti-government theories to tear down the things they would prefer to burnish, such as government and international institutions that they believe work for social justice and economic progress. republicans' conspiracy theories about powerful secret actors are consistent with their small-government views; it is a shorter leap for conservatives to portray washington as a swamp where individualism, justice and decency go to die.\n\nthanks to years of gop tolerance for surreal thinking on the right, conspiracy theories have moved from the fringe to the center. one poll by fairleigh dickinson university found that 63 percent of registered voters subscribe to at least one such theory. some social science research suggests that people who feel alienated from politics are more prone to thinking conspiratorially. trump capitalized on that climate of suspicion.\n\nit's easy to see the line from older conspiracy theories to the fact-free claims by trump supporters today. white house adviser stephen miller has drawn anti-immigration rhetoric from white-nationalist publications like the 1973 french novel the camp of the saints, which envisions hordes of immigrants obliterating western civilization. breitbart news has featured anti-immigrant, anti-gay and anti-black theories that could have been found in an earlier generation of far-right publications, including american opinion and american mercury.\n\nperhaps the biggest change of the trump era is the approach of republican leaders. in the past, they indulged these theories but never really espoused them. today, elective officeholders embrace them openly, in the face of explicit counterevidence from the government they purport to run. national security officials have repeatedly stressed in recent weeks that ukraine did not meddle in the 2016 election and that those who repeat the claim are advancing pro-russian propaganda. yet most republican members of congress now seem to believe this theory, pointing to a thin report in politico that documented no top-down, coordinated interference. trump's racism (calling mexican immigrants rapists; telling four congresswomen of color who are all u.s. citizens to go back to their crime infested home countries) and anti-semitism (he implies jews are loyal primarily to israel and motivated mostly by money) align well with old allegations that jewish bankers and assorted globalists have enriched themselves while inflicting economic havoc on the people, as his closing 2016 television ad suggested.\n\npolarization has also made mainstream american culture hospitable to ideas once relegated to the margins. voters have grown more tolerant of political leaders' failings as long as they adhere to the correct ideological positions, opening a space for someone like trump to win the presidency and then govern with the support of a minority of the electorate. and grass-roots opinion has shifted in favor of conspiracy theories, a pattern that both follows the cues of political leaders and incentivizes those leaders' abasements. for instance, twitter equips trump to instantaneously air any theory, no matter how nutty, to raucous and affirming plaudits. fox news also capitalizes on this shift to amplify trumpian claims (russia didn't hack our democracy, fox host tucker carlson recently parroted). it's no wonder that, as gallup found last february, 30 percent of republicans see russia in a favorable light. one recent post survey of attitudes toward 2016 election conspiracy theories found that 26 percent of americans believed that crowdstrike, a cybersecurity firm, invented a story of russian election meddling in order to hide ukraine's efforts to help hillary clinton.\n\nultimately, trump was the logical consequence of a posture followed for decades at the top echelons of the conservative movement: the batty screeds are silly, but since they help us, we won't work zealously to purge them. trump's conspiracy-based capture of the gop has less to do with him and his perspective than with a party that sought and often won the support of people who believe those notions.\n\n[correction: a previous version of this story misstated the year of a fairleigh dickinson university poll about conspiracy theories.]
when they do, president trump is quick to trash-talk them.\n\nthe new fake news narrative is that there is chaos in the white house, went one broadside after the many departures among his top appointees were reported.\n\nad\n\nwrong! people will always come & go, and i want strong dialogue before making a final decision. i still have some people that i want to change (always seeking perfection). there is no chaos, only great energy!\n\nad\n\nbut the reporting he criticizes as false — he claims it is invented from sources that don't exist — is validated when top officials leave the white house staff and give on-the-record interviews.\n\nwhite house chief of staff john kelly will be leaving his role in the coming months. here's a look back at his tumultuous tenure. (monica akhtar, joyce koh, bastien inzaurralde/the washington post)\n\ntake, for instance, an article based on an interview with just-departed chief of staff john f. kelly by molly o'toole in the dec. 30 los angeles times, which carried some remarkable headline words: that kelly's time as trump's top aide is best measured by what the president did not do.\n\nad\n\nthat kelly was, in other words, often in the position of restraining a whimsical and incurious president.\n\nif that sounds more like chaos than great energy, consider this passage from the same article:\n\nkelly faulted the administration for failing to follow procedure and failing to anticipate the public outrage for the two most controversial initiatives of his tenure: trump's travel ban in january 2017, and the zero tolerance immigration policy and family separations this year.\n\nad\n\nshortly after taking office, trump issued an executive order immediately suspending the entire u.s. refugee program for 120 days, indefinitely freezing the entry of refugees from syria and barring travelers from seven muslim-majority countries.\n\nad\n\nrefugees already approved for resettlement, green card holders and others were turned away from flights, detained, and in some cases deported. federal judges issued emergency stays, and several iterations of the travel ban have been challenged in court.\n\nat the time, despite reports he'd been caught off-guard by the president's order, kelly gave a full-throated defense.\n\ni had very little opportunity to look at them before the orders were announced, kelly acknowledged in the times interview.\n\nin other words, media reports that kelly, then secretary of homeland security, had been caught off-guard by this impetuous blunder were accurate.\n\nad\n\nand kelly's defense, at that time, was a charade.\n\nad\n\nit's remarkable that kelly now admits the chaos of travel ban implementation . . . when he previously lied to the public and press, cnn senior justice reporter evan perez said, responding on twitter to the los angeles times interview.\n\nperez added: the reporting, it turns out, was spot on. kelly was lying.\n\nand maggie haberman, a white house correspondent for the new york times, made a broader point about the coverage overall: the current theme out of some in the wh comms shop is 'there's no chaos to see in this white house,' a narrative trump has hoped will replace the actual reporting. this kelly interview affirms most of the real-time reporting about how it is there.\n\nad\n\nthis is far from the first time that top trump officials have validated real-time reporting in after-the-fact interviews.\n\nad\n\njust weeks ago, former secretary of state rex tillerson, in an interview with cbs news's bob schieffer, described the president as someone who is pretty undisciplined, doesn't like to read, isn't interested in deeply understanding policy decisions, and who repeatedly attempted to do illegal things. (trump responded by calling tillerson, the former ceo of exxonmobil, dumb as a rock.)\n\nthe situation tillerson and kelly have described is far closer to what the mainstream media reported than to what trump claimed a few months ago: the white house is truly, as you would say, a well-oiled machine. it is working so well.\n\nad\n\nthis doesn't mean, of course, that every anonymously sourced white house report turns out to be accurate to the letter. (after all, rumors of kelly's departure circulated for months before he actually departed.)\n\nad\n\nbut it does suggest that news reports describing high staff turnover, impulsive decision-making, an increasingly isolated chief executive and a chaotic atmosphere are valid. far from being made up out of whole cloth, they are quite an accurate representation of an unsettling reality — despite what trump would have us believe.\n\nin a particularly unhinged-sounding tweet on tuesday, the president sent new year's greetings to the nation, including the fake news media.\n\npresidential good wishes? or just wishful thinking?
musk has quintupled his net worth since january, according to estimates put together by bloomberg, adding $132 billion to his wealth and vaulting him to the no. 2 spot among the world's richest with a fortune of about $159 billion. bezos's wealth has grown by roughly $70 billion over the same period, putting his net worth estimate at roughly $186 billion as the year came to an end.\n\nad\n\nad\n\namazon's stock, on the other hand, has risen around 70 percent this year, a figure that is modest only in comparison to tesla's gains. much of amazon's performance is due to homebound americans turning to the e-commerce giant to order products they would have otherwise purchased at retail outlets shut down by the pandemic. amazon web services, a big profit generator for the company, has also experienced increased demand during the pandemic.\n\nall told, the two men increased their net worth by a staggering $200 billion last year, a sum greater than the gross domestic products of 139 countries. a billion dollars — a radically life-changing sum in nearly any other context — becomes just an entry in a database, as musk recently characterized his tesla assets.\n\nsuch a rapid accumulation of individual wealth hasn't happened in the united states since the time of the rockefellers and carnegies a century ago, and we as a society are only just beginning to grapple with the ethical implications.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwhat does it mean, for instance, that two men amassed enough wealth this year to end all hunger in america (with a price tag of $25 billion, according to one estimate) eight times over? or that the $200 billion accumulated by bezos and musk is greater than the amount of coronavirus relief allocated to state and local governments in the cares act?\n\nin an earnings call april 29, tesla ceo elon musk called the coronavirus lockdowns fascist, and said people should get back their freedom. (tesla)\n\nof course, the wealth of bezos and musk exists largely on paper, as it's mostly tied up in the company stock they own. in order to convert that stock to tangible assets, they would have to sell it, which could potentially crater the stock's value on top of incurring tax obligations.\n\nbeyond that, the task of ending hunger or plugging state budget holes is a lot more complicated than simply writing a check. if you have the money on hand, the challenge is delivering it in a useful form to the myriad places that need it. it's a lot harder to spend billions in practice than it is in theory, or at least billionaires often say it is.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin 2018, for instance, the 10 wealthiest people donated an average of less than 1 percent of their net worth to charitable causes, according to an analysis by economist gabriel zucman.\n\nbezos last year announced he would give $10 billion to fight climate change, and in november he announced the recipients of the first $800 million in spending on instagram. a washington post analysis in june of charitable spending by the wealthiest americans — when bezos's fortune totaled $143 billion — showed he gave $100 million to feeding america and up to $25 million for all in wa, a statewide relief effort in washington state. for the median american, bezos's giving was the equivalent of donating $85 at that time.\n\nmusk has given at least $257 million to his own charitable foundation, or less than one-fifth of 1 percent of his estimated wealth since founding it in 2002, according to an analysis by quartz.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nrepresentatives from amazon declined to comment, while representatives from tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
a group of 11 republican senators and senators-elect, led by ted cruz of texas, vowed to join sen. josh hawley (r-mo.) in challenging votes from some contested states, calling for an emergency 10-day audit to investigate trump's unfounded claims. hours later, trump wrote on twitter that there would be plenty more to come.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe move amounts to an open rebellion against senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.), who last month pleaded with gop senators to avoid a public debate over the legitimacy of november's election results. mcconnell has personally congratulated biden on his victory.\n\nthe high drama at the capitol is set to punctuate a momentous week in politics that will delineate power at the dawn of the biden presidency. the new congress to be sworn in sunday will reduce the size of the democratic house majority. trump and biden will both campaign monday in georgia ahead of twin runoff elections for the u.s. senate on tuesday that will determine which party controls the upper chamber. later in the week, members of the republican national committee will gather at a florida beach resort to chart the party's future beyond trump's presidency.\n\nwhat's happening [wednesday] foreshadows what's going to be happening for the following 24 months, said peter hart, a veteran democratic pollster. it's a question of do we start to move to the future or get locked into the past. . . . this [could] continue to rip apart the fabric of this country that has already been torn through.\n\nweeks before the 2020 presidential election, congressional republicans said president trump would accept the election result. (the washington post)\n\ncongress is all but certain to drive a final stake through the heart of trump's dream of four more years on wednesday. but the gulf between the reality of the certification process and trump's fantasy of subverting the vote to stay in office is politically perilous for republicans — none more than trump's unfailingly deferential no. 2, vice president pence.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nas president of the senate, pence will wield the gavel when the electoral votes are counted and biden is declared the winner by a wide margin, 306 to 232.\n\nthough pence's role is strictly ceremonial, lawyer sidney powell and other conspiracy-minded trump allies are trying to convince the president that pence has the power to overturn the election by rejecting some of biden's electors, according to two senior administration officials with knowledge of the conversations. after pence labored for four years to stay in the mercurial president's good graces, his performance on wednesday could risk a rupture on their 14th-to-last day in office.\n\nwhile the growing gop chorus to challenge biden's victory may ease the burden on pence to lead the charge for trump, it increases the likelihood of a volatile, discomfiting debate. and it virtually guarantees that republicans will face a vote that forces them to decide whether they will honor the collective will of the voters or stand with trump — a vote that could long serve as a litmus test for the gop base.\n\nwith dozens of house republicans expected also to challenge the election results, wednesday's event is likely to be a very public showcase of trump's two-month campaign to delegitimize biden's presidency, even as washington barrels inexorably toward biden's inauguration.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nfor days, trump has been urging supporters to converge on washington on wednesday — in a showing that could offer a measure of the enduring popular appeal of his unfounded claims of fraud.\n\nas many as four rallies are expected to draw pro-trump demonstrators to the washington monument, freedom plaza and the capitol. the proud boys, white supremacists and members of armed right-wing groups have pledged to attend, while threats of violence and calls for an armed encampment on the mall are proliferating online.\n\ni'm focused on the long-term damage rather than the short-term turbulence — the formation of a very large group of people who simply will not accept the legitimacy of joe biden as president of the united states or the legitimacy of the processes by which he ascended to the presidency, said william a. galston, the chairman of governance studies at the brookings institution. that, in my view, is the fundamental danger.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ntrump has made plain his goal with the certification process: to overturn the results of an election he insists was rigged, though he has produced no evidence to support that claim. but so far, at least, he has not provided clear directives about how, procedurally, he intends for that goal to be accomplished.\n\ntrump wants pence and others to help recruit lawmakers to join the effort led by hawley and cruz in the senate and a handful of trump allies in the house, and to publicly present what he considers evidence of voter fraud, according to a senior administration official, who, like others interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss internal deliberations.\n\npence and others have explained to trump that the vice president does not have the power to take substantive action on wednesday, such as moving to invalidate the results, administration officials say. pence's legally prescribed duties are strictly ceremonial: read aloud the electoral votes from each state and officiate any debate that unfolds.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhowever, pence is encouraging lawmakers to publicly debate what they see as voting irregularities in key states, said pence chief of staff marc short.\n\nvice president pence shares the concerns of millions of americans about voter fraud and irregularities in the last election, short said. the vice president welcomes the efforts of members of the house and senate to use the authority they have under the law to raise objections and bring forward evidence before the congress and the american people on january 6th.\n\nlate friday, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by rep. louie gohmert (r-tex.) arguing that the constitution gives the vice president sole discretion to determine whether electors put forward by the states are valid. gohmert's suit asked the judge effectively to tell pence that he has the right to invalidate electoral college votes cast for biden and instead recognize other slates of trump electors.\n\nad\n\nad\n\npence asked that the suit be rejected, and the judge, jeremy d. kernodle, complied. kernodle, who was nominated by trump to serve on the federal bench in texas in 2018, wrote that gohmert lacked standing to sue.\n\nfor trump, the dismissal compounds nearly two months of anger and agita over the election outcome and his failure to reverse it, either through dozens of lawsuits or by personal pressure on state and local officials.\n\nover the christmas vacation, the president was in a foul mood at mar-a-lago, his florida seaside club. in addition to venting about the election, he fumed about renovations to the property overseen by first lady melania trump in preparation for the couple's impending move from the white house, according to someone who spoke with the president at the club.\n\nad\n\ntrump left florida three days earlier than planned, skipping mar-a-lago's annual new year's eve party, which he typically attends. hundreds of guests bought tickets to the bash, expecting the president to be there. people go to see him, said one person who planned to attend but bowed out after learning trump was returning to washington.\n\nad\n\ntrump did not explain his unexpected departure but told some guests at mar-a-lago that he thought iran might seek to retaliate against the united states around the jan. 3 anniversary of last year's u.s. killing of iranian maj. gen. qasem soleimani in baghdad.\n\nstill, trump has been in a rancid state since his november loss to biden. obsessed with conspiracy theories fed to him by powell, his personal lawyer rudolph w. giuliani and other allies, he has aired grievances at will on twitter and been easily provoked to lash out at aides.\n\nall of us are just trying to stay off the radar, one senior administration official said. you have a conversation with him and, the next thing you know, you're pulled into, 'hey, sidney powell told me yadda, yadda, yadda,' or, 'rudy said blah, blah, blah.' there's no upside to being in his orbit right now.\n\na recent advertisement from the lincoln project, an anti-trump super pac run by longtime republican strategists, drew the president's fury. in it, the narrator speaks directly to trump and says, ominously, that pence is running away from him by not fully amplifying his claims of widespread election fraud.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe end is coming, donald, the narrator intones. even mike pence knows.\n\ntrump wanted to issue a cease-and-desist letter to the lincoln project over the ad, although it is unclear what legal ground, if any, he might have for doing so. officials said he ultimately was talked out of it.\n\nin recent weeks, trump also has been displeased with pence, thinking the vice president and other advisers have not done enough to help him overturn the election results. but people familiar with the dynamic between the two men said the relationship remains strong.\n\non monday, they are to fly to georgia to campaign for sens. david perdue and kelly loeffler, republican incumbents trying to fend off energized democratic challenges in tuesday's runoffs. both trump and pence are expected to emphasize the high stakes, telling georgia voters that if perdue and loeffler lose, republicans will lose control of the upper chamber — opening the door for a democratic house and senate to reverse many trump administration accomplishments.\n\nhowever, trump has been feuding openly for weeks with georgia's republican governor and secretary of state, blasting their unwillingness to reverse the state's presidential election results. biden was the first democrat to win georgia and its 16 electoral votes in nearly three decades.\n\nas a result, some gop officials are concerned that trump might veer from prepared remarks at his election-eve rally and deliver a sour message that risks depressing republican turnout on election day.\n\npolls show both races are tight, and the outcome may be uncertain when lawmakers gather back in washington for the presidential certification the next day. mcconnell and other party leaders have discouraged their members from interfering with the traditionally pro forma process, contending that any effort to change the outcome would fail.\n\nmcconnell has told others privately that he is frustrated by hawley's decision to challenge slates of biden electors and force votes likely to divide republicans, saying it will serve only to invite a political backlash from trump supporters against gop senators who vote to confirm biden's victory.\n\nin an open letter to his constituents, sen. ben sasse (r-neb.), a frequent trump critic, went further, calling the effort to use the congressional process to reverse the election results a dangerous ploy, given that there is no evidence of widespread fraud. instead, sasse wrote, the effort is designed to disenfranchise millions of americans simply because they voted for someone in a different party.\n\non saturday, the cruz-led coalition publicly rejected that position, arguing that deep distrust among some voters about the legitimacy of the election demands the creation of an electoral commission . . . to conduct an emergency 10-day audit of the election returns in the disputed states. a previous commission appointed to investigate trump's allegations about the 2016 election disbanded without finding evidence of fraud or even issuing a report.\n\nthose in the cruz coalition also said they would reject electors from disputed states as not lawfully certified, though they offered no legal basis for doing so. in georgia, for example, biden's victory was certified after three separate recounts.\n\nlate saturday, sens. mitt romney (r-utah) and patrick j. toomey (r-pa.) issued strongly worded condemnations of the efforts of their republican colleagues to dispute the results. romney wrote: the egregious ploy to reject electors may enhance the political ambition of some, but dangerously threatens our democratic republic. the congressional power to reject electors is reserved for the most extreme and unusual circumstances. these are far from it. and toomey wrote that the push by cruz, hawley and others directly undermines the fundamental democratic right of people to elect their own leaders.\n\nhawley has indicated that he will object to electoral votes submitted by at least one state, pennsylvania, and that he may challenge some others. he has justified the move as a means of speaking up for the 74 million americans who voted for trump. in a statement, hawley singled out pennsylvania as failing to follow their own state election laws, though he offered no evidence to support that charge.\n\nhawley and cruz are among several senators seen as potential presidential contenders in 2024, and their moves could open the floodgates for other ambitious republicans to lodge similar challenges on wednesday in hopes of appealing to trump's base.\n\nthis revolt will put a squeeze on incumbents facing reelection in 2022, including two members of the gop leadership, john thune of south dakota and roy blunt of missouri. both men are expected to vote to certify biden's victory, with thune telling reporters just before christmas that any attempt to challenge the election's outcome is just not going anywhere. i mean, in the senate it would go down like a shot dog.\n\nsince then, trump has been attacking the no. 2-ranking gop senator. on friday, trump tweeted that thune was a rino — a republican in name only — and called on gov. kristi l. noem to run against him in the state's gop primary.\n\nsouth dakota wants strong leadership, now! trump wrote.
sen. ted cruz (r-tex.), an on-again, off-again trump foe who organized a group willing to stand athwart the inevitable during the jan. 6 certification, received a tweet of approval.\n\nthis isn't what cruz's lawyerly statement actually said, nor is it what he said during the appearance on fox news that apparently inspired the tweet. instead, he touted the unprecedented allegations of fraud, most of which stem from trump. but such nuances are secondary to both parties. trump got to tout an ally in his fight and cruz got trump's approval — even as he preserved the long-term deniability that his comments have been carefully intended to maintain.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nit's hard not to read this specific fight over the election results as being a sort of jury deliberation on trump's role within republican politics. the tension between efforts by majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) to limit senate objections to the presidential election results and by senators such as cruz who are eager to appeal to trump's enthusiastic base has led to various examinations of where the power center of the party will land after jan. 20.\n\nbut this is largely missing the forest for the trees. the story of the republican party for at least the past 12 years has been one of tension between a political establishment and a wild fringe. that tension has repeatedly spurred the establishment to try to appease or co-opt the fringe. but instead of folding into the party, the fringe keeps moving further out. that is the tension of the moment: how will a fringe empowered and reinforced by the trump presidency coexist with a republican party eager to move back toward reality?\n\nconsider how we got here.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthree things happened in 2008 that shocked the republican system. the first was that the presidency of george w. bush was increasingly seen as a failure, even by many republicans. by early october of that year, his approval among members of his party was under 60 percent in gallup polling, a staggeringly low figure by recent standards. that was in part due to the downturn that was still burning through the economy, a downturn that destabilized the sense of security of even the most financially stable americans. those two things contributed to the election of barack obama, a manifestation of another cultural change in the country: the decreasing dominance of whites.\n\nbefore obama won, though, he was the target of baseless allegations that he had not been born in the united states and, therefore, was ineligible to hold the office of president. this wasn't true, but it was politically potent. the assertion wasn't limited to conservative circles; during his hard-fought democratic primary victory over hillary clinton, even some democrats elevated the claims. but the claims were heavily centered on right-wing websites that were finding new audiences with the emergence of social media. rumors that spread over email spread more slowly than ones dropped into facebook and twitter (as the founder of snopes explained to the washington post in 2015). write up a blog post claiming evidence of obama's ineligibility and tweet it out and suddenly you can propel the misinformation everywhere — and make a decent bit of cash from new visitors to your website.\n\nas the 2008 election approached, it was clear that there was an enormous amount of energy to the political right of the gop establishment, energy often concentrated in these theories. the party's nominee, john mccain, made one of the first overt efforts to appease those voters, selecting sarah palin as his running mate largely on the strength of her credibility with those skeptical of the establishment. his candidacy was doomed, though, and palin didn't do much to help.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nfrom nearly the moment obama took office, he became a lightning rod for the conservative fringe. part of it was situational: inheriting the crumbled economy meant needing to make broad investments to bolster employers and workers. obama was painted as a socialist for doing so, a charge that itself leveraged a sense from some on the right that he was an other, given his family background and life story.\n\nthe tea party movement, which emerged soon after obama took office, was a manifestation of those overlapping concerns. ostensibly centered on government spending (and centered on that concern by conservative activists), the movement was also intertwined with concerns about the declining power of white america and immigration.\n\nmany republican candidates recognized the value of appealing to the fervent base of tea party supporters and did so overtly. the movement introduced candidates of its own, often pulled from the mistier fringes of conservative thought. the establishment pushed back hard, working to undercut primary challenges from tea-party-spawned candidates. sometimes it worked; often it didn't. the energy among republican voters for candidates espousing hard-line tea party positions propelled several to surprising primary wins — but then to general-election losses, as the establishment had feared.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthat energy continued to be powered by conservative media. fox news leaned into the tea party movement, being described by one research team as a national advocacy organization actively fostering a social protest identity. further from the political center of the party were sites such as breitbart, which not only generated enthusiasm for the movement but encouraged speculation about obama's ancestry.\n\nrepublican leaders tried to appease the tea partyers to leverage the energy. a number of policy concessions emerged. the party shifted to the right. but the enthusiasm for the tea party movement was driven heavily by opposition to obama and a changing america, and the elevation of various policy issues as central concerns was often secondary. put another way, there was no appeasing those for whom the fight itself was often the desired goal.\n\nwhat's often underrecognized about trump's emergence in national politics is that he was the best-known figure willing to fully immerse himself in those fights encouraged in far-right media. he flirted with a 2012 presidential run by leaning into birtherism, building a foothold with sketchier conservative media outlets by doing so.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhis embrace of birtherism didn't prevent an embrace from more-mainstream conservative outlets, though. he first publicly questioned obama's birthplace in march 2011; at the end of that month, fox news announced that he would be contributing weekly to its morning flagship program, fox & friends. that gig lasted until he announced his presidential candidacy in june 2015.\n\ntrump's strategy wasn't complicated. he watched fox news and read sites such as breitbart and reiterated the questions and concerns he saw there. when violence in central america led to a surge of young immigrants at the border with mexico, trump echoed conservative media in seizing on immigration as an issue. when several people infected with ebola traveled to the united states shortly before the 2014 midterm elections, trump, like fox news and breitbart, obsessed over it.\n\nwhen trump announced his candidacy in 2015, he was praised by supporters for his directness and honesty. what that meant, to a large degree, was that he was saying things that they were hearing on fox news and in far-right media — things that other candidates wouldn't say often because they were believed to be prohibitive when seeking elected office. trump said fox things to a fox audience, and a chunk of the audience coalesced around him once his comments about immigration prompted enough of a cultural fight to break through the noise. this relatively small core was a lot in a crowded primary field, and trump quickly emerged as the republican front-runner.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nafter spending months thinking that trump's support would collapse and a desperate few weeks in early 2016 trying to ensure that it did, the republican establishment was forced to work with trump. over the course of the 2016 campaign, though, there was a broad assumption that he would lose and the party would need to rebuild.\n\nthe establishment had come to a similar conclusion in 2012 when mitt romney lost, deciding that, among other things, it needed to expand its base to include more non-white voters, perhaps by moving away from a hard line on immigration. (even sean hannity embraced the idea when the political winds blew in that direction.) but it didn't need to make such a move to win in 2016. instead, trump's candidacy reinforced cultural and racial politics far more openly than those of past republicans, helping stoke the energy of republican voters. against an unpopular democratic opponent that year, his fervent base proved to be large enough in enough states to win him the white house.\n\nagain, that base was powered by far-right media and misinformation. an influential study from harvard's berkman klein center for internet and society found that breitbart was the most popular media outlet on the political right during the 18 months leading up to the presidential election. a few months before the election, breitbart and the trump campaign effectively merged, with the website's chairman, stephen k. bannon — who had once described the site as virulently anti-establishment — becoming the chief executive of the campaign itself.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nonce he became president, trump and the party similarly merged. as with the tea party movement, trump's focus was never policy but, instead, fringe cultural fights. this suited the establishment fairly well: by letting trump have his incendiary public persona, the gop got hundreds of new conservative judges, three supreme court justices and a massive tax-cut package. it meant a lot of looking the other way at trump's behavior and broad refusals to call out dishonesty and controversial comments, but for much of his term, it worked on a political level.\n\nas the 2020 election approached, this alliance held. trump's repeated attacks on the mail-in voting process and his refusals to say he would concede peacefully should he lose were met with shrugs. the 2018 elections were largely a rout for the democrats thanks to trump's unpopularity and, clearly, because many 2016 trump voters stayed home with him not on the ballot. but being close to trump wasn't itself necessarily disqualifying in that environment: trump allies such as ron desantis in florida and brian kemp in georgia won close gubernatorial races. so even as it seemed clear trump would lose his reelection bid, most republicans stuck with him.\n\nthen he lost. trump's (predictable) refusal to acknowledge the loss was at first accepted as a cost of not alienating his base. the sentiment was infamously summarized by an official who spoke with the post a few days after the loss was confirmed.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwhat is the downside for humoring him for this little bit of time? no one seriously thinks the results will change, the senior republican said. he went golfing this weekend. it's not like he's plotting how to prevent joe biden from taking power on jan. 20. he's tweeting about filing some lawsuits, those lawsuits will fail, then he'll tweet some more about how the election was stolen, and then he'll leave.\n\nthis was the operating assumption for much of trump's presidency: go along with his nonsense, get what you need where you can and, eventually, things will go back to normal. some in the establishment saw trump's loss as a chance to step away from fringe politics, operating under an assumption that those politics are mostly associated with trump himself.\n\nthey are not. the fringe has grown only more robust over the past four years, encouraged by trump. he's leveraged sycophantic entities such as one america news and newsmax in an effort to pressure fox news to move further toward the right, an effort that has borne some fruit. he's refused to clamp down on bizarre conspiracy theories such as qanon, even at times encouraging them. an expert who spoke with the post in 2017 noted that trump's politics are rooted in baseless conspiracy theories, something reinforced by his approach to communications as president. his counternarrative to russia's interference in the 2016 election? a broad, baseless claim centered on the fbi. his rationalization for losing the election? a conspiracy among his opponents and state officials to prevent a win.\n\nsince that republican official shrugged at the harm of humoring trump, trump and the far right have only spiraled farther from the center of the galaxy, like a voyager probe of nonsense. when fox news had the gall to accurately report that trump lost his reelection bid, trump and his allies rejected the network. fox news spent years building foot soldiers for the maga movement, but, in refusing to accede to his theories, it was quickly rejected by many republicans.\n\nsuffolk university has for years asked americans what tv news or commentary source they trust most, offering options such as cnn, fox news, pbs and msnbc. fox news consistently earned most-trusted marks simply by holding the majority of republicans. but in the first suffolk poll released after the election, fox news is now running about even with none of the above.\n\nmuch of that shift, it is safe to assume, is a function of viewership having moved to one america or newsmax, places where accuracy is often a secondary concern. their rhetoric is centered on trump at the moment, but it is also deeply opportunistic. once the election fades as a subject of speculation, something else will fill the vacuum.\n\nben collins, an nbc news reporter who has focused on qanon and other misinformation efforts, made an observation about conservative media in the post-election period.\n\nthe qanon rumor pipeline has completely eaten the far-right news ecosystem over the last two months, he said in a tweet. he pointed to a debunked claim about voting machines as being little more than a tendril of the sprawling qanon theory.\n\nand, he added, the president believes all of it.\n\nprobably. there's certainly some opportunism at play for trump. but the point is that the fringe keeps doing its thing in ways that are often only tangentially linked to trump. there is some chunk of the republican base that is now invested enough in this divergent soap opera to turn away from fox news. qanon has engaged hundreds of thousands of people in a larp about government conspiracies, satanism and child abuse. the fringe was always more invested in cultural fights than political ones, but, encouraged by trump, those cultural fights are now much further from the gop establishment than they were even four years ago.\n\nthis is the fight the gop faces. it's not really about whether cruz's ploy to use lawyer-speak to give trump a thumbs up will play well in the 2024 primaries. it's about how far from reality the base will get.\n\nmaybe trump's inevitable withdrawal from the scene will reduce that distance somewhat. maybe without trump at the center, the one america and newsmax audience will return to fox. maybe fox will be able to broadly shift back from being pro-trump to being anti-democrat. but for the past 12 years, the movement has all been in the other direction, toward more extreme and wild assertions.
the memo prepared by grassley's staff summarizes the committee's examination of claims by more than 100 purported whistleblowers who came forward to allege misconduct and mismanagement by senior marshals service officials.\n\nit highlights years of alleged misdeeds, from deputy marshals forging hundreds of subpoenas to gather telephone records — a years-long practice that, even when it was discovered, led to no personnel dismissals — to repeated attempts to retaliate against whistleblowers who brought misconduct to light.\n\nad\n\nad\n\na marshals service spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\ninvestigations by grassley's committee and the justice department's inspector general found that the marshals' leadership, including the agency's former director, stacia hylton, violated federal hiring rules in filling positions at the agency and misspent money.\n\nthe usms has repeatedly spent taxpayer dollars on lavish and unnecessary items, such as a $22,000 conference table and a speechwriter who received contracts totaling over a million dollars, the memo says.\n\nthe committee noted a very troubling overall lack of accountability at the usms, the memo says, including the decision last year to allow a senior official to retire with full benefits after two inspector-general investigations found he misused government resources, engaged in sexual harassment, and threatened and retaliated against employees who participated in an investigation of his conduct. the official was not identified.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe memo also discloses a long-running practice among deputy marshals in indiana who more than a decade ago allegedly used hundreds of phony subpoenas to get phone records on people connected to fugitives.\n\nfor a 10-year period ending in 2005, approximately 800 of the fraudulent subpoenas were served on telecommunications providers in order to obtain telephone records of private citizens connected to fugitive investigations, according to an investigative document released with the senator's memo. the subpoenas contained a pre-printed signature from a judge who later told investigators he never issued the subpoenas and was not even assigned to the court in question after the year 2000.\n\nthe inspector general's investigation could not determine who began the phony-subpoena practice but found it was widespread in that district. a review of marshals service subpoenas received by at&t and related companies over less than a year and a half found 134 fraudulent subpoenas out of a total of 162 documents recovered. one service employee told investigators that he alone used the phony subpoenas approximately 500 times.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nno criminal charges were ever filed in the matter, and only one marshals service employee was given a reprimand, according to justice department officials. two of the employees who were criticized for their roles in the phony-subpoena practice were later promoted.
although redesigns and feature tweaks are predictably unpopular (and early outrage usually fades), motives seem to matter. indeed, their importance may bode ill for facebook's latest iteration of instagram, which replaced the compose button with its tiktok competitor, reels, and the activity button with its e-commerce venture, shop.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmuch like the supermarkets that re-order shelves to disrupt our well-worn routines, by monkeying with the position of instagram's most popular buttons, facebook is abusing years of muscle memory to wrong-finger a billion users into clicking more lucrative features. the reaction to these self-serving changes was swift and harsh:\n\nthe look, layout and actions of app interactions are examples of what designers call the user interface (u.i.), which is one element of the broader user experience (u.x.). so central is u.i. to the success of modern products and services, the field has spawned a library of books and articles, as well as a burgeoning academic specialty.\n\nhowever, as customers become increasingly sophisticated, demanding and vocal, the designs that succeed in the future are likely to be those that reimagine u.i. as user indulgence.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe power of user indulgence lies in its recognition of our whims, weaknesses and inherent contradictions. indulgent design allows products and services to dovetail with life as it is actually lived which, in turn, enables brands to form genuine and lasting customer connections.\n\n* * *\n\nconsider the snooze button.\n\npeople have long debated whether alarm clocks have a standard duration of snooze and, if so, why it seems to be nine minutes. but the button itself, popularized in the 1950s, is more intriguing for what it represents. even the cheapest alarms deliver an accuracy that horology's pioneers could never have envisioned, yet all of them feature a button that should be labeled: thanks for waking me to the nanosecond i requested … but now i want to doze. and this feature is seldom shy. compare the size, color and position of the iphone's snooze button with the button that stops the alarm:\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe snooze button is a perfect illustration of user indulgence, where sophisticated functionality is modified — or entirely contradicted — to accommodate human frailty and whim.\n\nindulgence is everywhere.\n\nsteam irons, water heaters, electric blankets and christmas lights incorporate auto switch-off timers to indulge our absentmindedness and reduce the risk of fire. kettles have keep warm functions to save us from endlessly re-boiling the same water. certain fountain pen cartridges have an ink reservoir that when smartly flicked discharges enough ammunition for a few more pages. and some pain-relief systems incorporate a bolus button to override the regulated flow of drugs when patients need, say, a hit of morphine.\n\nad\n\nmost toasters have eject buttons that countermand their timers; heston blumenthal's toasters offer indulgent quick look buttons to inspect your toast, and a bit more buttons to brown your bread a smidge longer. similarly the whirlpool gmc275 microwave has buttons to cook a bit more and add a minute.\n\nad\n\nthe post-it note sits alongside velcro as a triumph of re-adherable indulgence, and intermittent windshield wipers — inspired by the irregular blinking of a human eye — speak for themselves. wage envelopes feature plastic windows and cut-away flaps so that the cash inside can be counted before opening, and a range of banks and fintech apps indulge our ambivalence toward change (and thrift) by rounding-up purchases to the nearest dollar and sweeping the cents into savings or investment accounts.\n\ngoogle's did you mean? spell-check reflects an indulgence of hunt-and-peck typing as well as thick-thumbed spelling. and music streaming services such as itunes and spotify deliberately de-randomize their shuffle algorithms because the patterns that form in truly random selections don't feel random to the listener.\n\nad\n\nalthough the design of apple's podcast app has long attracted criticism, its interface does permit users to alter audio speed and skip briefly forward and back:\n\nad\n\nthe impact of such user indulgence on advertisers is one thing; its effect on content creators will soon be tested further by netflix, which has recently allowed those watching on mobile devices to speed up and slow down playback — an innovation that has not been universally applauded:\n\n* * *\n\nbecause indulgence speaks to profoundly human instincts, its absence can feel unjust. this feeling of perceived injustice explains why many otherwise obdurate systems (credit card companies, website domain renewals, patent applications) build in grace periods, and why boxing, since 1743, has given floored pugilists a count to recover on the canvas. similarly, computer games feature respawn protection, allowing freshly-reanimated players to get their bearings before once again being slain.\n\nad\n\nof course, indulgence also enables authorities to elide questions concerning the accuracy and calibration of their measurements. in other words, pragmatism — rather than goodwill — may guide the marginally flexible enforcement of parking meters, breathalyzers, speed cameras and other punitive equipment.\n\nad\n\nin some cases user indulgence is driven by the threat of harm. the baker's dozen (13 instead of 12) supposedly derives not from generosity but from the severe punishment meted out for short selling. similarly, some british pint glasses are deliberately oversized to allow for a frothy head atop the full legal measure. despite the ban on smoking on all commercial flights, even the latest planes are required to have bathroom ashtrays so miscreants can safely stub out their cigarettes when the smoke alarms sound. and many of the fences erected around construction sites, to keep the public out and the debris in, incorporate viewing holes to indulge our insatiable curiosity. (the best have holes at lower heights for kids.)\n\nin certain situations user indulgence is precisely that — most brazenly the hierarchy of comps (free drinks, room upgrades, cash back, private jets) dealt out by casinos to pacify regulars and reel in high-rollers. over recent decades the hospitality industry has become increasingly fixated on wow moments — unexpected indulgences that provoke surprise, delight and social-media love. back in the day it was chocolates on the pillow, towel-folded swans, late check-outs and hand-written notes of welcome; nowadays it is bespoke amenity kits, initial-embroidered pillowcases and personalized extras inspired by online research of customer peccadillos.\n\nad\n\nindulgence can also celebrate a higher purpose. certain japanese shrines incorporate intentional errors (such as the evil inverting pillar), lest perfection invite bad luck; orthodox jewish synagogues and homes leave an element of their structure unfinished to honor the destruction of the second temple; and, so the oft-told tale goes, persian rug weavers add deliberate flaws to their work because only the divine is faultless.\n\nad\n\nsplendidly, this school clock in north london manages to be indulgent, educational, encouraging and stern:\n\nantagonism\n\nthe power of indulgence is usefully illustrated by its opposite: antagonism.\n\nso commonplace is corporate antagonism that the tropes of obstructive and obnoxious customer interaction have become a staple of stand-up comedy. douglas adams nailed the frustration in the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy:\n\nad\n\nbut the plans were on display …on display? i eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.that's the display department.with a flashlight.ah, well the lights had probably gone.so had the stairs.but look, you found the notice didn't you?yes, said arthur, yes i did. it was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying 'beware of the leopard'.\n\nad\n\ncertain market sectors seem to thrive on antagonism. airlines, utility companies, gyms, banks and insurers, for example, deploy a bewildering arsenal of contractual trip-wires and price obfuscations — exclusions, penalties, premiums, overages, add-ons, deductibles, co-pays, minimums, endorsements, time limitations, blackout periods, booking fees, cancellation fees, installment charges, offers available only to new customers, offers available only to members, offers that auto-renew at a higher rate — that are designed to frustrate, fatigue and ultimately fleece the consumer.\n\neven offers that seem indulgent can be stealthily hostile. for instance, supermarket multi-buys — three for two, buy one get one free, buy one, get one half-price — not only confuse customers and encourage excess consumption, obesity and waste, they also penalize the poor, the elderly, the single and those who rely on public transport to schlep home their shopping.\n\nit's hard not to see such antagonisms as cynically calculated when even the most intricate systems can be simplified when the will exists. the world of investing — so long portrayed as complex and specialist — has recently been upended by fintech apps such as webull and robinhood that streamline and gamify trading, some would say to a fault. as christine ji noted:\n\nin the eyes of many, the lighthearted nature of the robinhood app fails to truly convey how serious investing is. novice investors, perhaps bored at home during this time of quarantine, can be deceived by what seems like a grown-up version of a mobile game. for starters, the flashing green and red lights, as well as the confetti, often lead users to act on their emotions instead of keeping a calm and level head. … the app's accessibility, combined with the emotional cues, can quickly lead inexperienced investors in too deep as they pursue a dopamine rush from their screens.\n\nevery so often brands seek to defy the antagonisms of their sector by appealing to the indulgent concept of humanity. jetblue launched with a mission to bring humanity back to air travel; liberty mutual insurance ran a humans campaign (complete with the human league hit human) to promote our empathy toward policyholders in times when they need us; and td bank sells itself as unexpectedly human — as if the very idea of humanity in banking was novel:\n\ndon't be alarmed if we smile. we're the bank that defies expectations. you can feel it the moment you walk in, call us or open our app. we run on human hours, not the typical 9 to 5, so you can pop in early, late and weekends. and it doesn't stop there. we've got your back around the clock with 24/7 fraud alerts—and in-store debit card replacements faster than you can say, it's a long story. the most unexpected part? we're happy to do it all.\n\nthe fact that airlines, insurers, banks and others find it not just valuable but differentiating to promote their basic humanity illustrates the power of indulgence in antagonistic sectors.\n\nfriction\n\nmany moments of user indulgence derive from the identification and resolution of friction — allowing air passengers with children to board first, say, or including a pre-stamped envelope with a bill. indeed successful startups are often premised on eliminating friction, especially when that friction has long been suffered as the cost of doing business.\n\nsetting aside the issue of price, ride-sharing apps such as uber and lyft instantly eliminated at least eight points of friction which, for generations, had been considered an inevitable part of taxi-hailing:\n\n•\n\nstanding on the street (in all weathers) hoping an empty taxi drives past\n\n•\n\nrequiring cash, or locating an en route atm\n\n•\n\nnoting the driver's name in case of a complaint\n\n•\n\nnot knowing the upfront cost of a trip\n\n•\n\ncalculating a tip\n\n•\n\nchecking change\n\n•\n\nkeeping receipts\n\n•\n\nthe improbability of reacquiring lost property\n\nwhile these frictional moments have always been irksome, they did not feel especially onerous because (absent a car service or chauffeur) there was simply no alternative. only once uber et al. had smoothed away the friction did the taxi-hailing experience seem archaic and antagonistic — which is why many licensed taxi drivers have been forced to join uber-esque platforms such as waave, curb, arro and free now.\n\n* * *\n\nadmittedly, user indulgence is simpler in the luxury, local and bespoke sectors, where there is money, time and manpower to spare. but even mass-appeal brands can incorporate the principles of indulgence into their designs. more often than not this involves abandoning brand ego, and thinking like the user — which is evidently easier said than done.\n\nin early october, google relaunched its g suite product as google workspace to unify gmail, calendar, drive, docs, sheets, slides, meet (and others) into a new, deeply integrated user experience. inevitably this relaunch required a new brand identity that reflects our ambitious product vision and the way our products work together, which meant redrawing the icons that almost two billion users click on multiple times a day.\n\nas with so many corporate redesigns, the theory behind this work is impeccable: a unified look and feel that draws upon the core components of the master brand. the reality, however, was user outrage and design derision, for what seems stylish at scale on a crisp white monitor becomes chaotic and confusing when shrunk to a 16-pixel icon.\n\n* * *\n\nthis is not to say that user indulgence should capitulate to every consumer caprice.\n\nfor those prone to abusing their oversized snooze buttons, there's clocky, the alarm-clock on wheels that, as it erupts in sound, leaps from the nightstand and zooms off at speed, forcing snooze abusers to unduvet themselves and hunt out its hiding place.\n\nsometimes, even the most indulged users need a wake-up call.\n\nthis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or bloomberg lp and its owners.\n\nben schott is a bloomberg opinion visual columnist. he created the schott's original miscellany and schott's almanac series, and writes for newspapers and magazines around the world.\n\nfor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com/opinion
back in 2017 — practically ancient history by today's standards — disney announced big plans for 2021, the 50th anniversary of the opening of walt disney world in florida.\n\nfor a milestone that big, it's never too early to start planning … especially when you're planning something huge! the announcement said, highlighting new roller coasters at the epcot and magic kingdom theme parks.\n\nnot even the coronavirus can delay an anniversary, but those big plans have shrunk as the pandemic forced the company to reduce crowd sizes, add new safety measures, pause construction and — in the case of disneyland in california — remain mostly closed indefinitely.\n\njessica sanders, who runs the disneyland planning site the happiest blog on earth, said she wouldn't make plans to visit the california parks before the summer, unless you're willing to change those plans. and even once those parks open, she said, the experience will be vastly different than before, with limited crowds, safety measures like masks and social distancing, and scaled-back offerings.\n\nfor someone that's looking for a full theme park experience, it's going to be past 2021, she said.\n\nin the meantime, of course, coronavirus cases are rising along with hospitalizations and deaths, and the centers for disease control and prevention recommends postponing travel. but the arrival of a vaccine has spurred travel bookings for later in the year, and some fans have returned to the florida parks since they opened in july.\n\nthere's still much uncertainty about when the california parks will open and when new rides will debut this year, but here's what the company has said will be new (or returning after going away) this year:\n\n[what happens to the milestone trips of 2020?]\n\n50th anniversary\n\ndespite all the changes, disney will mark the 50th anniversary of the florida resort on oct. 1. typically, the company stretches anniversary celebrations out over long periods of time, though no plans have been announced yet.\n\njana hornsby, general manager of south carolina-based discover the magic vacations, said clients are still eager to be there for the milestone date.\n\nwhen we're making new reservations now, we really have to be careful with availability, she said. because once that ability to make reservations for that time period opened up, we had disney fanatics flocking to be there.\n\nas for those big 2021 plans that were announced in 2017? that timing appears to be up in the air. they include guardians of the galaxy: cosmic rewind, a roller coaster at epcot; a tron roller coaster at the magic kingdom; and star wars: galactic starcruiser, an immersive two-night experience aboard a starship hotel.\n\npark hopping\n\nwhen walt disney world resort reopened last year, one of the new restrictions was that visitors could not go to more than one park per day — a feature that many guests pay extra for. the company reinstated park hopping on friday, though guests still need a reservation for the first park they visit and can only switch to another one after 2 p.m.\n\n\n\ndisney fan emily jacobsen, who wrote a song about the chef rat remy that kicked off an online musical, got an early look at remy's ratatouille adventure in epcot in december. (matt stroshane/walt disney world)\n\nremy's ratatouille adventure\n\none ride that was announced in 2017 and will definitely open this year is remy's ratatouille adventure, based on the animated film, at the epcot theme park. in the attraction, guests will take a culinary adventure with remy across a french restaurant's kitchen floor.\n\nharmonious\n\nnighttime fireworks and light shows are on hold for now, but when they return, epcot will introduce a new one: harmonious, billed as one of the largest nighttime spectaculars ever created for a disney park.\n\nbailee abell, editor in chief of the disney news site inside the magic, said fireworks and other shows are a big part of why people visit the parks, so the uncertainty around their return is causing some fans to postpone their visits.\n\nit's this kind of funky feeling, because we know it's coming and people are really excited about it, she said. a lot of people are in the camp that they want to hold off and they don't want to book a trip until more shows come back, more parades come back.\n\n[11 travel resolutions for when we can go on adventures again]\n\navengers campus\n\nthis entirely new land inspired by the marvel superheroes was set to open in july 2020 at disney california adventure, but the coronavirus-forced closure put that on hold. a new announcement on dec. 31 said the company is looking forward to exploring avengers campus at disney california adventure next year.\n\nsnow white's enchanted wish\n\nthe disneyland ride snow white's scary adventures has been reimagined with new scenes, story details and technology — and a new, less-scary name.\n\nread more:\n\nwhat to expect from travel loyalty programs in 2021\n\npeople with coronavirus are still getting on planes. no one knows how many.\n\nphotos: the surreal scene of cruises in europe
in the following days, mitchell took particular aim at biden's win in georgia, tweeting that the state's recount was a total sham and a fake!!! she wrote that the effort was cover for the sos, referring to secretary of state brad raffensperger. responding to criticism of her appearance, she tweeted, happy to be considered a nut job because i believe in the rule of law.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmitchell largely stayed out of the spotlight in the following weeks as legions of lawyers for the trump campaign failed in high-profile court cases across the country to get the election overturned. behind the scenes, however, her role had escalated to the point that when president trump on saturday made a last-ditch phone call to get raffensperger to find thousands of votes for him, it was the washington-based mitchell who emerged as a key player.\n\nit wasn't the first time mitchell had alleged election fraud.\n\nin a case that foreshadowed her work for trump, mitchell worked for the campaign of sharron angle, who ran against sen. harry m. reid of nevada in 2010. mitchell wrote a letter soliciting campaign contributions, alleging that reid intends to steal this election if he can't win it outright....understand, everything we have worked for in the last year could be destroyed by dirty tricks and criminal acts.\n\nad\n\nin a phone call on jan. 2, president trump insisted he won the state and threatened vague legal consequences. here are excerpts from the call. (obtained by the washington post)\n\nad\n\nas evidence, she said that teachers' union representatives were offering starbucks cards to people who voted for reid. the secretary of state's office dismissed her complaint, and reid won reelection.\n\nmitchell's role as a trump legal adviser, which received widespread attention after the washington post on sunday published audio and a transcript of the call, has surprised some colleagues, particularly because she is a partner at a major law firm, foley & lardner, that immediately faced questions about whether it endorsed such work.\n\nin a statement monday, the firm said, we are aware of, and are concerned by, ms. mitchell's participation in the january 2 conference call and are working to understand her involvement more thoroughly. the firm noted that as a matter of policy, its attorneys do not represent any parties seeking to contest the results of the presidential election, although it did allow attorneys to observe recounts voluntarily as private citizens.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthroughout the hour-long call, trump displayed an extraordinary degree of reliance on mitchell. she is a onetime democratic member of the oklahoma legislature who became a republican and has made a washington career representing gop candidates, committees and causes, culminating with her work after the election advising trump.\n\nat the outset of the call, trump chief of staff mark meadows said mitchell was not the attorney of record but has been involved in the campaign's lawsuits seeking to overturn biden's georgia victory. the attorney of record, kurt hilbert, declined to comment.\n\nstephen gillers, an ethics expert at new york university law school, said the issue facing mitchell is probably one relating to the law firm's policy, adding, i'm sure the firm is dismayed by the appearance of its lawyer on the transcript.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmitchell declined to comment.\n\nmitchell, 70, began her political career as a democrat, helping win passage of oklahoma's equal rights amendment for women and making history in the state legislature as the first woman in the nation to chair a house budget and appropriations committee.\n\nin an oral history, she said that she authored a successful proposal to have oklahoma become the first state to have universal preschool. i insisted that it couldn't be means-based, she said. it had to be universal.. . . it wasn't just some other people who were poor kids.\n\nmitchell, then known by her maiden name of deatherage, married duane draper, a fellow oklahoman, and divorced in 1982. he later came out as a gay man, became director of the massachusetts aids policy office and died in 1991; he had the disease when he died.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmitchell married her second husband, dale mitchell, chairman of the board of fidelity national bank, in 1984, taking his last name. in exchange, according to a story at the time in the oklahoman, he agreed to change his republican registration to democrat. two years later, she ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in the democratic primary.\n\nin 1992, dale mitchell was convicted of bank fraud, an experience that cleta mitchell later said was the result of overreaching government regulation. she became increasingly disenchanted with the social liberal policies she had supported and moved to washington to become director of the term limits institute. she advocated for allowing states to impose term limits on members of congress, a measure that the supreme court ruled unconstitutional. the combination of events led her to switch her registration to independent and then republican.\n\na glowing 1996 new yorker profile of her after she arrived in washington, headlined the outsider, described her as having given up the pursuit of elected office and setting herself as a leader of antipolitical action. the story quoted her as saying she used to be a social liberal who would sit in the state capitol thinking of all the good things i could do with other people's money but eventually turned against what she called our entitlement mentality.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwith her background as a democrat and her newfound fervor as a republican, she was courted by washington's conservative activists, and she became a leading lawyer for gop candidates and committees.\n\nshe came on the scene as a principled conservative democrat, referring to her fiscal outlook, and emerged as a leader among conservatives, said grover norquist, president of americans for tax reform, who hosts a weekly meeting in washington for conservative activists and intellectuals.\n\nshe became associated with legal matters involving the republican party, the national rifle association and other politically active groups — particularly around campaign finance law.\n\nad\n\nshe talked to republicans about how efforts to promote voter integrity and campaign finance reform were weaponized by democrats as a way of limiting the political power of conservatives, norquist said. she had a working knowledge of the democratic party and brought to republicans an awareness of how democrats were advocating for politics that would effectively shut down political opponents.\n\nad\n\none of mitchell's high-profile cases concerned a challenge to the mccain-feingold campaign finance law brought by the national rifle association and others in 2002.\n\nmitchell was co-counsel in that case with charles cooper, a conservative constitutional lawyer also representing the nra. the pair argued that the law's ban on soft money and other activities limited the first amendment rights of the nra and other groups. the court largely upheld the law in that case, but in subsequent challenges ruled in favor of claims that campaign finance rules undermined first amendment rights of free speech.\n\nad\n\nshe is a very solid lawyer and very knowledgeable in election and campaign finance law, cooper said.\n\ncooper said he listened to audio of the saturday phone call in which mitchell advocated for trump's effort to overturn the election. while cooper said he does not believe that the trump challenges to the election in georgia or any other state have any merit whatsoever, he said that mitchell, in her role in the call, was expressing a lawyerly frustration with an inability to obtain data necessary to investigate their concerns and to verify the secretary of state's defenses.\n\nad\n\nin the saturday call, trump told raffensperger that he risked facing criminal consequences if he didn't find enough votes to declare that the president had won the state. raffensperger responded that the challenge that you have is, the data you have is wrong.\n\ntrump then asked mitchell, well, cleta, how do you respond to that. maybe you tell me?\n\nmitchell complained to raffensperger that we have asked from your office for records that only you have but had not received them.\n\nmitchell raised her claim that around 4,500 people voted after having moved out of georgia. trump interjected that the number was in the 20s, apparently meaning in the 20-thousands, but raffensperger's general counsel, ryan germany, said those numbers were not accurate. every one we've been through are people that lived in georgia, moved to a different state, but then moved back to georgia legitimately.\n\nmitchell concluded her contribution by saying that she hadn't even addressed the claim that voting machines were rigged, which georgia officials denied. trump interjected that we don't need to prove that machines were rigged.\n\ntrump said, all we have to do, cleta, is find 11,000-plus votes.
during a recent online chat, i received a question from a nervous reader worried about not having enough income in retirement.\n\ni asked carolyn mcclanahan to address this person's concerns. mcclanahan is a physician turned certified financial planner who founded the fee-only life planning partners based in jacksonville, fla. she concentrates on how health intersects with personal finance, including aging, health-care costs and long-term care issues.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nread more: i feel you about the stock market swings\n\nq: i'm 35, single, and a renter, and have essentially no retirement savings. i'm not counting on social security, and even if i was, my payout is very low right now due to years of schooling.\n\ni make about $50,000 a year, and that won't change for the next few years. however, i am optimistic that in five years, i can get a job that will pay $70,000 to $80,000. i'm trying to plan a worst-case retirement scenario for me, which has me saving 20 percent of my income starting at age 45 (when my student loans should be paid off), retiring at 70, and living off $64,000 a year. using bankrate.com's calculator, that gives me 16 years of retirement.\n\nad\n\ndo you think $64,000 will be sufficient in the year 2053?\n\nwhat other things should i be worried about? i'm hoping that this really is worst-case and i can start saving at 40 (those extra five years give me an extra 10 years of retirement!), save more, make more, etc. i'm considering leaving my profession for one that will pay more because i'm so worried about my current state of retirement. i'm throwing all my extra money right now to paying off credit card debt — that should be done in three to four years. but if all these numbers sound reasonable to you, maybe i can keep doing what i'm doing instead of moving to a big corporation.\n\nad\n\na: it is wonderful that at 35, this person is thinking that far ahead. too many people wait too late to save and they are caught flat-footed later in life.\n\nad\n\nhowever, there is a balance. we cannot predict the future one year out much less 50 years out. life can change on a dime. i ask people to take stock of their life now. are you happy in your job and your life? do you make enough to live on? are you taking care of your health, and are you able to save some money? if you are hit by an illness or a bus today, did worrying about 50 years out really pay off if you didn't focus on making life great now? do you really want to change a job that you love because some calculator said you weren't going to have enough money?\n\nregarding the question: what other things should i be worried about?\n\ni joke that we get only so many worry minutes and then we die. people should focus on only what they can control and not worry about bridges that aren't even there yet to cross.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmy recommendation for this reader is to focus on paying off that credit card debt and vow never to charge it back up, but at the same time, if the person has a retirement plan at work where he or she gets matching funds, at least get the match. if not, focus on the credit card debt first. then take the money you were paying on that credit card and create an emergency fund of three months' expenses. then all the money that was being paid to the credit card should be put in savings.\n\nfor this period of time, pay attention to where money goes so you have a better handle on what you need when you can no longer work.\n\nad\n\ndon't focus on a retirement age — if you do what you love, you should try to do it as long as possible. one of my favorite professors in college was 88 years old — she taught history and had lived most of it!\n\nad\n\nover time, projections can be done to see how you are doing, but this should be used as a guide, not the gospel. the more important number to follow is spending — make sure it stays in check and that all spending is thoughtful use of money.\n\nread more:\n\nad\n\nlive chat this week\n\njoin me on thurs. jan. 10 at noon (eastern time) for a live discussion about your money. mcclanahan will be available to take your online questions about retirement.\n\non the day of the chat, you can join the discussion by clicking this link.\n\nyour thoughts\n\ni loved this line from mcclanahan: projections can be done to see how you are doing, but this should be used as a guide, not the gospel.\n\nad\n\ndo the projections of how much money you may need to retire scare you?

he knows, and he will, trotz said. if he can continue on where he's building on that [toronto] game, he's going to have to shoot more because he's going to be open more, when he skates the way i thought he did that game. he opens up so many options for everybody else. when they take those options away, he's going to have to take it to the net and deliver the pill to the back of the net hopefully.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nsaid kuznetsov: i always want to pass the puck if i see the guy open. that's kind of fun. i have to understand that i have to shoot more, but i don't have something in my mind that, 'oh, i'm going to shoot.' no, it's just whatever play's better.\n\nkuznetsov was washington's leading scorer last season, recording 20 goals and 57 assists. halfway through the season, he's on pace for roughly eight goals. he is averaging 1.95 shots per game this season after 2.35 last year. at five-on-five, kuznetsov's shots per 60 minutes are down from 7.35 last season to 6.11 this season.\n\nthrough 38 games, kuznetsov has four goals and 21 assists. are there moments when kuznetsov rewatches his shifts, and thinks, maybe i should have taken a shot there instead of passed?\n\nad\n\nif you look at your whole life back in a couple days, you always want to do something different, kuznetsov said. same in hockey of course. you want to change your mistakes. sometimes, hockey gives you another opportunity next shift. you just have to take it.\n\nad\n\n>>> it's a good thing the capitals recalled a 13th forward, liam o'brien, before their road game against the ottawa senators on saturday night, as illness is starting to spread throughout the team. on thursday night, backup goaltender philipp grubauer wasn't on the bench because he was getting fluids in a back room at verizon center. grubauer flew to ottawa later than the rest of the team on friday, visiting a doctor first.\n\nhe's not the only one ailing, apparently.\n\nad\n\nwe have a lot of guys that were sick last couple of days here, trotz said. that's just the flu bug, goes through everybody. trainers are on top of it. wash your hands and don't cough on each other. quarantine the guys that are not feeling well and keep the healthy guys away from them. that's basically all you can do.\n\n>>> though some guys might be feeling under the weather, morning skate rushes didn't reveal any lineup changes from the capitals' 5-0 win against the columbus blue jackets on thursday. defenseman taylor chorney and o'brien are expected to be scratched.\n\nad\n\no'brien was recalled on friday morning, a reward trotz wanted to give because and o'brien is enjoying a career year offensively in hershey with five goals and 13 assists. his 18 points through 28 games gave eclipsed the 16 points he scored in 59 games last season.\n\nad\n\nhe deserved to come up, trotz said. he's been playing very well for probably the last eight weeks, and he has been a difference-maker in hershey. you try to reward someone who's done very, very well, so it's just on merit.\n\nhere's what the lineup is expected to look like on saturday night:\n\nforwards\n\nalex ovechkin-nicklas backstrom-t. j. oshie\n\nmarcus johansson-evgeny kuznetsov-justin williams\n\nbrett connolly-lars eller-andre burakovsky\n\ndaniel winnik-jay beagle-tom wilson\n\ndefensemen\n\nkarl alzner-john carlson\n\ndmitry orlov-matt niskanen\n\nbrooks orpik-nate schmidt\n\ngoaltenders\n\nbraden holtby (starter)\n\nphilipp grubauer
the patriots, again, enter the playoffs as the super bowl favorites (per the betting markets) but here's something that should give you pause before backing a team that seems quite likely to reach the final nfl game of the year: they weren't tested much this season.\n\nsure, they may have been pressed during the absence of tom brady, the team's starting quarterback and a strong mvp candidate, for the first four games due to a suspension for his role in deflategate, but on the whole new england played the easiest schedule in the nfl, a slate of games that included two divisional matchups against the 5-11 new york jets and one each against the 1-15 cleveland browns, 2-14 san francisco 49ers and 4-12 los angeles rams. during the seven-game win streak to end the season, coach bill belichick had to overcome just one playoff team: the dolphins in the last regular-season game of the season.\n\ntake a look at the quarterbacks the patriots have faced this season. the blue line represents the passer's end-of-season total quarterback rating, espn's metric to value a quarterback on all play types on a 0-to-100 scale, and the red line is the average qbr of the top 20 passers in the nfl heading into week 17. as you can see, it would take more than backups like charlie whitehurst, jared goff, matt moore and landry jones to throw a scare into brady and belichick. moore, the patriots' opponent in week 17, has a high qbr but was making his third start of the season, so discard that due to sample size. other passers faced included ryan fitzpatrick (twice), the second-to-worst passer this season per qbr, trevor siemian, brock osweiler and joe flacco. none even met the average of a qb in the top two-thirds of the league.\n\nbeating weak opponents issue free is exactly what you want to see from a good team like the patriots, however, it may have masked a potential weakness by helping to make new england's defense look better than it is. the patriots allowed a league-low 1.4 points per drive, yet per football outsiders, the average offense they played against in 2016 was equivalent to the 7-8-1 arizona cardinals, a team that went three-and-out once out of every four drives, 23rd highest rate in the nfl.\n\none point before we proceed: their defense isn't clearly a weakness, but we just don't know based on their scheduling. and what we do know is that one metric paints a pretty murky picture about their defense's potential to be great in the playoffs.\n\nad\n\nad\n\npressuring the passer hasn't been a strength for the patriots in recent history, but it has never been this bad in the brady-era, either. this season, the team has a sack rate of 5.4 percent after adjusting for down, distance and opponent. the league average is 6.1 percent. in other words, the patriots still ranked 23rd in the nfl despite not having to face very good offenses this year — and that will most certainly change in the playoffs. but the mitigating factor is when the patriots will face those good offenses.\n\nthe patriots will play the lowest remaining seed in the afc during the divisional round, with potential opponents including the miami dolphins, houston texans and oakland raiders. the kansas city chiefs are the no. 2 seed, the steelers the no. 3 and they could play new england in the afc championship game. two of those opposing offensive lines, the raiders and chiefs, tied for the least amount of pressure allowed this season (117 total sacks, hits and hurries allowed). the steelers ranked seventh (133 pressures allowed). that's challenging for any team to overcome, especially one with a mediocre pass rush.\n\ninjuries to derek carr, oakland's starting quarterback (and potentially to backup matt mcgloin), and the presence of alex smith under center for the chiefs might not be enough to sway you from backing new england as the eventual super bowl winner, but the patriots will also have to beat a team from the nfc in order to claim the ultimate prize. and the steelers could present a challenge as well. remember, ben roethlisberger missed the earlier meeting between the patriots and steelers.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nroethlisberger finished ranked no. 10 in qbr. in the other conference, the two top seeds in the nfc boast the second and third-best passers in the nfl per qbr, ryan and prescott, and rodgers is close behind at no. 4. matthew stafford of the detroit lions finished at no. 8.\n\nand those qbs will be a problem if the patriots can't create pressure. (and some may be trouble even if new england can get after the quarterback.)\n\nthe green bay packers, dallas cowboys and atlanta falcons ranked no. 3, no. 5 and no. 8, respectively, for least amount of pressure allowed by the offensive line this season. and their respective quarterbacks were among the best at producing with a clean pocket.\n\nfalcons quarterback matt ryan led the league with a 130.4 passer rating in a clean pocket. cowboys qb dak prescott ranked third (118.0) and the packers' aaron rodgers ranked eighth (106.7). rodgers proved this year that even when you pressure him he is still going to beat you. he threw 10 touchdowns and just one interception under pressure for a league-high 90.8 passer rating, a rating higher than the one produced by carolina panthers starting quarterback cam newton in a clean pocket (87.8) this season.\n\nthe no. 3 seed in the nfc, the seattle seahawks, saw its quarterback, russell wilson, produce the second-best passer rating (881.) and complete over half of his passes (55.4 percent) under pressure, despite a porous offensive line.\n\nad\n\nad\n\none player to watch for new england is linebacker dont'a hightower. he finished 2016 with 25 total sacks, hits and hurries in 13 games, the most he has played since 2013, and was the highest-rated pass-rushing linebacker this season per the game charters at pro football focus. the problem there? he was that good and the patriots' pass-rush was still mediocre. new england will need to see its other players overachieve if they are going to ramp up the pressure.

here is what they have to say:\n\nbrenda chapman\n\noscar-winning filmmaker (brave, the prince of egypt):\n\nad\n\nuse your voice. say what's on your mind. if you run up against sexism, or any other negative '-ism,' call it out — with humor if possible, but if not, then with conviction. swallow your fear and be fired up by your passion. if your path is unfairly blocked, then find away around that obstacle, enlisting allies who share your convictions and belief that you have every right to work and be creative and that your voice should be heard.\n\nad\n\nmost important, do the same for other women, young and old, whose voices, work and creative spirit should be given equity. stand together, and we all stand stronger.\n\ndon't forget that we are half of our species, and [that] without us, the other half would not exist. we are equal — even with our differences. let's not allow what progress we've made slip away or get brushed aside like the progress that was made in the 1970s.\n\nad\n\ncece bell\n\neisner award-winning graphic novelist (el deafo) and illustrator:\n\nit might seem like so many forces are against you forging a creative path in this world, especially in these times of internet criticism and sexism.\n\njust remember that when you have a good idea, that's power. protect that power when you're turning your idea into something more. you can — and you should — ignore the rest of the world while you're writing or drawing or crafting. i have found, as someone who has trouble communicating [because of deafness], that the only communication that really matters for creative people is that which happens between us and the materials we are using to make stuff.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nand finally, if you choose to share what you make, disregard the haters. that's the best way maintain your power so that you can keep creating.\n\nlynda barry\n\neisner hall of fame cartoonist and visual educator:\n\nalways carry a pen and a notebook with you — write down the crazy things you hear people say: the good, the bad, the confusing. if you can draw a picture of them saying it, even better!

cuomo, widely seen as a potential contender for the democratic presidential nomination in 2020, said the provision is violative of states' rights and the principle of equal protection.\n\nad\n\nwashington has launched an all-out, direct attack on new york state's economic future, cuomo said at his state of the state address in albany. it is crass. it is ugly. it is divisive. it is partisan legislating. it is an economic civil war. make no mistake: they are aiming to hurt us.\n\nad\n\nthe new gop law caps how much taxpayers can deduct in state and local taxes at $10,000; previously, the deduction was unlimited. as a result, new york residents could pay an additional $14 billion in federal taxes, cuomo said, and taxpayers in california, new jersey and illinois are also expected to pay more under the change. gov. phil murphy (d-n.j.) told cnbc last month that everything is on the table in terms of combating the gop law, including challenging its legality and constitutionality in court.\n\nbut constitutional law professors express doubt that the federal courts will seriously entertain striking down the gop's cap on the deduction. they noted that republicans had articulated justifications for ending the state and local deduction beyond a simple attempt to punish liberal voters, and argued that a successful lawsuit may in fact wind up harming progressive policy priorities in the long run.\n\nad\n\nthe overall incoherence of the bill is real, so i'm sympathetic to new york's claims, said professor darien shanske of the university of california davis school of law. but there are non-crazy arguments for getting rid of the deduction — there's a rational reason to get rid of it, even if it's one you disagree with.\n\nad\n\ncuomo's administration, working with state attorney general eric schneiderman, is exploring a number of legal challenges. they could include arguments that the gop plan violates the 10th and 14th amendments to the constitution.\n\nnew york state is exploring a variety of legal claims in response to the divisive federal salt law, the state's chief counsel, alphonso david, said in a statement. the practical and intended impact of this law is to impose a disadvantage on 'blue' states. courts have historically rejected government action that inappropriately targets a class of people and this should be no different.\n\nad\n\ncongress would have violated the 14th amendment had republicans passed a tax bill that, for example, specified that taxes be raised on democratic voters and lowered on republican voters. but the bill's defenders, and even some of its critics, say that there are nonpartisan justifications for capping the deduction. speaker paul d. ryan (r-wis.), for instance, argued throughout that the tax debate that eliminating or paring back the deduction would force blue states to lower their local taxes — not that doing so would help make lives miserable for coastal elites.\n\nad\n\nthe federal government is eliminating what had been an unfair benefit. the u.s. constitution does not require that high-tax states can give themselves a large federal tax cut, which is essentially what salt does, said brian riedl, senior fellow at the libertarian-leaning manhattan institute, who added of the cuomo lawsuit: it's completely frivolous and there's no basis for it.\n\ncuomo's other likely argument, that the gop tax law violates the 10th amendment's guarantee of state sovereignty, may also not stand up in court, according to shanske. the 16th amendment gives congress the authority to institute a federal income tax, and the federal government has the authority to determine which deductions can be claimed.\n\nad\n\ni think that's also a loser, shanske said of the 10th amendment claim.\n\nmichael dorf, a constitutional law professor at cornell law school, has argued the provision could be struck down if it could be shown to have been designed to punish democrats, perhaps under the first amendment. but dorf also acknowledged that the climb to a successful legal challenge to the new law appears steep.
this was the workshop of sculptor edward virginius valentine. though he missed the civil war while studying art in europe, valentine returned home to the ruins of richmond in 1865 and shaped the way generations would view that era of american history.\n\ntoday, the artist's studio is closed to visitors at the richmond museum that bears his family name — the valentine. but museum director martin and others see the workshop as the center of what could be a public reckoning with the racist mythology that valentine's sculptures helped bring to life.\n\nworking in virtuous white plaster, then recasting for the ages in stone or bronze, valentine created heroic images of fallen confederate leaders that defined the lost cause. nearly a century after the artist died in 1930 at the age of 91, his creations are drawing as much attention as when they were first unveiled before multitudes — but for different reasons.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe lee statue that recently came down from statuary hall at the u.s. capitol was a valentine. the figure of confederate president jefferson davis that protesters hauled from its pedestal on richmond's monument avenue in june was a valentine — and its copy came down from a square in new orleans in 2017.\n\nnow the valentine museum has petitioned the city of richmond to let it display the davis statue from monument avenue — not in its former glory, but tipped over, dented and covered with paint from protesters.\n\nactually bringing that statue back to the spot where it was created has a unique power to it, martin said. when you think about the creation of the lost cause myth — it was built around this particular spot in this garden at the valentine.\n\nad\n\nthe power of that myth is what protesters confronted in richmond and other southern cities all summer, after the killing of george floyd in police custody in minneapolis triggered national demonstrations for racial justice.\n\nprotesters in richmond tore down a statue of the confederacy president jefferson davis on june 10. (dylan garner/richmond times-dispatch via storyful)\n\nunder that version of history, the prewar south was a land of magnolias and chivalry where women were belles, men were noble cavaliers and black people were happy to be enslaved. it was no coincidence that the lost cause took root in the post-war years of reconstruction, undercutting social advances and shackling black americans to bad jobs and poor schooling for another century.\n\nad\n\nvalentine literally did some of the work to make these ideas tangible, said josh epperson, a consultant based in richmond working with the museum to rethink its mission. epperson, who is black, has hosted brainstorming sessions over the past few months with diverse community members, including social activists and business leaders.\n\nad\n\nnot all were thrilled about the idea of giving the toppled davis monument a new home, arguing that even in its diminished state, it glorifies the old ideologies. the reaction showed just how much raw feeling and raw pain there is still attached to those objects, epperson said.\n\nbut he found that all the community members were really interested in folks dealing directly with who benefited from these narratives of the lost cause, which includes, obviously, the valentine family.\n\nad\n\nthe name was already prominent before the sculptor became well known. edward's brother, mann s. valentine ii, earned a fortune through a product called valentine's meat juice — which was exactly as it sounds and proved excellent at nourishing wounded soldiers during the war and restoring weak constitutions after.\n\nad\n\nmann valentine founded the museum in 1898, stocking it smithsonian-style with collections of odd fossils, rocks and indian artifacts. over time, it became dedicated to the history of the city.\n\nedward valentine had his studio in a nearby carriage house, which after his death was relocated to the grounds of the museum. when he returned from years of studying under noted sculptors in europe, valentine began executing works for what was left of richmond society.\n\nhe created likenesses of presidents george washington and thomas jefferson, including the jefferson that still stands in the lobby of richmond's jefferson hotel. lee visited his studio in 1870 to have his face measured; in 1873, davis returned for the same reason to the capital he had fled eight years before.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ncurators at the museum are digging deeper into valentine's character, combing through his journals to learn more about his personal views. but there are at least two clues in his work. one is that valentine never created likenesses of president abraham lincoln, even though that might have been a hot-selling product.\n\nand the other is that some of valentine's most popular images were depictions of black people that seem openly exploitative. a young boy who unloaded coal for valentine's studio was immortalized as the nation's ward, a bust with exaggerated features that martin said fit into the demeaning tradition of pickaninny caricatures. another subject was henry page, who had been enslaved by the valentine family and was depicted as the kindly, smiling uncle henry — akin to an uncle tom figure.\n\nwhen page died in 1886 at 101, his obituary appeared in the local newspaper, and his pallbearers included white members of the valentine family as well as black men. what that says about the complicated relationships of the day, martin said, is something the museum hopes to learn more about.\n\nad\n\nad\n\npart of what we want to do with the studio interpretation is really humanize henry page. he was a man, said christina vida, the museum's curator of general collections.\n\nanother goal is to explore the social consequences of such damaging symbols.\n\ni think public art contributes to private thought, and private thought influences public policy, vida said. that means connecting the dots to persistent inequities in housing, health care, education and criminal justice, she added.\n\nhow erasing black people from local and national history for over 300 years led to the removal of confederate statues in richmond, virginia. (the washington post)\n\nthe museum plans to renovate the studio, rethink the exhibit and reopen it sometime in 2022. it's raising money along the way. and the work will go forward whether the valentine obtains the ruined davis statue.\n\nad\n\nthe city is still taking applications from interested parties all over the country who want to house davis or any of the 10 or so confederate monuments that were removed over the summer.\n\nin the meantime, there's still plenty of edward valentine art out in the world. one of the most famous is the recumbent statue of lee near the confederate general's tomb at washington and lee university in lexington — which is embroiled in a debate about whether to change the institution's name.\n\nad\n\nnot all his works are politically charged. valentine created the statue of naturalist john james audubon that stands in new orleans and a deeply spooky representation of grief atop a grave in richmond's hollywood cemetery.\n\nad\n\nbut his reputation is forever linked to the figures of confederate leaders that galvanized the summer's black lives matter protests — some of which played out on the streets around the museum.\n\none night during the first weekend in june, martin hunkered down alone inside the valentine as police moved aggressively against protesters outside. he heard voices near a window, peeked out and saw about a dozen young demonstrators crouched in the darkness on the museum's grounds, hiding from police.\n\nmartin beckoned them inside, where they treated one another with milk washes for eyes stung by chemical agents. eventually, martin ventured out and spoke with a police officer, who told him vans were leaving with scores of protesters in custody. once the coast was clear, the demonstrators who were holed up in the valentine ran away safely.\n\nad\n\nthe next morning, martin and other museum staffers picked up rubber bullets, spray paint cans and protest signs from the streets outside. they added them to their collection of richmond history, along with confederate gen. stonewall jackson's death mask and lee's boots.
even as we failed to elect a woman as president of the united states for the first time, we can root for these young queens to consolidate power and exert their own wills independent of their advisers, because they were born into power rather than having campaigned for it. elizabeth and victoria didn't do the thing that americans appear to find so unseemly in ambitious women: go to the public and advertise their own qualifications and their desire for high office.\n\nthe circumstances of their very existence constitute a kind of womanly demurral. pushing back against a domineering mother, as in victoria, or refusing to be cowed by a minister who underestimates her, as elizabeth does in the crown, doesn't make queens shrill or arrogant; it's simply them making the best of a situation and a station that they have no choice but to weather.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nas with hillary clinton's approval ratings, which tended to go up when she was doing a job and took hits when she was seeking new positions, these responses reveal an unresolved tension in our attitudes toward women in public life.\n\nit's one thing to object to the prospect of giving women prominent roles in public life at all; that would at least be consistent with a squeamishness about women's participation in the process by which politicians seek office. instead, it seems that we would prefer some sort of magic that places women in these jobs without our having to witness their participation in the quest for power. maybe we would be happier if women got into politics only when their husbands died and their widows were appointed to fill their seats, or some other process that circumvents the prospect of actual campaigning. maybe it's that we like the idea of benefiting from women's talents and women's work, but heaven forfend that a woman actually enjoy the power of her office, or think so highly of her own skills and character that she has the temerity to think she deserves it.\n\nand in fact, both the crown and victoria have plots in which their young queens face humiliating confrontations with their shortcomings. victoria, eager to free herself from the manipulations and insinuations of sir john conroy (paul rhys), makes an impetuous allegation that he has fathered a child out of wedlock and subjects lady flora hastings (alice orr-ewing) to a humiliating medical examination that ends up disproving victoria's own charges. elizabeth must face the consequence of her limited education, which leaves her to send her staff searching for school-room notebooks so that she can find talking points for a debate on constitutional principles.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nvictoria and elizabeth overcome these obstacles and become better women and more confident rulers for it. but it's still telling that even in stories that take as their premise young women rising to meet difficult challenges, the enemy often lies within, rather than presenting itself in the form of political obstruction or foreign aggressors. (both shows also delve into the dilemmas of young men who marry into a position that requires them to walk a few steps behind their wives, a historical reality that nonetheless reinforces the age-old message that marriages in which the woman is more powerful necessarily involve strain and unhappiness.)
then came wednesday's tweet from former nationals general manager-turned sirius xm radio and espn analyst jim bowden, who noted that the nationals maintained interest in reliever greg holland and catcher matt wieters but are way over budget on spring training complex, making decision difficult. the nationals, meanwhile, denied any connection between their spring training spending and player payroll.\n\none has nothing to do with the other, a nationals spokesperson said wednesday. our spring training facility budget does not impact our ability to sign players.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nis the nationals' spring training project, rushed as it is, becoming more expensive than anticipated? well, the final cost of the project, which is not done yet, is still unclear. what is clear is this: the original stadium deal, which the nationals' and astros' joint company (hw spring training, llc) made with palm beach county, includes an initial budget of $135 million. any overages would be the responsibility of the teams, who had already committed to pay for about a third of the project, though they are doing so over the course of their lease, in part through use fees.\n\nbut the nationals expected to pay some overages, too. more information on exactly how much more they spent than they anticipated will likely become available when the project is complete, but remember: the joint company, not just one team, is responsible for overages. in other words, the nationals and astros are both responsible.\n\nadditionally, the notion that the nationals would use the same budget for player payroll as for a capital project such as their spring training facility does not withstand scrutiny. ultimately, the nationals' ownership group is responsible for both costs, so in some sense, the budget originates from the same place. but the nationals bid tens of millions on closers mark melancon and kenley jansen this winter. given that, one could logically conclude that they can probably afford holland, who would come at a much lower price.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nholland was one of two players mentioned in bowden's tweet as someone in whom the nationals have interest (as has been reported here throughout the offseason), but he's one they are wary of spending to acquire. he and wieters are represented by scott boras, who is a master of message, and of using message to master the market.\n\nbryce harper responded to bowden's report with this, suggesting he would rather have the nationals pay up for players than spend on spring training:\n\nharper, always outspoken about dream additions to the nationals roster, has now turned to twitter twice this offseason to comment on player moves. in the moments after the nationals dealt their two top pitching prospects to the white sox for adam eaton, harper tweeted simply, wow. eaton, as it happened, retweeted harper's tweet about fellow boras clients wieters and holland on wednesday.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbut the nationals as an organization have been rather quiet this offseason. other than committing $13.625 million to harper in arbitration, more than many projections predicted the 24-year-old would receive, they have not spent much at all. the eaton trade is by far their biggest splash so far, and a re-signing of chris heisey marks the only free agent deal certain to affect their big league roster. could spring training spending be a reason for their relative inactivity?
this time, however, bachelor matt james is new to everyone. he was to appear on clare's season, but as we'll explain below, he was plucked to be a star before ever serving as a supporting character. here's everything you need to know about matt james and his premiere as the show's first black lead.\n\nwho is matt james?\n\naccording to his official abc bio, he's a real estate broker living in new york city. he was 28 when his season was filmed and is now 29. as he said during monday night's premiere, he's never been in love. and as his contestants and chris harrison continually remark, he's very hot and very tall. according to instagram, he's also pals with tyler cameron and former bachelorette hannah brown. he studied economics at wake forest university, where he also played wide receiver on the football team. matt is biracial; he was raised by a single white mother who split from his black father when he was young. in a touching conversation with his mother, matt talked about how 2020 taught him that nothing goes according to plan, making him realize there's no perfect person out there for him. he said he's looking for someone who's weathered storms, who's resilient, strong.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbefore his contestants arrived, matt sat down with harrison and addressed the pressure he feels as the first black bachelor. people want you to end up with a certain type of person, matt said, adding that he's a product of interracial marriage and knows that whomever he picks, viewers will have strong feelings. after noting he doesn't want to upset black or white viewers, matt said, but i'm both of those! how do i please everybody?\n\nhe'll learn soon enough that pleasing everyone is not possible on this show. however, matt hopes that being in this position normalizes this for other people of color, he told usa today.\n\nchristianity is clearly very important to matt, which he showcased in his first few moments with his contestants, leading them in a group prayer. he thanked god for bringing us all together, healthy and asked god to bless this time we have together.\n\nwhy is this season historic?\n\nthe bachelor franchise, which started in 2002, has been criticized for years for its lack of diversity — in 2012, two african american men who auditioned for the series filed a racial discrimination class-action lawsuit. then in may, as the country faced a reckoning over racial injustice and police brutality, abc announced james as the show's new lead.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwe don't want this, in any way, to seem like a cure-all and seem like, 'hey! look what we did here!' we know this is a few grains of sand in a very big hourglass, abc programming executive robert mills told variety. it's taken a while to get where we are and we will continue to go further, and i acknowledge it may not be enough.\n\nrachel lindsay, who was the first black lead of the bachelorette in 2017 and is an outspoken critic of the show's embarrassing lack of diversity, said on a podcast that it was great to see james's casting — but it was also the bare minimum the producers could do, and still didn't address the internal, embedded, deep-rooted issues in this franchise where it needs to change structurally.\n\nwhere are they filming?\n\nthough watching the two-hour episode without a mask in sight might fool you into thinking the bachelor was filmed on some planet far away from the coronavirus pandemic, matt's season was made similar to clare crawley's. only instead of being shot at the blistering la quinta resort in palm springs, calif., in the heat of summer, the cast and crew are at nemacolin, a resort in farmington, pa. (they quarantined and were tested ahead of time.)\n\nad\n\nad\n\nif this wooded setting looks familiar, bachelor fans might remember it from jojo fletcher's 2016 season of the bachelorette. it appears there's a lot more to do here than at the la quinta. there's wildlife on the grounds, paintball, a zip-line, slot machines and a spa. and if you reallllyyy miss the bachelor mansion in malibu, it's available for rent via airbnb. just $6,000 a night!\n\nwho had the most outrageous introduction?\n\ncontestants know that if you don't want the humiliation of going home the first night, you better have a memorable introduction when you meet the star of the show. kaili, a 26-year-old hostess from chicago, tried her best: she arrived wearing only lingerie, and coyly asked a rather startled matt if he could help her decide which dress to wear. unfortunately for kaili, she was instantly upstaged by katie, a 29-year-old bank marketing manager from washington state, who launched into a monologue about how she brought something special from home … and then revealed her vibrator.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmatt burst out laughing, while the other contestants gasped while watching the interaction from the window: what?! no, she did not! one exclaimed. producers loved this scene so much that they also played it at the beginning of the episode — but they were also scandalized enough that they placed a black bar over the device on screen, as to not offend viewers' delicate sensibilities (or maybe network television regulations).\n\nwho got the first-impression rose?\n\nmatt isn't the only cast member making history this season. abigail, a 25-year-old client financial manager from beaverton, ore., is the show's first deaf contestant. matt instructed the women to be vulnerable with him, as the show's leads often do. after she told him about the challenges she has been through, matt recognizes that she's a fighter and gave her the first-impression rose. they kissed. it was one of the purest first impressions we've ever seen.\n\nwho is likely to be this season's villain?\n\nkit, the 21-year-old fashion entrepreneur from new york, seems ripe for the role. she's the youngest contestant, appears exceptionally smug, and is already the most famous, as she's the daughter of designer cynthia rowley and launched her own clothing line as a teenager. however, victoria, a 27-year-old from los angeles whose only job description is queen, was so obviously thirsty for the title (and, obviously, a spot on bachelor in paradise) that it would be almost cruel to deny her the designation.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nvictoria was carried in on a throne by four men, wore a tiara and introduced herself as victoria, like the queen. everyone obviously immediately despised her, and no doubt were ecstatic that she immediately tripped and fell after her royal arrival. however, in a preview of the season, viewers saw those wily producers invite even more women to join the show in future weeks — so victoria may face some evil competition.
for millions of snow-deprived souls bordering the atlantic, another missed opportunity seems possible this coming weekend as a powerful storm lurks offshore. there is room, however, for that to change.\n\nweather models are consistent in developing a strong storm off the coast of the mid-atlantic and new england on saturday. preliminary data suggests that the storm may strengthen, intensifying quickly and perhaps attaining bomb cyclone status.\n\nbut its track probably makes it too little, too late to affect the northeast. instead, it could have its sights set on newfoundland or nova scotia. but it's important to note that, six days away, storm tracks can shift.\n\nad\n\nad\n\namong the greatest uncertainties with the potential storm is the degree to which two regions of jet stream energy phase. the jet stream is a river of swiftly moving air in the upper atmosphere. it's in a split flow regime, with a strip of northern-stream and southern-stream energy.\n\nphasing occurs when pent-up kinks or bends in both jet streams line up, their effects combining constructively and spelling a greater storm potential.\n\nin addition, the southern stream will transport the moisture necessary to spark a whopper storm, while the cold air needed for snow is bottled up in the northern disturbance. it's looking possible that the phasing and coming together of various atmospheric elements will occur too late, sparing the east coast.\n\nthat may be different for storm-weary parts of extreme eastern canada, but that remains to be seen.\n\neven if the streams of flow manage to come together and unleash stormy conditions in the mid-atlantic and northeast, it's not clear if the air will be sufficiently cold for snowfall, especially along and east of the interstate 95 corridor.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthere is unlikely enough cold air to support accumulating snow even if we do get precipitation on saturday, wes junker, the capital weather gang's winter weather expert, said concerning the washington area's snow prospects. the pattern continues to be discouraging for snow lovers. promises of cold air and storms keep getting pushed back into fantasy land.\n\nmost major cities in the mid-atlantic and northeast have seen below-normal accumulations for this deep into the winter.\n\nbut not everyone is lacking; some cities in interior central and northern new england have actually been running above average.\n\nwashington's average snow through late january is 8.0 inches. they currently rest at 0.6 inches .\n\nbaltimore's average snow through late january is 9.0 inches. they currently rest at 1.8 inches.\n\nphiladelphia's average snow through late january is 9.3 inches. they currently rest at 0.3 inches.\n\nnew york's average snow through late january is 11.0 inches. they currently rest at 4.8 inches.\n\nhartford, conn.'s average snow through late january is 20.5 inches. they currently rest at 25.3 inches.\n\nprovidence, r.i.'s average snow through late january is 18.4 inches. they currently rest at 11.6 inches.\n\nworcester, mass.'s average snow through late january is 32.6 inches. they currently rest at 29.4 inches.\n\nboston's average snow through late january is 22.0 inches. they currently rest at 14.6 inches.\n\nportland, maine's average snow through late january is 32.0 inches. they currently rest at 41.2 inches.

nguyen died of blunt force injuries, the clark county coroner's office told the las vegas review-journal. her death was ruled a homicide.\n\nad\n\nthe incident unfolded saturday afternoon, after the suspect sat for a $35 manicure at nguyen's salon, crystal nails and spa. nguyen co-managed the business with her longtime partner, sonny chung. the female customer tried to pay with a credit card, chung told the review-journal, but the card was declined multiple times.\n\nad\n\nthe woman told nguyen she would retrieve money from her car, chung said. the couple followed the woman outside, approached the car and tried to get the driver's attention.\n\nnhu annie ngoc quynh nguyen, 51, was killed dec. 29 in las vegas outside her nail salon when she tried to stop a fleeing customer. (kvvu-tv)\n\nmy wife ran out and tried to stop her, and then [the customer] rolled forward, chung told the review-journal.\n\npolice said the driver hit nguyen and dragged her before fleeing the store parking lot. witnesses told fox 5 vegas the altercation was over within seconds.\n\nad\n\ni tried to hold the car back, but i'm not superman, chung told the review-journal. she ran off for $35 and killed my wife — $35 to run my wife over.\n\na gofundme page created by family to help defray funeral costs describes nguyen as an extremely hard working woman and dutiful mother who always put her children first. her job took her across the united states, the page said, and nguyen often worked 12 hour days, seven days a week so she could pay for her daughters to attend college. nguyen also helped financially support her mother, siblings and grandchildren.\n\nad\n\nallowing them to have a greater opportunity in life, she worked endlessly, the gofundme description says. nguyen would skip meals so her family would not have to work as hard as she did.\n\nad\n\nfamily told fox 5 vegas nguyen had lived around the country, in florida, california, michigan and arizona, before settling in las vegas two years ago. she had been in a relationship with chung for nearly 13 years, he told the review-journal. nguyen had three daughters — all in their 20s — and two young grandchildren, chung said. they live in california but were in town for the holidays.\n\nmetropolitan police department lt. ray spencer told the newspaper the rental car, a black chevrolet camaro, was reported stolen about three weeks ago. hours after the salon incident, authorities found the unoccupied vehicle at a nearby apartment complex.\n\nad\n\nwe do not believe the person who originally rented the car is the suspect, spencer told the review-journal.\n\nad\n\noutside the salon, a makeshift memorial had been set up, according to the newspaper. one of nguyen's granddaughters had written a message on notebook paper covered with hearts: we love you grandma.\n\nand on the door of the salon that is usually open 12 hours a day, seven days a week, a sign read: sorry, we will be closed until further notice. thank you and happy new years.\n\npolice are still investigating nguyen's death and said wednesday morning there was no additional information on the case.
while the lasting effects of brexit on london probably won't be known for years, the first business day after britain's jan. 1 departure from the single market was a significant turning point — and not just symbolically.\n\nbecause eu investors must trade european shares inside the bloc (unless they're denominated in pounds), brokers and exchanges have been advising customers from the u.k. and the rest of the world to also buy and sell equities via eu hubs, where liquidity is now likely to be deeper.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe result? on monday, the first trading day of 2021, public data on exchanges pointed to london having lost almost 45% of the volume of stock that would have gone through the city at the end of last year. about 6.3 billion euros ($7.7 billion) of shares that would have traded on london-based platforms changed hands in the eu, according to data compiled by cboe global markets inc., which now handles some of those exchanges from amsterdam.\n\nit was only one day of trading and habits could still change, but it's hard to imagine the circumstances under which the eu would want that activity to return to london. indeed, snapping up other financial business of even greater economic significance will be next on europe's agenda.\n\nthe departure of eu stock trading from the british capital wasn't unexpected. soon after the 2016 u.k. vote to leave the single market, the financial services industry started preparing for the worst. sidelined in the trade discussions, it quickly became apparent that finance would lose unfettered access to the bloc, leaving firms with little choice but to set up eu bases to serve the region's clients. late last year, some big banks shifted large chunks of their balance sheets across the channel.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ntrading will inevitably migrate to where investors can get the best execution. if eu clients had to move their business, it was inevitable that their financiers would follow. why would a u.s or japanese investor keep trading eu stocks in london if that's not where they'd be getting the best price?\n\nmore surprising — and more alarming for london — is the apparent seamlessness with which the new year move happened. going into the final stages of brexit negotiations at the end of last year, regulators were cautiously optimistic that most risks to financial stability had been mitigated and any disruption would be minimal. but the ease with which the eu has been able to seize control of share trading — a key emblem of its financial markets — will only embolden europe to pursue yet more business (assuming there are no bumps over coming days).\n\nfor now, trading firms are still allowed to carry out market-making of eu shares from outside the bloc. why not bring that under brussels oversight too? that would be a big prize, involving substantial amounts of capital and human intellect. the clearing of derivatives, in which the u.k. has been granted temporary equivalence with eu rules until june 2022, could be next.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nlondon's dominance as an investment-management hub is also uncertain. the european commission is studying whether to tighten rules over how eu–based funds delegate the management of portfolios to investors outside the bloc. while delegation isn't likely to be banned, brussels could make it more expensive to manage funds from third-party countries such as the u.k. by increasing compliance and governance obligations.\n\nbritain and the eu have agreed to draft a memorandum of understanding around the regulation of financial markets by march, an agreement that will supplement the broader christmas eve trade agreement, but which won't be as legally binding. the hope on both sides must be that it establishes a framework for granting equivalent access to each others' markets, with predictable rules and proper consultation on any decision to withdraw access. greater visibility will allow finance firms to determine which businesses will be worth duplicating between london and continental hubs, and which activities will simply cease to be economically viable — either in the u.k. or the bloc.\n\nthe shift in stock trading is a poignant sign of what the eu is aiming for as it seeks to establish a deeper capital market to fund its economies and wean its companies off bank loans. in the words of one market participant, it's not 'big bang,' it's 'bang and it's gone.' the eu's dependence on the city of london is no longer a given.\n\nthis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or bloomberg lp and its owners.\n\nelisa martinuzzi is a bloomberg opinion columnist covering finance. she is a former managing editor for european finance at bloomberg news.\n\nfor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com/opinion
opponents cite what they say would be the risk of environmental damage from the construction and from the operation of the terminal. they also question the safety of transporting 3 million to 4 million gallons of lng a day through the philadelphia metropolitan area — to a site that for a century was a dupont dynamite factory.\n\nad\n\nthe project could be an early test of the biden administration's commitment to stronger environmental measures and efforts to combat climate change. it has the backing of local elected officials, business leaders in southern new jersey and, perhaps most significantly, labor unions that argue it will bring jobs to a distressed area.\n\nad\n\nnew fortress energy is seeking to build the terminal, on the repauno plant site opposite tinicum island and chester, pa. new fortress is led by wes edens, who is a co-owner of the national basketball association's milwaukee bucks and argues that natural gas is a bridge fuel to more-sustainable energy sources in the future.\n\nthe company did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nthe delaware riverkeeper network, a nonprofit advocacy group, has led opposition to the project, and its members are hoping president-elect joe biden's concerns for his home state of delaware — downriver from gibbstown — will tip the balance.\n\nhe was always protective of delaware's coastal resources, tracy carluccio, deputy director of delaware riverkeeper network, said of biden. they're at the bottom of the delaware river watershed, and they get all the bad stuff that everyone's dumping upstream.\n\nad\n\nad\n\neven before the coronavirus pandemic struck, natural-gas prices were severely depressed in the united states as stockpiles grew and many oil producers chose simply to flare the gas they were extracting as a byproduct. president trump actively promoted export sales of lng as a way to support the market.\n\nearly last year, the transportation department moved to allow railroads to transport lng for the first time, over the objections of environmentalists, the national transportation safety board, native american tribes and other groups.\n\nthe idea, backed by new fortress, was to get the lng to saltwater ports where it could be loaded on ships.\n\ncarluccio said that means if the gibbstown project goes ahead, oceangoing tankers laden with lng will be sailing past low-income neighborhoods in chester, followed by the port of wilmington, various coastal refuges on the delaware and new jersey riverbanks, and delaware's beaches.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthey get all the danger and none of the benefits, she said.\n\nlng has been transported by sea for about 60 years, with few safety issues, but under certain conditions a cloud of escaped gas could ignite, with potentially devastating consequences. a failure of the thermal systems that keep stored lng at minus-260 degrees fahrenheit could also lead to what is called a boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion, or bleve.\n\nthe gibbstown project has received a green light from the coast guard, the army corps of engineers, the new jersey department of environmental protection and — on an administrative appeal last month — the delaware river basin commission.\n\nad\n\nbut the army corps and new jersey environmental rulings have been challenged in court, and carluccio said her organization plans to take the delaware river basin commission to court before a february deadline. another possible battleground will be the federal energy regulatory commission: new fortress has asked for a ruling saying that the commission lacks jurisdiction over the project, which environmentalists will argue against.\n\nad\n\nthe natural resources defense council contends that the project violates clean-water laws and regulations. actor mark ruffalo co-wrote an op-ed in the new york daily news attacking the project. every part of the way lng is extracted, transported and stored is dirty and dangerous, it said.\n\nthe new jersey sierra club argues that the project would damage wetlands that support the atlantic sturgeon and other endangered species and would spur even more hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, in nearby pennsylvania.\n\nbut some unions have strongly supported the project.\n\nad\n\nsince 1902, the international brotherhood of electrical workers has contributed to the industrial growth in communities across southern new jersey and along the delaware river, daniel cosner, business manager for ibew local 351, wrote in a letter to the river commission. for the past century, the jobs we have completed have helped build the middle class and ensured the economy works for everyone. this project does just that.\n\nad\n\nthe terminal will bring new life to this once-blighted facility while creating hundreds of good paying, union construction-related jobs and providing much needed tax revenue to the community, he wrote.\n\nadditional support comes from the iron workers union, the pilots' association for the bay and river delaware, the united brotherhood of carpenters and several business associations.\n\nad\n\nan engineer working for new fortress, kevin webb, told the greenwich township, n.j., zoning board that the company expects to operate the dock 24 hours a day, with 50 to 70 permanent employees.\n\nnew fortress has already built one dock at gibbstown to handle mixed cargoes. the proposed second dock would be devoted to the transfer of lng or other refinery byproducts from freight cars or trucks to ships.\n\na wharf, with room for two deepwater ships at a time, would be built out in the river, parallel to the shore, connected to the land by a trestle pier. it would require dredging about 665,000 cubic yards of sediment over a 45-acre area.\n\nthe repauno plant site includes a diverse and significant amount of hazardous waste that dupont dumped into unlined landfills, sand tar pits, pipes and ditch basins, according to a suit against the former owner brought by state environmental officials. the land is contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls, or pcbs, among other wastes.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nopponents of the project argue that the dredging will release pcbs into the river, but the basin commission ruled that proper mitigation procedures should be sufficient to contain the pollutant. representatives from member states new jersey, delaware and pennsylvania voted in favor of the plan; the commissioner from new york, which has dealt with severe pcb pollution in the hudson river, abstained.\n\nin a letter to the commission, the natural resources defense council said that recent scientific evidence has shown that pcbs are far more toxic than scientists or environmental agencies realized even 15 years ago.\n\nunder the new fortress plan, the natural gas would be liquefied in pennsylvania, most likely at a plant in the town of wyalusing, in bradford county, about 35 miles northwest of scranton. the company has suggested that it would run two unit trains of up to 100 tank cars every day to the terminal; loading a ship to capacity would take about

guess who's in first place.\n\nthe capitals' 5-2 win over johansson and the devils on saturday night capped a 10-2-2 december that helped alex ovechkin and co. complete their climb to the top of the metropolitan division. washington (24-13-3) has lost only four times in regulation since suffering back-to-back losses by a combined 12-5 at nashville and colorado in mid-november and has the second-most points in the eastern conference entering tuesday's game at carolina.\n\nit's nice to be able to kind of fly under the radar, capitals center jay beagle said tuesday during an interview with the sports junkies on 106.7 the fan. the last couple years, there's been a lot of talk about us, and so a lot of pressure on, and so it was nice to kind of be able to go out and figure it out as a team because we knew we were going to have some new guys. i think for a lot of us coming back that have been here for a while, we knew that obviously the goal was to be where we're at right now, in first in the division and to keep building. it's been a fun season. it's been fun having new guys and building a new identity with a new group of guys. we're hot right now, like you guys said. we had a great december, and we just got to keep this going into january now.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbeagle said he never bought into the outside talk about the capitals potentially taking a step back or beginning the rebuilding process this season.\n\nwe have a great core here and a lot of great players, said beagle, who has four goals and seven assists. so, every year, we should be contenders to win the presidents' trophy and then go in the playoffs and be contenders to win the stanley cup. that's the way we look at it. that's our mind-set.\n\nwashington won its second consecutive presidents' trophy last season but bowed out of the playoffs in the second round for the third straight year. the capitals haven't advanced to the eastern conference final since their only stanley cup appearance in 1998. while the pressure will ramp up, as always, come april, beagle suggested that diminished outside expectations for the capitals at the start of the season were a blessing.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nno one puts more expectations and more pressure on ourselves than us, beagle said. no one else can put more pressure on yourself to perform than yourself. you want to win more than anyone. that's what's gotten you here, and that's what drives you. when you have that extra kind of pressure and that extra . . . just people always scrutinizing and looking at everything as a team and individually, i think it adds pressure that's necessarily not very good. it's nice this year to come in at the beginning of the year and just to be able to figure it out as a team and not have that expectation of coming out of the gates of being in first place and leading the league right away in points. this year, it's been a little different in that sense, and it's been good. it's allowed guys that are new to the team to figure out their role and allowed our team just to figure out our identity. it's been nice for a change.\n\nof course, the division standings at the start of the new year mean even less than the presidents' trophy. just ask the two-time defending stanley cup champion pittsburgh penguins, who are in seventh place in the metropolitan, and just one point out of the basement. two years ago at this time, washington had the best record in the eastern conference, and the penguins, who had fired coach mike johnston a few weeks earlier, were in fifth place in the division. pittsburgh turned things around under mike sullivan, its current coach, entered the playoffs as one of the nhl's hottest teams and eliminated the capitals in the second round.\n\nmaybe this year will be different. that would be nice for a change.\n\nad\n\nad
in a particularly stark sign, supporters of sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) have returned to bashing the democratic national committee, reviving grievances from the divisive 2016 primary race. in that campaign, sanders backers said that the system had been stacked against the democratic socialist — a view later affirmed when wikileaks released hacked internal emails — and supporters of nominee hillary clinton blamed sanders for failing to sufficiently rally his base on clinton's behalf in the general election.\n\nad\n\nad\n\na chaotic iowa caucus has left the democratic party scrambling for clarity in new hampshire. (the washington post)\n\nsanders's allies are again charging that the dnc is maneuvering to thwart his anti-establishment movement. they say the dnc's decision last week to call for a recanvass in iowa threatened to undercut sanders's ability to claim momentum from winning the popular vote there, while changing the rules to benefit bloomberg reflects the desire among the party elite for a savior to deny sanders the nomination.\n\nthey can shout unity all they want, but the actions show otherwise, said nina turner, a national co-chairman of the sanders campaign.\n\nthe brew of resentment and anxiety represents a sharp turn for a presidential primary race that began last year with a historically diverse field and intense optimism that democrats could harness the same energy that helped them win big in 2018.\n\nnow party unity is breaking down just as voters express rising concerns that none of the remaining candidates is fully equipped to take on an incumbent president who regularly scoffs at political norms of civility and accuracy.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nlike iowans, many of whom remained undecided until the last moment before the caucuses, about a third of new hampshire voters remain undecided, with sanders and former south bend, ind., mayor pete buttigieg appearing to have momentum before the tuesday primary. the longtime national polling leader, joe biden, who many democrats hoped would unify the party and pose the greatest threat to trump, posted a disappointing finish in iowa and has been sliding in new hampshire.\n\nthe party's internal strife now looms over the tuesday vote here as well as additional primaries set for the coming weeks.\n\nadvisers to the two men most responsible for overseeing the disastrous iowa caucuses, national chairman tom perez and iowa chairman troy price, have been privately deflecting blame onto each other, as the relationship between the two has become tense, advisers say. price has refused to join perez in calling for a recanvass of voting records in the state, after finding out about perez's demand from a deputy a few minutes before it was tweeted, people familiar with their communication said.\n\nprice allies blame perez for the botched caucus count, pointing to new party rules he implemented around transparency and accessibility that increased the burdens on the state. they also point to confusion over whether a cybersecurity team sent by perez fully reviewed the technology that failed on caucus night.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nultimately this is the national chairman's mess. he is the one who asked us to do it. we tried to do it. we got bushwhacked by a bad system, and now we are trying to clean up, said former congressman dave nagle, who planned the 2020 caucuses with price and now refers to perez with the nickname pontius pilate.\n\nin response, aides to perez, who was not in iowa for the caucuses, have maintained that the state party was ultimately responsible for administering the caucuses, choosing a technology vendor and making sure the technology worked. the dnc hired experts, they say, to review the cybersecurity of the technology but not the functionality of the software.\n\ni am not troy price's boss so it is not our role to micromanage every element of the administration of elections, perez said in an interview sunday, when asked about the dnc's responsibility for the iowa failures. every state party has its own process.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nperez did not appear in the spin room after friday's new hampshire debate, and he skipped a speaking slot saturday in manchester at a state party fundraiser because of a conflicting, and previously scheduled, appointment to meet with governors in washington, his aides say.\n\nfrom the moment he took the job as party chairman, perez has said he is more focused on beating trump than expanding my holiday card list. the party he inherited was a skeletal operation, gutted and demoralized after clinton's 2016 loss and the scandal sparked by leaked internal party emails, which the intelligence community has blamed on the russian government.\n\nperez moved quickly to remake the nominating process, forcing more regulation of states that host caucuses, investing heavily in technology security efforts and eliminating any chance of a decisive vote by party insiders on the first ballot at the nominating convention, a concession to sanders supporters who wanted the process to more directly reflect the popular vote.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nat the start of the campaign, sanders advisers repeatedly praised perez, encouraging party leaders who are wary of the enormous funding advantages of the republican national committee, which has raised $194 million in the current election cycle compared with $76 million by the dnc, according to the center for responsive politics.\n\nbut that tone shifted in recent weeks, as sanders surrogates, supporters and staff have criticized perez for changing the debate rules and for the appointees he has placed on the various convention committees.\n\nperez announced last month that he would allow candidates to make the debate stage in late february if they met either a polling threshold or won national party delegates in iowa or new hampshire. perez dropped a requirement that forced candidates to attract thousands of grass-roots donors, which bloomberg would not meet since he does not accept donations.\n\nad\n\nad\n\na former new york mayor, bloomberg gave more than $1.5 million to the national and state parties in the final months of last year, according to federal election records. he so far has collected only one of the four 10 percent polls he needs to qualify for the las vegas debate feb. 19.\n\nperez said the rule change was not made to benefit any single candidate.\n\nour job at every debate is to identify through the most relevant measures who are the most viable candidates who should be on the debate stage, he said when asked why he dropped the donor requirement. the polling is now more probative because people are paying attention.\n\nsanders has been blunt in his condemnation of the move.\n\nad\n\ni think it is an outrage, he told reporters thursday. i guess if you're worth $55 billion, you can get the rules changed.\n\nad\n\none top sanders aide warned that the rule change could hurt party enthusiasm.\n\nthe question is, are working people going to turn against the democratic party because there is a billionaire who is himself able to get on the debate stage because he got special treatment? sanders senior adviser jeff weaver said.\n\nbiden also has joined in the criticism of perez for changing the debate qualification rules in a way that could allow bloomberg onto the stage.\n\nthe rules seem to be changing a little bit, he said at a saturday campaign stop, noting that other candidates had tried to change them. if i'm julián castro or i'm a couple other guys — they didn't change the rules to allow me to stay on the debate stage. but now the rules get change to put someone else on the debate stage?\n\nad\n\nother democratic insiders have tried to paint the sanders complaints as politically expedient. along with other candidates, they say, the sanders campaign supported a change to the debate rules in december that would have allowed candidates to qualify with either polling or donors, as part of an effort to allow sen. cory booker (d-n.j.) to join the jan. 14 debate. that change, which perez did not accept, would also have cleared the path for bloomberg.\n\nad\n\nthe sanders campaign was also alarmed when perez decided last month to name his allotted appointments to the standing committees for the party's national nominating convention, set for this summer in milwaukee. previous party chairmen have made similar appointments, which make up a minority of the full committee membership.\n\nthe deck is stacked against fairness, turner said of the committee appointments. and not only stacked against senator sanders, but it's stacked against any candidate who is not entrenched in the elite section of the democratic party. and the sad thing about it is chairman perez knows this.\n\nweaver has tried to strike a less aggressive tone, saying that the sanders campaign still believes perez has tried to be evenhanded. of course, given our experience, we are ever vigilant, he said.\n\nseveral national committee members were upset earlier this year when word spread that the budget committee had approved transition payments equal to four months' salary for perez and his top deputies. the funds were intended to assure that perez and his deputies had time to work with their successor in 2021, or this year if the party nominee calls for new leadership before the election.\n\nthis is not a tom thing. this is a business thing, said dan halpern, budget committee chairman. this is an effort to make sure that the dnc is a going concern.\n\nperez and his team quickly distanced themselves from the effort.\n\none hundred percent of our resources are going toward beating donald trump, said xochitl hinojosa, dnc communications director. dnc leadership will not accept any extra compensation recommended by the budget committee, which didn't operate at the direction of dnc leadership.\n\nthe next logistical test for perez will come feb. 22, when nevada democrats hold the second major caucus of the process. the state party has scrapped plans to use a similar app to the one that performed so poorly in iowa, but a computer system is still expected to be employed to collate early voting results. as in iowa, the nevada state party has primary responsibility over the process, perez said.\n\nour goal is we want to make sure that we have a caucus that is as low tech as humanly possible while still being efficient, perez said. we are working with them and we are coordinating with them.\n\nsanders, meanwhile, has put a bit more of an anti-establishment edge on his speeches this weekend, perhaps aimed at the independent voters who can participate in the new hampshire primary, many of whom are skeptical of democratic party leadership and other institutions.\n\nwe're taking on not just the whole republican political establishment, sanders said, we're taking on the democratic establishment. when sanders said the democratic establishment was getting nervous, the applause was louder.\n\nvoters have increasingly brought up complaints about the national party on the campaign trail, especially at sanders events. after the iowa caucuses, jared saunders, 43, drove from massachusetts to derry, n.h., where he raised his anxieties with sanders directly during a town hall meeting about the recent appointment of standing committee members.\n\nsanders encouraged supporters to channel their nervous energy into voting for him.\n\nwhat we can do right now is make sure we have the largest voter turnout in the history of new hampshire, he said, drawing applause from the crowd. the truth is that the nominee will have enormous power over those committees, okay?\n\nthe candidate's response did not quell saunders's concerns.\n\nthe dnc rigged it in 2016 and it's doing it again, he said after the event.
though this diplomatic disagreement has been widely covered, there has been much less discussion of the israeli public's sentiments. where does the jewish-israeli population stand on the issues raised by the security council resolution? do israeli jews view the territories in question — which in israeli discourse are commonly known as judea and samaria, their biblical titles — as palestinian territories or as part of israel? do they view jewish settlements on these territories as residing on occupied territory? or are they viewed as part of israel?\n\na recent public opinion survey provides important insights on prevailing mindsets among this population. the survey was carried out between oct. 28 and nov. 3 and included 1,027 respondents over the age of 18, a representative sample of the jewish-israeli adult population. the sampling error is plus or minus 3.1 percent.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nparticipants were asked if — to the extent of their knowledge — israel has formally declared its sovereignty over judea and samaria. even though israel has never formally extended its sovereignty and prominent right-wing politicians are increasingly demanding israel annex at least part of these territories, only about half of israeli jews surveyed replied correctly. the rest are almost evenly divided between those who erroneously think that israel already annexed these territories and those who do not know.\n\nstrikingly, among those who knew that israel has not declared sovereignty over judea and samaria, practically half answered yes when asked whether israel should formally declare its sovereignty over these territories. in other words, taken together, about half of the jewish-israeli respondents believe that israel either has already formally declared its sovereignty over judea and samaria or should do so.\n\ninterviewees were further asked if certain settlements built on lands captured in the 1967 war are within the territory of the state of israel. the set included eight relatively long-existing settlements, most of which were established in the 1970s. the settlements included a diverse mixture of sizes, demographics and locations, including some in outlying regions and others closer to the pre-1967 war boundaries.\n\na majority of israeli jews thought that several of the settlements were within the territory of the state of israel, and a plurality perceived others as such. however, none received an absolute majority of outside the territory of the state of israel responses.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe small sample size of settlements restricts confident inferences about why some settlements are more likely to be perceived as within the territory of the state of israel. size and type of locality might be important: ma'ale adomim, ariel and kiryat arba are all urban localities with larger populations than the other settlements in the sample, although beit el is considerably larger than kfar etzion. proximity to the green line — the boundaries of the pre-1967 war — does not seem to be significant. ariel and kiryat arba are much deeper on the east side of the green line than ma'ale shomron and kfar etzion.\n\nfamiliarity, on the other hand, likely does matter. ma'ale adomim, ariel and kiryat arba are names israeli jews are likely to hear in their daily lives, even if just in passing. all three have theaters for the performing arts and soccer clubs. ariel has a university, and tv channels regularly provide its weather forecasts.\n\nto be sure, the picture is not one dimensional. when asked about support for a two-state solution, considerably more respondents express support than opposition to it, a finding consistent with many other surveys.\n\nhowever, when breaking down the population according to age group, more complex trends are revealed. in the case of the questions about israel declaring sovereignty over judea and samaria, the critical tipping age is 50. a majority of those 50 and over responded substantively differently than younger respondents, the largest difference between categories.\n\npredictably, post-graduate education, political position and religiosity also matter. those with a post-graduate degree tend to be more informed. religious and traditional jews are more likely than secular ones to perceive ariel to be inside the territory of the state of israel. nonetheless, when holding these constant, age proves to be the most consequential explanatory factor.\n\nthe significance of the age of 50 is not incidental. the year 2017 will mark the 50th anniversary of the 1967 war in which israel conquered the contested territories from jordan. according to the findings in this research, those born before 1967 are more likely to remember israel's pre-1967 boundaries. they know that israel has not formally declared its sovereignty on judea and samaria. they view settlements to be outside the state of israel's territory. this is especially true for those who were at least 10 years old in 1967. for that generation, the green line is tangible.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin contrast, for those born after 1967, the boundaries of the pre-1967 war are not palpable. karl mannheim wrote in his famous the problem of generations that the specific range of experiences individuals in shared age groups undergo predisposes them to certain mindsets and perspectives. in the israeli case, those born after 1967 never experienced the green line — they regularly see ariel on the weather forecast, they drive by ma'ale adomim on route to the dead sea and they went on school trips to parts of the judean desert on the east side of the green line.\n\nthe daily life experiences of post-1967 jewish israeli generations contrast sharply with what they read and hear from the security council and secretary kerry's speech.\n\ngenerational mindsets are not immutable — whatever the issue at hand. at the same time, it may be worthwhile acknowledging that the issue of israeli settlements is not just an issue of demographic change. rather, settlements' contribution to the erosion of the pre-1967 green line in the mind-set of the younger generation of israeli jews may prove to be the more formidable challenge.\n\nad
the mind-boggling snowfall is linked to a pair of record-breaking weather systems that induced a prolonged period of westerly to northwesterly winds, the ideal wind fetch needed to yield the factory-like production and dumping of heavy snow.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmountainous areas of japan are bracing for yet another dump of heavy snow over the next five days.\n\nthe second extreme snowfall in two weeks' time\n\njapanese news agency nhk reported that okura village in yamagata prefecture, a mountain community a little more than 200 miles north of tokyo, had received 85 inches of snow by late friday. the seven feet of snow matched what came down the week of dec. 18 just to the south in the community of fujiwara.\n\nthat snowstorm stranded more than a thousand motorists on the kan-etsu expressway for more than 24 hours, with drivers forced to melt snow for drinking water during the overnight debacle.\n\nwhile snowfall around new year's day wasn't quite as disastrous, it did pile up to staggering totals. some locales hit hard included uonuma city, 50 miles south of niigata, as well as yokote city in northern japan. those places saw 62 and 60 inches respectively by friday morning.\n\nextreme accumulations snarl travel\n\nnhk reported that at least 140 domestic flights were canceled leading up to the storm, with bullet train service suspended on the yamagata line. that line navigates snow-prone regions near and west of the ou mountains in the tohoku region of honshu.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nadditional 24-hour snowfall of up to 30 inches was forecast saturday in niigata prefecture, with slightly lesser amounts closer to the coast in northwest japan. snowfall rates exceeded three inches per hour at times.\n\na perfect recipe for ocean-effect snow\n\nthe higher elevations of japan, particularly along the japanese alps and echigo mountains, are among the snowiest regions of the world. japan is situated in a perfect zone for ocean-effect snowfall, with frigid northwesterly winds blowing across the lukewarm waters of the sea of japan. that adds moisture to the air, which is then forced up the mountains and deposited in the form of heavy accumulating snowfall.\n\nthat sea-to-atmosphere temperature contrast is bolstered even more by the kuroshio current, akin to the gulf stream; a branch of it called the tsushima current is responsible for warming the sea of japan. it can routinely remain in the 50s to near 60 degrees at this time of year.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmeanwhile, a morning low of minus-27 degrees was set in horokanai in hokkaido on new year's eve, while neighboring shumarinai and both fell to minus-25. each reading snagged a record low for the month of december.\n\nthe wintry weather wasn't relegated to only northern japan; southern japan set a number of 24-hour december snowfall records, with 31 inches in kaminagata.\n\nhow japan was sandwiched between two record-breaking weather systems\n\nthe impressive bout of snowfall is tied to a pair of extreme weather systems that flanked the japanese archipelago both to the west and east last week. an exceptionally cold air mass associated with arctic high pressure parked over mongolia, while a historically strong low-pressure system brought stormy weather and dangerous conditions to mariners in the northern pacific.\n\nthe high-pressure system may have set a world record with the highest air pressure ever reliably recorded; a station in tsetsen-uul, mongolia recorded a sea-level equivalent air pressure of 32.31 inches last tuesday morning. typical sea level air pressure averages closer to 30.00 inches. the extreme high-pressure ridge was accompanied by temperatures near minus-50.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmeanwhile, low pressure to the east near the aleutian chain became the deepest nontropical low pressure system ever observed in the north pacific, with an air pressure of 27.20 inches. it stirred up 110 mph wind gusts over the open ocean and set a new state air pressure record in alaska.\n\nbecause air flows from high pressure to low pressure, the steep pressure gradient, or change with distance, spurred strong westerly winds that proved instrumental to ocean-effect snow production in the sea of japan.\n\nin the meantime, record high and low-pressure systems aren't anticipated in the upcoming week, but more snow is on the way as cold winds once again roar over the sea of japan.\n\nanother 40 to 60 inches is likely for some in central and northern japan in the next five days as a strong area of low pressure develops over the sea of japan tuesday into wednesday.

i respect the office that he holds and the agencies of government that he appoints to — i think i respect them more than he does, looking at who he has appointed to those offices, she told the washington post in an interview as she prepared to take the speaker's gavel.\n\nad\n\nnavigating that dilemma has affected the limited talks to end the partial government shutdown, now in its second week, over the president's demand for money for a u.s.-mexico border wall, and it is certain to define pelosi's dealings with trump in the new era of divided government.\n\nad\n\nit is an unpredictable chapter in the historic career of the 78-year-old pelosi, the nation's first female speaker, as she retakes the gavel after eight years.\n\nwhen she entered the oval office on dec. 11 for a meeting with trump and senate minority leader charles e. schumer (d-n.y.), she had a phrase in mind that she planned to use in private — trump shutdown.\n\nshe did not realize she would deliver that line in front of television cameras. the world watched as the president interrupted her after she uttered those words at the outset of a wild 15-minute exchange: did you say 'trump' ?\n\nad\n\nmoments later, pelosi urged him to kick out the media and proceed with private talks more befitting, in her view, the stakes and the setting.\n\nwhat i saw in that oval office circus was someone struggling really to try and respect the institution of the president while having total disdain for the man himself, said jim manley, who was a top aide to then-senate majority leader harry m. reid (d-nev.), who served alongside pelosi. she's smart enough to know that she can't go into the gutter, but you know she's going to find ways to tweak the guy.\n\nad\n\nthe needling, aided by schumer, paid political dividends after trump proclaimed at the end of the meeting that he was proud to shut down the government for border security — words that have been shown on a seemingly endless loop as the president deals with the damage.\n\nad\n\nshortly after leaving the meeting, pelosi told a private gathering of fellow democrats that the wall was a like a manhood thing for trump, a comment seemingly calibrated to unnerve the president — and promptly and widely leaked to the media.\n\ntrump, for his part, has needled pelosi while expressing respect for her.\n\ni like her. can you believe it? i like nancy pelosi. i mean, she's tough and she's smart, he said after the midterm elections, when democrats recaptured the house with a 40-seat gain. later, he offered to solicit republican votes when she was struggling to persuade democrats to elect her speaker.\n\npelosi said of trump in the interview: we have to stipulate to a set of facts if we're going to ever negotiate. but he simply won't do it. what he talks about with the wall isn't true. it isn't true about terrorists coming over the wall, people with illnesses flooding the country. i mean, really?\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbeyond the factual divide, pelosi says she sees in trump a lack of shared values about our country and belief in governance, as well as a disrespect for the dignity and worth of a person.\n\nyet she still speaks routinely — if somewhat mechanically — about her desire to work in tandem with trump on issues of mutual interest, that she would seek to light the way and extend the hand of friendship.\n\nwe're about dignity and a tone that is respectful of the offices that we hold, and the office he holds, she added. we're not stooping to his level, no.\n\npelosi can have difficulty masking her disdain. often that is by implication — speaking effusively about george w. bush's personal character or quoting from ronald reagan's 1989 farewell address, in which he said the nation should be open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nother times, she is more explicit. at one point in the interview, pelosi picked at a political scab of trump's, noting he was elected — not by a majority of the popular vote — but nonetheless to be president of the united states. at another, she said her dealings with trump have been largely respectful, except for saying i can't speak for myself, a reference to trump bringing up in the oval office her difficulty corralling speaker votes. she secured the necessary votes a day later.\n\npelosi denied trying to openly needle trump by calling the wall a matter of manhood — something she did publicly in an october appearance at harvard university before she repeated it privately to democrats last month.\n\ni don't think he has any concern about that. he likes publicity, good or bad, doesn't he? she said, adding, it's a guy thing — maybe i should say it that way. maybe it's a guy thing.\n\nad\n\nad\n\npelosi returned to the white house on wednesday — behind closed doors and joined by a broader cast of congressional leaders, a setting several democratic aides cast as a white house effort to avoid a repeat of the earlier fiasco. rather than with words, this time she made her point with her power.\n\nshe declared house democrats would vote thursday to reopen the government without funding the wall — on republican-written legislation, a move orchestrated to isolate trump and split the gop around him. we're asking the president to open up government, pelosi said. we are giving him a republican path to do that. why would he not do it?\n\nfriends, family and foes, even those within her party who pressed for her to step aside for the next generation, praise her political skills.\n\nad\n\nshe'll cut your head off, and you won't even know you're bleeding, pelosi's daughter alexandra said wednesday on cnn.\n\nad\n\npressed on the advice she's gotten on dealing with trump, pelosi insisted she makes her own advice — a point she made by paraphrasing a passage from a 57-year-old papal encyclical.\n\ni observe, judge, act — i learned that from the pope, she said. observe. judge. act.\n\ndespite pelosi's image as a liberal partisan, an image driven relentlessly by gop campaign ads, she has a long history working productively with republicans — first as a junior lawmaker serving on bipartisan house appropriations and intelligence committees, later during her first two years as speaker, dealing with bush.\n\nad\n\nlike trump, bush at the time had weak approval ratings and inspired deep enmity in the democratic base — to the point that some lawmakers floated impeaching him. and while pelosi was personally against the iraq war and campaigned against it to win the majority, she was never heard to speak askance of bush's manhood or any other aspect of his character.\n\nad\n\nbush signed several major laws passed by democrats, led by pelosi and reid, including energy, tax and foreign-aid bills, and in the final months of his presidency, the leaders worked closely together to address an epochal financial crisis.\n\npresident bush was very committed to continuing what had been started [in iraq] and to see it through, and so they clashed on that, said daniel p. meyer, who served as bush's legislative affairs director during pelosi's speakership. but it was a professional relationship. i don't think there was personal animus in any way, shape or form.\n\nher initial interactions with trump, meyer said, portend a different relationship: he's not going to hold back, and that reflects his style. and she, apparently, is going to respond somewhat in kind.\n\npelosi still speaks fondly of bush and his late father, whose photograph she keeps in her capitol hill office alongside those of presidents john f. kennedy and barack obama. and she rejects entirely any comparison between her dealings with bush and with trump.\n\nad\n\nhe was a republican, i'm a democrat, she said of bush. we differed on a woman's right to choose, the war in iraq, those kinds of things. but in our negotiations we recognized certain facts.\n\ntrump's allies in the white house and on capitol hill are fond of pointing out — and potentially exploiting — the difficulties pelosi will probably have managing her caucus's aggressive left flank. rep.-elect alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.), for instance, tweeted criticism of democratic leaders monday over the makeup of a special climate-change committee and wednesday announced she would vote against rules changes backed by pelosi.\n\nbut pelosi has more experience managing those dynamics than they might realize. former congresswoman lynn woolsey (d-calif.), a leader of the democratic antiwar bloc, said pelosi skillfully managed that aggressive faction while she was sparring with bush over iraq.\n\nnancy did not lead it, but she never got in our way, she said. in one instance, pelosi rejected the idea of woolsey and others inviting tom hayden, a controversial former student radical, to capitol hill.\n\nwoolsey said pelosi was right, as hayden's presence would have been the story instead of what we were really aiming to accomplish.
beneath the portraits of male speakers past, history seemed to be changing.\n\ndozens of newly elected women queued to receive their member pins. husbands affixed those pins to their wives' lapels. they held tote bags, corralled relatives and quieted children.\n\nthe day served as a powerful reminder of the shifting gender dynamics of the house as democrats ascend to power. when pelosi arrived on capitol hill in 1987, there were 23 female members. as of thursday, there are 102, nearly 90 percent of whom are democrats.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nit's been a work in progress, said freshman rep. ilhan omar (d-minn.), escorting her family through the halls of the capitol. i look forward to ushering in further progress so that my daughters and their daughters don't have to have these conversations about what this moment means because it would just become really normal.\n\nmore women were elected in this year's election than any point in u.s. history. but how close is congress to parity? (jenny starrs/the washington post)\n\npelosi underscored these hopes in her opening speech to the house as speaker, noting that her election comes amid the 100th anniversary of women's suffrage.\n\nlater, she invited the children present in the chamber to join her on the dais.\n\nlet us pray that god may bless our work, and crown our good with brotherhood — and sisterhood — from sea to shining sea, she said.\n\nad\n\nwomen brought the allure of political celebrity to a day of celebration for democrats.\n\nnew rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.) was mobbed by supporters as she and her aides sought to make their way through throngs of people outside of pelosi's office.\n\nad\n\nan anonymous twitter account affiliated with the far-right had tried to spoil her week by posting a video of ocasio-cortez dancing on a rooftop during college, a move that seemed only to strengthen her support online.\n\nin another made-for-twitter moment, republicans audibly groaned when ocasio-cortez cast her vote for pelosi for speaker. sorry, she mouthed with a smile.\n\nfreshman rep. mike levin (d-calif.) said he was inspired by his new female colleagues.\n\nad\n\ni hope it's the beginning of a trend, where we're going to have gender equity hopefully in the workplace, but also here in our workplace, said levin, wearing a madam speaker pin. i have a daughter here and a son here, so i hope that they each have the same opportunity if they choose to do this someday, where gender is not an issue.\n\nyet throughout the day, the reality of the political moment threatened to intrude on the festivities.\n\nad\n\nmuch of the government remained closed thursday, the product of an impasse between president trump and democratic leaders. trump congratulated pelosi for her tremendous achievement of again becoming speaker but suggested he would remain firm in demanding funds for a border wall.\n\nad\n\nthere is certainly a somber note as we think about the 800,000 people who are living in economic uncertainty because of a president who won't grow up and reopen the government because of a vanity wall, said rep. pramila jayapal (d-wash.), co-chair of the ascendant congressional progressive caucus, as she reflected on the day.\n\nthe shutdown appeared to unite democratic factions and, at least for a day, tamped down talk of their differences.\n\nwomen lawmakers vowed to find a way forward.\n\ni think right now in our country, we're in a real crisis, omar said. i look forward to the women of congress and the female speaker all bonding together to bring about real change to reopen our government and to restore hope.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe difference between the democratic and republican caucuses was striking as members assembled midday on the house floor.\n\nto the left of the dais — the democratic side — the typical sea of men's suit jackets was balanced by pops of green, blue and white worn by women. bald heads alternated with bobbed haircuts. scanning the rows, the record number of women and lawmakers of hispanic, asian and african american heritage who will serve this term was clear.\n\nto the right of the dais — the republican side — older white men occupied nearly every seat. visually, granddaughters provided most of the contrast.\n\nfreshman rep. madeleine dean (d-pa.) compared the scene to an old movie. a former state legislator, she enters congress as one of four women representing pennsylvania. last term, there were none.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nit means a lot, dean said of the new women in the house. i'm optimistic because i believe that what that kind of diversity will bring is problem-solving.\n\nthe women's bathroom off the house floor became a natural gathering place as incoming lawmakers and their families sought to navigate the events of the day.\n\nonce the house parliamentarian's office, the facility opened when there were only 76 women in the lower chamber. to access it from the floor, women must walk beneath the portraits of five men dating as far back as 1843.\n\ngathering outside, a group of women expressed the mood by channeling singer nina simone.
i remember spending many winter nights as a child sobbing under my scavenged blanket because i was hungry and freezing because our wood stove had gone cold.\n\ni started working at 12 with my parents' enthusiastic encouragement and almost every penny went toward groceries. i'm the oldest and they drilled in that it was my responsibility.\n\nad\n\ni worked all through high school, worked two jobs to put myself through college, and got a professional job that paid all my bills and some to spare. thirty years later, i'm married, and our house and cars are paid off. though we're far from rich, we have everything we need.\n\nad\n\nnow in their 70s, my parents have nothing. the shack i was raised in was condemned and my husband and i put them up in an apartment rather than see them homeless.\n\nthey constantly ask for money for necessities, then spend it on (what i consider) really stupid purchases. (my mother still thinks her massive collection of beanie babies will be worth millions someday.)\n\ni'm bitter and resentful. two of my siblings married rich. the others followed in our parents' footsteps and live hand to mouth.\n\nad\n\nif we cut my parents off, they'll have no place to go. my conscience can't take it.\n\nif we continue as we are, our own retirement is at risk.\n\nmy husband has always supported my overdeveloped sense of responsibility, but i know he's frustrated and a little angry, too. what do we do?\n\nnot a retirement fund\n\nad\n\nnot a retirement fund: i understand your conflicted feelings about your parents, who didn't provide adequately for their children, but are now basically shameless (you feel) in terms of their expectations.\n\nyou need to wean your parents away from being your sole responsibility. your local office on aging should be a great resource for information on services available for low-income seniors. your folks will likely qualify for subsidized housing, snap (food stamps), heating assistance and other programs designed to keep them safe.\n\nad\n\nyou should decide on an amount you are able/willing to spend on them each month, and — that's it. if you provide adequately and they have subsidized supplemental programs and yet still want more, you can send them in good conscience to one of their other children.\n\nyou survived your very tough upbringing, and your grit is commendable — although it is tinged with anger.\n\nad\n\nyour next heavy lift will be to work your way toward forgiveness. forgiving them will liberate you.\n\ndear amy: forty years ago, we lost a child — and while i don't dwell on that with people, when i'm asked how many children i have, i don't know what to say.\n\nfor years, i wanted to say, well i have two living children, but i also lost a child.\n\nad\n\nit never seemed appropriate to bring that up.\n\nthere needs to be a word to use for parents who have lost children. if i lost my husband i'm a widow, and if you and your husband divorce you are a divorcée, but there's no word to describe a parent who has lost a child.\n\nany suggestions?\n\nwondering\n\nwondering: wow, you're right. there is no one word to describe a parent's status after the death of a child.\n\ni understand the impulse to dodge this awkwardness. but i also think that if you are able, you could respond to the question: how many children do you have? by saying, we had three children, but our daughter, 'charlotte,' died many years ago.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nsay your child's name.\n\ndear amy: i couldn't believe your sexist, one-sided response to the so-called caring husband, who reported that his wife continues to report that he does not listen to her.\n\namy, i don't know what is wrong with you. this guy is being patently disrespectful to his wife, and you totally let him off the hook.\n\ndisappointed\n\ndisappointed: caring husband reported that he is in a loving relationship with his wife. he was seeking to address this ongoing issue between them. and i offered him support for trying to change, as well as a common-sense solution (having regular family meetings, where he makes it a point to listen with intention).
mexico has ratified the deal, and canada is expected to formally approve it soon.\n\ntrump was able to win congressional passage of the deal because of substantive changes he made to get support from democrats and labor unions. but no democratic lawmakers were present at the signing ceremony.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ntwo people familiar with talks said that u.s. trade representative robert e. lighthizer had told lawmakers he wanted to include democrats at the event but that his efforts to do so were unsuccessful. the people spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private conversations.\n\njeffrey emerson, a spokesman for lighthizer, said it was totally false to claim lighthizer wanted democrats at the event, adding: ambassador lighthizer is enormously pleased with the signing ceremony. the media is simply trying to distract from this huge success.\n\nat the ceremony wednesday, trump hailed the momentous, historic and joyous occasion and said the deal would prevent outsourcing and keep jobs in the united states. vice president pence and senior adviser jared kushner, the president's son-in-law, were among those in attendance. dozens of republican lawmakers also attended.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ntrump called the original nafta a catastrophe and said revamping the deal was the reason he ran for president and abandoned the beautiful, simple life of luxury i lived as a private businessman and celebrity.\n\nthis is a cutting edge, state-of-the-art agreement that protects and defends the people of our country, trump said.\n\ntrump also said the usmca would increase the u.s. gross domestic product by 1.2 percent. that number is significantly higher than most mainstream estimates, including a u.s. international trade commission report in april that found the usmca would expand the economy by 0.35 percent once it is fully implemented in six years. trump's senior advisers have also given a more measured assessment of the eventual impact of the deal.\n\nad\n\nbipartisan majorities in congress approved the trade deal by wide margins, with the package sailing through the senate, 89 to 10. democrats touted changes they helped secure in the pact to beef up its labor and environmental protections in months of talks with lighthizer.\n\nthis is a celebration of what democrats were able to secure, rep. rosa l. delauro (d-conn.), a longtime free-trade skeptic who endorsed the deal, said in a media call wednesday. we secured positive changes on environmental standards, labor standards and access to medicine.\n\nad\n\nit is unclear whether the trade deal will reverse decades of damage to the u.s. industrial sector. u.s. factory payrolls dropped by close to 6 million after nafta took effect in 1994 and china entered the world trade organization in 2001. the usmca is likely to add only 50,000 of these jobs, the international trade commission has found.\n\nad\n\nthe agreement also scrapped nafta's investor-state dispute settlement system, which gave corporations extensive authority to sue foreign governments, said lori wallach, a trade expert at public citizen, a left-leaning advocacy organization. that's a dramatic change, wallach said.\n\nthe revised north american trade pact was signed just weeks after trump signed a partial trade deal with china, and white house officials have said the hardball tactics the president has used to extract changes from u.s. trade partners have proved effective.\n\nad\n\nthe usmca was supported by the afl-cio, one of the largest unions in the country, as well as leading business groups such as the u.s. chamber of commerce and business roundtable. other union groups, such as the international association of machinists and aerospace workers, opposed it. the united food and commercial workers international union also criticized the agreement for not including country-of-origin labeling intended to ensure food safety and prevent foreign companies from skirting food production standards.\n\nad\n\nmany of the nation's leading environmental organizations, including the sierra club and the league of conservation voters, also blasted the agreement as failing to address climate change and helping corporate polluters.\n\nthe vast majority of the democratic caucus, as well as most of the leading democratic presidential candidates, backed the effort. sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.), who is seeking the democratic presidential nomination, voted against the package, citing the opposition of environmental groups and the machinists union.\n\nerica werner contributed to this report.
georgetown survived its early ineptitude to build a 16-point halftime lead, but marquette erased that deficit and then some in a lopsided second half to claim a 64-60 victory and hand the hoyas their third straight loss. the hoyas (3-6, 1-4 big east) have lost four straight matchups against the golden eagles (6-5, 2-3).\n\nbad shots and bad decisions. turnovers, georgetown coach patrick ewing said. we did a great job in the first half of playing great defense. in the second half, we got selfish and started turning it over. . . . we've just got to do better, especially down the stretch. we started the game with five or six turnovers. we ended the game with five or six turnovers. we've just got to make better decisions.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmarquette dominated the second half, and a jamal cain three-pointer with 15 seconds remaining extended the golden eagles' lead to 64-60. the hoyas had possession trailing 61-60, but carey lost control of the ball and a scramble resulted in a held ball. marquette had the possession arrow, and cain cemented the win from the outside.\n\nhe finished with a career-high 25 points, including 20 in the second half. dawson garcia added nine points and 13 rebounds.\n\njamal was great, and that's exactly what you'd want your senior to do, marquette coach steve wojciechowski said. everybody's going to point to the big three he hit, and that was huge, but he was terrific throughout. when you're struggling, when you're against the ropes like we were, you need your veterans to step up, and jamal certainly did that.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwe didn't dwell on things, cain said. we know basketball is two halves, and we didn't play to our full potential in the first half; so we knew we had to bring it for another 20 minutes.\n\njahvon blair led georgetown with 20 points despite being benched to start the game. it was the first time he did not start this season. the senior guard, the hoyas' top scorer, entered the game with 17:40 remaining in the first half — after those four straight turnovers. ewing declined to specify why blair did not start, saying he didn't want to talk about it. when he got into the game, blair provided a calming presence and scored six points during a 14-0 run that gave the hoyas an 18-9 lead.\n\nfreshman kobe clark started in blair's place. the hoyas are still without graduate transfer jalen harris, who left the team to attend to family matters after starting the season's first five games.\n\nsophomore center qudus wahab finished with 13 points, 10 rebounds and three blocks for georgetown, and freshman forward jamari sibley added a ­career-high seven points.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmarquette entered the game first in big east play in field goal percentage and three-point percentage, but after a 4-for-8 start, that strong shooting was nowhere to be seen; the golden eagles went six minutes without scoring. after taking a 9-4 lead, marquette closed the first half shooting 4 for 23 from the field. it also was 2 for 11 from behind the arc in the half.\n\nthe strong defensive effort was a nice change of pace for the hoyas, who had ranked ninth in conference play in scoring defense and eighth in three-point defense.\n\nwe did not get off to the start we wanted to, and a lot of that is a result of how well georgetown was playing, wojciechowski said. but our kids showed a great resolve to stay with it and to find ways to win. not sure it was anything i said [at halftime]. it was more of them deciding that we needed to step it up, and i give them full and complete credit for answering the call.\n\nad\n\nad\n\npowered by cain, the golden eagles used a 22-4 run to take a 59-56 lead. the hoyas shot just 9 for 30 and managed only 24 points in the second half. they finished with 17 turnovers, an area that has frustrated ewing all season.\n\neveryone has to take it upon themselves to make the right decisions, he said.  . . . look at the score. we lost by four points. it was a one-point game, nip and tuck, with about a minute to go. then we turned the ball over.\n\ngeorgetown visits butler (2-5, 1-3) at 7 p.m. wednesday.
dear amy: my brother and his wife are expecting a third child.\n\nmy sister-in-law is pushing to have the baby use her last name because her side of the family doesn't have any boys to carry on the name.\n\nthis has caused a huge rift in our family. my older parents are heartbroken.\n\ni would like to know, is it an accepted social practice to have different last names within the same family? would not having the same last name as siblings cause any negative emotional impact to this third child?\n\nwhat would be a compromise in this situation? i am thinking of suggesting a hyphenated name (her last name, his last name). what do you think?\n\nthank you for your wise advice.\n\nconcerned sister\n\nconcerned sister: my first piece of advice is for all of you to remember that this baby has two parents who are making decisions regarding their children. this is their issue (not yours), and the best thing you could do is to urge your brother and his wife to deal with your parents.\n\nyou could influence your parents by encouraging them to accept this family's choice with equanimity.\n\nmany families sport various last names within the family unit. (in my family of five daughters, there are four surnames.) rarely, families choose to divide the spouses' surnames between children; and this can cause paperwork hassles and some issues when traveling as a family, but you should assume that your brother and his wife are anticipating this.\n\nhyphenating one child's name when the other children don't have a hyphenated last name seems more cumbersome than giving the child the mother's surname — nor would it cut down on the questions or explanations as the child moves through life.\n\nchildren can adjust to this quite easily: two of us have our dad's last name and our baby sister has mom's last name, is all the explanation they need to give.\n\ndear amy: my husband and i are having marital problems. he's abusive, controlling and has cheated on me at least five times. he takes any money i get and doesn't cook or help with our daughter. he is an alcoholic.\n\ni want things to work out, but he doesn't make any effort. i love him so much. i don't want to lose him. he is the love of my life. i've been with him since i was 17, and i'm going to be 21 at the end of the month.\n\ni don't know whether to try to save my marriage, because he hasn't changed. he keeps saying he will, but doesn't. i'm a stay-at-home mom. i don't know what i'd do without him. he doesn't want to go to marriage counseling because he says it doesn't work.\n\ni'd be devastated if we fell apart. he isn't only my husband but my best friend and my other half, all wrapped up in one. i don't think he understands that.\n\nwhat do i do?\n\nsad wife\n\nsad wife: it is a shame that you love your husband more than you seem to love yourself, or value your daughter's future. because raising a child in a household with abuse, drinking and cheating will teach her that this is okay. if she thinks that this is okay, then she might choose this for herself, some day. i hope you want a better life for her.\n\nyou describe your husband as your best friend. but is this how friends treat one another? no.\n\nyou are young. you are still maturing into your own adulthood. the journey toward your own healthier future will start with you learning how to love and value your own life. i hope you have people in your corner who will help you to see your strengths.\n\nyou should assume that your husband will not change. you are capable of change, however, and you need to. change starts with one step, and counseling (for yourself) could help you to take that first step.\n\ndear amy: waiting described her relationship of 10 years. she said she was 28 and her boyfriend, 26. you said, you have been in this relationship for almost half your life. why didn't you point out that this duration was almost half of his life?\n\ndo the math, lady.\n\nuninspired\n\nuninspired: he didn't write to me. she did. but i also realize that i didn't describe the math correctly (nor did you). i should have referred to this as almost a third of her life.
through tonight: conditions remain largely tranquil through the evening. clouds thicken and move lower heading into the overnight period, and organized showers could break out as soon as the midnight period — maybe a random sprinkle before that. odds of rain and a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain increase as we near dawn. for now, nothing looks terribly heavy through sunrise, and the precipitation may largely focus south of the below-freezing air. that below-freezing air looks to mainly be north of the city overnight, although it'll be close. temperatures ultimately fall to the low and mid-30s.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nview the current weather at the washington post.\n\ntomorrow (saturday): we wake up to much colder conditions and the risk of rain showers or wintry mix. overall, it looks like anything that falls is rather light and periodic, although some briefly heavier stuff is possible. this is mainly sleet and freezing rain north of the city, and rain or sleet to the south. there's not a whole lot of change in temperatures from the overnight. they may keep dropping slightly into the early morning before generally rebounding to the mid-30s or so. with the region right on the edge of freezing, a few degrees one way or another can make a big difference. do use extra caution while out and about, as untreated roads — particularly north of the city — could be icy. any ice is too much ice for safe driving.\n\nsunday: the last of the wintry weather risk that moves in saturday morning should end overnight and into early sunday. anything overnight is light and spotty as temperatures fall to near freezing. sunday after sunrise should tend to be dry. i think we also see some sunshine by midday and into the afternoon as highs head for the mid-40s most spots.\n\nmartin luther king jr. day (monday): the end of another long weekend for many of us. clouds should rule the day. i wouldn't really expect it to rain much, but the air is more damp than it was sunday, so a few showers or some drizzle may occur. and with thicker clouds, plus precipitation, highs are in the near 40 to mid-40s range.
translated to english: technology that would allow us to control televisions, smartphones and computers without touching them, not unlike tom cruise's character, john anderton, manipulating floating digital images like a conductor directing an orchestra (though he uses gloves instead of a baton).\n\nfor years, google's advanced technology and projects (atap) lab has been seeking to create motion sensors that might be used in similar technology, an effort the company dubbed project soli.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthis week, the federal communications commission approved a google request to operate the soli sensors at higher power levels than currently allowed, according to reuters, which first reported the change in policy.\n\na full copy of the fcc ruling can be found here.\n\nin that ruling, the fcc said the change would serve the public interest by providing for innovative device control features using touchless hand gesture technology. the fcc also said users can operate google soli devices aboard aircraft — but they remain subject to faa regulations on portable electronic devices.\n\ngoogle did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the fcc decision and information about how the company plans to use the technology in the future.\n\nad\n\nhere's one idea, courtesy of inverse: instead of having to perfectly tap a smartwatch app with your pinkie, you could scroll and select from afar.\n\nad\n\non its website, project soli's tagline is: your hands are the only interface you'll need.\n\nin a video on the site posted in 2015, ivan poupyrev, project soli's founder, marvels at the human hand, noting that it is extremely precise and fast.\n\nhow can we take this incredible capability, he asks, and apply it to the virtual world?\n\npoupyrev says the project is using radar hardware — traditionally used to track large objects like airplanes and satellites — to track human hand twitches and then turning it into a gesture sensor that uses those motions to interact with various devices via a microchip.
but on sunday night, cotton said he won't join a dozen other republican senators in challenging trump's loss. the coalition, led by sen. ted cruz (r-tex.), plans to object wednesday when congress meets to certify president-elect biden's electoral college victory.\n\ncotton said on sunday that plan oversteps congress's largely ceremonial role, and warned that if the gop prevailed, it would essentially end presidential elections and place that power in the hands of whichever party controls congress.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe founders entrusted our elections chiefly to the states — not congress, cotton said in a news release. they entrusted the election of our president to the people, acting through the electoral college — not congress. and they entrusted the adjudication of election disputes to the courts — not congress.\n\ncotton, though, did continue backing the president's baseless claims of widespread election fraud, and said he supported creating a commission to study the election results.\n\nthe arkansas senator's decision highlights the stark divide in the republican party over trump's continued attempts to remain in power, and separates cotton, who is seen as a likely presidential contender in 2024, from other presumed challengers, including cruz and sen. josh hawley (r-mo.).\n\nsen. ted cruz (r-tex.) announced jan. 2 that a dozen republican senators intend to challenge president-elect joe biden's victory. (reuters)\n\na spokesperson with the president's campaign did not immediately respond to the washington post's request for comment early monday.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ncruz's group of gop senators announced over the weekend that they would reject electors from some swing states won by biden, calling for an emergency 10-day audit to investigate the president's unsubstantiated fraud claims.\n\nalthough the challenge will delay wednesday's session, the move is highly unlikely to change the election results because the democratic-led house would also have to reject biden's electors. after lawmakers count the electoral college votes declaring biden the winner, vice president pence — who has also backed cruz's challenge — will formalize the president-elect's win.\n\nsenate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) had urged gop leaders to refrain from contesting the election results, and other republicans including sens. mitt romney (utah) and ben sasse (neb.), have blasted cruz's move. romney called it an egregious ploy threatening democracy and sasse deemed it a dangerous ploy. on sunday, republican sen. lindsey o. graham (s. c.) called the move a political dodge that has zero chance of becoming a reality.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ncotton on sunday said he shared cruz's aims, but believed the republican senators would set unwise precedents by refusing to accept electors.\n\nhe argued that it would further embolden democrats to abolish the electoral college, claiming that if republicans decline to count electoral votes this time, democrats could imitate the response in the future.\n\ndemocrats could achieve their longstanding goal of eliminating the electoral college in effect by refusing to count electoral votes in the future for a republican president elect, cotton added.\n\nhe also suggested that it would motivate the left to push for standard election laws nationwide.\n\ncongress would take another big step toward federalizing election law, another longstanding democratic priority that republicans have consistently opposed, he said.\n\nand cotton noted that the challenge wouldn't change the election.
how candidate positions were compiled\n\nthe washington post sent a detailed questionnaire to every democratic presidential campaign asking whether it supports various changes to u.s. economic policy. candidates with similar stances were organized into groups using a combination of those answers, legislative records, action taken in an executive role, and other public comments, such as policy discussion on campaign websites, social media posts, interviews, town hall meetings and other news reports and surveys. see something we missed? let us know.\n\nthis page will update as we learn more about the candidates' plans. we also will note if candidates change their position on an issue. at initial publication, this page included major candidates who had announced a run for president. if a candidate dropped out after a question was published here, their stance is included under the show former candidates option. if they dropped out before a question was first published, the post did not reach out to get their stance.\n\ncurious about where candidates stand on another policy? fill out this suggestion form.\n\ncandidate illustrations by ben kirchner.
beccs has been used only rarely thus far, but many had hoped widespread use of the technology would provide large amounts of energy while helping to fight climate change. it would be particularly important if the world misses its targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. in that scenario, greenhouse gases concentrations would pass the maximum levels climatologists say could avoid bringing about extreme consequences of climate change, and hitting the targets would require negative emissions technologies that lower concentrations.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbut in the new paper, scientists argue that deploying beccs technology on the scale needed to address the problem would use up massive amounts of water, fertilizer and land. that would probably lead to large environmental problems or even destabilize key planetary systems, wrote vera heck of the potsdam institute for climate impact research and three colleagues.\n\nwe could achieve substantial amounts of bioenergy potentials, but this would really come at the cost of extensive environmental damage in many other dimensions, heck said.\n\nto analyze beccs, heck and her co-authors examined invoke the influential concept of planetary boundaries, a list of nine ecological thresholds beyond which we should not push natural systems, because doing so could generate abrupt or irreversible environmental changes.\n\nchanging the earth's climate transgresses one a key boundary — in this sense, beccs helps out. but at the same time, the new research says it could up the risk of crossing other boundaries — those concerning freshwater, the integrity of ecosystems, large-scale changes to land areas, and shifts in flows of nitrogen and phosphorous.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe study found that large-scale beccs initiatives, with biomass plantations stretching over millions of square miles, could store between 1.2 billion and 6.3 billion tons of carbon annually. that's enough to make a very large dent in global greenhouse gas emissions. however, at this scale, beccs could trigger critical environmental feedbacks to the earth system, the study finds.\n\nbeccs at such a scale would lead to millions of square miles of forest loss and large pressures on biodiversity, the study found. meanwhile, the huge plantations would require tens of millions of tons of nitrogen fertilizer that would alter flow of this chemical around the earth, and huge amounts of water — over a trillion tons of it each year.\n\nwe would increase freshwater consumption by biomass plantations by an amount that more than doubled agricultural uses currently, said heck.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nif we wanted to do beccs in a way that would not risk blowing past key planetary boundaries, we could, but the resulting carbon storage would be far smaller — less than 0.1 billion tons per year, the research found. but then, that wouldn't make a major dent in the climate problem.
when did the term come about, and how was bomb selected?\n\nit came from a paper we published in 1980. the title was synoptic-dynamic climatology of the 'bomb.'  i was a graduate student at the time [at mit], and my adviser, who was the lead author, frederick sanders, actually coined the term. he had quite a bit of experience making forecasts for cyclones in the north atlantic that were developing very rapidly. oftentimes, we'd even say explosively. given their explosive development, it was an easy path to take to just call these systems bombs.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwhat does a storm have to do to be classified as a bomb?\n\nwe defined it as a series of pressure falls that occur in a rapidly developing cyclone. the central pressure of the storm has to drop at the rate of one millibar per hour for at least 24 hours.\n\nwhat first brought your attention to this phenomenon?\n\nwe noticed a tendency for storms in the northern atlantic and pacific to sometimes intensify quickly during the fall and winter months. what really brought attention to these storms was a rare summertime storm in 1979. the storm bombed out and impacted the fastnet yacht race in the united kingdom. it caused widespread damage and a number of casualties, and elevated these sorts of storms to international attention.\n\nwhat role did your paper have in the science of forecasting these storms?\n\nad\n\none of the reasons we published this paper was that these explosively developing cyclones were most prevalent during the wintertime — and the winds themselves tended to be of hurricane force. impacts of these cases were often comparable to those of hurricanes. but many people would mistakenly let their guard down once hurricane season was over. this happened a lot with marine and coastal interests. our goal was to help raise awareness that damaging ocean storms don't just happen during the summer.\n\nad\n\ndid the term bomb take off immediately after the paper was published?\n\nthe paper helped to launch into public perception a little bit more. it mainly served to raise the awareness of scientists, which was most important since they are the stakeholders, so to speak. that spawned a lot of important research. at the time, forecasting for these systems was poor. the presidents' day storm in '79 dropped record-shattering snow on d.c., for instance, and it was really poorly forecast. thanks to the work that's been done since, prediction has improved phenomenally. and i think the term has helped contribute to the visibility of the phenomenon as well. … it's become popularized in recent years.\n\nad\n\na meteorological bomb almost sounds too crazy to be real. are they as bad as the name makes them sound?\n\nthey most certainly are. the name isn't an exaggeration — these storms develop explosively and quickly. they can produce destructive winds, coastal flooding and erosion, and, of course, very heavy precipitation. if the term conveys the importance and the danger associated with them, then i think that's a good thing.\n\nad\n\nare there indications climate change could affect the frequency of bombs in the future?\n\nthat's a great question. we're definitely expecting impacts for two reasons. first is the warming ocean. as the waters warm, they can add more moisture to the air, allowing the storms to dump more precipitation. latent heating could also play a role intensifying the storms as well. these storms feed off the temperature gradient between the mild gulf stream and cold air over the land. climate change could also periodically cause cold air to spill farther south, and when the two meet, there's an increased risk for these extreme storms.
it's rush hour on a november evening in washington's busiest regional rail hub, but swarming commuters must yield to a much more potent tide. the federalist society has taken over the main hall of union station for its annual black-tie gala. the stone walls of the vast, vaulted concourse are bathed in pale red and blue, while larger-than-life white spotlight cameo silhouettes of james madison's head — the society's trademark — crown the columns and glow on video screens. two hundred and twenty sold-out tables, each set for 10, await the throng funneling through a block-long tent, where $200-a-plate tickets are checked; inside, exclamations of celebration and reunion echo and blend into a deafening roar.\n\nlisten to this and other great stories from the washington post magazine on the curio app.\n\neven when the crowd simmers down, it's so hard to hear in the cavernous hall that the words of retiring sen. orrin hatch of utah — who is receiving an award — are mostly lost to history. whatever he's saying, i'm sure it's good, says lew olowski, who, like me, has crept closer to try to hear. he was a human rights activist studying at georgetown law a decade ago when, he tells me, joining the federalist society expanded his mind to see both sides of issues. now he's general counsel for an organization helping poor pregnant women get a leg up and, not incidentally, keep their babies. his ears prick up at isolated morsels of hatch's talk: … religious freedom … administrative state. … see what i mean? olowski says. music to my ears.\n\n(illustrations by sam spratt for the washington post)\n\nthere is much for this crowd to celebrate. the conservative and libertarian society for law and public policy studies has reached an unprecedented peak of power and influence. brett kavanaugh, whose membership in the society dates to his yale law school days, has just been elevated to the supreme court; he is the second of president trump's appointees, following neil gorsuch, another justice closely associated with the society. they join justice clarence thomas (who said last spring he's been a part of the federalist society now since meeting with them … in the 1980s), chief justice john roberts (listed as a member in 1997-98) and justice samuel alito (a periodic speaker at society events). the newly solidified conservative majority on the court will inevitably decide more cases in line with the society's ideals — which include checking federal power, protecting individual liberty and interpreting the constitution according to its original meaning. in practice, this could mean fewer regulations of the environment and health care, more businesses allowed to refuse service to customers on religious grounds, and denial of protections claimed by newly vocal classes of minorities, such as transgender people.\n\nthis illustration is based on howard chandler christy's 1940 painting, scene at the signing of the constitution of the united states, with contemporary players on both sides of the judicial contest. 1. stephen breyer, 2. ruth bader ginsburg, 3. sonia sotomayor, 4. elena kagan, 5. chuck schumer, 6. kamala harris, 7. leonard leo, 8. vice president pence, 9. orrin hatch, 10. chuck grassley, 11. john roberts, 12. susan collins, 13. lindsey graham, 14. mitch mcconnell, 15. president trump, 16. samuel alito, 17. neil gorsuch, 18. clarence thomas and 19. brett kavanaugh.\n\nbut having allies on the highest court of the land is just the top layer of the federalist society's expanding sway. for one thing, there is the judicial nomination process itself. when trump was campaigning in 2016, he made the shrewd and un­or­tho­dox move of publicizing a list of 11 conservative legal stars that he promised to draw from if he got a chance to pick a supreme court justice. leonard leo, executive vice president of the federalist society, played a key role in suggesting the names, along with trump's future white house counsel, don mcgahn (also a society member), and the conservative heritage foundation. the list was expanded twice to include gorsuch, kavanaugh and others. leo took a leave from his job at the federalist society to advise the white house on the confirmation process for gorsuch and kavanaugh — reprising a role he played for the george w. bush white house in putting roberts and alito on the court.\n\nthe next most important segment of the judiciary — the federal appeals courts — is also filling up with federalist society members: twenty-five of the 30 appeals court judges trump has appointed are or were members of the society. our opponents of judicial nominees frequently claim the president has outsourced his selection of judges, mcgahn quipped to a federalist society gathering in 2017. that is completely false. i've been a member of the federalist society since law school. still am. so, frankly, it seems like it's been in-sourced.\n\nkavanaugh, gorsuch, alito and thomas are all at the banquet — a record turnout of supreme court justices for the annual affair. there's also a trio of trump's once and future justice department leaders: deputy attorney general rod rosenstein (alumnus of the federalist society's harvard law school chapter), recently fired attorney general jeff sessions (frequent society speaker) and acting attorney general matthew whitaker (recommended by leonard leo to be sessions's chief of staff). it's as if the players in the recent melodramas surrounding the justice department are minor actors compared with the federalist society itself — which provides the enduring climate within which storms on the right come and go.\n\nto close the gala, mcgahn and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell settle in armchairs below the giant madison heads for an onstage tete-a-tete, during which they all but spike the football over the current pace of appointing conservatives to all levels of the federal judiciary — the judges project, as mcconnell calls it. at the appeals court level, in particular, trump has made more appointments than all other presidents at the same point in their presidencies, according to research by russell wheeler, a visiting fellow in governance studies at the brookings institution. (at the district court level, however, trump's pace lags behind that of george w. bush and bill clinton.) my goal … is to do everything we can for as long as we can to transform the federal judiciary, because everything else we do is transitory, mcconnell says. the closest thing we will ever have an opportunity to do to have the longest impact on the country is confirming these great men and women and transforming the judiciary for as long into the future as we can. mcconnell notes that the judges list played a big part in getting trump elected. the majority leader looks out over the gathering almost mistily as he concludes: i hope you are proud of what we've done.\n\nas pumped as anyone is olowski, watching with me from the side. but to understand what the federalist society has achieved and where it's headed, he advises me to look beyond the scorecard of confirmed judges — and to instead consider the intellectual sparring and professional grooming going on at federalist society chapters and forums across the land.\n\nthis advice resonates with what i had been picking up over a couple of weeks of conversations with people in and around the organization: much of the federalist society's influence comes not from its very public washington victories but from its behind-the-scenes, grass-roots ability to shift the law at the idea level, even the cultural level. and so, a glimpse of the impact yet to come could be had at far tables fanning out to the corners of union station where the sound is bad — the law students and professors from houston, boston and los angeles; the young lawyers at the dawn of long careers scarfing fancy food at tables underwritten by their firms. let the politicians build the coalitions to confirm conservative judges and roll back the administrative state, olowski says. that's not the federalist society's job. the federalist society's job is to put these ideas out there. and of course, as james madison could tell us, ideas tend to outlive presidents, political majorities and even judges.\n\nworking with president trump, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has said the goal is to transform the federal judiciary.\n\nthe original ambition was not so grand. a handful of conservative law students at the university of chicago, yale and harvard in the early 1980s wanted an outlet for their maverick notions of the law amid the liberal domination of the legal academy. when we started the federalist society, we didn't know we were starting the federalist society, lee liberman otis, one of the chicago co-founders, told me. we thought we were starting groups at each of our law schools. … 'let's start something where we could talk about those ideas.' \n\nthe students announced a national symposium to be held at yale in the spring of 1982. word spread ahead of the conference, and so many letters came from students at other schools asking how to start a chapter that otis says she and another co-founder quickly drafted a guide. daniel kelly was a senior at the college of the holy cross and applying to law school when he heard about it. thrilled at the prospect, he and some friends drove 100 miles from worcester, mass., to new haven, conn., and slept on the floor of a friend's yale dorm. they were saying something that seemed completely plain sense and true to us, kelly recalls, which is when you look at the constitution, you should look at the way the framers wrote it and interpret it as best you can based upon the intention of the framers. kelly is now head of the federalist society lawyers chapter in boston, where, in late october, sessions gave one of his last speeches as attorney general.\n\nspeakers at that first symposium included future justice antonin scalia, who was then a law professor at the university of chicago and a mentor to the campus federalist society chapter. choosing as his topic the two faces of federalism, scalia presumed that his audience was on a mission to influence national policy, and so he told the gathering: i urge you, then — as hamilton would have urged you — to keep in mind that the federal government is not bad but good. the trick is to use it wisely.\n\nmuch of the federalist society's influence comes not from its very public washington victories but from its behind-the-scenes, grass-roots ability to shift the law at the idea level, even the cultural level.\n\nanother speaker was future solicitor general ted olson, who was then an assistant attorney general in the office of legal counsel. i didn't have any idea how far it would go or what it would become, olson told me, but i did feel at the time … this is something interesting happening here. in his address to that first symposium, he said: i sense that we are at one of those points in history where the pendulum may be beginning to swing in another direction. of course, we do not know now, and no one will really know until many years from now, whether the 1980 elections have wrought a significant and long-lasting change. but i think that there is an opportunity here; and the organization of this society and this symposium is a cause for optimism and a sign that perhaps something is happening.\n\nfrom there, the story of the federalist society's influence became the story of approximately 70,000 random epiphanies. that's roughly the number of active participants in the society today, according to its leadership. my admittedly unscientific sample of a dozen federalists' personal stories — backed up by political scientists' more systematic research into the question — suggests that each individual federalist is akin to an excited synapse in a sprawling hive mind with no one actually in charge.\n\ni have a very distinctive beginning story, randy barnett told me over eggs at a diner in logan circle a few days before the society's annual national convention in november. there was no federalist society when i was a law student, so i didn't know anything about it. i heard about it, and my impression of it was it was going to be a very right-wing organization, and i'm a libertarian — i'm not a conservative.\n\ntoday, barnett is a professor of constitutional law at georgetown and an influential voice in the legal wars over the affordable care act, medical marijuana and the like. but his first encounter with the federalist society came in 1986, two academic postings ago, when he was a relatively junior professor at chicago-kent college of law. a student invited him to speak on a panel at one of the early federalist society national student symposiums. barnett was reluctant because he thought his perspective would be unwelcome, and anyway, he taught contracts, not the constitution. but he was ambitious enough to want to rub shoulders with the legal celebrities who would also be invited. so he said yes.\n\nhe was on a panel about freedom of association. most people consider it a hallowed right — yet it is one that is not mentioned in the constitution. some legal theorists fret over assorted rights being smuggled into the constitution by activist judges. on the panel, barnett knew he was seated beside a conservative advocate of judicial restraint. and so, barnett told me, i said at the end of my little talk, 'i know what you're thinking: what gives lifetime-appointed judges the power to protect a right that isn't actually mentioned in the text of the constitution?'  he recalled that he paused dramatically. and then, as i had prepared, my next thing was to read the text of the ninth amendment, which says the enumeration in the constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. and when i said that, this huge roar [of approval] came up from the audience.\n\nbarnett realized he had misread the federalist society. despite his initial impression of a closed conservative sect, the society seemed open to testing a diversity of ideas — and speaking on that panel changed his professional life. he switched from contracts to constitutional law. he made himself an expert on the ninth amendment, which got him involved in a case seeking to protect people from federal prosecution for using medical marijuana in california, where the state had legalized it. the case ended up relying not on the ninth amendment, but on the commerce clause — a strict reading of which is a favorite federalist tool for curbing federal power. barnett argued the matter before the supreme court in 2004. he lost — but in the process he developed some subtle jujitsu moves with the commerce clause.\n\nfederal appeals court appointments president trump has appointed more judges to the federal appeals courts than all other presidents at equivalent points in their presidencies.\n\n\n\n30 donald j. trump\n\n12 barack obama\n\n16 george w. bush\n\n19 bill clinton\n\n22 george h.w. bush\n\n19 ronald reagan\n\n\n\nfigures provided by russell wheeler, visiting fellow in governance studies at the brookings institution.\n\nand that is how he had an arsenal of commerce-based arguments ready when the affordable care act was passed in 2010. by then barnett was a leading voice of the growing libertarian wing of the federalist society, and he became one of the architects of constitutional claims at the core of lawsuits against the health-care plan. his participation in the legal assault on obamacare was hatched at — where else? — the federalist society's national convention in the fall of 2009, where, in the hallway of the mayflower hotel between sessions, he happened to bump into a clutch of fellow federalists discussing the health-care legislation. (josh blackman, a popular federalist social media force and a professor at the south texas college of law, documented the moment in his 2013 book, unprecedented: the constitutional challenge to obamacare.) barnett told me how one person in the group says, 'you want to do something about this?' i said, 'sure.' … and he said, 'whatever we do, we've got to do it fast because it's going to come out of committee very soon.' \n\na few weeks later, barnett and co-authors nathaniel stewart and todd gaziano issued a 16-page legal memorandum via the heritage foundation that outlined a constitutional case against the health-care measure. according to blackman, the paper became a source of talking points during congressional debate and laid the framework for subsequent court challenges; barnett represented one of the plaintiffs.\n\nultimately, of course, to the distress of most federalists, the supreme court upheld the law in 2012. yet to barnett and others, it was still a victory for future deployments of the commerce clause argument against federal overreach, because a majority of the court agreed with the commerce-based critique. instead, in his opinion upholding the measure, chief justice roberts found other grounds to support the law.\n\nthis is how the federalist society influences things, barnett told me. it's not the dark-money cabal. … by having free and fair discussion, it involves people, gets them interested, and they oftentimes will do something about that.\n\nsurfacing judicial candidates to be appointed when conservatives are in power is just one byproduct of the society's work — and maybe not the most important one.\n\nbarnett's experience is a typical example of how different the society is from the stereotype of a traditional top-down washington pressure group. the society itself lobbies for no policies; it never signs amicus briefs or represents clients in cases. no one at federalist society headquarters in washington dictated barnett's moves or told him how to advocate for what positions. it's just that at a few gatherings made possible by the federalist society that barnett happened to attend, synapses fired, a corner of the hive mind engaged, and barnett took it from there. multiply that chemistry tens of thousands of times over the past 36 years and you have the federalist society's true source of power.\n\nit's a remarkably successful example of what political scientists call a political epistemic community — an interconnected network of experts with policy-relevant knowledge who share certain beliefs and work to actively transmit and translate those beliefs into policy, as amanda hollis-brusky argued in her 2015 book, ideas with consequences: the federalist society and the conservative counterrevolution. hollis-brusky documented the impact of such a community: focusing on key recent supreme court decisions on hot-button issues such as campaign finance, gun control and state sovereignty, she found that as many as two dozen people with federalist society connections played some role in crafting the arguments, arguing the cases, clerking for the judges or issuing the rulings.\n\nthat community now includes more than 200 student chapters at law schools, where federalists are a minority presence, but a significant one. the georgetown chapter has more than 100 members out of about 2,000 in the law school. the federalist society is one of our most active student organizations, law school dean of students mitch bailin told the society's national student symposium on campus in march. of particular impact and importance to me, they regularly, happily, engagedly partner with our student organizations across the viewpoint spectrum to ensure the widest range of ideas are explored on the issues of the most urgent consequence.\n\nfederal district court appointments despite president trump's record pace of appeals court appointments, at the federal district court level he lags behind some recent presidents at the same point in their administrations.\n\n\n\n53 donald j. trump\n\n39 barack obama\n\n83 george w. bush\n\n107 bill clinton\n\n48 george h.w. bush\n\n67 ronald reagan\n\n\n\nfigures provided by russell wheeler, visiting fellow in governance studies at the brookings institution.\n\nonce students graduate, they can pick from more than 90 lawyers chapters around the country. kaytlin roholt graduated from the university of pennsylvania law school in 2014, clerked for two federal judges, served as a special counsel to senate judiciary committee chairman charles grassley during the gorsuch nomination, and now practices at jones day and is a member of the steering committee of the federalist society's d.c. chapter for young lawyers. regardless of where i am, i know that a federalist society event is a place where i can go to sort of stay current in the legal issues, to continue learning while practicing, she told me. what we really try to do on the young lawyers chapter is create spaces for people to engage with these issues that they wouldn't really be able to do during their day-to-day life as a lawyer. panel organizers try to include advocates of liberal perspectives so ideas get a good workout. together, the student and lawyers chapters put on about 1,500 programs a year.\n\nmany individual federalists are political and ideological warriors, though never in the name of the federalist society. rather, society events provide the proving ground where they hone their arguments, seize a chance to shine and come to the attention of mentors higher up in the political-legal hierarchy. in that sense, the federalist society is a talent network and placement agency as well.\n\nwhile the federalist society may never take an official position on anything, conservative funders know who their friends are. ever since the founding symposium at yale in 1982 was bankrolled largely by conservative organizations, the society has enjoyed steady financial support from the right. the group raised $20 million in 2017; more than $300,000 came from interests related to conservative activist funders charles and david koch.\n\nmost of the money went toward supporting the chapter programs and staging conferences — in other words, tending to the network and the idea factory. what makes leonard leo so consequential is not because he's so smart or whatever, it's that he's sitting at the center of an enormous network, says steven teles, author of the rise of the conservative legal movement: the battle for control of the law and a professor of political science at johns hopkins university. he has lots of information, and that information isn't just his; it's that those things bubble up through those relationships … spreading through all these people who know each other, and they develop reputations and linkages, which then have lots of other consequences.\n\nsurfacing promising judicial candidates who can be nominated when conservatives have electoral power is just one byproduct of the network, and on its own maybe not the most important one, teles explains. there's a supply-and-demand relationship between the judges and the network. the judges need scholarship and arguments extending federalist principles into new areas. where new legal theories depart from the status quo, they need them to be vetted and legitimized through public debate. they require targeted cases raising questions that provide an opening to move the law. without professors and lawyers in the network filling that demand, teles says, you're not going to maximize what you got through the electoral process.\n\ni met leo at the federalist society's offices in washington. despite the fact that in his personal capacity while on leave from the society he put so much effort into advising the trump administration on judges, he endorses the network theory of the society, telling me, it's less about who gets what job and more about building a community that can be self-perpetuating and self-sustaining and self-driving.\n\nthe federalist society's leonard leo, having helped create a list of supreme court candidates, is one of trump's judge whisperers.\n\nliberal legal advocates and scholars realized they were in a serious battle for the law with the federalist society after the supreme court decided bush v. gore in 2000, handing the white house to george w. bush. peter rubin, then a professor at georgetown, founded the american constitution society to win hearts and minds of students, lawyers and judges.\n\npeter, among others, saw bush v. gore and recognized that we'd been snookered, caroline fredrickson, president of the acs, told me. the left had been sleeping on its laurels, still living in the warren court and all of the sudden we were going to have the roberts court. and so the idea was to found an organization that would help organize progressive lawyers to protect the core fundamental values that we see in the constitution.\n\nimitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and a measure of how much the federalist society had already shifted frames of reference was the liberal response. acs was very explicitly founded to do the same kind of work that the federalist society has done, fredrickson says. we, too, have chapters across the country. … we also organize events. we have a group of scholars and experts who work with us on efforts to explain the constitution and our laws to the broader public. but the acs still lacks the reach of the federalist society, as measured in chapters and budgets. fredrickson attributes the gap to legal institutions and opportunities on the left being more diffuse than on the right. also: they do get a lot more corporate support than we do because it's in the interest of the corporations, she says. they want to get rid of regulations.\n\nthe traditional liberal response to the federalist society has included pointing out how suspiciously convenient it is that the jurisprudence advocated by society members so often yields conservative results. the conservatives reverse-engineered their preferred methodologies of interpreting the constitution and legal statutes to reach the ends they want, goes this line of attack. those methodologies are known as originalism and textualism because they are said to be founded in a search for the original meaning of the constitution and the literal texts of legal statutes.\n\nbut more recently another liberal position has emerged, and it shows what the federalists have achieved. this position might be summed up as: if you can't beat them, join them — methodologically, at least. a number of liberal scholars have applied themselves to the task of showing how, in fact, originalist approaches can yield progressive results. as this train of thought has flowed out of the academy, liberal originalist logic is, more and more, showing up in legal briefs and even in supreme court dissents. advocates of all stripes know they must be ready with textualist arguments because, thanks in large part to the work of the federalists, it's more likely than ever that the judge deciding a case will want to hear that perspective.\n\nfor too long progressives were ceding that constitutional ground to the right and organizations like the federalist society, says elizabeth wydra, president of the constitutional accountability center, a progressive think tank and law firm that fashions originalist arguments. when you actually look at the text and history of the entire constitution, particularly focusing on the transformative amendments that were enacted in the wake of the civil war, you really see an arc of progress that pushes our country toward inclusion, equality and greater democracy that tells a very different story from a lot of what the folks on the right, including the federalist society, would have you believe about our constitution. the cac has made originalist arguments in favor of same-sex marriage, affirmative action and abortion rights. its position is that those rights are guaranteed by a textual and historical understanding of the original meaning of the 14th amendment's equal protection clause. the cac also is using an originalist reading of the foreign emoluments clause as it represents members of congress who claim trump is unconstitutionally benefiting from foreign payments.\n\neven federalists come down on both sides of some of these questions. in 2013, years after he spoke at the founding federalist society symposium, and after he won bush v. gore, ted olson returned to the supreme court to overturn a california proposition banning same-sex marriage. for their part, many liberal scholars and lawyers continue to reject originalism in favor of a vision of the constitution flexible enough to embrace changing times and evolving notions of human rights. still, even critics of originalism are forced to acknowledge the new reality: despite recent work demonstrating the bankruptcy of these [originalist] approaches, liberal lawyers trying to get progressive results at the supreme court have already begun trying to pick off conservative justices through a calculated embrace of the theories, richard hasen, a professor of law and political science at the university of california at irvine, wrote recently in slate.\n\nleonard leo told me he disputes the notion that the constitution contains either conservative or progressive values, and he denies that originalism is rigged to reach conservative and libertarian results. the constitution is a structural road map for how to ensure accountability and transparency in government, he said. and there are timeless values in it that are tied to the weaknesses of human nature and the danger of unlimited authority being vested in one person or a group of people. … you're practicing originalism appropriately when you're doing so without looking behind the curtain and trying to predetermine results.\n\nbut he welcomes liberals to the federalist society's jurisprudential worldview: there are liberals who work really hard at trying to develop a neutral, originalist approach to interpretation, he said. the fact that people may come out differently occasionally — that's okay. half the battle is just agreeing that it is essential.\n\ntrump's supreme court appointees, neil gorsuch, left, and brett kavanaugh, both have federalist society connections.\n\nback at the black-tie gala in union station — as mcgahn and mcconnell conclude what can only be described as a sedentary victory dance; as the four federalist-friendly justices disperse into the night; as deputy ag rosenstein and acting ag whitaker linger for pictures with groups of giddy fans — i ponder: what now? having reached this summit, what's left for the federalist society to conquer?\n\ni found some clues during the three days of the national convention at the mayflower hotel that bookended the gala. the judges project is still clearly in high gear, and with two sitting supreme court justices in their 80s — ruth bader ginsburg, 85, and stephen breyer, 80 — there's an incentive to keep the list of candidates fresh. numerous candidates-in-waiting were on display at the conference. i counted 24 appeals court judges on the program — including 15 just elevated by trump — and at least 11 of the names on trump's expanded list of potential supreme court nominees were scheduled to participate over the three days.\n\nsome of the judges were treated as rock stars, especially amy coney barrett, named by trump to the 7th circuit. more than one convention speaker got a rise out of audiences by recalling democratic sen. dianne feinstein's gaffe of telling the catholic barrett during her confirmation hearing that the dogma lives loudly within you, and that's of concern. the lunchtime panel on stare decisis (the legal doctrine that calls for courts to respect precedent) was full — and several attendees told me it wasn't the topic that drew them, it was the presence of barrett moderating the panel. judge, welcome back to washington — and i hope you'll come back for good sometime soon! one of the panelists, kannon shanmugam, an appellate advocate and partner at williams & connolly, said to barrett, drawing cheers from the audience.\n\nin hallways and during panels, networking continued to mix with intellectual ferment. i ran into josh blackman, the texas professor and blogger; he was scheduled to be on a panel where he would urge judges to tweet more and make decisions easier to search online. all the action does go on in the hallway, he told me. at dinner last night i met with friends old and new who had things they wanted to tell me, things they wanted me to think about, things i want to write about. as long as you have your eyes and ears open, you always are able to connect in new ways.\n\nchecking out a number of panels, i was impressed that, true to its claim, the federalist society really had invited capable liberal advocates to try to rebut conservative perspectives. people always treat me politely in these circumstances, but they always look at me in bemusement about how wrong i am, w. neil eggleston, former white house counsel for obama, quipped during the session on stare decisis. he cautioned the newly empowered majority on the supreme court against overturning landmark decisions such as roe v. wade just because it could with slim 5-to-4 majorities.\n\nmeanwhile, for all the federalist society's steamrolling progress on display, i detected a sign of tension that may, too, carry into the future. near the conclusion of the gala, while mcgahn and mcconnell are still gloating, i notice a figure standing at a high-top with a drink in the bar area. it's george conway iii, husband of trump communications counselor kellyanne conway. george is surrounded by some friends, and none of them is paying much attention to mcgahn and mcconnell.\n\ngeorge conway's federalist society pedigree is impeccable. he has been a member since 1984 — two years after the founding symposium — and he serves on the society's board of visitors. but he has also publicly criticized his wife's boss's actions on occasion. and he shook the conservative legal establishment when, just before the convention, he and a group of conservative and libertarian lawyers announced the formation of a group called checks and balances because, they said, trump threatens the rule of law. george conway had even told the new york times that there's a perception out there that conservative lawyers have essentially sold their souls for judges and regulatory reform.\n\nas i approach, conway is being congratulated by people coming up from all sides.\n\nchecks and balances! says one admirer.\n\nisn't it great? says conway.\n\nhow's kellyanne feeling?\n\nah, she could do without it.\n\nanother, much younger lawyer approaches.\n\ni got that email, he says.\n\nyou going to come? asks conway, referring to a recruitment meeting planned for the next day.\n\ni already put the word out.\n\nturning to me, conway says: that's one of the young people who just loves what we're doing. … he's a recent law school graduate, a few years out, and a clerk for a really prominent judge here in the district. … the younger people really feel it, and their view is: this will end, the current era. and they're going to be around a long time, and they're not worried that it's going to affect their careers.\n\nchecks and balances, as conway explains it to me, is not an attack on the federalist society but a reminder of the core principles the society has stood for ever since that band of students gathered at yale. and now, here in a corner of the vast, tingling network, another connection is being made.\n\ndavid montgomery is a staff writer for the magazine.
while the supreme court regularly scrutinizes electoral districts for racial gerrymandering, the justices have never found a state's redistricting map so infected with politics that it violates the constitution. such a decision would mark a dramatic change for how the nation's political maps are drawn.\n\nad\n\nthe court passed up the chance last term to settle the issue of whether courts have a role in policing partisan gerrymandering, sending back on technical rulings challenges to a republican-drawn plan in wisconsin and the challenged maryland map.\n\nthe process of redrawing district lines to give an advantage to one party over another is called gerrymandering. here's how it works. (daron taylor/the washington post)\n\nin oral arguments last term, conservative justices generally seemed uncomfortable with judges getting involved in what some consider a political matter between voters and their representatives. liberal justices seemed to think that partisan redistricting was thwarting the will of voters and that the situation will get worse as technology provides lawmakers with pinpoint accuracy in identifying which party voters support.\n\nad\n\nbut a reconfigured court will consider the issue in march. justice anthony m. kennedy, who had held out the belief that some gerrymandering could be so political as to be unconstitutional, has been replaced with justice brett m. kavanaugh. the new justice is generally more conservative but has not ruled on the issue in the past.\n\nad\n\nthe supreme court had little choice but to accept the cases, as it is required to either affirm or reverse lower-court decisions on such political matters.\n\nwhile last term's outcomes did not favor them, opponents of partisan gerrymandering said they hoped the supreme court could be persuaded to find a role for the judiciary in the matter.\n\nvoters nationwide are ready for a ruling from the supreme court that finally declares that they come first, not self-interested politicians, said paul smith, vice president of the campaign legal center.\n\nad\n\nadam kincaid, executive director of the national republican redistricting trust, said that maps that follow traditional redistricting criteria should be free from challenges in federal court.\n\nad\n\nin june, the justices said the maryland case was not ready for them and sent it back. in november, a unanimous three-judge panel found that democrats had unconstitutionally targeted republican voters in the 6th congressional district because of their political affiliation. the legislature had redrawn the district, which previously stretched across the top of the state, to dip down into democratic strongholds in the washington suburbs.\n\nafter the 2011 redistricting, a democrat won the seat previously held by a republican. there was an open election in the district in november, when democrat david trone defeated republican amie hoeber by a wide margin.\n\nad\n\nthe massive and unnecessary reshuffling of the sixth district, involving one-half of its population and dictated by party affiliation and voting history, had no other cause than the intended actions of the controlling democratic officials to burden republican voters by converting the district into a democratic one wrote judge paul v. niemeyer of the u.s. court of appeals for the 4th circuit. he was joined by u.s. district judge george l. russell iii.\n\nad\n\nchief u.s. district judge james k. bredar wrote a separate opinion agreeing with the overall judgment and declaring partisan gerrymandering a cancer on our democracy.\n\nrather than redraw the map, as the federal judges had ordered, democratic attorney general brian e. frosh decided to appeal to the supreme court. that put him at odds with the state's republican gov. larry hogan, who also won reelection in november and has pushed three times for a constitutional amendment that would have an independent commission redraw boundaries.\n\nad\n\nit's outrageous that the attorney general and legislative leaders are continuing to fight against free and fair elections, even in the wake of a unanimous federal court ruling, said hogan spokeswoman amelia chasse.\n\nad\n\nthe supreme court had also sent back the north carolina case last term, telling a special panel of three federal judges to decide whether challengers in that state had the legal standing to bring the challenge. the judges said they did, and also found that the legislature's efforts violated constitutional protections of equal protection and free speech.\n\nthe north carolina legislature drew a plan designed to subordinate the interests of non-republican voters not because they believe doing so advances any democratic, constitutional, or public interest, but because, as the chief legislative mapdrawer openly acknowledged, the general assembly's republican majority 'think[s] electing republicans is better than electing democrats,'  wrote judge james a. wynn jr. of the u.s. court of appeals for the 4th circuit.\n\nad\n\nbut that is not a choice the constitution allows legislative mapdrawers to make.\n\nwynn was referring to comments from a legislative leader after a previous map was struck down as an example of racial gerrymandering that made clear politics was at the heart of the new map.\n\nad\n\ni think electing republicans is better than electing democrats, said rep. david lewis, a republican member of the north carolina general assembly, addressing fellow legislators when they passed the plan in 2016. so i drew this map to help foster what i think is better for the country.\n\nhe added: i propose that we draw the maps to give a partisan advantage to 10 republicans and three democrats because i do not believe it's possible to draw a map with 11 republicans and two democrats.\n\nwhen voters went to the polls that fall, the 10-3 outcome was exactly as lewis had predicted, even though republican candidates won just 53 percent of the statewide vote. the trend continued in november's elections, although one of those district results is being challenged because of allegations of ballot fraud.
but history has shown any attempt to promote fair housing that does not actively work to destroy deeply ingrained systems of residential segregation will fail. research has shown time and again that segregated housing is detrimental to all in our society. the residential segregation we see today is the result of decades of housing policy that benefited white home buyers to the exclusion of others. in such a highly segregated system and society, the rhetoric of freedom of choice does nothing to afford individuals actual choices.\n\nwe have seen secretary ben carson's playbook before. in 1954, the housing authority of baltimore city declared its public housing projects desegregated, by simply removing racial designations of white and negro from them. this colorblind freedom of choice plan was easy to declare, and it absolved local authorities of responsibility for integration.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwithout any structural support for integration, however, segregation remained in place. those few projects that saw any racial change at all quickly flipped from being all-white to having all-black residents. that's because lower-class white baltimoreans, accessing racially biased programs including federally insured home loans and gi bill benefits, moved in droves to the suburbs.\n\nnew public housing projects, opened on an ostensibly desegregated basis, were primarily populated by black households. simultaneously, the housing authority of baltimore city blamed black families themselves for the lack of meaningful desegregation, claiming black residents were uninterested in moving to white areas. the color line remained stubbornly in place, even absent formal racial designations — giving people a choice of where to live in public housing in still deeply segregated neighborhoods did nothing to address it. even 30 years later, three particular housing projects in the majority-black city still had 70 to 80 percent white residents.\n\nbut federal officials at hud understood back then that declaring free choice was not the same thing as making it so. in a precursor to the 1968 fair housing act, the department determined free choice housing policies, like the one in place in baltimore, were allowing segregation to continue in public housing projects. new guidelines released in 1967 required local housing authorities to maintain systemwide waiting lists of applicants and assign tenants based on the order of application, rather than allowing white applicants to hold out for an opening in a majority-white housing project. hud explained in a memo to housing authorities that freedom of choice plans did not afford freedom of choice in fact.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmoreover, hud explained, placing the burden of desegregation on individuals without acknowledging how long-standing patterns of segregation affected the ability of individuals to make choices did not provide applicants with actual freedom of access to, or full availability of, housing in all projects and locations. indeed, hud recognized the long-standing history of segregated housing was in itself a major obstacle to freedom of choice.\n\nin response to the policy changes, baltimore housing officials reworked their plans. still emphasizing choice, the housing authority skirted around the requirements. instead of one wait list with applicants placed in projects as openings became available, baltimore successfully lobbied to divide their housing projects into four geographic areas. in a highly segregated city like baltimore, geographic areas could — and did — serve as a proxy for race.\n\nbaltimore's officials were successful in this end run around hud policy because of their appeals to choice, insisting the policy as hud originally envisioned would be an overreach into the lives of applicants that would force them to live in areas of the city that they did not prefer. in the face of this appeal to choice, hud officials acquiesced to baltimore's policy changes and accepted the division of the wait list into geographic areas.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbaltimore's plans also used the results of residential segregation, including the racialized geography of proximity to family, churches, jobs and the familiar, as reasons to justify continuing such segregation. despite hud's attempted intervention, these new plans did as little to encourage integration as freedom of choice plans had done before. throughout the 1970s and 1980s, white public housing applicants could ensure placement in a white housing project by designating preference in the eastern group, where two projects had majority-white occupancy. if an applicant's employment necessitated living in the southern portion of the city, they could likewise specify a preference for proximity to the familiar to stay at the top of the wait list until an opening occurred in that area's majority-white project.\n\nthe idea that local housing officials needed to actively work to end residential segregation in all housing, public and private, became codified as law in the 1968 fair housing act. policymakers understood that simply removing the legal restraints of segregation would not produce desegregated housing.\n\nbut despite this law, it was only in 2015 under the obama administration that hud codified reporting requirements that required jurisdictions across the country to provide an assessment of fair housing, using data to report on local housing segregation and develop plans with concrete, actionable steps to support fair housing opportunity. this rule recognized that the assumption that people make free choices unconstrained by structural inequality and systemic prejudices ignores the reality of how decisions are actually made. for those reasons, the 1968 fair housing act required not only an end to segregation, but also affirmative supports for integration.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthis 2015 rule defined affirmatively furthering fair housing as taking meaningful actions that … address significant disparities in housing needs and in access to opportunity, replacing segregated living patterns with truly integrated and balanced living patterns.\n\nbut now carson has proposed a rule that would replace this definition. rather than defining fair housing as a policy of active desegregation, the trump administration emphasizes individual choice, even though we know that this is a policy dead end. now the rule would focus on advancing fair housing choice within the program participant's control or influence. the rule also conflates desegregation with creating more affordable housing, replacing fair housing reporting and planning requirements with reports on the availability of affordable housing within a jurisdiction.
here's what science has to say:\n\nour sympathies for your cold. we haven't been doing too great ourselves — achoo!\n\nbut we urge you to pause for a moment before blaming mucus for your troubles. that inconvenient fluid is full of antiseptic enzymes that protect the lining of your sinuses while flushing out potentially dangerous invaders. it's a non-newtonian gel perfectly adapted for trapping microbes right down to the molecular level. it's a hero of your immune system, right out on the front lines of the daily fight to keep you healthy. so show a little appreciation. mucus is on your side.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmucus is also so much more than the slimy stuff seeping from your nasal cavities. the term describes any viscous secretion (mucus is mostly water, mixed with glycoproteins and other molecules) that is produced by and covers the body's cavities and organs. bony fish produce external mucus to protect against infectious agents. the southern sand octopus uses mucus to line the walls of its sandy burrow to keep the hole from collapsing. it's thought that earthworms use mucus to communicate and that dolphins rely on snot to make their distinctive clicks.\n\nin humans, mucus serves all kinds of useful purposes. it protects the lining of your stomach from getting corroded by acid. it also acts as a lubricant in your esophagus, helping food pass down smoothly en route to your stomach.\n\nbut your nose is where mucus really shines. that's where it works with stunning efficiency to filter the air you breathe, trapping dust particles, bacteria and other baddies before they get into your lungs.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nit's the initial defensive system of your body to the outside world, said aaron pearlman, a rhinologist — or nose specialist — at the weill cornell medicine and new york-presbyterian.\n\ndoctors estimate that the nose produces about four cups of mucus a day. the nose's particular type of slime is made of mostly water, with small amounts of mucin (a lubricating protein that helps prevent bacteria from clumping together in biofilms) and other particles. its strands form a mesh, with small pores capable of trapping most bacteria, allergens and pollutants. only the smallest viruses can slip through mucus's defenses.\n\nits color — green, white, yellow or brown — comes from the dead cells stuck in it. the lighter colors come from white blood cells, which fight infection (though, contrary to popular belief, green mucus is not necessarily evidence you should be on antibiotics). orange or brown mucus is stained by dried up blood — an indication that the nose tissue is inflamed.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nnasal mucus has two elements: a thin, fluid layer on the bottom, called sol, and a thick, sticky layer evolved to trap invaders, called gel. when microscopic tentacles on the surface of your nasal passages, called cilia, beat against the sol, it and the gel layer on top are flushed out of the nose.\n\nif you find yourself sneezing and coughing a lot when you're sick, a virus may have done damage to your cilia, forcing the body to find other ways to get rid of mucus. david king, who teaches evidence-based medicine at the university of queensland, in australia, wrote in the conversation that the best treatment for a stuffed-up nose is saline solution, which has been shown to improve cilia's beat frequency.\n\nbut the vast majority of mucus does not fly out your nose or mouth. instead, your cilia push it to the back of your nose and throat, where your mucus is swallowed.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ngrossed out? you shouldn't be. your stomach is well-equipped to neutralize any infectious agents that might wind up there in your swallowed snot. plus, mucus is probably a lot more sanitary than some other things you eat; scientists at mit have proposed coating medical lab equipment with mucin because of its incredible antibacterial powers.\n\ncanadian researcher scott napper has even suggested we should be intentionally eating our own boogers as a way to acquaint our immune systems with potential pathogens. speaking to the canadian broadcasting corp. in 2013, he noted that snot has an appealing taste — possibly an evolutionary signal that we should snack on it.\n\ni've got two beautiful daughters, and they spend an amazing amount of time with their fingers up their nose, napper said. and without fail, it goes right into their mouth afterwards. could they just be fulfilling what we're truly meant to do?\n\nwe're just as happy leaving our mucus in a tissue — and your friends and family would probably appreciate if you do the same, at least while in public.

this has been a very hard year. how do you think it has affected us?\n\nad\n\nad\n\nit's so sobering that basically we have a 9/11 every day in terms of the number of people killed by this coronavirus. and on the one hand, i think we are learning to be resilient and creative and all those good things. but i think also we're kind of becoming callous. i think people when things become more routine, the stakes or the fear, that sometimes lessens as well. because it becomes a little bit more routine and you build that into how you see the world and it does become sort of normalized.\n\nand that's something that i think we're seeing with the fires [in australia and california that have been associated with climate change], with the police shootings, with these crazy conspiracies that are driving decision-makers. so i don't know if callous is the right word to describe what we're becoming, but these things that we're seeing as tragedies are becoming more routine and we're thinking that they're normal. but when you have a 9/11 every single day, that's not normal.\n\nyou mentioned conspiracy theories being pushed by some elected officials, such as the president and members of congress.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nconspiracy theories are functional. i mean, there is a role for them in societies, and it's usually when people are feeling out of control, they need to have some sense, some semblance of control and understanding, and conspiracy theories sometimes allow people that. and i think we're seeing that in particularly among people that are white working class that have not been making it over the last decade. and i think, trump actually fueled that in people with that particular mind-set.\n\nwe're living increasingly, in a society in which people — in the same society — have radically different worldviews. i mean, they just see the world differently.\n\nthe pandemic has been especially traumatic for people of color. it seems like those communities were abandoned by the government, by the public health system, by the economy.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwhat this pandemic has done, so poignantly, is shown how race and class and gender in some respects are working in society, because there are a few of us that with the stock market, we made more money this year than any other year in our lives. but other people lost their jobs and here in north carolina, they evicted people on christmas eve; it was embarrassing. and so people are losing their houses, losing their jobs, holding on to whatever little stimulus check they have, while other people are just making money hand over fist or can work from home and keep getting paid exactly the same every month, or teaching from home, but others have just lost everything. and so it's showing, quite literally, the class structure in the united states, the racist, classist society that we have.\n\nbut is making us more empathetic, sympathetic or understanding of the plight of people who are suffering?\n\ni hope so. one glimmer of [hope from] the protests this summer was it was by and large a multiracial effort, mostly by young people. and that, i think, gives me a little bit of hope that the youth this time around may be a little bit more inclusive. but i'm not sure.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nyes, because for all the talk this past summer of a racial reckoning, a lot of people voted for trump, who this year increasingly embraced rhetoric and a message that appealed to white identity. then after he lost, he and his supporters wanted to disenfranchise black voters, attacking the results in detroit, milwaukee and philadelphia. some have said it's a bid for minority rule.\n\nit's going to be a test of democracy, won't it, once white people are no longer in the majority? one of the very informative books i've been reading was isabel wilkerson's caste. one of her points is that [racism] has always kind of been here. the changes during the civil rights movement were not super durable and the backlash with obama, a lot of that came back or was unmasked, i don't know what the right word is, but it showed itself in these sort of racist forms and it became okay again to have, not [former alabama] governor wallace saying segregation today, segregation forever, but closer, in terms of really doubling down and defending these confederate monuments and the like and the protests in charlottesville and some really naked racism that has been shown.\n\nand in some respects, again what we're seeing, i think, is more of these divisions — even with some of the young folks recognizing and reckoning with the movement for black lives and addressing anti-racism. on the other hand, i think other people are sort of going, i don't want to say backwards, but consolidating whiteness and trying to hold on to power by any means necessary. and by doing that, it's not just dog whistles, it's sort of trumpets.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ni know you don't have a crystal ball, but, you know, what happens if we just continue to go along, divided like this?\n\ni don't know. a lot of people don't fully recognize it. is that why there has not been a majority of white people who have elected a democrat since lbj. and that's a troubling pattern. and if that doesn't change, i don't know. it's just going to be a real test of democracy in the next 25 years. but if we want to hold onto democracy. i think the way we do that is through coalition building, because without that, you get trump [as president].\n\nhow would you sum up this past year, and what it said about race, class and identity?\n\nit's emblematic of trump, it's almost metaphoric. we've said he has changed the norms of the presidency, but 2020 changed the norms of american society. at the same time, however, it rigidly defined patterns that have been systematic and has been building for the last 50 years.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ni'm always a little optimistic, and i hope that we learn to understand and be more empathetic across race and class lines and really try to understand and feel the anxiety, the fear of people who are not making it in america, whether they're white or black and really trying and also then understand how the super rich are just becoming even more rich, all the while poor people or middle class are stagnant.\n\ni also think understanding how social media is cultivating groups with very different worldviews means that we have to think not in terms of integration or assimilation, but to function in more of a pluralistic society. and i think that's going to be key. and if we can do that, i think we might have some hope.\n\ncan you elaborate just a little bit?\n\nad\n\nfor so much of american history, we've been sort of enamored by assimilation, whether it was racial uplift in the black community, like the talented tenth leading the charge, as well as many immigrants, trying to learn english and sort of blend in and assimilate.\n\nad
that was the expression on stephon gilmore's face when asked about espn's report that brady, coach bill belichick and owner robert kraft no longer get along, and the franchise is coming apart from the force of their egos. gilmore paused in his gray sweats in the center of a swarm of reporters and actually said, what report?\n\nad\n\nthe one that says something has turned sour inside the franchise that is going for its sixth super bowl title in 17 seasons. the one that started a storm in the week before their divisional playoff game against the tennessee titans, by suggesting there are imperceptible but widening cracks on their team despite a 13-3 record and the top seed in the afc. that one. what about it?\n\nad\n\ni'm all-in on tennessee, said belichick, in that bottom-of-a-drain voice of his, where expression goes to die.\n\noutside, a crew worked to remove the snow built up from last week's blizzard from gillette stadium. shovel by shovel, they methodically cleared the aisles and each step of the stadium stairs, even as an aluminum sky overhead threatened to bring another nor'easter. inside, the patriots worked at the same dull, digging pace, shoveling out platitudes and refusing to admit any chink in this impenetrable fortress of a franchise, which so many teams would love to believe is finally permeable, and might even collapse from within.\n\nad\n\ncan't anybody help us but us, cornerback malcolm butler said. we're all we got. that's how you have to look at it.\n\nyou just don't pay attention to it, he added. it's hard sometimes when people are just talking, but when it comes down to it, it's keeping your head down and keep pushing and not worrying about people that aren't in our locker room and going through things we're going through. and keep it real tight.\n\nprivately, people on the inside acknowledge that tensions are inevitable between competitive people who have spent years together under a variety of high pressures. brady is a quirky obsessive, and the driven belichick knows only one tone: demanding. but they also adamantly insist that the situation is not as dire as portrayed. someday the patriots' run will end, because brady is, after all, 40 years old, says a person close to him. but not for this reason.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nto believe the patriots are fracturing, and this is their last big run, you have to believe that the three principal characters have begun to behave in profoundly uncharacteristic ways. you have to throw away almost everything you know and have seen of brady, belichick and kraft for two decades. you have to believe that brady, for the first time in his career, has become a pouty diva who demands special status and privileges and have to ignore the many times he has restructured his contract to make it more team-friendly in the interest of winning. you have to believe that he is so insecure that he pressed for his backup jimmy garoppolo to be traded, and rejoiced when garoppolo was dealt to the 49ers.\n\nin 18 years i have never celebrated when a player was traded or cut, brady said, refuting the notion on his weekly radio show tuesday morning. it is such a poor characterization.\n\nyou'd have to believe that kraft abandoned his longtime policy of being resolutely hands-off about football matters. you have to believe that one of the most restrained and organizationally conscious owners in the league suddenly called belichick to the owner's suite and big-footed him, instructed belichick to trade garoppolo to appease brady. kraft insists the meeting and the mandate absolutely didn't happen.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nand you'd have to believe that the famously dispassionate belichick became suddenly more emotionally attached to garoppolo, who had won just two games for the patriots, than to an mvp who has won five super bowls, including two of the last three. and that belichick therefore, for the first time in his highly calculating career, made a terrible deal and maybe even intentionally kneecapped the organization he has so painstakingly hand-built. as opposed to doing the careful math on the patriots' salary cap and the money they would have to offer garoppolo to keep playing behind brady, and the leverage they were likely to lose if he didn't move on a deal for garoppolo in what he saw as the last window to get some value for him.\n\nyou'd have to believe he wanted garoppolo to embarrass the patriots — as opposed to hoping that by sending him to a struggling team across the country and in an opposite division and conference in the nfc west, under a first-year head coach, he likely wouldn't come back to beat them on the field any time soon.\n\neveryone complains about their bosses. everyone gets testy with their longtime mates. it doesn't always mean you want to divorce, or quit, or tear down all you've built. brady's unexpected good health and mvp level of play at age 40 undeniably has put the patriots in a unique kind of limbo, and no doubt it comes with tension. especially given his reliance on the highly unconventional health guru, alex guerrero, whose special access undoubtedly angered the conventional medical and training staffs — who have reason to be territorial and defensive given brady's very public rejection of their pill-needle-and-knife care.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbut the real indication that the mortar is dissolving in this building will not come from media reports. it will come from a subtle change in the on-field habits that have been the patriots' signatures for years, the lockstep precision and attention to detail and their remarkably disciplined focus, the ability to shut out everything else and to control the day, as special teams captain matthew slater put it.\n\nyou'll know it if they become a telltale bit slipshod. that single fundamental you've been talking about since otas? that can be pivotal on saturday, slater said. you'll know when you see a faint decline in their will, to put up with the pressures and the noise and the inevitable nor'easters, both weather-born and media-brought, that come with their success. saturday night. foxborough, gillette. fans loud. cold, slater says.\n\nmaybe the patriots are done. maybe brady really is slipping and feeling threatened, and belichick is disenchanted, and maybe it's time for a new organization, led by younger men. or just maybe they aren't done yet,. maybe they remain the most inflexible, uncompromising, exacting, self-willed and victory-ravenous team you've ever seen.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nfate whispers to the warrior, 'you cannot withstand the storm,' brady posted on instagram late monday. the warrior whispers back, 'i am the storm.' \n\nfor more by sally jenkins,

saudi arabia, a lead rebel sponsor during the war, seems increasingly willing to accept assad remaining in damascus, hoping to lessen his dependence on riyadh's regional rival, iran. it is even expected that the arab league, which expelled assad following his brutal crackdown on protesters in 2011 that initiated the civil war, will welcome him back in 2019.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhow isolated was assad really?\n\nof course, assad was never that internationally isolated — one of the main reasons he has survived. vital assistance from allies russia and iran is well documented. russia ensured that damascus faced no united nations-led sanctions, such as those suffered by iraq's saddam hussein, while alongside iran, moscow provided aid, loans and support to keep assad's state and military just about functioning.\n\nthe remaining brics (brazil, india, china and south africa), like many non-western states, did not demand assad stand down. china was most supportive, vetoing anti-assad u.n. security council resolutions six times since 2011, but india, too, retained ties to damascus, fearing the rise of islamists and possibly rewarding syria for its past pro-delhi stance on kashmir. brazil withdrew its ambassador to syria, but for safety reasons rather than an explicitly anti-assad action. even before the recent election of right wing pro-torture president jair bolsonaro, brazil stated its wish to restore full ties and take part in reconstruction.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nrebuilding syria will be costly\n\nthe brics and assad's allies are unlikely to provide much of the estimated $400 billion needed to rebuild postwar syria. the wealthiest, china, seems lukewarm, while russia and iran lack the funds. assad and his allies have long recognized that only persian gulf or western aid could provide the reconstruction billions needed, and this is the true value of any warming of arab ties.\n\nwhile rejoining the arab league brings economic reward and marks a symbolic end to attempts by assad's arab enemies to topple him — and will be used by the syrian dictator domestically to underline his victory — even in the arab world damascus's isolation was never complete. lebanon and iraq refused to join any gulf states-led sanctions and maintained close ties, while jordan retained a diplomatic presence in syria even while forced by the war and external political pressure to halt trade and grant rebel fighters safe haven. further afield, algeria, a fellow dictatorship that also fought an insurgency in the 1990s, opposed the arab league's expulsion of syria and acted as backchannel thereafter, while the sisi regime in egypt also developed covert ties.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nroadblocks to assad's rehabilitation: the u.s., e.u. and turkey\n\ndespite these positives, assad's road to full rehabilitation remains blocked by three significant obstacles: the united states, the european union and nato-ally turkey. the united states seems the most immovable of these. while trump's shock decision to withdraw troops from syria boosts assad's stated desire to reconquer, every inch, of territory, there is no indication this will come alongside any softening toward damascus. pro-israel and anti-iran voices in washington make it unlikely u.s. sanctions will be lifted anytime soon. these restrictions on u.s. companies and citizens dealing with or financing any work in syria remain problematic and deter international investors.\n\ne.u. sanctions are similarly problematic, although not as harsh, but the europeans are more ambivalent about assad. there has long been a split among e.u. members on syria: france, britain and germany backed washington's tough stance, but doubts were expressed by syria's neighboring southern european states.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwith assad's survival now all but guaranteed, these voices — many hosting syrian refugees that they want to return — will grow louder. as britain departs the e.u. and germany hosts 600,000 syrians, france may find itself unable to prevent a shift in european policy. e.u. policy is slow-moving and will still seek to attach conditions to the gradual lifting of any sanctions or provision of aid. while it may eventually split with washington on syria, assad will have to wait some time yet.\n\nthe more pressing obstacle, however, is turkey. syria's economy and especially its war-ravaged second city, aleppo, would be greatly boosted by reopening routes into turkey — currently blocked by both ankara and the turkish-backed rebels controlling idlib. though turkey has dropped demands for assad to go, three contested areas prevent reconciliation.\n\nfirst, after trump's withdrawal ankara and damascus could come to blows over eastern syria. turkey wants to push out washington's former kurdish allies it sees as terrorists, while syria may reach accommodation with them to regain the region. much will depend on whether russia can mediate any deal.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nsecond is idlib, the last rebel-held pocket of syria that assad is determined to retake but is protected by turkey, which fears being flooded with refugees and militants should idlib fall. finally, there is the chunk of northern syria between afrin and jarabulus currently held by turkey through rebel proxies ankara seems reluctant to give up. these issues are unlikely to be resolved swiftly. even if some kind of agreement can be reached over border trade and highways, turkey and syria seem years way from any kind of normalization.\n\nassad will welcome any return to the arab league, but its significance should not be overstated. on the one hand syria was far from isolated throughout its civil war, and on the other it remains a long way from reconciling with western governments and turkey. not that this will overly concern damascus. the assad regime has decades of experience withstanding western and regional sanctions and isolation, most recently in the mid 2000s.\n\nits strategy has long been to wait for international conditions to change in its favor than alter its policies. the recent opening from arab states will further vindicate this approach, and assad will be confident that eventually the west and ankara will also come round, no matter how long it takes.
still, for as memorable as 2016 was in the nba, don't think that's going to stop now that the calendar has flipped to 2017. there are still plenty of story lines worth following that will shape the league this year and beyond. here are the washington post's top things to watch for in the nba in 2017:\n\nad\n\nad\n\n1. the next clash of the titans\n\nanyone who argued that the creation of super teams in cleveland and golden state was bad for basketball – and, by extension, made the sport a boring one – lost it just by watching the christmas day battle between the two archrivals in cleveland. the cavaliers storming back from 14 points down in the fourth quarter was the latest example that this has become an all-time-great matchup, and made clear why most fans are so excited at the prospect of a third straight faceoff in the nba finals matchup.\n\nthat game showed what was widely suspected about the two teams: if both play to their optimum level, golden state is the more talented team, and should win. but cleveland is the one team that isn't scared of the warriors and their incredible array of stars. whether that mental edge is enough to lead the cavaliers to a second straight title remains to be seen. the guess here, though, is that golden state will get its championship, and durant's decision will be vindicated.\n\nad\n\nad\n\n2. can russell westbrook average a triple-double?\n\nwhile durant's decision to leave the oklahoma city thunder to join golden state decimated what would've been a title contender, it did something else: allow westbrook to become the version of himself we were curious to see. throughout durant's tenure in oklahoma city, there was always a creative tension – at least from the outside looking in – between the two superstars, with a steady debate about how much they shared the scoring and shooting load and whose team it was.\n\nthose questions are now gone. oklahoma city is now westbrook country, and he has exploded out of the gate with one of the most amazing stretches of individual play in league history. through 34 games, westbrook has 16 triple-doubles and is averaging 30.9 points, 10.5 rebounds and 10.7 assists. only oscar robertson averaged a triple-double for a full season, an accomplishment many assumed would never be matched. westbrook will likely wind up falling short of doing so as oklahoma city's schedule gets tougher in the second half, but he has unquestionably been remarkable.\n\nad\n\nad\n\n3. possible last looks at legends\n\nfew seasons will ever see three players as great as duncan, bryant and garnett all leaving the stage at the same time, but this could be the final one for a few more legends. los angeles clippers forward paul pierce has already said he will retire at the end of this season, while san antonio spurs guard manu ginóbili and dallas mavericks forward dirk nowitzki could call it quits, too.\n\npierce, of course, will be best remembered for his days in boston, where he led the celtics to the 2008 nba title, while ginobili and nowitzki are the rare stars to have spent their entire careers with one team. both ginobili and nowitzki – two of the greatest international talents to ever play the sport – seem likely to return next season. but given their respective ages, an exit is possible at any time, which is why every chance to see them should be cherished.\n\nad\n\nad\n\n4. what comes next in los angeles?\n\nboth tenants at staples center – the los angeles lakers and clippers – are headed for a summer of uncertainty. the lakers are headed for another season at the bottom of the western conference, which could bring about the moment of truth for owner jeanie buss and her brother jim, the team's head of basketball operations. jim buss has said previously he'll resign if the lakers aren't contending after this season (and they won't be). will the owner hold him to that, as she has claimed in the past? no one has a good handle on this, but it's a critical moment for one of the league's flagship franchises.\n\nthen there are the clippers, who seem headed toward a six straight playoff appearance – two more than the franchise managed in its previous 33 years of existence in san diego and los angeles since moving from buffalo in the late 1970s. but with chris paul, blake griffin and j.j. redick all set to be free agents, and with the clippers seemingly headed for a sixth straight exit in the first or second round, there will be no team with more intrigue around it this summer. the most likely path is everyone comes back for another go-round, but that's by no means a sure thing.\n\nad\n\nad\n\n5. coaches and executives on the hot seat\n\none of the annual rites of any sports season is the churn of coaches and front office executives getting hired and fired. this year the nba has a few potential candidates for the ax.\n\nthe list of coaches in trouble is pretty short, given the number of recent hires. the leading candidates at the moment: brett brown with the philadelphia 76ers, who has seen management change and the team remain in rebuilding mode; fred hoiberg with the chicago bulls, whom espn reported last week is under fire with his team struggling; the new orleans pelicans' alvin gentry, who has long been rumored to be in trouble despite basically never having a healthy roster since taking over before last season; and terry stotts, whose portland trail blazers are struggling mightily of late. all of them are more likely than not to return next season, but chances are at least one will be gone – if not someone else – by season's end.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe same situation applies to several executives. rob hennigan with the orlando magic, ernie grunfeld with the washington wizards, dell demps with the pelicans, gar forman with the bulls and buss are all in varying degrees of job insecurity. of those, hennigan and demps are the ones thought to be in the most trouble … but both also are on teams within shouting distance of a playoff spot. all of this makes trying to handicap the futures of all involved difficult, but it'll be something to monitor over the next few months.\n\n6. what will ben simmons look like?\n\nthere have been few prospects hyped as much as ben simmons in recent seasons, as a 6-foot-10 forward with point guard vision and ballhandling skills. then simmons fractured his foot during the first week of training camp, robbing the 76ers of one of their brightest young lights. in his absence, joel embiid has looked fantastic, but the sixers have still missed having a distributor like simmons on the court.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthat opening should be closed soon, as simmons is expected to return sometime in january, allowing philadelphia to spend half a season looking at him and embiid. the potential for the two of them to grow together is why philadelphia has one of the most exciting futures in the league – even if it came after years of losing.\n\n7. how will the new cba begin to impact the league?\n\nfor everything that happened on the court over the past year, the league's off-court activity has been equally impactful. between the massive influx of television money – which helped grease the wheels for durant's departure – and the new collective bargaining agreement going into effect this summer, it remains to be seen how the league will be shaped by both events moving forward.\n\nad\n\nthe new designated player rule could keep westbrook and demarcus cousins – two players expected to leave the thunder and sacramento kings, respectively, in search of better chances to win – to stick around. meanwhile, the ramifications of other parts of the cba will impact how teams build their rosters moving forward. given how much fans focus on the moves their teams potentially could make, this is a story line that might not get a lot of attention now in the middle of the season, but will become something everyone is talking about in june and july.\n\nad\n\n8. who will reap the benefits of the star-studded 2017 draft?\n\nit's a little early to talk about college basketball, but executives around the league are salivating at what looks to be an excellent draft class – especially given how disappointing the 2016 class has been overall thus far.\n\nthe 2017 draft is expected to be dominated by point guards, with draftexpress.com currently featuring four of them – washington's markelle fultz, north carolina state's dennis smith, ucla's lonzo ball and kentucky's malik monk – in the top five and two more, kentucky's de'aaron fox and belgian frank ntilikina, inside the lottery. but there are plenty of toolsy forwards available at the top of the draft as well, including kansas' josh jackson, duke's jayson tatum and harry giles and indiana's og anunoby.
among the most astounding numbers:\n\n1918 – the last time we saw a colder final week and first week of a year in d.c.\n\n12 – the number of consecutive days it was at or below freezing at dulles, a new record.\n\n19 – the average temperature of the first week of january, the fourth-coldest on record for d.c.\n\nand that's just a few.\n\none quick way to visualize how it looks compared to normal and compared to our recent weather is to look at a long-term temperature departure timeline. a glance shows that this latest stretch (on the far right) was much, much colder than normal.\n\nad\n\nother takeaways are the intensities of the departures. in what is largely a sea of red, there are now a number of days in a row of extreme cold. national airport alone recorded daily temperature departures of minus-19 on jan. 5, minus-20 on jan. 6, and minus-20.4 on jan. 7.\n\nad\n\nas you might notice above, we do that kind of departure on the warm side fairly frequently. on the cold side? rarely.\n\nfor the d.c. region, the story of this cross-year arctic onslaught is focused on longevity, but the depths of the cold were also impressive.\n\nconsider again that the two-week stretch from christmas through jan. 7 was the fifth-coldest two-week year-change overlap on record in d.c. it's the second-coldest on record for baltimore, and the coldest at dulles. it was a similar story all around us.\n\nwhile compiling notable numbers for this post, i came to the conclusion that there may be too many to count. below are some of the most eye-popping locally, and i am sure i have missed plenty.\n\nad\n\ndaily records\n\nas cwg's justin grieser pointed out a few years ago, d.c. warm records are vastly outpacing cold records . getting any cold records often seems like a huge deal. we pulled a number out of the hat this stretch:\n\nad\n\ndulles (where records begin in 1963) set record-low maximum temperatures on dec. 28 with 23, jan. 1 at 23, jan. 5 when it reached 19, and jan. 6 with a high of 19. baltimore (where records date to 1872) tied a low max for dec. 28 at 24. d.c. (since 1872) tied its coldest max at national airport (since the mid-1940s) for that same date of 25.\n\nbaltimore recorded a record low of 10 on dec. 28, and it reached 1 on jan. 7, which also set a record low for that date. dulles reached record-low temperatures on jan. 3 with 1, and jan. 7 at minus-1.\n\nd.c. didn't set any record lows, but the low of 8 on jan. 7 was the coldest since 5 on feb. 20, 2015. prior to 2014 and 2015 , national had not reached the single digits since 2009.\n\nlengthy cold streaks\n\nin addition to the aforementioned coldest final week plus first week of a year since 1918, here are some other key local tidbits about the longevity of this cold wave:\n\nd.c.'s run of 12 days at or below 35 degrees is the sixth-longest on record . it's also the longest at-or-below freezing streak since february 1961. further, the consecutive lows at or below 16 is the fifth-longest streak on record at eight days\n\ndulles set a record for the longest stretch at or below freezing, with 12 days. the below-freezing weather stretched well into the 13 th day before rising above freezing in the evening. this record beats prior ones by more than two days.\n\nbaltimore's 12 days in a row of 33 or lower ties for the third-longest streak in its long-term record. only two are longer: 14 days ending feb. 18, 1979, and 15 finishing feb. 2, 1966.\n\nmore trivia to impress your friends\n\nthe high of 23 on dec. 31 in d.c. was the coldest high temperature in the month for the city since dec. 24, 1989, when it was also 23.\n\nfour days with lows in the teens are the most in december since seven in 2000. the 12 days with lows in the teens or lower for the final 10 days of december and first 10 days of february are the fourth-most on record for that period, and this is the first time it has happened since january 1918.\n\njan. 5-7 was the first time with consecutive days of 21 degrees or less for highs in d.c. since feb. 3-5, 1996, when there were three such days in a row. interestingly enough, that was also a la niña winter.\n\ncanaan valley, just 125 miles west of d.c., reached minus-24 on jan. 7. the average low temperature for the first week of january was minus-10 there. (h/t former nws climatologist robert leffler.)\n\nnow we mild up, at least briefly. even in the coldest winters there is often a january thaw. it might not always come in january, but it is hard to sustain punishing winter weather for an entire winter. as weather watchers know, it rarely stays the same for long.\n\nthe pattern that helped bring us this big blast of cold is one that tends to repeat itself. i'm no long-range forecaster, but i'd wager it's a wise idea to enjoy the warmth we get and brace for more winter before it eventually gives way to spring.
a five-time all-star guard, mr. westphal played in the nba from 1972 to 1984. after winning a championship with the celtics, he made the finals in 1976 with phoenix, where he was a key part of one of the most riveting games in league history. he also played for seattle and the new york knicks.\n\nhe averaged 15.6 points, 4.4 assists and 1.9 rebounds during his career. he had a career-high average of 25.2 points per game in 1977-78.\n\nad\n\nafter his playing career ended, mr. westphal moved into coaching. he led the suns to the nba finals in 1993 and also was head coach at seattle and sacramento. he had stints as an assistant with dallas and brooklyn.\n\nad\n\nthere may be just a handful of people who have as much influence and significance on the history of the phoenix suns, former team owner jerry colangelo said.\n\nat the college level, mr. westphal coached at southwestern baptist bible college (now arizona christian university), grand canyon and pepperdine.\n\nhe played at usc from 1968 to 1972, leading the trojans to a 24-2 record in 1971. the following year, he was an all-american and team captain who led the team in scoring with a 20.3 average.\n\nad\n\npaul douglas westphal was born nov. 30, 1950, in torrance, calif.\n\nhe was drafted 10th overall in the first round of the 1972 nba draft by the celtics. the 6-foot-4 guard spent three seasons in boston before being traded to phoenix.\n\nin 1976, mr. westphal helped the suns reach their first nba finals against the celtics. game 5, a triple-overtime thriller in that series, is often called the greatest game ever played.\n\nad\n\nthe suns trailed 94-91 in the closing seconds of regulation when mr. westphal stole the ball from jojo white and got fouled. his 3-point play tied the game at 94.\n\nin the second overtime, with 15 seconds left and the suns trailing 109-108, mr. westphal stole the ball from john havlicek, who had taken an inbounds pass. that led to a sequence in which the suns scored to take a 110-109 lead.\n\nad\n\nhavlicek scored with five seconds left to put the celtics ahead 111-110. the buzzer sounded and celtics flooded the court, believing their team had won. however, the referee ruled that havlicek scored with two seconds remaining.\n\none second was put back on the clock. mr. westphal called for a timeout that the suns didn't have, resulting in a technical foul. the celtics made the free throw for a 112-110 lead. after a timeout, the suns inbounded at midcourt and scored to force a third overtime.\n\nad\n\nwith 20 seconds left and the celtics leading 128-122, mr. westphal made two quick baskets to cut the score to 128-126. he nearly stole the ball at midcourt, but he failed and the celtics ran out the clock to win.\n\nad\n\nthe suns later retired his no. 44 jersey.\n\nmr. westphal returned to the suns as an assistant in 1988.\n\nhe led by example, said eddie johnson, 1989 sixth man of the year. he didn't change off of the court. it's just a positive atmosphere that he exudes when he's around.\n\nmr. westphal was inducted into the college basketball hall of fame in 2018 and into the naismith memorial basketball hall of fame as a player in 2019.\n\nsurvivors include his wife, cindy, and two children.\n\n— associated press
carolyn hax is away. the following originally appeared sept. 11 and 16, 2005.\n\ndear carolyn: this may seem like an odd question, but if someone doesn't like an aspect of your personality, how would you know when you're in the wrong as opposed to someone just not liking that aspect for their own reasons?\n\nnew york, n.y.\n\nnew york, n.y.: great question. odd answer:\n\nyou'd think it would be a matter of right and wrong. should you change this aspect of your personality, because it's somehow bad, or is it good and fine and merely annoying to one person?\n\nbut should takes a distant third place, to want to and can. is this a part of your personality you want to change? if not, then your critic gets to love it or leave it.\n\nand even if you do want to change it, can you? if you're, say, a worrywart, and your friend/mate/sibling/colleague hates that you're a worrywart, and you also wish you could stop worrying, then you could probably learn a few techniques to lessen your stress.\n\nbut you will never become anything approaching laid-back, and so it would be wrong to keep fighting this aspect of your personality and wrong for critics to pressure you to.\n\nyour best chance of finding peace with others is to make some peace with yourself, by accepting a less-than-perfect aspect of your personality, making the best use of it, being careful not to take it out on others, using all this as a way to like your less-than-perfect self — and then letting your critics love it or leave it from there.\n\ndear carolyn: i'm not sure how to set effective boundaries with my in-laws. my husband and i are newlyweds. when last we visited them, they showed a family digital slide show. mixed in were pictures of a woman my husband had been in a relationship with (over 10 years ago). i left the room after several oops, we should have sorted these before we showed them to you and more pictures.\n\nthe mother's defense was, well, it is his history. i talked to my husband, who later that evening explained to them that neither of us wants to see these pictures.\n\nwell, there were apologies, and we felt we made real progress in our relationship with them — respect established.\n\nuntil the next night, when again several pictures happened to pop up of another ex. at this point i said calmly, i am not going to watch this and removed myself from the room.\n\ni feel unaccepted by them and am not sure if this is just poor insight, judgment and taste on their part or if this is blatant disrespect.\n\nm.\n\nm.: respect established? nothing like sharing a bucket of grins with the in-laws.\n\nit's not your boundaries that need toughening, it's your skin.\n\nyou've given me two choices, between declaring your in-laws thoughtless or declaring them outright hostile to you.\n\ni strongly recommend you give yourself a third choice: that they're regular people with a lot of life behind them and a commensurate photographic record that they, oops, didn't get around to updating.\n\nor a fourth choice, that they're people with a view of former loves that differs vastly from yours. maybe to them it's their son's life story, no more, no less, no harm intended.\n\nboth mean it's possible that showing these pictures was no reflection on, or statement about, you.\n\nand if that was the case, then your protest didn't establish respect, it established that you feel threatened, insecure, so afraid you won't be accepted that you're afraid to laugh at yourself.\n\nor: their apologies make this unlikely, but maybe you're right that they left those photos in on purpose.\n\nif that was the case, then your protest didn't establish respect. it established that they'd won. they'd gotten to you.\n\nregardless of their intent, their son married you, not these other women. stop trying to prove what plainly already is. let them worry about what they accept and why. what your in-laws think and do have no bearing on who you are.\n\nknow that, and then use it, either to make light of the old girlfriend thing — hey, you said there was no one until you met me!!! — or, if it's the best you can do, to get through it with something resembling perspective. a few raindrops don't bother a rock.\n\ndear carolyn: why is it so hard just to end a crappy relationship? seriously.\n\ni feel like i should be smarter than this\n\ni feel like i should be smarter than this: because you sought out this crappy relationship for a reason — you got something out of it and are still getting something out of it. something maybe you don't even know you need.\n\nfind the need, find the source and fix it. then the only obstacle to getting out is getting through the unabridged edition of hell that all breakups turn out to be.

?blablabla1234565.?\n\nkozachek developed, customized, and monitored x-agent malware used to hack the\n\nand dnc networks beginning in or around april 2016.\n\n16. defendant pavel vyacheslavovich yershov (eprnoa banecnasosna)\n\nwas a russian military of?cer assigned to department within unit 26165. in or\n\naround 2016, . yershov assisted kozachek and other co-conspirators in testing and\n\ncustomizing x-agent malware before actual deployment and use.\n\n17. defendant artem andreyevich malyshev annpeenntr) was\n\na second lieutenant in the russian military assigned to department within unit\n\n26165. malyshev used a variety of monikers, including ?dj an gomagicdev? and ?realblatr.? in\n\nor around 2016, malyshev monitored x-agent malware implanted on the and dnc\n\nnetworks.\n\n18. defendant aleksandr vladimjrovich osadchuk (ocanayx anerccannp\n\nwas a colonel in the russian military and the commanding of?cer of unit 7 445 5 .\n\nunit 74455 was located at 22 kirova street, khimki, moscow, a building referred to within the\n\ngru as the ?tower.? unit 74455 assisted in the release of stolen documents through the dcleaks\n\nand guccifer 2.0 personas, the promotion of those releases, and the publication of anti-clinton\n\ncontent on social media accounts operated by the gru.\n\n19. defendant aleksey aleksandrovich potemkjn (?oremknn anerccefi\n\nwas an of?cer in the russian military assigned to unit 7445 5. potemkin was\n\na supervisor in a department within unit 7445 5 responsible for the administration of computer\n\ninfrastructure used in cyber operations. infrastructure and social media accounts administered by\n\ndepartment were used, among other things, to assist in the release of stolen\n\ndocuments through the dcleaks and guccifer 2.0 personas.\n\nobiect of the conspiracv\n\n20. the object of the conspiracy was to hack into the computers of u.s. persons and entities\n\ninvolved in the 2016 u.s. presidential election, steal documents from those computers, and stage\n\nreleases of the stolen documents to interfere with the 2016 u.s. presidential election.\n\nmanner and means of the conspiracv\n\nsnearphishing operations\n\n21. antonov, badin, yermakov, lukashev, and their co-conspirators targeted\n\nvictims using a technique known as spearphishing to steal victims? passwords or otherwise gain\n\naccess to their computers. beginning by at least march 2016, the conspirators targeted over 300\n\nindividuals af?liated with the clinton campaign, and dnc.\n\na. for example, on or about march 19, 2016, lukashev and his co?conspirators\n\ncreated and sent a spearphishing email to the chairman of the clinton campaign.\n\nlukashev used the account ?john356g at an online service that abbreviated\n\nwebsite addresses (referred to as a ?url-shortening service?).\n\nlukashev used the account to mask a link contained in the spearphishin email,\n\nwhich directed the recipient to a gru?created website. lukashev altered the\n\nappearance of the sender email address in order to make it look like the email was\n\na security noti?cation from google (a technique known as ?spoo?ng?), instructing\n\nthe user to change his password by clicking the embedded link. those instructions\n\nwere followed. on or about march 21, 2016, lukashev, yermakov, and\n\ntheir co-conspirators stole the contents of the chairman?s email account, which\n\nconsisted of over 50,000 emails.\n\nb. starting on or about march 19, 2016, lukashev and his co?conspirators sent\n\nspearphishing emails to the personal accounts of other individuals af?liated with\n\nthe clinton campaign, including its campaign manager and a senior foreign policy\n\nadviser. on or about march 25, 2016, lukashev used the same john356gh\n\naccount to mask additional links included in spearphishing emails sent to numerous\n\nindividuals af?liated with the clinton campaign, including victims and 2.\n\nlukashev sent these emails from the russia-based email account\n\nhi.mymail@yandex.com that he spoofed to appear to be from google.\n\n0. on or about march 28, 2016, yermakov researched the names of victims and\n\n2 and their association with clinton on various social media sites. through their\n\nspearphishing operations, lukasi-iev, yermakov, and their co-conspirators\n\nsuccessfully stole email credentials and thousands of emails from numerous\n\nindividuals af?liated with the clinton campaign. many of these stolen emails,\n\nincluding those from victims and 2, were later released by the conspirators\n\nthrough dcleaks.\n\nd. on or about april 6, 2016, the conspirators created an email account in the name\n\n(with a one-letter deviation from the actual spelling) of a known member of the\n\nclinton campaign. the conspirators then used that account to send spearphishing\n\nemails to the work accounts of more than thirty different clinton campaign\n\nemployees. in the spearphishing emails, lukashev and his co-conspirators\n\nembedded a link purporting to direct the recipient to a document titled ?hillary?\n\nin fact, this link directed the recipients? computers\n\nto a gru?created website.\n\n22. the conspirators spearphished individuals af?liated with the clinton campaign\n\nthroughout the summer of 2016. for example, on or about july 27, 2016, the conspirators\n\nattempted after hours to spearphish for the ?rst time email accounts at a domain hosted by a third-\n\nparty provider and used by clinton?s personal of?ce. at or around the same time, they also\n\ntargeted seventy-six email addresses at the domain for the clinton campaign.\n\nhacking into the network\n\n23. beginning in or around march 2016, the conspirators, in addition to their spearphishing\n\nefforts, researched the and dnc computer networks to identify technical speci?cations and\n\nvulnerabilities.\n\nfor example, beginning on or about march 15, 2016, yermakov ran a technical\n\nquery for the internet protocol con?gurations to identify connected devices.\n\n011 or about the same day, yermakov searched for open-source information\n\nabout the dnc network, the democratic party, and hillary clinton.\n\non or about april 7, 2016, yermakov ran a technical query for the\n\ninternet protocol con?gurations to identify connected devices.\n\n24. by in or around april 2016, within days of searches regarding the\n\nthe conspirators hacked into the computer network. once they gained access, they\n\ninstalled and managed different types of malware to explore the network and steal data.\n\na.\n\non or about april 12, 2016, the conspirators used the stolen credentials of a\n\nemployee employee to access the network.\n\nemployee 1 had received a spearphishing email from the conspirators on or about\n\napril 6, 2016, and entered her password after clicking on the link.\n\nbetween in or around april 2016 and june 2016, the conspirators installed multiple\n\nversions of their x-agent malware on at least ten computers, which allowed\n\nthem to monitor individual employees? computer activity, steal passwords, and\n\nmaintain access to the network.\n\nc. x-agent malware implanted on the network transmitted information from\n\nthe victims? computers to a gru-leased server located in arizona. the\n\nconspirators referred to this server as their panel. kozachek,\n\nmalyshev, and their co-conspirators logged into the ams panel to use\n\nx?agent?s keylog and screenshot functions in the course of monitoring and\n\nsurveilling activity on the computers. the keylog function allowed the\n\nconspirators to capture keystrokes entered by employees. the screenshot\n\nfunction allowed the conspirators to take pictures of the employees?\n\ncomputer screens.\n\n- d. for example, on or about april 14, 2016, the conspirators repeatedly activated\n\nx-agent?s keylog and screenshot functions to surveil employee 1?s\n\ncomputer activity over the course of eight hours. during that time, the conspirators\n\ncaptured employee 1?s communications with co-workers and the passwords\n\nshe entered while working on fundraising and voter outreach projects. similarly,\n\non or about april 22, 2016, the conspirators activated x-agent?s keylog and\n\nscreenshot functions to capture the discussions of another employee\n\nemployee about the ?nances, as well as her individual\n\nbanking information and other personal topics.\n\n25. on or about april 19, 2016, kozachek, yershov, and their co-conspirators remotely\n\ncon?gured an overseas computer to relay communications between x-agent malware and the\n\nams panel and then tested x-agent?s ability to connect to this computer. the conspirators\n\nreferred to this computer as a ?middle server.? the middle server acted as a proxy to obscure the\n\nconnection between malware at the and the conspirators? ams panel. on or about april\n\n20, 2016, the conspirators directed x-agent malware on the computers to connect to this\n\nmiddle server and receive directions from the conspirators.\n\nhacking into the dnc network\n\n26. on or about april 18, 2016, the conspirators hacked into the computers through\n\ntheir access to the network. the conspirators then installed and managed different types\n\nof malware (as they did in the network) to explore the dnc network and steal documents.\n\na. on or about april 18, 2016, the conspirators activated x-agent?s keylog and\n\nscreenshot functions to steal credentials of a employee who was authorized\n\nto access the dnc network. the conspirators hacked into the dnc network from\n\nthe network using stolen credentials. by in or around june 2016, they\n\ngained access to approximately thirty?three dnc computers.\n\nb. in or around april 2016, the conspirators installed x-agent malware on the dnc\n\nnetwork, including the same versions installed on the network.\n\nmalyshev and his co-conspirators monitored the x-agent malware from the\n\nams panel and captured data from the victim computers. the ams panel collected\n\nthousands of keylo and screenshot results from the and dnc computers,\n\nsuch as a screenshot and keystroke capture of employee 2 viewing the\n\nonline banking information.\n\ntheft of and dnc documents\n\n27. the conspirators searched for and identi?ed computers within the and dnc\n\nnetworks that stored information related to the 2016 us. presidential election. for example, on\n\nor about april 15, 2016, the conspirators searched one hacked computer for terms that\n\nincluded ?hillary,? ?cruz,? and ?trump.? the conspirators also copied select folders,\n\nincluding ?benghazi investigations.? the conspirators targeted computers containing information\n\n10\n\nsuch as opposition research and ?eld operation plans for the 2016 elections.\n\n28. to enable them to steal a large number of documents at once without detection, the\n\nconspirators used a publicly available tool to gather and compress multiple documents on the\n\nand dnc networks. the conspirators then used other gru malware, known as\n\n?x-tunnel,? to move the stolen documents outside the and dnc networks through\n\nchannels.\n\na. for example, on or about april 22, 2016, the conspirators compressed gigabytes\n\nof data from dnc computers, including opposition research. the conspirators\n\nlater moved the compressed dnc data using x-tunnel to a gru-leased computer\n\nlocated in illinois.\n\nb. on or about april 28, 2016, the conspirators connected to and tested the same\n\ncomputer located in illinois. later that day, the conspirators used x?tunnel to\n\nconnect to that computer to steal additional documents from the network.\n\n29. between on or about may 25, 2016 and june 1, 2016, the conspirators hacked the dnc\n\nmicroso? exchange server and stole thousands of emails from the work accounts of dnc\n\nemployees. during that time, yermakov researched powershell commands related to\n\naccessing and managing the microsoft exchange server.\n\n30. on or about may 30, 2016, 1v1alyshev accessed the ams panel in order to upgrade\n\ncustom ams software on the server. that day, the ams panel received updates from\n\napproximately thirteen different x-agent malware implants on and dnc computers.\n\n31. during the hacking of the and dnc networks, the conspirators covered their tracks\n\nby intentionally deleting logs and computer ?les. for example, on or about may 13, 2016, the\n\nconspirators cleared the event logs from a dnc computer. on or about june 20, 2016, the\n\n11\n\nconspirators deleted logs from the ams panel that documented their activities on the panel,\n\nincluding the login history.\n\nefforts to remain on the and dnc networks\n\n32. despite the conspirators? efforts to hide their activity, beginning in or around may 2016,\n\nboth the and dnc became aware that they had been hacked and hired a security company\n\n(?company to identify the extent of the intrusions. by in or around june 2016, company 1\n\ntook steps to exclude intruders from the networks. despite these efforts, a linux?based version of\n\nx?agent, programmed to communicate with the gru?registered domain remained\n\non the dnc network until in or around october 2016.\n\n33. in response to company 1?s efforts, the conspirators took countermeasures to maintain\n\naccess to the and dnc networks.\n\na.\n\non or about may 31, 2016, yermakov searched for open~source information\n\nabout company 1 and its reporting on x-agent and x-tunnel. on or about june\n\n1, 2016, the conspirators attempted to delete traces of their presence on the\n\nnetwork using the computer program ccleaner.\n\non or about june 14, 2016, the conspirators registered the domain actblues.com,\n\nwhich mimicked the domain of a political fundraising platform that included a\n\ndonations page. shortly thereafter, the conspirators used stolen\n\ncredentials to modify the website and redirect visitors to the actbluescom\n\ndomain.\n\non or about june 20, 2016, after company 1 had disabled x-agent on the\n\nnetwork, the conspirators spent over seven hours unsuccessfully trying to connect\n\nto x-agent. the conspirators also tried to access the network using\n\npreviously stolen credentials.\n\nl2\n\n34. in or around september 2016, the conspirators also successfully gained access to dnc\n\ncomputers hosted on a third-party cloud-computing service. these computers contained test\n\napplications related to the analytics. after conducting reconnaissance, the conspirators\n\ngathered data by creating backups, or ?snapshots,? of the cloud-based systems using the\n\ncloud provider?s own technology. the conspirators then moved the snapshots to cloud-based\n\naccounts they had registered with the same service, thereby stealing the data from the dnc.\n\nstolen documents released through dcleaks\n\n35. more than a month before the release of any documents, the conspirators constructed the\n\nonline persona dcleaks to release and publicize stolen election-related documents. on or about\n\napril 19, 2016, after attempting to register the domain electionleaks.com, the conspirators\n\nregistered the domain dcleaks.com through a service that anonymized the registrant. the funds\n\nused to pay for the dcleaks.com domain originated from an account at an online\n\nservice that the conspirators also used to fund the lease of a virtual private server registered with\n\nthe operational email account dirbinsaabol@mai1.com. the dirbinsaabol email account was also\n\nused to'register the john356gh url-shortening account used by lukashev to spearphish the\n\nclinton campaign chairman and other campaign-related individuals.\n\n36. on or about june 8, 2016, the conspirators launched the public website dcleaks.com, which\n\nthey used to release stolen emails. before it shut down in or around march 2017, the site received\n\nover one million page views. the conspirators falsely claimed on the site that dcleaks was\n\nstarted by a group of ?american hacktivists,? when in fact it was started by the conspirators.\n\n37. starting in or around june 2016 and continuing through the 2016 us. presidential election,\n\nthe conspirators used dcleaks to release emails stolen from individuals affiliated with the clinton\n\ncampaign. the conspirators also released documents they had stolen in other spearphishing\n\noperations, including those they had conducted in 2015 that collected emails from individuals\n\n13\n\naf?liated with the republican party.\n\n38. on or about june 8, 2016, and at approximately the same time that the dcleakscom website\n\nwas launched, the conspirators created a dcleaks facebook page using a preexisting social media\n\naccount under the ?ctitious name ?alice donovan.? in addition to the dcleaks acebook page,\n\nthe conspirators used other social media accounts in the names of ?ctitious u.s. persons such as\n\n?jason scott? and ?richard gingrey? to promote the dcleaks website. the conspirators accessed\n\nthese accounts from computers managed by potemkin and his co?conspirators.\n\n39. on or about june 8, 2016, the conspirators created the twitter account @dcleaksw. the\n\nconspirators operated the @dcleaks_ twitter account from the same computer used for other\n\nefforts to interfere with the 2016 u.s. presidential election. for example, the conspirators used\n\nthe same computer to operate the twitter account @baltimoreiswhr, through which they\n\nencouraged u.s. audiences to ?[i]oin our flash mob? opposing clinton and to post images with the\n\nhashtag #blacksagainsthillary.\n\nstolen documents released through guccifer 2.0\n\n40. on or about june 14, 2016, the company lupublicly announced that it\n\nhad been hacked by russian government actors. in response, the conspirators created the online\n\npersona guccifer 2.0 and falsely claimed to be a lone romanian hacker to undermine the\n\nallegations of russian responsibility for the intrusion.\n\n41. on or about june 15, 2016, the conspirators logged into a moscow-based server used and\n\nmanaged by unit 74455 and, between 4:19 pm and 4:56 pm moscow standard time, searched\n\nfor certain words and phrases, including:\n\n14\n\n5' . -\n\n?some hundred sheets?\n\n?some hundreds of sheets?\n\ndcleaks\n\nilluminati\n\nmnpono useec'rnm? nepeaon\n\n[widely known translation]\n\n?worldwide known?\n\n?think twice about?\n\n?company?s competence?\n\n42. later that day, at 7:02 pm moscow standard time, the online persona guccifer 2.0\n\npublished its ?rst post on a blog site created through wordpress. titled servers hacked\n\nby a lone hacker,? the post used numerous english words and phrases that the conspirators had\n\nsearched for earlier that day (bolded below):\n\nworldwide known cyber security company [company 1] announced that\n\nthe democratic national committee (dnc) servers had been hacked by\n\n?sophisticated? hacker groups.\n\ni?m very pleased the company appreciated my skills so .\n\nhere are just a few does from many thousands i extracted when hacking\n\ninto network. .\n\nsome hundred sheets! this?s a serious case, isn?t it? .\n\ni guess [company 1] customers should think twice about company?s\n\ncompetence.\n\nthe illuminati and their\n\n43. between in or around june 2016 and october 2016, the conspirators used guccifer 2.0 to\n\nrelease documents through wordpress that they had stolen from the and dnc. the\n\nconspirators, posing as guccifer 2.0, also shared stolen documents with certain individuals.\n\na. on or about august 15, 2016, the conspirators, posing as guccifer 2.0, received a\n\n15\n\nrequest for stolen documents from a candidate for the u.s. congress. the\n\nconspirators responded using the guccifer 2.0 persona and sent the candidate\n\nstolen documents related to the candidate?s opponent.\n\nb. on or about august 22, 2016, the conspirators, posing as guccifer 2.0, transferred\n\napproximately 2.5 gigabytes of data stolen from the to a then-registered state\n\nlobbyist and online source of political news. the stolen data included donor records\n\nand personal identifying information for more than 2,000 democratic donors.\n\n0. on or about august 22, 2016, the conspirators, posing as guccifer 2.0, sent a\n\nreporter stolen documents pertaining to the black lives matter movement. the\n\nreporter responded by discussing when to release the documents and offering to\n\nwrite an alticle about their release.\n\n44. the conspirators, posing as guccifer 2.0, also communicated with us. persons about the\n\nrelease of stolen documents. on or about august 15, 2016, the conspirators, posing as guccifer\n\n2.0, wrote to a person who was in regular contact with senior members of the presidential campaign\n\nof donald j. trump, ?thank for writing back . . . do ?nd anyt[h]ing interesting in the docs i\n\nposted?? on or about august 17, 2016, the conspirators added, ?please tell me if i can help\n\nanyhow . . . it would be a great pleasure to me.? on or about september 9, 2016, the conspirators,\n\nagain posing as guccifer 2.0, referred to a stolen document posted online and asked the\n\nperson, ?what do think of the info on the turnout model for the democrats entire presidential\n\ncampaign.? the person responded, ?[p]retty standard.?\n\n45. the conspirators conducted operations as guccifer 2.0 and dcleaks using overlapping\n\ncomputer infrastructure and financing.\n\na. for example, between on or about march 14, 2016 and april 28, 2016, the\n\n16\n\nconspirators used the same pool of bitcoin funds to purchase a virtual private\n\nnetwork account and to lease a server in malaysia. in or around june\n\n2016, the conspirators used the malaysian server to host the dcleaks.com website.\n\non or about july 6, 2016, the conspirators used the vpn to log into the\n\n@guccifer_2 twitter account. the conspirators opened that vpn account from\n\nthe same server that was also used to register malicious domains for the hacking of\n\nthe and dnc networks.\n\nb. on or about june 27, 2016, the conspirators, posing as guccifer 2.0, contacted a\n\nu.s. reporter with an offer to provide stolen emails from ?hillary clinton?s staff.?\n\nthe conspirators then sent the reporter the password to access a nonpublic,\n\npassword-protected portion of dcleaks.com containing emails stolen from victim\n\nby lukashev, yermakov, and their co-conspirators in or around march\n\n2016. i\n\n46. on or about january 12, 2017, the conspirators published a statement on the guccifer 2.0\n\nwordpress blog, falsely claiming that the intrusions and release of stolen documents had ?totally\n\nno relation to the russian government.?\n\nuse of organization 1\n\n47. in order to expand their interference in the 2016 u.s. presidential election, the conspirators\n\ntransferred many of the documents they stole from the dnc and the chairman of the clinton\n\ncampaign to organization 1. the conspirators, posing as guccifer 2.0, discussed the release of\n\nthe stolen documents and the timing of those releases with organization 1 to heighten their impact\n\non the 2016 u.s. presidential election.\n\na. on or about june 22, 2016, organization i sent a private message to guccifer 2.0\n\nto ?[s]end any new material [stolen from the here for us to review and it will\n\n17\n\nhave a much higher impact than what you are doing.? on or about july 6, 2016,\n\norganization 1 added, ?if you have anything hillary related we want it in the next\n\ntweo [sic] days prefable [sic] because the dnc [democratic national convention]\n\nis approaching and she will solidify bernie supporters behind her after.? the\n\nconspirators responded, ?0k . . . i see.? organization 1 explained, ?we think trump\n\nhas only a 25% chance of winning against hillary . . . so con?ict between bernie\n\nand hillary is interesting.?\n\nb. after failed attempts to transfer the stolen documents starting in late june 2016, on\n\nor about july 14, 2016, the conspirators, posing as guccifer 2.0, sent\n\norganization 1 an email with an attachment titled ?wk linkl.txt.gpg.? the\n\nconspirators explained to organization 1 that the ?le contained\n\ninstructions on how to access an online archive of stolen dnc documents. on or\n\nabout july 18, 2016, organization 1 con?rmed it had ?the le or so archive? and\n\nwould make a release of the stolen documents ?this week.?\n\n48. on or about july 22, 2016, organization 1 released over 20,000 emails and other\n\ndocuments stolen from the dnc network by the conspirators. this release occurred\n\napproximately three days before the start of the democratic national convention. organization 1\n\ndid not disclose guccifer 2.0?s role in providing them. the latest-in?time email released through\n\norganization 1 was dated on or about may 25, 2016, approximately the same day the conspirators\n\nhacked the dnc microsoft exchange server.\n\n49. on or about october 7, 2016, organization 1 released the ?rst set of emails from the\n\nchairman of the clinton campaign that had been stolen by lukashev and his co~conspirators.\n\nbetween on or about october 7, 2016 and november 7, 2016, organization 1 released\n\n18\n\napproximately thirty-three tranches of documents that had been stolen from the chairman of the\n\nclinton campaign. in total, over 50,000 stolen documents were released.\n\nstatutory allegations\n\n50. paragraphs 1 through 49 of this indictment are re?alleged and incorporated by reference as\n\nif fully set forth herein.\n\n51. from at least in or around march 2016 through november 2016, in the district of columbia\n\nand elsewhere, defendants antonov, yermakov, lukashev,\n\nmorgaci-iev, kozachek, yershov, malyshev, osadchuk, and potemkjn,\n\ntogether with others known and unknown to the grand jury, knowingly and intentionally conspired\n\nto commit offenses against the united states, namely:\n\na. to knowingly access a

if fully set forth herein.\n\n57. to facilitate the purchase of infrastructure used in their hacking activity?including hacking\n\ninto the computers of u.s. persons and entities involved in the 2016 u.s. presidential election and\n\nreleasing the stolen documents?the defendants conspired to launder the equivalent of more than\n\n$95,000 through a web of transactions structured to capitalize on the perceived anonymity of\n\nsuch as bitcoin.\n\n58. although the conspirators caused transactions to be conducted in a variety of currencies,\n\nincluding u.s. dollars, they principally used bitcoin when purchasing servers, registering domains,\n\nand otherwise making payments in furtherance of hacking activity. many of these payments were\n\n21\n\nprocessed by companies located in the united states that provided payment processing services to\n\nhosting companies, domain registrars, and other vendors both international and domestic. the use\n\nof bitcoin allowed the conspirators to avoid direct relationships with traditional ?nancial\n\ninstitutions, allowing them to evade greater scrutiny of their identities and sources of funds.\n\n59. all bitcoin transactions are added to a public ledger called the blockchain, but the\n\nblockchain identi?es the parties to each transaction only by alpha?numeric identi?ers known as\n\nbitcoin addresses. to further avoid creating a centralized paper trail of all of their purchases, the\n\nconspirators purchased infrastructure using hundreds of different email accounts, in some cases\n\nusing a new account for each purchase. the conspirators used ?ctitious names and addresses in\n\norder to obscure their identities and their links to russia and the russian government. for\n\nexample, the dcleaks.com domain was registered and paid for using the ?ctitious name ?carrie\n\nfeehan? and an address in new york. in some cases, as part of the payment process, the\n\nconspirators provided vendors with nonsensical addresses such as ?usa denver ?g?igh\n\nghihgfh and ?l 2 district of columbia.?\n\n60. the conspirators used several dedicated email accounts to track basic bitcoin transaction\n\ninformation and to facilitate bitcoin payments to vendors. one of these dedicated accounts,\n\nregistered with the username ?gfadel47,? received hundreds of bitcoin payment requests from\n\napproximately 100 different email accounts. for example, on or about february 1, 2016, the\n\ngfadel47 account received the instruction to ?[p]lease send exactly 0.026043 bitcoin to? a certain\n\nthirty-four character bitcoin address. shortly thereafter, a transaction matching those exact\n\ninstructions was added to the blockchain.\n\n61. on occasion, the conspirators facilitated bitcoin payments using the same computers that\n\nthey used to conduct their hacking activity, including to create and send test spearphishing emails.\n\n22\n\nadditionally, one of these dedicated accounts was used by the conspirators in or around 2015 to\n\nrenew the registration of a domain encoded in certain x?agent malware installed\n\non the dnc network. i\n\n62. the conspirators funded the purchase of computer infrastructure for their hacking activity\n\nin part by ?mining? bitcoin. individuals and entities can mine bitcoin by allowing their computing\n\npower to be used to verify and record payments on the bitcoin public ledger, a service for which\n\nthey are rewarded with freshly?minted bitcoin. the pool of bitcoin generated from the\n\nmining activity was used, for example, to pay a romanian company to register the domain\n\ndcleaks.com through a payment processing company located in the united states.\n\n63. in addition to mining bitcoin, the conspirators acquired bitcoin through a variety of means\n\ndesigned to obscure the origin of the funds. this included purchasing bitco in through peer-to-peer\n\nexchanges, moving funds through other digital currencies, and using pre-paid cards. they also\n\nenlisted the assistance of one or more third-party exchangers who facilitated layered transactions\n\nthrough digital currency exchange platforms providing heightened anonymity.\n\n64. the conspirators used the same funding structure?end in some cases, the very same pool\n\nof funds?to purchase key accounts, servers, and domains used in their election-related hacking\n\nactivity.\n\na. the bitcoin mining operation that funded the registration payment for dcleaks.com\n\nalso sent newly-minted bitcoin to a bitcoin address controlled by ?daniel farell,?\n\nthe persona that was used to renew the domain the bitcoin mining\n\noperation also funded, through the same bitcoin address, the purchase of servers\n\nand domains used in the spearphishing operations, including accounts-\n\nqooqle.com and\n\n23\n\nb. on or about march 14, 2016, using funds in a bitcoin address, the conspirators\n\npurchased a vpn account, which they later used to log into the @guccifer_2\n\ntwitter account. the remaining funds from that bitcoin address were then used on\n\nor about april 28, 2016, to lease a malaysian server that hosted the dcleaks.com\n\nwebsite.\n\n0. the conspirators used a different set of ?ctitious names (including ?ward\n\ndeclaur? and ?mike long?) to send bitcoin to a company in order to lease a\n\nserver used to administer x-tunnel malware implanted on the and dnc\n\nnetworks, and to lease two servers used to hack the cloud network.\n\nstatutorv allegations\n\n65. from at least in or around 2015 through 2016, within the district of columbia and\n\nelsewhere, defendants

or around june 2016, kovalev and his co?conspirators researched domains used by\n\nus. state boards of elections, secretaries of state, and other election-related entities for website\n\nvulnerabilities. kovalev and his co-conspirators also searched for state political party email\n\naddresses, including ?ltered queries for email addresses listed on state republican party websites.\n\n25\n\n72. in or around july 2016, kovalev and his co-conspirators hacked the website of a state\n\nboard of elections and stole information related to approximately 500,000 voters,\n\nincluding names, addresses, partial social security numbers, dates of birth, and driver?s license\n\nnumbers.\n\n73. in or around august 2016, kovalev and his co-conspirators hacked into the computers\n\nof a u.s. vendor (?vendor that supplied software used to verify voter registration information\n\nfor the 2016 u.s. elections. kovalev and his co-conspirators used some of the same\n\ninfrastructure to hack into vendor 1 that they had used to hack into sboe 1.\n\n74. in or around august 2016, the federal bureau of investigation issued an alert about the\n\nhacking of sboe 1 and identi?ed some of the infrastructure that was used to conduct the hacking.\n\nin response, kovalev deleted his search history. kovalev and his co-conspirators also\n\ndeleted records from accounts used in their operations targeting state boards of elections and\n\nsimilar election-related entities.\n\n75. in or around october 2016, kovalev and his co-conspirators further targeted state and\n\ncounty of?ces responsible for administering the 2016 u.s. elections. for example, on or about\n\noctober 28, 2016, kovalev and his co?conspirators visited the websites of certain counties in\n\ni georgia, iowa, and florida to identify vulnerabilities.\n\n76. in or around november 2016 and prior to the 2016 u.s. presidential election, kovalev\n\nand his co-conspirators used an email account designed to look like a vendor 1 email address to\n\nsend over 100 spearphishing emails to organizations and personnel involved in administering\n\nelections in numerous florida counties. the spearphishing emails contained malware that the\n\nconspirators embedded into word documents bearing vendor 1?s logo.\n\nstatutory allegations\n\n77. between in or around june 2016 and november 2016,

regardless of what happens next on tariffs, the ongoing trade war has exposed three things that are unlikely to change anytime soon. here's what you need to know:\n\n1. china's regulatory state is part and parcel of beijing's globalization strategy.\n\nad\n\na strict regulatory regime underscores the unique challenge of china's trade advantage. china began to liberalize foreign direct investment (fdi) in the 1990s, even before the country joined the world trade organization in 2001. but almost immediately, as my research shows, the chinese government systematically re-regulated sector by sector, deliberately employing economic and state interventionist tools to expand the national technology base, promote domestic industry and enhance national security.\n\nad\n\nnowhere is this more evident than in telecommunications. the introduction of competition in telecom services has modernized china's communications infrastructure — but the chinese government retains state ownership in basic services and tight control over information dissemination. beijing does not permit direct market entry of foreign internet service providers, despite its wto commitments.\n\nas equipment manufacturers, foreign companies like ericsson and nokia were able to invest in china. but the reality of investing in china's telecom sector requires foreign companies to form joint ventures with domestic competitors and transfer their technology to local suppliers. foreign investors must also manufacture products with domestic contents — and follow china-specific technical standards.\n\nad\n\nfrom the mid-1990s through the late 2000s, the research and development and rollout of td-scdma, china's indigenous 3g telecommunications standard, involved initial technology from german equipment maker siemens, working closely with state-owned datang, managed by the chinese academy of telecommunications technology.\n\nad\n\nthe ministry of industry and information technology (miit) delayed licensing global 3g technologies, instead waiting on the technical maturity of td-scdma. then miit compelled foreign equipment makers like motorola and samsung, and state-owned zte and quasi-private huawei, among others, to invest in products deploying td-scdma for the china market.\n\nto roll out td-scdma, the government restructured the state-owned carriers to maximize nationwide network resources and service operation capabilities. it then assigned td-scdma to the newly strengthened china mobile. in the mid-2010s, miit again delayed licensing the next 4g technologies until after the state-owned carriers successfully rolled out td-lte, china's homegrown 4g standard.\n\nad\n\n2. in 2019, look for 5g wireless standards to complicate the trade war.\n\nad\n\nthis strategic re-regulation of fdi to enhance indigenous innovation and modernize infrastructure is unfolding right now with the development of 5g networks. this next-generation technology is expected to significantly boost data transfer and wireless speeds, and lower lag times between network and device.\n\ndespite beijing's regulatory efforts, td-scdma and td-lte are not widely adopted outside of china. this time around, chinese companies (from datang to huawei and zte) own in total about 10 percent of 5g-essential intellectual property rights (ipr). the 2017 adoption of huawei's polar coding methodology by 3gpp, the global wireless standards-setting body, will likely raise that number as telecom companies around the world, including in canada and india, deploy huawei technology for 5g networks.\n\nad\n\nso will china's regulatory state. made in china 2025, the industrial policy plan beijing released in 2015, identifies strategic emerging sectors like autonomous vehicles, green technology and semiconductors — and also emphasizes breakthroughs in 5g development.\n\nad\n\nhere's an example of how chinese regulators and courts exert influence over global markets, with so many multinational corporations doing significant business in china. the state administration for market regulation showed china's tight regulatory fist by delaying the merger between two rival chipmakers: qualcomm, a u.s. company whose china business accounted for nearly two-thirds of its revenue in 2017, and nxp of the netherlands. the deal would have increased qualcomm's competitiveness in the internet of things, including connected cars.\n\njust recently, an ipr tribunal of the fuzhou intermediate court banned the sale of older iphone models after ruling earlier that apple infringed on qualcomm patents covering wireless networks and devices. chinese handset makers like xiaomi, vivo and oppo compete with apple, and license qualcomm's 4g and 5g technologies.\n\nad\n\nchina's state-owned telecom operators won't just rely on qualcomm to maximize china's first-mover advantage in 5g technology. u.s. chipmaker intel, which operates two assembly and testing factories in chengdu, has partnered with huawei and china mobile to conduct interoperability trials and will work with china unicom to roll out 5g at the 2022 winter olympics in beijing. and there were reports in september that the chinese government is considering restructuring the national carriers for 5g rollout.\n\nad\n\n3. china's regulatory state locks the united states and china into a complex interdependence.\n\nwhether china's 5g maneuvers suggest a telecommunications race or an all-out tech war, many analysts expect china to fully commercialize 5g by 2020, five years ahead of australia, the european union, japan, south korea and the united states.\n\nad\n\nwith chips, networking equipment and smartphones assembled and sold in china, and many related inputs produced there, u.s. high-tech companies, including qualcomm, intel, and apple, are worried about their bottom line as the trade war continues. these companies joined a multi-sector alliance to lobby against the trade war — and argue that trade disputes would slow down the development of 5g in the united states.\n\naccording to the white house, xi made a promise in buenos aires to enforce ipr and approve the qualcomm/nxp merger. these concessions, however, don't change beijing's dominant patterns of market governance in strategic sectors. higher fines for ipr infringement were already in the works, and the merger is conditioned on whether the companies actually revive their deal.\n\nad\n\nthe current slowdown notwithstanding, 40 years into china's reform and opening, china's regulatory state matters not least because chinese regulators and courts increasingly have influence over global value chains, global markets and the direction of technological innovation.\n\nad\n\nyet precisely because of the complex interdependence its globalization strategy has created, china can't race ahead without the world in lockstep. china requires global technologies and global markets to propel ahead just as u.s. companies across sectors are eager for the trade dispute to end.
boycotts are not new in togo. major opposition parties boycotted togo's first three legislative elections after the country adopted multiparty politics in 1992. the boycotts left the legislature dominated by the ruling party, granting it power to make constitutional amendments, enabling two leaders, gnassingbé eyadéma and his son faure, to extend their successive rule past the 50-year mark.\n\nin togo's previous two legislative elections (2007 and 2013), however, opposition parties competed — and held the ruling party to less than 50 percent of the vote. c14's move in december effectively guaranteed the ruling party control of togo's legislature.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbut the opposition members believed they had little power to change that outcome, whether they competed or not. they complained of an independent electoral commission dominated by the ruling party, legislative districts disproportionately favoring the ruling party, and government refusal to reinstate the term limits and voting provisions of togo's 1992 constitution.\n\ntogo's ruling family has remained in power since 1967.\n\nthe roots of these complaints go back decades. president faure gnassingbé's father took power in a 1967 military coup; father and then son have held the presidency since. after neighboring benin liberalized its political system, domestic and international pressure prompted togo to introduce the 1992 constitution, which included multiparty elections and a two-term limit on the presidency.\n\nin response to political violence and the disqualification of the main opposition candidate — gilchrist olympio, son of togo's first president — major opposition parties boycotted legislative elections in 1994, 1999 and 2002. olympio did contest the 1998 presidential election and may have won; his strong performance led the government to take over ballot counting from the quasi-independent electoral commission.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin 2002, the legislature amended the constitution to remove presidential term limits and change elections from two rounds (which could help a divided opposition unite behind a single candidate) to a single-round plurality vote system. upon eyadéma's death in 2005, his supporters suspended the constitution to proclaim his son president but yielded to domestic and international pressure to hold a presidential election that year.\n\nthe opposition, violently repressed, complained of fraud in both the 2005 and 2010 presidential elections. continued pressure convinced the government to establish an independent election commission (ceni) with representation balanced between the ruling party and the opposition. in 2007, the opposition participated in a legislative election for the first time and collectively won more votes than the ruling party, but malapportionment gave the ruling party a dominant share of seats despite winning less than half the votes. the same thing happened in 2013, with turnout down to 66 percent from 85 percent in 2007.\n\nthe opposition remains thwarted.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin addition to exploiting biased district boundaries, gnassingbé recruited olympio, longtime leader of the main opposition party — the union of forces for change (ufc) — to join the government coalition in 2010. most ufc members split from olympio and joined a new opposition coalition, the save togo collective (cst), which placed second in the 2013 legislative election; another opposition coalition (cst's partner in c14) took third. olympio's ufc fell to fourth, with just three seats.\n\nthe ruling party's legislative majority defeated the widely supported restoration of presidential term limits, paving the way to gnassingbé's third term in 2015. protests gained steam in 2017; hundreds of thousands of togolese took to the streets, calling for a constitutional referendum to block gnassingbé from seeking a fourth term. government security forces violently repressed the protests.\n\nthe july 2018 legislative election was delayed to allow for facilitated talks between the opposition and the government, but the government continued to resist demands to restore the 1992 constitution, increase the number of districts in the south to make voters per district more proportionate, and exclude the ufc from ceni seats reserved for opposition parties.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nelection day itself was peaceful, with 59 percent turnout — lower than previous elections, though not as low as c14 had hoped. the ruling party's share of the legislature's 91 seats fell from 62 to 59, but its ally ufc gained four seats, with the remainder going to minor parties and independents unlikely to constrain the government. supporters of the government point to the smoothly run election as a disavowal of c14.\n\nwhat does c14 gain from the boycott?\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthese outcomes suggest c14's boycott failed to achieve its goals. why did togo's opposition turn to boycott tactics? political scientists emily beaulieu and susan hyde detail the costs and benefits of boycotting when opposition groups contemplate whether to contest an election.\n\ncosts include the loss of legislative seats and potential inclusion in the cabinet in the short term — and damage to the party's reputation and electoral support in the longer term. on the plus side, boycotts are sometimes successful in discrediting the ruling party and convincing it (with the help of foreign pressure) to improve the fairness of future elections. this is what happened in the lead-up to togo's 2007 legislative elections.\n\nfactors like electoral unfairness, an entrenched opposition and whether international election observers are present also help explain c14's boycott. the earlier togo boycotts were a partial success: the country liberalized the 2007 legislative elections but not enough to allow the opposition to achieve a legislative majority. the ultimate success of the 2018 boycott will depend on the response of domestic and international actors alike.
we've been socked in with clouds much of the day, but highs still managed to reach the upper 50s to low 60s. the mild air sticks around tonight and, nicely enough, into tomorrow as well. consider taking a trip outside on your lunch break tomorrow with temperatures poised to rise into the 60s.\n\nget our daily forecasts on your amazon alexa device. click here to find out how.\n\nad\n\nthrough tonight: the scenery doesn't change much, as clouds remain ensconced over the area. some of our far northern suburbs could see a few light showers or drizzle overnight, while the rest of us stay dry. temperatures remain mild — especially for january standards — with lows ranging from around 40 to the mid-40s. a weak southerly wind will blow.\n\nad\n\nview the current weather at the washington post.\n\ntomorrow (monday): mostly cloudy skies greet us when we wake, with little break expected from this cloudy pattern through midday. the sun makes a more honest attempt to peek out from the clouds during the afternoon, and these limited partly sunny periods, along with continued southerly flow, should help highs climb into the low-to-mid-60s. clouds will more fully cover the area monday evening as a cold front draws closer. showers should move in toward midnight and will be widespread through the overnight hours into tuesday morning. some of us could experience briefly higher wind gusts — perhaps ranging from 20-30 mph — as these showers move on through. isolated rumbles of thunder are also possible. overnight lows are even milder in the upper 40s to low 50s.\n\nad\n\nsee brian jackson's forecast through the weekend. and if you haven't already, join us on facebook and follow us on twitter and instagram. for related traffic news, check out dr. gridlock.\n\nad\n\nupcoming rain will do little to ameliorate region's moderate drought\n\nrain in the forecast for monday night into tuesday morning will be significant, generally ranging from a quarter-inch to a half-inch, with areas closer to the mason-dixon line possibly receiving over a half-inch.\n\nhowever, those expected rain amounts will do little to ameliorate what the u.s. drought monitor classifies as moderate drought conditions for almost all of the area.\n\nreagan national airport is running a precipitation deficit of more than 8 inches since september. on a shorter term basis, reagan has a deficit of over 3 ½ inches since the start of meteorological winter (december 1). according to noaa's national climatic data center (ncdc), much of the region would need 6 to 8 inches of precipitation over the next month to end the drought, which is more than twice the seasonal average for that time frame.
in preparation, his advisers have spent much of the past week drilling him for the big jump, which could make or break the momentum he has generated with his extravagant spending. in debate prep sessions, they have armed him with comebacks for the inevitable attacks on his enormous wealth and past record, while also coaching him to move beyond his sometimes distant, wonky and diffidently logical public persona.\n\nad\n\nad\n\non feb. 16, several democratic presidential candidates took to tv to criticize former new york mayor mike bloomberg over his record and campaign spending. (the washington post)\n\nmike is the most deeply steeped student of policy who is going to be on that debate stage, said bloomberg senior adviser tim o'brien, one of many who have helped the candidate prepare for the debate. we also really hope voters get to see his humanity and his compassion.\n\nwary of bloomberg's rise in the polls, his rivals, with far more debate experience and democratic longevity, have made clear that they will not go easy on the newcomer.\n\nsen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) spent tuesday in reno, nev., denouncing bloomberg's campaign as an example of oligarchy, not democracy. former vice president joe biden has been boasting for days about his desire to confront bloomberg in person because he cannot compete with the billionaire's advertising budget.\n\nad\n\nat least now primary voters curious about how each candidate will take on donald trump can get a live demonstration of how we each take on an egomaniac billionaire, sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.) warned in a tweet about bloomberg on tuesday.\n\nwhile campaigning in raleigh, n.c., democratic presidential candidate michael bloomberg responded to president trump's feb. 13 tweet that called him a loser. (reuters)\n\nad\n\nthe scrutiny comes as bloomberg's aides are attempting to reframe the contest as a two-person race, between sanders and bloomberg, after several state and national polls have shown biden's support plummeting as the former new york mayor rises past warren, sen. amy klobuchar (d-minn.) and former south bend, ind., mayor pete buttigieg.\n\nin a call with reporters tuesday, dan kanninen, bloomberg's states director, said sanders was the only other viable democrat in the race. he said supporters of other candidates need to quickly choose between the two or risk wasting their votes in upcoming primaries. under party rules, candidates who get less than 15 percent of the vote in a state or congressional district are awarded no delegates.\n\nad\n\nmultiple recent polls have found both men on the ascent in the democratic race — and on a collision course if their trajectories continue. an nbc news-wall street journal poll published tuesday put sanders at 27 percent and bloomberg at 14 percent, one point below biden at 15 percent. unlike biden, who fell 11 points in the past month, bloomberg gained five points over the same period.\n\nad\n\nbut a race between the two at the current moment would be no contest, with sanders at 57 percent and bloomberg at 37 percent.\n\nit's very clear democrats have to urgently consolidate around a candidate, kanninen said, warning that supporters of other moderates could inadvertently help nominate sanders by refusing to get behind bloomberg on his timetable. there really is a prospect of a candidate with maybe only a quarter of the votes getting 80 to 90 percent of the delegates.\n\nad\n\nbloomberg's rise in polling comes as he faces a barrage of negative news coverage, some of it promoted by rival campaigns. he has had to again address allegations that he made vulgar and sexist comments, his past defense of targeting stop-and-frisk police policies to black and latino neighborhoods in new york, and an interview in which he blamed the 2008 financial crisis on politicians who had pushed to end racially discriminatory mortgage-lending policies known as redlining.\n\nad\n\nbloomberg's past political leanings — he re-registered as a democrat only in 2018 — and his refusal to file a financial disclosure or release his tax returns before the debate, even as he is self-financing his campaign, also could come into play wednesday. a spokesman for his campaign said the financial disclosure would be filed by march 20, and howard wolfson, a senior adviser to the campaign, has previously said bloomberg would release his tax returns, though no date has been set.\n\nbloomberg campaign manager kevin sheekey signaled tuesday that the campaign may soon adopt a more aggressive posture toward opponents like sanders.\n\nad\n\nthe opposition research on @berniesanders could fill @realdonaldtrump's empty foxconn facility in wisconsin, sheekey wrote in a twitter post, with no elaboration save the reference to a giant manufacturing space for which president trump once claimed credit. it is very damaging, perhaps even disqualifying.\n\nad\n\nthose comments and the campaign's new get-it-done thrust came less than a week after bloomberg declined to criticize sanders or express concern about a lack of consolidation among the moderate democratic candidates.\n\ni'm not a prognosticator, so i don't want to comment on who's up and who's down, bloomberg said last week on a tour through tennessee, demonstrating his typically dispassionate style. i believe that i have common-sense policies that are affordable, practical and politically viable to take this country forward.\n\nad\n\nuntil now, bloomberg has built a campaign that exists overwhelmingly in the realm of paid advertising, with hundreds of television and digital ads that have been tested and refined to produce positive responses from their audience.\n\nthrough mid-february, bloom­­berg has spent about $339 million on television and radio, more than the total that barack obama spent on such ads during his 2012 reelection campaign, according to advertising analytics, a tracking firm. by comparison, the two top finishers in the iowa caucuses, buttigieg and sanders, spent more than $10 million each on broadcast advertising in the state.\n\nad\n\nto put the spending in another context, all the ads bloomberg purchased through feb. 10 would run for 4,106 hours, or 171 days, if they were played consecutively. bloomberg announced his campaign only 86 days ago.\n\nad\n\nthe wizard behind the curtain of all that paid media, however, has been far less visible to the public. by passing on the competitions in iowa and new hampshire, and the first year of televised town halls and interest group cattle calls, bloomberg has not needed to flex the improvisational campaign muscles his rivals have been building for months.\n\nhis in-person campaign approach has also been outsourced to a massive field operation that employs about 1,700 people in 43 states. they have proved adept at attracting crowds for him of about 1,000 as he jets around the country for events with free food and wine, live music and complimentary campaign t-shirts.\n\nad\n\nbloomberg's actual performance on the stump can be underwhelming by comparison, as he reads from teleprompters to deliver even a standard 15-minute speech after multiple introductions, and he regularly cuts short the time for glad-handing with the public afterward.\n\nad\n\nbloomberg is the first candidate to make the democratic debate stage this cycle without meeting any fundraising goals, after a change last month by democratic national committee chairman tom perez allowed candidates to qualify for the debate either by winning at least one delegate or by scoring 10 percent or more in four qualifying polls.\n\nthe poll that put bloomberg onstage, from npr-pbs newshour-marist, showed him with the support of 19 percent of democratic primary voters nationwide — in second place behind sanders, who received 31 percent. the poll, published tuesday, was conducted between feb. 13 and 16.\n\nad\n\nthe debate will air wednesday on msnbc and nbc at 9 p.m. eastern. candidates who qualified either with polling or by winning national delegates in iowa or new hampshire include bloomberg, biden, warren, sanders, klobuchar and buttigieg.\n\nbloomberg has prepared for the sparring by shifting his policy proposals to more closely align with the appetites of democratic primary voters. he has proposed a modest financial-transaction tax that would hit many of the subscribers to his company's financial-data terminals, and a tax increase for those like himself in higher tax brackets. he has called for racially targeted programs to increase black homeownership, double the number of black-owned businesses and increase the net worth of black families. he has also repeatedly apologized for stop-and-frisk policing.\n\nif anything, bloomberg has tried to use his wealth and emotional distance from political combat as a selling point. the central message of his campaign is that he has the ability and record to defeat trump and the managerial competence to improve the lives of voters. while his rivals attack his wealth as obscene and his spending as profligate, he has embraced the same as the appeal of his candidacy.
allen kane is retiring after 14 years as director of the national postal museum in washington, d.c. (marvin joseph/the washington post)\n\nallen kane had zero experience in museum administration when he became director of the national postal museum in 2002. he wasn't a stamp collector, either.\n\nbut kane knew the u.s. postal service, having spent 30 years working there, including stints managing its gulf war crisis team and leading its $800 million marketing effort. because the postal service is the museum's landlord and largest funder, kane got the job.\n\nto his surprise, he loved it.\n\ni said, 'i'll stay for six months, fix it up and then i'm going to the beach,'  kane recalled. i came from a huge government agency that has a lot of rules and regulations. [this] is very entrepreneurial. if you bring in the money, you can do whatever you like. you can really change it.\n\nkane embraced the possibilities he found at the museum, which opened in 1993 and is one of the smallest in the smithsonian complex. he dramatically expanded its exhibition space by opening the world's largest stamp gallery. he increased the staff and the number of exhibitions, displayed rare and internationally famous stamps, and created a website focused solely on renowned stamps and collections. he improved fundraising and built a network of volunteers who help curators develop and create exhibitions.\n\nallen kane stands a statue modeled after his likeness, on display in the atrium of the national postal museum. face. (marvin joseph/the washington post)\n\n[national postal museum to open new stamp gallery]\n\nif kane is aware of the inherent contradiction of expanding a museum that celebrates a declining service and a hobby whose glory days have probably passed, he doesn't let on.\n\nit's a history museum, he said. we're interested in rare stamps, and we use them to tell stories.\n\nkane, 71, is retiring this month after a tenure of 14 years because of a recent heart attack. last week, the smithsonian named marshall f. marty emery, the museum's manager of public relations and internet affairs, as acting director until a national search for a permanent director is completed.\n\ncolleagues credit kane's management skills and personality for strengthening the institution, which has 6 million objects in its collection, the second largest in the smithsonian.\n\nit wouldn't exist without his tenacity and his unwillingness to take no for an answer, said charles shreve, a member of the museum's council of philatelists and the director of the robert a. siegel auction galleries in new york. i can't underestimate the value of his relationship with postal officials.\n\nkane, shreve said, has always put his constituents first. he'd say, 'i'm not the collector, you guys are. what do you want? what do you need? tell me what you need and i'll get it.' \n\nkane's successes are based on that can-do attitude. when his appointment angered collectors who wanted a proven philatelist at the helm, he focused on their wish list. we started on the stamp side and built that up, he said. once you say, 'here's what we can do together,' you get them going and they love it.\n\nkane is proud of his management accomplishments — and cost-cutting. case in point: one of the statues of postal workers in the museum's atrium features kane's likeness, because he didn't want to pay a model several thousand dollars to pose for it. he later regretted that decision, however, saying that having his head covered in plaster was terrifying.\n\nto create a recent online exhibition about the mailing industry, kane turned to the trade associations for help, enlisting volunteers to develop, research and write its stories.\n\nthe mailing industry is a $1.4 trillion industry that no one knows about. it's probably the best government/private-sector partnership you'll ever see, he said.\n\nthe exhibition is an example of kane's hub and spoke management strategy, which seeks experts in the field to work with the museum's bare-bones staff. once involved, these individuals form a real connection with the institution.\n\nwe're building a partnership for the future, kane said. i like that better than having an army of curators writing and then going on to something else. and it's cheap.\n\nkane doesn't worry about the ethical questions raised by the museum's tight relationship with the postal service. unique among smithsonian museums, the branch has a long-term contract with the postal service that includes space in its historic building next to union station and a $3 million annual grant, half of its roughly $6 million budget, according to the smithsonian.\n\nits exhibitions detail the history of the u.s. mail and its innovations in transportation and communication. there are exhibits about the pony express; interactive computer displays that allow visitors to design their own stamps; and examples of trains, planes and automobiles that delivered the mail. a movie about modern postal delivery was made by the postal service's video department, saving the museum almost $500,000.\n\nthere are no mentions of snail mail or going postal.\n\ndo we tell the story they want? we tell the story we want to tell, but in fairness, we run it by them and other organizations to get their input, kane said, referring to the postal service.\n\nthe museum attracted 398,000 visits last year, a 12 percent increase over 2015 but still in the bottom quarter of smithsonian branches. (only african art, anacostia and the sackler gallery attracted fewer visits last year.) average annual attendance during kane's tenure is 358,500; about 30 percent are postal service employees and retirees.\n\nkane says the 2013 opening of the william h. gross gallery was the highlight of his tenure. he persuaded the postal service to provide the space, previously occupied by a rent-paying restaurant and brewery. (asked to confirm rumors that he called in favors to get the restaurant out, kane smiled and said, i can't tell you.) financier and stamp collector william h. gross donated $8 million, the largest private gift in the museum's history. district oversight panels quickly approved the museum's request to hang images of stamps in the gallery's 54 windows, immediately improving the museum's visibility.\n\neveryone said it couldn't be done, kane said. i like it when people say it's impossible. that's the fun.
1. how many covid-related lawsuits have been filed?\n\na total of 1,315 lawsuits related to covid-19 claims had been filed in the u.s. as of dec. 28, according to fisher & phillips, a law firm tracking the litigation. relatively few have been filed by workers who blame their employers after contracting the virus, according to several lawyers who have been following the field. melissa camire at fisher & phillips, said that the most common kinds are cases filed by workers who said they needed, but were denied, time off because they contracted covid-19 or had to take care of a sick person. the next most common categories were suits in which employment discrimination claims were tied to the pandemic, including claims by parents saying they were fired for taking care of their children, and whistle-blower cases.\n\nad\n\nad\n\n2. who's been sued?\n\nmost covid exposure suits have been against companies whose workplaces are densely staffed, such as meatpackers and food processors, according to john beisner, a partner at skadden arps slate meagher & flom llp in washington, d.c. janie schulman, an attorney at morrison & foerster in los angeles, said smaller companies and those in the health care industry are common targets. the fisher phillips data support her conclusion: companies with fewer than 50 employees are defendants in 461 covid-related lawsuits, or more than one-third of the total. suits have also been filed against companies over conditions in warehouses and product distribution centers, including one against amazon.com inc.\n\n3. what are those suits about?\n\nad\n\njuno turner, litigation director at towards justice, a denver-based workers' rights organization who filed the suit against amazon in brooklyn, said that many of them have been brought by low-wage, frontline or essential workers, who are disproportionately people of color. some, like the amazon suit, are seeking court orders requiring safe conditions. others seek damages for employers' egregious conduct on behalf of workers who've fallen ill or died, she said.\n\nad\n\n4. what can people who think they got covid on the job do?\n\nthe vast majority of workers arguing they contracted covid due to unsafe workplaces are required to pursue their claims through worker compensation programs, an administrative process that generally makes it impossible to sue employers directly over workplace injuries. labor lawyers argue the programs don't have the teeth required to change practices at dangerous workplaces.\n\nad\n\n5. how about workers worried about infection risks?\n\nsome cases are being filed as public nuisance suits in an attempt to avoid the normal channels for such complaints. the case against amazon accused the company of contributing to the spread of covid-19 by telling plant workers to emphasize speed over distancing, hand-washing and sanitizing work spaces. a federal judge in brooklyn dismissed the case in november, saying workers should bring their concerns to the federal occupational safety and health administration instead. two of the legal non-profits that brought the amazon lawsuit, towards justice and public justice, are separately suing osha in a federal court in pennsylvania, saying the agency has arbitrarily and capriciously failed to address imminent dangers to workers at a meatpacking plant in the state.\n\nad\n\n6. what are states doing?\n\nad\n\nwhile congress has remained gridlocked on any federal measure, at least 10 states have created their own legal shields for businesses and individuals, says fisher and phillips lawyer chentell c. foley. they include georgia, north carolina, utah and wyoming. georgia's law shifts the burden of proof so that instead of a company first being required to show how it complied with state and federal health guidelines, plaintiffs must prove it didn't. workers must show their employer willfully and wantonly failed to follow the guidelines, foley says. that's a pretty high burden. california in december put in place a new rule requiring employers to implement coronavirus safety measures and setting standards for virus testing, notifying workers of infections, and paid medical leave.\n\n7. what would a federal liability shield do?\n\nad\n\nas outlined by senate republicans in a proposed stimulus measure that failed to win democratic support, lawsuits couldn't be brought under common law or medical malpractice statutes, only through a specially designed federal cause of action. defendants could be found liable only if they didn't make reasonable efforts to comply with relevant public health guidelines and were either grossly negligent or engaged in willful misconduct. thresholds for acceptable evidence would be stricter. compensatory damages would be limited to the plaintiff's economic losses; punitive damages, awarded only if the defendant's willful misconduct caused the injury, could not exceed compensatory damages. an employer couldn't be held liable if it relied on, and generally followed, relevant health and safety standards. the shield would apply to virus exposure on or after dec. 1, 2019, and until at least oct. 1, 2024.\n\nad\n\n8. what do opponents say?\n\nseveral democrats, including house speaker nancy pelosi and senate minority leader chuck schumer, say that the liability shields would place workers in dangerous conditions without giving them legal recourse to recover damages or demand change. they also object to the length of the proposed shield. labor groups and workers' rights organizations say the main effect of a shield would be to encourage employers to not take the required safety precautions. turner said republicans were using an exaggerated concern about purportedly frivolous litigation to justify blanket immunity for corporations that break the rules.\n\nad\n\n9. is the idea dead?\n\nad\n\nno. a bipartisan group of senators has vowed to continue working in 2021 on a deal that would pair a liability shield with financial aid to state and local governments, a democratic priority. that group had been working on a measure that would establish a nationwide gross negligence standard for covid-19 exposure, medical malpractice and workplace testing claims. its protections would apply to claims arising from injuries that occurred from december 2019 through the later of one year after enactment or the end of the coronavirus public health emergency.\n\nfor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com
related items books & reading\n\nfirst chapter of the sixties\n\n\n\nthe sixties\n\ncultural revolution in britain, france, italy, and the united states, c.1958-c.1974\n\nby arthur marwick\n\noxford 903 pp. $39.95\n\nreviewed by gertrude himmelfarb, professor emeritus of history at the city university of new york and author, most recently, of the de-moralization of society: from victorian virtues to modern values. sunday, november 29, 1998\n\n\n\n\n\nsearch online\n\nmerchants\n\nfor this book.\n\nh istorians are notably wary of the word revolution. they are even grudging in applying it to political events (was the english revolution of 1688 a revolution or merely a restoration?), still more so to social or cultural events. and still more to social or cultural events in their own time. surely a longer perspective (the famous long view that historians are supposed to cultivate) will dissipate the effect of ephemeral experiences and reveal the continuity behind ostensibly dramatic changes. yet occasionally, very occasionally, historians are privileged (or doomed) to live through real revolutions, even social and cultural ones. arthur marwick, a professor of history at the open university in england, maintains that the 1960s witnessed one such revolution. and a revolution, moreover, that transcended political and national boundaries. marwick confines himself to four countries, britain, france, italy and the united states (with passing references to germany, eastern europe and japan). as a good historian, he apologizes for focusing on so artificial a period as a decade, and then, with further apologies, for prolonging the sixties to encompass the long decade of 1958 to 1974. the apologies are unnecessary. there was a revolution in these (and other) countries, and decades are sometimes significant units of time, even though they spill over into the adjacent years. the 800-odd page book (with another hundred pages of bibliography, footnotes and index) is one to be read in rather than read through. divided into three periods, 1958-63, 1964-69 and 1969-74, it ranges over a variety of subjects: sex, censorship and morality; art, literature and movies; race, class and youth; poverty, affluence and commerce; education, welfare and crime; feminism, consumerism and environmentalism; beatles, hippies and yippies. in addition there are accounts of the dramatic events in each period and each country: the civil rights movement, student strikes, urban riots, political crises. in a work of this scope there are inevitable omissions and peculiar emphases. why so much emphasis on the popular culture (on movies especially) and so little on the high culture, which was complicitous in creating, sustaining and, more important, legitimizing the cultural revolution? (it would have been useful to be introduced to lionel trilling's concept of the adversary culture, which originated with the literati earlier in the century and was democratized and popularized in the course of the '60s.) why half-a-dozen pages on gore vidal and toni morrison and no mention of saul bellow? why, in a long discussion of race, is there no account of the moynihan report on the black family in 1965, which was so prescient in pointing out a crucial aspect of the racial problem in the united states: the breakdown of the black family (signified by the then-startling illegitimacy rate of 25 percent)? and why, in a multi-national study such as this, is so much attention paid to memphis, tenn., which is hardly typical of the united states let alone of western europe (but which happens to be the location of rhodes college, where the author was a visiting professor and availed himself of the city's research facilities)? but these are incidental details compared with the main issue: the nature of the revolution itself. and here marwick has made a genuine contribution, first in affirming the reality of the cultural revolution as it manifested itself in so many spheres of life; then in showing how that revolution permeated and transformed mainstream society; and finally in putting it all in an international perspective, exposing the differences and yet basic similarities provided by the perspective. for americans especially, it is useful to be reminded that the american experience was not unique -- certainly not the product, as is sometimes suggested, of the civil rights movement and the vietnam war. and the insistence upon the interaction between the dominant culture and the counter-culture (the term itself was coined in 1968) is also fruitful, obliging us to recall another aspect of the revolution that is too often forgotten, the fact that so many of the revolutionaries proved to be imaginative, ambitious and eminently successful commercial entrepreneurs, creating whole industries out of the counter-culture itself -- boutiques, experimental theatres, art galleries, discotheques, nightclubs, 'light shows', 'head shops', photographic and model agencies, underground films, pornographic magazines. in his methodological observations, marwick is very much the cautious professional historian. he firmly rejects the great marxisant fallacy, according to which any revolution worthy of the name can be conducted only by a class intent upon overthrowing the whole of bourgeois society and culture; it was this fallacy that inspired herbert marcuse to create a new revolutionary class, composed of students, blacks and other marginalized and disaffected groups. marwick's own methodological explanation is more complex and sophisticated (so complex and sophisticated, perhaps, as to offer little practical guidance): cultural and social change, while influenced by human agency, by contingency and convergence, takes place within the opportunities offered, and the constraints imposed, by structural, ideological, and institutional circumstances. like a good disinterested historian, he also professes to reject the familiar ideological interpretations of the '60s: the radical view that sees it as a movement of social and sexual liberation, a boon to blacks, women, gays and other oppressed minorities; and the conservative view that harps on such disagreeable matters as the increase of crime and violence and an assault upon the universities and rational inquiry. marwick does not, to be sure, refrain from judgment. instead he couches his judgments in the familiar if . . . but, on the one hand . . . on the other hand mode. thus, if a relaxed censorship brought an explosion of porn and exploitation, it was also accompanied by a remarkable continuity in the revival in serious american film-making. if drug abuse got out of control, it can, however, be seriously questioned whether the recreational use of drugs, and certainly cannabis, is any more reprehensible than the recreational use of alcohol. if brutal things did happen in the sixties, yet there was a remarkable balance between this humanism [tolerance and rationality] and the extremes of innovation. if ever there was justification for violence, the appalling, utterly inhumane story of 'soledad brother' george jackson [of black panthers fame] provided it. some rioters were vandals, but practically every violent episode could be traced back to some stupid or brutal (often both) action by the police. many of those caught up in violent situations were intensely peace-loving . . . the student uprisings demonstrated on the one hand, the dedication, the idealism, the bravery of those who participated in them; on the other, the folly of their obedience to the great marxisant fallacy, the absurd faith that there was a promised land ready -- given sufficient protest, sufficient violence, sufficient unconventionality, sufficient vulgarity -- for the taking. lest marwick's own view of these students be in doubt, he adds: i do not mock the protesters; i salute them, recognizing that they never had a hope of success in their revolutionary aspirations. i do mock commentators since, who, looking for the revolution decreed in the marxist scriptures, have gone on and on picking over their failure, missing the real cultural revolution. the real cultural revolution -- by the end of the book that revolution has taken on dimensions and attributes that even its most ardent supporters rarely claim for it. the essence of the cultural revolution, marwick writes, was its involvement of vast numbers of ordinary people, from peasant families in rural italy getting the basics of civilized living to black children in the ghettos of the american south being admitted for the first time to properly equipped schools; from paraplegics whose needs as integrated members of the community were for the first time being recognized, to women everywhere freed from the confinements of the feminine mystique; from italian, french, british and american workers with freshly negotiated wages and conditions of employment to young people in once-dreary provincial cities, now provided with boutiques and discos. and so on, with a medley of other tributes, large and small: the end of segregated housing, the increase of social welfare, the liberalization of marriage and divorce, the abandonment of fictions about the nature of beauty and the arrival of body-hugging clothing (or no clothing for sun-bathers), the inauguration of the new universal language of rock [that] was genuinely liberating, and not just for the young . . . there even emerged a new measured judgment on the part of authorities, so that tom hayden, the leader of the radical sds, and the many others who suffered grievously at the hands of the most reactionary elements in the 'justice' system were all finally acquitted. by the last page of this very long book, in his opinion, the ifs and buts, on the one hand and on the other, are resolved, as marwick happily looks back to a period that, in his opinion, was so much better than those that preceded or followed it: gone was the stuffy conservatism of previous decades, while the radical, divisive, philistine conservatism of reagan and thatcher was yet to come. one has come a long way from the opening page, where marwick deplored the political polemic, nostalgic mythologizing, and downright misrepresentation of both sides in this debate. although there is much valuable material in his own voluminous work, it too is a notable contribution to that polemical genre.
fema's new funding rules were released in an update to the policy guide for the agency. similar rules are in a house measure that passed late last year and in a pending senate bill. they are being challenged by church-state advocacy groups that say they violate the first amendment's prohibition on the government establishing religion.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe issue is also pending in federal courts because of lawsuits against fema by three texas churches and two florida synagogues hit last year by hurricanes that were denied fema funding. lawyers for those houses of worship are waiting to make sure funding comes through, the san antonio express-news reported wednesday.\n\nwe thank the trump administration for righting this longtime wrong and treating disaster-damaged churches, synagogues and other houses of worship fairly — on the same terms as other nonprofits such as museums, community centers and libraries stricken by natural disaster, said nathan diament, executive director for public policy at the orthodox union, a major u.s. orthodox jewish organization.\n\nthe debate about fema funding doesn't affect a huge number of institutions, since fema designation only happens after rare major disasters such as the trio of hurricanes that hit the united states last year — harvey in texas, irma in florida and maria in puerto rico. for example, diament said after harvey four or five synagogues and a few dozen churches sought such aid, while in florida there was less damage to such spots.\n\nhowever, it's a symbolically important issue to some faith groups, particularly in the last decade as religious conservatives have seen their standing challenged by growing liberal and secular forces.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhistorically, diament said, the issue was bipartisan. it's unclear what will happen going forward if the issue gains public attention, but at the moment a mix of lawmakers is supporting the measure to directly fund houses of worship, including republican reps. christopher h. smith (n.j.) and peter t. king (n.y.) and democratic rep. grace meng (n.y.). in the senate it has backing from democrat claire mccaskill and republican roy blunt, both of missouri.\n\nfaith groups advocating for the change include the u.s. conference of catholic bishops, agudath israel of america (which represents orthodox jews), the southern baptist convention and the jewish federations of north america.\n\nthe debate about whether fema can pay to rebuild churches and other places of worship increased in the early 2000s. federal disaster assistance had been increasing as the agency grew, prompting debates about who got what. in 2002 the bush administration changed the practice regarding certain types of funding to religious groups — granting $550,000 to the seattle hebrew academy, a private school devastated by an earthquake.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe issue came to the fore again with hurricane katrina in 2005, when religious organizations — not just houses of worship but major nonprofit agencies and institutions — suffered millions in property damage. the bush administration said it would help rebuild parochial schools, nursing homes and similar religious institutions but would not pay for the rebuilding of houses of worship.\n\ni just want to make it clear that any facility that's used primarily for inherently religious activities is not going to be covered, h. james towey, director of the white house office of faith-based and community initiatives, was quoted as saying in a 2005 article in the washington post.\n\npresident george w. bush established the network of faith-based offices across the federal government to help government work with faith-based nonprofits. president barack obama continued them, but trump has not filled most of the key positions in the network, though he's not formally killed it.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nsome faith groups praised the bush administration for recognizing the public service faith groups provide and simply not discriminating, while separationist groups said institutions like religious schools were primarily serving a religious purpose and shouldn't get government funds.\n\ndiament said while bush refused to change the policy explicitly, his staff found ways to get many — not all — churches fema funds. the rules were applied flexibly he said, with the government focusing on the parts of houses of worship that could be characterized as not exclusively religious — like community halls that serve the homeless, for example.\n\nthe federal law behind these various fema policies is called the stafford act of 1988. diament said it is silent about the issue of religion altogether. it includes a section about private nonprofits that can get post-disaster funds. it has a list that isn't comprehensive, but more illustrative, diament said — it just lists the type of groups, and includes community centers, museums and art centers.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe issue came up again after hurricane sandy, but the obama administration was less flexible than the bush white house, diament said.\n\nhouses of worship aren't the only buildings denied fema funding by white house policies. the guidelines issued this week use preexisting language, which deems ineligible facilities established or primarily used for political, athletic, recreational, vocational or academic training, conferences.\n\ni won't pretend the system of inclusion or exclusion has logic to it, diament said of the stafford act.\n\ndena sher, assistant legislative director for americans united for the separation of church and state, said until this week the fema guidelines treated religious and nonreligious nonprofits equally, and determined eligibility based on what activities take place. now this gives houses of worship special treatment, she said.

in a way, rose was doxed — but not purposefully. the source was the trump campaign, which shared their number with 4.6 million followers on twitter and facebook.\n\non sunday, the campaign asked supporters to call two michigan state lawmakers and demand a vote to decertify president-elect joe biden's victory in a state he won by more than 150,000 votes. the campaign posted numbers and emails for michigan state senate majority leader mike shirkey (r) and former michigan house speaker lee chatfield (r).\n\nad\n\nad\n\nnot only did the post, which president trump also re-shared to more than 35 million followers on his own facebook page, falsely identify chatfield as the current speaker, it also gave the wrong number for the former lawmaker.\n\ninstead, that number belongs to rose.\n\nsince midday sunday, rose, a petoskey, mich., native whose story was first reported by the petoskey news-review, said they have received thousands of angry and threatening calls and text messages from people all over the country.\n\nmy phone can't even take it anymore — it's breaking, rose, who now lives in california, said in an interview with the washington post. i was getting so many calls it was impossible to do anything with my phone.\n\nad\n\nit took rose some time to figure out why their phone was blowing up. it wasn't until a friend of their father's texted them — thinking it was the former state representative — that rose realized they were now involved in a mix-up.\n\nad\n\nrose began answering many of the phone calls, initially hoping to clear up the confusion. but many of the callers were hostile and confused, rose said. angry trump supporters accused rose of lying about not having any association with chatfield. other callers were frustrated that their messages were going unanswered, assuming chatfield was avoiding their calls.\n\ngiving up on the hopes of convincing people that the number does not belong to the michigan republican, rose changed tactics to try to educate the confused callers about what to trust on the internet.\n\nad\n\ni want these people to realize that they can't just find something on facebook and call a number they found, rose said. they need to do research.\n\nrose has employed a different, more amusing, tactic over text.\n\ni've been trolling them, rose said.\n\nrose has responded with witty memes, pictures of fluffy rodents and a recipe for pumpkin pie, according to screenshots of the messages reviewed by the post.\n\nrose said they hoped the witty remark would be an obvious signal the number did not, in fact, belong to a former michigan house speaker.\n\nad\n\nfor some reason, even though i send them some ridiculous things, they still think i'm lee [chatfield] and they still keep trying to tell me what they want and they say, 'i'm sending this to the president!' rose said.\n\nad\n\nrose said the president's campaign should have taken the time to double-check the numbers before posting them online.\n\ni'm being personally affected by a decision that [trump] made without fact-checking, and that's the silliest thing i've ever heard, rose said.\n\nthe trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. chatfield also didn't respond to a message early tuesday.\n\nas of early tuesday, the tweet and facebook post are still online with the wrong number. rose said they have tried repeatedly to get in touch with trump's campaign to get the posts taken down and have asked friends to reach out as well.\n\nad\n\nrose plans to change their phone number on tuesday. the whole experience has been draining for the 28-year-old, who is disabled. it's hard for me to do anything in the first place, rose said.\n\nthe stress of the overwhelming deluge of unsolicited correspondences has felt utterly ridiculous, the michigan native added.
during trump's surprise appearance in the white house briefing room thursday afternoon, he again turned on the charm, offering pelosi congratulations on her very, very great achievement of becoming house speaker again.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhopefully we're going to work together and get lots of things done, like infrastructure, he said. i think it will be a little bit different than people think.\n\nit's not as if pelosi has been easy on trump. at a private meeting after their now-infamous oval office meeting last month, she allegedly commented that the border wall must be a manhood thing for trump. yet even that insult did not invoke a twitter tirade from the president. he has slammed democrats generally for not giving him funding for the wall, but he hasn't gone after pelosi personally.\n\npelosi wields tremendous power over trump. as speaker, she has say over investigations and subpoenas and would ultimately be the one to bring impeachment charges to the floor if it came to that. she even said thursday the president's not immune from indictment. maybe trump is playing nice because he knows that.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nor maybe he genuinely likes her. (he did tell her, way back in 2011, that she was the best.)\n\nif trump respects power above all else, as it seems he does, it's not surprising he'd respect pelosi.\n\nwhile we're not privy to pelosi's skills behind the scenes, the way she navigated her march back to being speaker is an indication of her talents.\n\npelosi told elle magazine in a recent interview that she views the vitriol thrown her way by republicans and some democrats not as hatred but as respect.\n\nthey wouldn't come after me if i were not effective. i consider myself a master legislator. republicans fear me for that, but also because i am a successful fundraiser, enabling our candidates to have the resources they need to win, she said.\n\nad\n\nthe persistent anti-pelosi campaign devised by the republicans over the years had been successful in adversely affecting public perception of her. not only did she become the personification of everything republicans were supposed to fear, but she became a third rail for some within her own party. over time, democratic candidates distanced themselves from her. asking a candidate whether they would support her for speaker became an ultimate gotcha question.\n\nad\n\nbut pelosi worked diligently and strategically after the democrats won the house majority in the november midterms to shore up support from the varying factions that could have opposed her.\n\nto counter a challenge from rep. marcia l. fudge (d-ohio), a former congressional black caucus chairwoman, pelosi promoted a new diversity-hiring office and offered fudge a job overseeing a resurrected subcommittee on elections. she appealed to progressives by creating a committee focused on climate change.\n\nad\n\npelosi's greatest opposition has come from her right flank, from members who said they wanted fresh blood in the leadership role and are from swing districts where backing pelosi is a liability. she assuaged many of those members by agreeing to implement term limits on party leaders in the house.\n\nafter all the drama surrounding her bid to become speaker, she ultimately lost just 15 democratic votes, mostly from freshman lawmakers who promised on the campaign trail to oppose her.
pittsburgh, pa - january 04: jamel artis #1 of the pittsburgh panthers drives against london perrantes #32 of the virginia cavaliers at petersen events center on january 4, 2017 in pittsburgh, pennsylvania. (photo by justin k. aller/getty images) (justin k. aller/getty images)\n\npittsburgh's michael young and jamel artis had virginia coach tony bennett in an unfamiliar spot wednesday night. bennett, the architect of the top-rated defense in the nation, found his team helpless in trying to defend the pair of seniors.\n\nthey were bigger, stronger and more experienced than the four-guard lineup bennett deployed in hopes of matching the panthers' scoring advantage. there was nothing much bennett could do but hope.\n\nit was one of those games where you were hoping they miss shots, bennett said after virginia's 88-76 overtime loss to pittsburgh at petersen events center. that's not a good feeling.\n\npittsburgh (12-3, 1-1 acc) broke its seven-game losing streak against no. 11 virginia (11-3, 1-2) behind artis's game-high 24 points. a game after florida state's dwayne bacon made six three-pointers on the way to 26 second-half points to beat virginia in charlottesville, the cavaliers were still unable to find a suitable perimeter defender. artis made 6 of 7 from beyond the arc, including all three of his second-half attempts.\n\nyoung added 19 points in a tight contest that left bennett unsparing in his criticism of his once-vaunted defense.\n\nwe're not a talented defense right now, bennett said.\n\n[george mason gets straight at the line, holds off u-mass., 86-81]\n\nvirginia had struggled all night to contain artis and young. the cavaliers' best hope at times appeared to try to match them, which senior point guard london perrantes did with a three-pointer with less than three seconds left in regulation that sent the game into overtime tied at 70.\n\nin the extra period, however, the cavaliers ran out of answers. the panthers scored the first nine points of overtime — on three consecutive three-pointers.\n\nvirginia's darius thompson made a jumper to cut the deficit to seven with 2:30 remaining, but that was as close as the cavaliers would get.\n\nbennett knew the artis-young tandem would be difficult to stop entering the game. it was one reason he gave freshman sharp shooter kyle guy — averaging a team-high 11.5 points through two acc contests entering wednesday — his first career start.\n\nbut the lineup change was for naught. the rookie endured a chorus of loud boos every time he touched the ball and made just 1 of 7 field goal attempts to log his lowest-scoring game since an 11-minute outing against ohio state in november. he scored just two then as well.\n\nvirginia's fate wound up in the hands of its most experienced player instead.\n\nperrantes led five cavaliers in double figures with 16 points, including three three-pointers, all of which came in the second half. junior guard devon hall had 15 points and a team-high nine rebounds, and marial shayok added 14 points off the bench.\n\nbut perrantes didn't score after his three-pointer to force overtime. pittsburgh's sheldon jeter sank two three-pointers to start the extra period, then artis added his final three of the night to give the panthers a nine-point cushion with 2:45 left on the clock.\n\nthe game was tight up until overtime, with seven lead changes in total, despite that virginia trailed for the majority. wednesday was pittsburgh's second overtime game in a row. the panthers lost, 78-77, to notre dame on new year's eve, but this time were sound enough to hold on to a lead.\n\n[duke's grayson allen's 'indefinite' suspension lasted all of one game]\n\non paper, rebounds hurt the cavaliers most — bennett often played a small-ball lineup with four guards in an effort to get his offense running, seceding size matchups to the panthers. as a result, pittsburgh outrebounded virginia 21-8 in the first half and had 14 second-chance points to the cavaliers' two.\n\nthey ended the game outrebounding virginia 42-24.\n\nvirginia took its first lead of the second half with just under seven minutes to play, after thompson notched a driving layup and mamadi diakite blocked pittsburgh's justice kithcart on the other end. thompson kicked the rebound back to shayok for another aggressive layup and the cavaliers led 56-55.\n\nhall's three-pointer, virginia's sixth consecutive made field goal, put the cavaliers ahead 61-58 just about a minute later.\n\nartis's fifth three-pointer of the night changed the lead for the seventh time.
world health organization officials were pressed repeatedly monday as to why they are holding off declaring the coronavirus a pandemic, especially with some experts saying the disease's spread has already crossed that point.\n\nit's too early, said michael ryan, who's director of health emergencies. we're still trying to avoid that reality.\n\nryan acknowledged that, especially in cases of influenza viruses, it is often easier to see when a virus is becoming a pandemic because scientists know much about how such diseases spread. but he insisted that much is still unknown about the coronavirus — particularly the exact nature of how it transmits. and those unknowns, he said, give who hope that the coronavirus can still be contained.\n\nryan pointed to the drastic measures — such as entire city lockdowns instituted in china — and how they appear to have had a strong effect on decelerating the number of new cases. the hope we have from the efforts in china is that it is clear that china and countries with smaller events have been able to suppress and contain, ryan said.\n\nwho is the body with authority to officially declare a pandemic. but who officials will be reluctant to make that declaration unless absolutely necessary. that's because declaring any outbreak a pandemic is not just a medical decision but a political and economic one as well.\n\nthe last time who declared a pandemic — during the h1n1 outbreak in 2009 — the decision was later roundly and harshly criticized by many countries, who thought that it spread fear and led to unnecessarily aggressive responses.\n\nh1n1 turned out not to cause the massive deaths and chaos some initially feared. but the pandemic declaration triggered requirements, for example, that governments buy pandemic vaccine — which some countries thought was a waste of money. some critics even accused who advisers of pushing toward the declaration because of ties to the vaccine industry, according to a history of the controversial decision published in the bulletin of the world health organization.
i moved about a month ago into my first apartment, a little studio in bethesda, and was faced with a decision: how to fill my empty wall with sports. i am a sports reporter, which means i pretty much need to see whatever game is on that night.\n\nif toledo plays miami of ohio on tuesday night in mid-american conference football, i need at least to have it playing in the background. the same is true if the orlando magic plays chicago on wednesday. thursday night football is a must. friday through monday are stuffed with nfl and college football, and then whatever else comes on when the seasons change.\n\nmy building is wired exclusively for verizon fios, so cable service would cost $65 a month, plus whatever i had to pay for equipment and installation. i thought i could do better, so i resolved to cut the cord. i did some research, made my decision, then asked twitter and the internet for other, better arrangements.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe results were enlightening and, frankly, could save me some money down the road. so from my research, plus advice from others, here are the cliffsnotes on cord-cutting for sports fans.\n\n1. set a spending framework.\n\nfor me, $65 a month was way too much, especially since i pay another $50 a month for internet. i wanted to spend no more than $40 a month on a cable replacement.\n\ncome up with a spending framework that fits your overall household budget. factor in one-time expenses such as equipment costs. for example, do you have a smart tv (a tv that can connect to the internet and use apps), or do you need a little extra hardware to get you there?\n\nad\n\n2. decide what you must have and what you would like to have.\n\ni need to watch a lot of sports, so i must have espn, espn2 and espnu. national sporting events are often on broadcast networks nbc, abc, cbs and fox, so i need those. i love college football, especially my missouri tigers, so i have to get the sec network, even if it means spending a little more money. and i'm also a news junkie, so cnn has to be available as well.\n\nad\n\nthose nine channels pretty well encompassed what i need for the sports season at the end of fall and beginning of winter. with that in mind, i could start looking at services such as slingtv, playstation vue, direct tv now and youtube tv to see what best fit my needs.\n\nad\n\n3. what hardware do you need?\n\nthink of hardware as a replacement for the set-top box of the cable days of yore. what would you use instead?\n\ni do not have a smart tv. i have a 10-year-old, 42-inch vizio that cannot connect to the internet and didn't reliably connect to my brother's xbox when we were kids.\n\ni needed a device that would transform that television into a smart tv and allow me to stream applications, such as slingtv, playstation vue, the espn app (formerly watchespn) and netflix (i'm addicted to the west wing).\n\non the recommendation of family members, i chose an amazon firetv stick. it was pretty cheap — $35 — and in my mailbox the very next day.\n\nad\n\nad\n\n(disclosure: amazon founder and ceo jeffrey p. bezos owns the washington post.)\n\nthe firetv stick plugs into an hdmi socket in the back of your tv and into a power outlet in the wall. turn on your tv, tune it to the appropriate hdmi channel and the firetv stick setup menu pops up right away. configuring the whole thing took me five minutes.\n\nafter downloading the netflix app, i was streaming in less time than it took me to assemble ikea furniture (which takes me a concerningly long time, but that's not the point).\n\nemailers and twitter users also recommended apple tv ($200), roku ($40) and google chromecast ($35). all four devices do basically the same thing, and all have their own bells and whistles. for me, none of them stood out enough to sway me from the price and convenience of the firetv stick.\n\nad\n\nad\n\n4. with what service will you watch your sports?\n\nit is time to pick a service to watch your sports, and i'll make it easy. use this matrix, which lists all the mainstream providers and devices i could find and cross-lists them against all the sports channels and apps you could want. ns means need subscription.\n\nchannels/product slingtv playstation vue direct tv now youtube tv antenna amazon firetv stick apple tv roku chromecast espn/espn2 yes yes yes yes espnu yes extra yes sec network extra extra extra yes espn app ns ns ns ns nbc yes yes yes yes ns ns ns ns abc yes yes yes yes ns ns ns ns cbs yes yes yes ns ns ns ns fox yes yes yes yes ns ns ns ns fox

yes yes ns ns ns ns nbcsn wash. extra ns ns ns masn\n\nsports fans are blessed with the degree of competition in this space. pay as little as $20 a month for slingtv or as much as $40 a month for playstation vue, which offers more channels in its base package.\n\nseveral emailers and twitter users suggested purchasing an hdtv antenna, which costs about $20, so you can get the local broadcast channels at no monthly cost.\n\nad\n\nalso, if you still have access to a cable subscription — maybe a family member or friend gives you access to an account or you (gasp!) share passwords — you can download the nbc, abc and fox apps, and stream live programming, including sports.\n\nad\n\ni went with slingtv and added a sports package to get the sec network and tnt, to watch the nba. that takes me up to $25 a month. i also have access to those broadcast apps through a family member's cable subscription (thank you, mom!).\n\nduring the fall, i sprung for the cbs app ($10 a month) to watch college football, then dropped it once the season ended. i also recently dropped the sec network add-on from slingtv, because sec network games are also on the espn app.\n\nad\n\nin all, here's what i spent my first month:\n\n$35 for amazon firetv stick.\n\n$25 a month for basic slingtv, plus bonus sports package.\n\n$10 a month for cbs all-access (app).\n\nthat's $5 more than the cable bill would have been, but the firetv stick is a one-time purchase.\n\nmy vizio tv sits on a bank of cubbies against the wall of my apartment opposite my internet router. the only wires visible are those for the firetv stick and the television. i will find books and tchotchkes to fill up the cubbies so i can't see them.\n\nad\n\n5. don't be shy. try a new service.\n\nthere is a good to fair chance i will drop slingtv in the spring and pick up another service that lets me watch my beloved baltimore orioles, which aren't on national television too often.\n\ni'll probably have to pick up cbs again for a couple months so i can stream ncaa tournament games.\n\nad\n\nthe great thing about all these apps and streaming services is that they're built to follow you around, unlike cable, which is built to make you huddle around a television. i can download the espn or nbc app on my phone or ipad and watch games while i'm out shopping or sitting on the metro.\n\ni thought sports would be harder to watch, but it's really easier than ever, said kit baty, a college football fan in atlanta with whom i talked on the phone. he uses playstation vue so his kids can watch disney programs. there's more

president-elect joe biden, who also traveled to the state on monday, turned trump's efforts to overturn the november election results into a rallying cry to drive democrats to the polls on tuesday. only by winning both seats would democrats control the senate, giving biden far better odds of pushing through his agenda.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin america, as our opposition friends are finding out, all power flows from the people, biden said at an atlanta rally, in a reference to trump's attempts — unsuccessful so far — to force the courts or state officials to overturn the results. politicians cannot assert, seize or take power. power is granted by the american people and we cannot give that up.\n\nlittle about the first campaign clash of 2021 suggested a fresh political start for the new year. the president's nine-week effort to reverse the november vote, which he hopes will come to a head wednesday when the house and senate meet to accept those results, have become the biggest applause lines at republican events in the state, popping up even when party leaders wanted to focus on issues closer to home.\n\npresident trump's rally for sen. kelly loeffler and former senator david perdue in dalton, ga., on jan. 4 was riddled with false or misleading claims. (the washington post)\n\nas a result, republican strategists spent much of monday focused on pressuring trump and his aides to script his monday night appearance in the state in a way that does not further undermine their chances.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nit is a white-knuckle moment for republicans all over the place, said one strategist who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be frank. he wants attention more than he wants the win, and that could really screw us. so much of these elections are about momentum.\n\ntrump ultimately gave both republican candidates in the georgia runoffs, sen. kelly loeffler and david perdue, ringing endorsements during a rally in dalton, ga., calling them the last line of defense against democratic control of the senate.\n\ntomorrow, each of you is going to vote in one of the most important runoff elections, he told the crowd, before embracing both without reservation. kelly fights for me, david fights for me — that i can tell you.\n\nad\n\nbut trump also doubled down on his unfounded claims of fraud in the presidential election. he pressured pence to push to overturn the election results on wednesday and promised to campaign against georgia gov. brian kemp, whom he previously supported, and georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger.\n\npresident trump on jan. 4 said he hopes vice president pence, who oversees the certification of the electoral college vote, will come through for us. (the washington post)\n\nthey say they are republicans. i really don't think they are, said trump, who has relentlessly criticized them since biden was declared the winner in georgia.\n\nad\n\ndemocratic strategists also expected trump to play a decisive role in the outcome.\n\nall of the story is about their turnout, said j.b. poersch, the president of the senate majority pac, the largest outside group supporting democrats in the state. if they win it is because they had enough enthusiasm to go to the polls. and if they lose it is because there was a lot of ambivalence.\n\nad\n\nwidely circulated false conspiracy theories have animated republican crowds on the campaign trail in the closing days. at the final public rallies for loeffler, her loudest applause came not when discussing her background in business, or the radical liberal agendas of the democrats, but when discussing republican challenges to the nov. 3 vote.\n\nwe have to get to the bottom of these elections, loeffler said at a sunday night rally in cherokee county, one of the republican strongholds where the party is trying to boost turnout. the democrats will never look into this. that's what we're fighting for, integrity in this country.\n\nad\n\nbut she also was concerned that the focus on the last election could divide her own voters. she had refused as the runoff date neared to take a clear position on whether she would support trump's efforts to get the senate to refuse the electoral college result later this week, although she announced in a statement monday evening and again at the rally that she would back the president. asked on saturday about the challenge to the electoral college that trump has backed, she had offered a vague comment. everything is on the table, she said, before returning to a familiar line.\n\nad\n\nperdue, whose senate term lapsed on sunday, leaving him on the sidelines for the electoral college fight in that chamber, has said he would support the effort to challenge the election result.\n\nthey stole the election. that's the truth. we've got tons of evidence, said patty smith, 61, who interrupted pence during his event by shouting for him to do the right thing on jan. 6, when congress will meet to accept the election results.\n\nad\n\nrepublicans have not submitted credible evidence of widespread fraud, but the sentiment was widespread enough that local republican officials held the news conference to contest, point by point, the case trump argued in a phone call over the weekend with state officials that the election result was wrong.\n\nthis is all easily, provably false, gabriel sterling, a republican official who oversaw the voting systems in the state, said at the news conference. yet the president persists and by doing so undermines georgians' faith in the electoral system, especially republican georgians, which is important because we have a big election coming up.\n\nwhen they could, both perdue and loeffler focused on a unified message that blanketed the state's airwaves: only their election would save the nation from the socialist decline they said would result from victory for their rivals, filmmaker jon ossoff and the rev. raphael warnock., who both reject the socialist label.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe very future of our republic is on the line, perdue said at the pence rally, addressing the crowd by telephone because of a coronavirus exposure that has put him in quarantine. he said the result could set the country's course for at least 50 to 100 years.\n\nthe democratic candidates spent the closing days of the race trying to refocus the campaign on more local concerns such as health care and jobs, even as they brought in star power to help seal the deal and continued to jab at trump. a closing ad for ossoff featured narration by former president barack obama and a musical appearance by john legend.\n\nwhen the president of the united states calls up georgia election officials and tries to intimidate them to change the election results . . . that is a direct attack on our democracy, ossoff said in savannah on sunday, at an event with vice president-elect kamala d. harris. and if david perdue and kelly loeffler had one piece of steel in their spine, one piece of integrity, they would be out defending georgia voters from that assault.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwarnock, speaking at a monday afternoon rally in clayton county, ridiculed trump for his appeal to state election officials to reverse the presidential results — especially in the middle of a pandemic — but told his own supporters to pay him no mind.\n\nthe only way this thing goes in the wrong direction is if we become overly confident and give in to the ghosts of complacency and indifference, warnock said. we lose only by the margin of our disengagement.\n\ndemocrats, who have long considered themselves underdogs in the runoff contests, have been cheered by early vote numbers and clear signs in the state that many core democratic constituencies, including suburban and urban voters, remained engaged. public polling, which has been less prominent than during the presidential campaign, has generally shown a close race.\n\nad\n\nad\n\njust about every available bit of television and radio airtime has been consumed by the four campaigns and their supporting outside groups, leading to a barrage of messaging. but democrats thought their advantage came via an aggressive voter registration effort, which continued after the presidential campaign, and a large get-out-the-vote operation that did not pause after biden's victory.\n\nover the course of this campaign, it is clear that the structural advantages that we had, the sweat equity on the ground, has paid off, said bradley beychok the president of american bridge, a pac that has spent about $9 million to elect the two democrats. a day out, it is clear that this race is a toss-up and we maybe have a slight advantage.\n\nthe republican candidates have been bedeviled by trump's actions, even as the president remains one of their biggest assets. both perdue and loeffler have said they support trump's late call for $2,000 stimulus checks to americans, a move that is also backed by house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) and opposed by senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.).\n\nbut the debate over whether to approve larger checks for american workers gave their democratic opponents an opportunity to seize on the issue, arguing that the best way to secure increased payments is by giving democrats control of both chambers.\n\nthe debate over $2,000 isn't about some abstract debate in washington. it's about real lives, your lives, the lives of good hard-working americans, biden said in atlanta on monday. if you send jon and the reverend to washington, those $2,000 checks will go out the door.\n\non other recent trump maneuvers, the republican candidates have been less clear, as they try to minimize divides in their own party. besides brushing aside questions about trump's efforts to overturn the electoral college results, loeffler has declined to take a firm position on whether she would have voted to override trump's veto of the defense authorization bill, after missing the vote in december.\n\neven as democrats have been bolstered by the high numbers of early voters, particularly in liberal-leaning areas where they have focused their efforts, many note that the gains come against a historical conservative lean of the state.\n\nif you look at these numbers, you will see white and black voters are voting at slightly higher rates, said michael thurmond, the chief executive of dekalb county and the first african american in modern georgia history to win a statewide election (labor commissioner) without first being appointed to an office. but about 70 to 75 percent of white voters are republicans, and republicans vote in higher numbers on election day, so it's too early to draw any conclusions.\n\nthurmond also said the historic nature of the pair of senate runoffs has democrats not wanting to celebrate too early. the high stakes have meant heavy attention and big money in georgia. the national stakes of the races mean they have seen unprecedented attention, and nearly half a billion dollars in campaign cash was expected to flow into georgia during the two months of the runoffs.\n\ngeorgia election officials, who have been beating back unfounded claims of fraud and malfeasance since november, say they're ready for attention once again as part of the runoffs.\n\nall the counties in georgia are in the spotlight right now, so we are all prepared for this as well as we can be, richard barron, fulton county's elections director, said at a news conference monday afternoon.\n\ntrump has attacked fulton county repeatedly since he lost the state — including in his weekend call to the secretary of state and others. barron said his staff has had to endure threats and slurs a bomb threat, multiple death threats and racial slurs in the run-up to tuesday's vote.\n\nwe're trying to take each of those things as they happen and just continue to do our jobs, barron said.
john thompson jr., left, made georgetown nationally prominent. john thompson iii has taken it to a final four, but it's fair to wonder whether the hoyas have been surpassed, or just hit a lull that they're prepared to rebound from. (jay laprete/associated press)\n\njohn thompson iii was still digesting his team's first big east win of the season, last monday night in front of a cozy, friends-and-family gathering at verizon center, when he hit upon the central point for georgetown basketball, almost inadvertently. january had arrived, the hoyas were barely above .500 and a fan base that remembers heady times wondered, in parts, about the relevance of their beloved program.\n\nlet's not think about the big picture, thompson said, and he repeated himself for emphasis: let's not think about the big picture. let's just think about the here and now.\n\nthe here and now: a 10-8 overall record, even after consecutive wins over st. john's and connecticut, and a 1-4 mark in the big east headed into monday night's game against providence, the last of four straight at home. the here and now involves navigating an upcoming schedule that includes butler, xavier and creighton. all three of those programs are nationally ranked. georgetown is not. not close.\n\nbut the here and now is just a slice of the big picture around the hoyas.\n\ni don't go through assessments of the program in the middle of the season, thompson said last week, back on campus before practice. and that's his prerogative.\n\njagan mosely, left, and the hoyas beat u-conn. on saturday to improve to 10-8. last season's 15-18 mark was a rare losing season in hoyas history. (john mcdonnell/the washington post)\n\nbut the midseason assessment is such: this unique program is in a unique spot in its history. assign whatever amount of drama you want to that statement. what lies ahead could be fascinating.\n\nsince 1972-73, georgetown basketball has as many final four appearances as losing seasons: four. those losing seasons each marked a watershed for the program: the first season for john thompson jr.; thompson's last, in which he retired mid-year; craig esherick's final season, after which he was fired; and last year, when the beat-up hoyas lost 10 of their final 12 and thompson iii suffered his first losing campaign among 12 running his dad's old program.\n\nlet's deal with that fact right here and now, because it is inescapable: georgetown's position is unlike any other program in the country because the coach's father not only hung three final four banners on campus and won the 1984 national championship, and not only was also a bold voice for change and progress in college sports, but because he sits on the baseline for each game at verizon center, taking in a team that remains in the family. it is the biggest part of the big picture, whether that's fair to either the hall of fame coach or his 50-year-old son.\n\nyou'd be the first person not to ask me about his dad, thompson iii told me last week. he and his dad still talk strategy, but they're my decisions, thompson said. he has long since learned to deal not only with his father's presence but with the questions about it.\n\nthe questions are pertinent now, with this particular team trying to fight its way back into this particular conference race, because back-to-back losing seasons at flagship programs usually bring unrest. true to form, even with this season far from over, hoya fan websites have in recent weeks offered pieces requesting a full reboot of the program, one even listing potential replacements for thompson as coach.\n\nlisten to the hoya faithful — and i have — and the prevailing sentiment isn't one of regime change. there are, among the fan base, pockets of anger and frustration, sure, those who talk about transfers from the program, about the bad losses in recent years: arkansas state in november, radford and monmouth and unc asheville last year, scabs that get picked when the conference season begins with four straight losses. when villanova wins the national title with a small forward from sidwell friends (josh hart) and a championship-winning buzzer-beater from gonzaga (kris jenkins), well, that can create new wounds.\n\nbut there are also pockets of hope, fans who point out that it was thompson iii who brought the hoyas to their first final four in a generation (though it was a decade ago), who believe georgetown has been superior to, say, neighboring maryland over the entirety of his tenure, who don't dwell on last year's losing season but highlight the eight trips to the ncaa tournament since he arrived. moreover, they point out that he is exactly the kind of bright, caring, scandal-free character they want representing their school. not small points.\n\nbut the scariest assessment: there are pockets of resignation, of apathy. when those sentiments take hold in college athletics, watch out. college sports are built on emotion, both on the court and in the stands. which emotions does georgetown basketball elicit now? not among the most ardent but, say, among the sports fans of our city?\n\nthe st. john's game last week came before an announced crowd of 5,158 fans in an arena that seats 20,308 for basketball. so this isn't even a glass-half-full question. it's a glass- quarter- full question.\n\nline up the reasons: the students weren't yet back in town from holiday break. the tip time of 6:30 p.m. on a monday is so inconvenient for commuters. and when u-conn. showed up for a noon game saturday, 12,164 fans — including a strong showing from the student section — helped create a buzz, a backbone of the hoyas' comeback victory.\n\nbut the reality is that a program that has to list off the reasons for a tiny crowd against a traditional rival is a program that is battling to stay relevant. georgetown basketball was once a national brand with considerable heft. not long ago, the attractions of both coming to play for the program and to see the team play were apparent and obvious.\n\ngeorgetown now believes those attractions are being re-established. when john thompson iii walks into his office, he can stride past a life-size statue of his old man, complete with the bronze towel slung over his shoulder, in what is known as the thompson rotunda inside the brand-new, $65 million john r. thompson jr. intercollegiate athletic center. it is a stunning, beautiful facility, wedged onto the hilltop in a way that somehow fits nicely despite its size. thompson iii has been in his new digs not yet two months, but he has yet to find a detail that went overlooked.\n\nrecruits whom thompson used to be reluctant to bring to mcdonough arena can now touch screens in the lobby and learn about hoya history, not only of big john but of patrick ewing and allen iverson and the rest. the program, even at its low ebbs, can still draw on the generations that came before it. shoot, alonzo mourning's son is on this year's team. ewing's son played here and is now on thompson's staff.\n\nbut that history is also a reminder of what can be achieved, what some believe should be achieved.\n\nto a certain extent, every institution that has had a successful program in any sport, there's always that history, thompson said. i don't necessarily think it's a burden, but it's a reality, that you're gonna be compared and contrasted to 'x' year.\n\nthe comparisons in the past have been about whether one team could go as far as another in march. now, march can't be assumed. and if there's no march, there's not much momentum headed into thompson's 14th season here.\n\nbut thompson isn't going anywhere. not the coach, nor his dad. the ties are too deep, the legacy too important.\n\nso, then, back to the big picture: what should georgetown be? what can georgetown be? it's not kentucky or north carolina, with automatic, region-wide appeal. it's an academically elite, smallish private school with a parochial pull — exactly the kind of school it's competing against in the remodeled big east. almost exactly the kind of school, it turns out, that won the national championship last year.\n\nmonday night, georgetown will host providence, another team that already beat the hoyas this season, another that sits ahead of them in the big east standings. that is their here and now. but each immediate task fits into the tableau of the entire program. it is a program that was once a must-see. now, thompson and his players are fighting to make it that way again. the big picture would show there's a long way to go.
in neither case did republicans recognize the facts before them. in neither case did they act to remove him. that prologue brings us to his telephone call with georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger on saturday.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe post reports: president trump urged fellow republican brad raffensperger, the georgia secretary of state, to 'find' enough votes to overturn his defeat in an extraordinary one-hour phone call saturday that election experts said raised legal questions. in the call, trump asked raffensperger to change the certified vote that was subject to multiple recounts: so look. all i want to do is this. i just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. because we won the state.\n\nin fact he threatened him. the post reports, during their conversation, trump issued a vague threat to both raffensperger and ryan germany, the secretary of state's general counsel, suggesting that if they don't find that thousands of ballots in fulton county have been illegally destroyed to block investigators — an allegation for which there is no evidence — they would be subject to criminal liability. trump, sounding like a mobster as he often does, said, that's a criminal offense. and you can't let that happen. that's a big risk to you and to ryan, your lawyer. nice career, there brad. shame if anything happened to it.\n\nlaughably, trump also tried to use the senate runoff election to pressure raffensperger. in an incoherent tirade, he insisted, you have a big election coming up and because of what you've done to the president — you know, the people of georgia know that this was a scam. he continued: because of what you've done to the president, a lot of people aren't going out to vote, and a lot of republicans are going to vote negative, because they hate what you did to the president. okay? they hate it. and they're going to vote. and you would be respected, really respected, if this can be straightened out before the election. i have no idea what vote negative means or how voters' anger would jeopardize the republican senate contenders. in any event, now that the tape has been revealed, trump's conduct will, we should hope, undercut the republicans.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ni have never favored prosecuting trump for his conduct in office. but pressuring a campaign official to change the vote tally is a federal offense, as former justice department inspector general michael bromwich tweeted sunday, citing title 52 u.s. section 20511. that law states: a person, including an election official, who in any election for federal office … knowingly and willfully deprives, defrauds, or attempts to deprive or defraud the residents of a state of a fair and impartially conducted election process, by … the procurement, casting, or tabulation of ballots that are known by the person to be materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent under the laws of the state in which the election is held is subject to imprisonment of up to five years.\n\nthreatening raffensperger with criminal consequences is also arguably extortion. title 18 section 875 of the u.s. code reads: whoever, with intent to extort from any person, firm, association, or corporation, any money or other thing of value, transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication containing any threat to injure the property or reputation of the addressee or of another or the reputation of a deceased person or any threat to accuse the addressee or any other person of a crime, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.\n\nalternatively, the state attorney general of georgia might investigate and bring applicable charges under state law. that would have one clear advantage: trump cannot receive a federal pardon for state crimes.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthere must be a response to a president who exploits his office for the purpose of overthrowing an election. the evidence is on tape. the next attorney general should move forward, if for no other reason, to deter further attempts at such reprehensible conduct. i would suggest impeachment as well, which could include a ban on holding office in the future, but we know already republicans will defend anything trump does.\n\nwatch the latest opinion video:
this meeting is where scientists hatch new ideas for lifesaving methods and warnings, said dan sobien, the president of the national weather service employees organization. any delay in that research could someday cost someone their life, and that person could be you or me, sobien said. not having nws meteorologists there to collaborate will likely cost many more lives than the absence of any border wall, anywhere.\n\nkeith seitter, the executive director of the american meteorological society, said the effect of the shutdown on future advances is impossible to calculate, but we know that it is significant.\n\nthe interactions that occur at these meetings foster new science and new services across the enterprise that greatly benefit all of society, seitter said. having one of those sectors not represented at the meeting greatly impedes progress on saving lives, supporting the economy and building an understanding of the environment.
racing up and down the two sheets of ice open to the capitals for the duration of training camp, the 35-year-old russian wearing his signature yellow laces was the center of attention. and he will be in the months ahead both on and off the ice.\n\nad\n\nas he enters his 16th nhl season, ovechkin is also entering the final year of the 13-year, $124 million contract he signed in 2008. he said monday he expects to engage in negotiations with general manager brian maclellan during camp, but he also said he won't be too concerned if a deal is not reached before the regular season begins jan. 14.\n\nad\n\ni don't think we on the rush, said ovechkin, who is negotiating his own contract. i think we understand everything what's happening right now. whatever is done is done. if it's not done, we're going to talk and we'll see.\n\nthe capitals' career scoring leader has made it clear he intends to stay in washington beyond this season, and the team has expressed similar wishes.\n\nso while ovechkin's future will remain a point of interest, the looming season is the more immediate concern. the team hit the ice monday with only 10 days to get to know coach peter laviolette, learn a new system, get offseason additions adjusted to a tightknit, veteran group, and physically get ready for a pandemic-shortened, condensed 56-game schedule.\n\nad\n\nthe mantra from [laviolette] is to get going right away, defenseman john carlson said. it's a shortened camp. it's going to be a wacky year playing teams back-to-backs and playing the same team kind of repetitively. it's going to be different than anything we've dealt with, so [trying] to hit the ground running as quick as we can is important.\n\nad\n\nthis season will be a learning experience for the entire team, but laviolette, whose booming voice was crystal clear from the start of monday's workout, faces an especially large challenge. a good portion of practice was spent with players down on one knee, looking up at their new coach, who was carefully explaining his new system via a whiteboard attached to the side of the glass.\n\nveteran players, including carlson and center nicklas backstrom, both indicated the new system would take some time to adjust to, but it wasn't as drastic of a change as it could have been.\n\nad\n\nit's not the exact same, obviously, but some variation of something like that, carlson said. the bigger changes are more just mind-set with the puck and without it, and how we're going to get up the ice is probably going to be a little bit different than in years past. so little things like that probably are a bigger difference than i would say systems-wise.\n\nad\n\nthis will be the first season in quite some time that carlson will play without todd reirden either as his coach or as an assistant in charge of the defensemen. now, carlson and his fellow blue-liners will take instructions from the defensive-minded laviolette and assistant coach kevin mccarthy.\n\nthe capitals' blue line will also be impacted by the addition of zdeno chara, but the longtime boston bruins captain was not on the ice monday because of coronavirus-related quarantine protocols after he was signed last week.\n\nad\n\nevery other player expected to be available at the start of the season was accounted for and practicing, and while chara will have to go through physicals before joining the group, he is expected to hit the ice sometime this week.\n\nlogistically, training camp will be broken up into two groups for at least the first week, with group a comprising the players expected to make the team's 23-man active roster. the way the groups are split, therefore, gives a few hints about how the capitals' opening night roster could shake out. laviolette said there will be a little bit of movement in terms of forward lines and defensive pairings heading into the season opener, but he likes where things stand initially.\n\nad\n\nthe only new forward skating with the main group monday was conor sheary, who was signed last month after spending last season with the buffalo sabres and pittsburgh penguins. during line rushes, sheary was inserted as the third-line left wing alongside lars eller and richard panik. carl hagelin was skating with nic dowd and garnet hathaway on the fourth line. the top two lines remained the same as they were much of last season, with ovechkin, evgeny kuznetsov and tom wilson on the top line, and jakub vrana, backstrom and t.j. oshie on the second line.\n\nad\n\nmonday's main group had eight defensemen, with carlson and dmitry orlov together on the top pairing, and brenden dillon and free agent signing justin schultz on the second pairing. jonas siegenthaler and nick jensen made up the third pairing, with martin fehervary and free agent signing trevor van riemsdyk forming an additional pairing.\n\nilya samsonov and vitek vanecek were the two goaltenders skating with the main group monday. vanecek appears to have the early edge over 39-year-old craig anderson as the backup netminder. washington signed anderson to a professional tryout agreement in late december.\n\nad\n\nsamsonov, who was injured in an off-ice accident in russia before the postseason, still seems to have the inside track to be the no. 1 goaltender when the puck drops next week.
considering the capitals and blues play just twice a year, there's a surprising amount of bad blood. both preseason games resulted in nhl department of player safety suspensions, first to blues defenseman robert bortuzzo for his illegal hit on washington's michal kempny and then to wilson for his check to the head of st. louis's oskar sundqvist. wilson also has been suspended twice previously for hits against st. louis players. on a night the blues apparently had retribution on their mind, they got that and then some.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthey wanted it more than us, capitals forward brett connolly said.\n\nthis was a big hockey game for us, bortuzzo said. we didn't go in the game thinking, 'let's get vengeance,' or whatnot. it was an emotional game. . . . happy to defend teammates or whatnot, but at the end of the day, it was just about winning this game.\n\nnot surprisingly, wilson and bortuzzo dropped the gloves for a heavyweight bout less than three minutes into the second period, and bortuzzo said the referee came up to him after and asked, are we done with that? forty-seven seconds later, connolly scored on his own rebound to lift the capitals to a 2-1 lead.\n\nbut washington had been bleeding scoring chances throughout the game, and a bad night on special teams led to a rough second frame. david perron went to the penalty box for slashing 5:29 into the period, an opportunity for the capitals to extend their cushion with the nhl's best power play of the past decade. but on the man-advantage's third look of the game, washington managed just one shot on goal. in the past seven games, the capitals have one power-play goal in 24 chances.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ni think we just tried to do too much, said captain alex ovechkin, who scored his league-leading 30th goal. we don't have to change anything because we're top in the league if we play the right way, if we play smart and if we do the right things. i'm not worried about it. we're going to be fine.\n\nst. louis scored on its power play 12:23 into the game when colton parayko beat holtby with a snap shot. sundqvist then lifted the blues to their first lead of the game at the 16:33 mark, diving to swat in a rebound at an awkward angle.\n\nwe're sitting in the penalty box far too much, center lars eller said. we're just putting ourselves in tough spots sitting so much. and then we didn't give holts a lot of help today with breakaways and rebounds in front of the net. it's hard for him to stop night in and night out. we've just got to be sharper and stay out of the penalty box.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwith st. louis up 3-2 entering the third period, washington registered just two shots on goal for the final 20 minutes. pietrangelo's goal came 5:44 into the frame, and then center tyler bozak scored to make it a three-goal cushion and end any hope of a comeback. it was a second straight game that washington got off an encouraging start, ahead through the first half, but then faded late.\n\nthey were skating, competing harder, won races, more determined than we were, defenseman matt niskanen said. if we're being honest about it, we didn't have a very good game, and they played a pretty darn good game.\n\nplayers were disappointed after the game, but with another game against the dallas stars on friday night, the capitals were ready to chalk this one up to just falling flat, something that's bound to happen with an 82-game schedule. washington had won 16 of its 20 games entering this one, affording itself some room for error, but as other teams in the division have started to go on their own streaks, that margin is now gone.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nit's a really good league, and teams are good, and you kind of take nights off, connolly said. they were energized, their crowd was into it, and it was just not our night tonight.
the narrative around food that we don't traditionally eat is all negative, said mcquillan, whether it is the recently in vogue ugly produce or the yuck-inducing name trash cooking. instead of calling this trim or byproduct, let's come up with a name for it.\n\nit worked for the slimehead, a fish we now see on restaurant menus as orange roughy. it worked for archibald alexander leach — you probably knew him as cary grant. and mcquillan is hoping the rebranding effort will make a dent in this country's huge problem with food waste.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nit's already working at baldor. the company, which provides produce and specialty goods such as caviar and olive oil to the mid-atlantic and northeast's food-service industry, no longer produces any organic food waste as of this year, thanks to some clever reuse initiatives. for the company's fresh cuts program, which offers pre-sliced, diced or otherwise prepared vegetables, baldor saves all of its sparcs (though the company stylizes it with a capital c, sparcs, to help make the word stand out, mcquillan said) for human or animal consumption. previously, these edible and nutritious pieces of fruits and vegetables would have been discarded.\n\ncarrot skins and tops, strawberry tops, odd-shaped pieces of watermelon and other fruit and vegetable pieces are sold at 30 cents a pound — about half their usual value — to misfit juicery, a d.c. company that cold-presses perfectly-edible ugly produce into juice. other vegetable odds and ends are sold to haven's kitchen, a new york restaurant and cooking school that uses them for sauces, soups and broths. baldor is also experimenting with other creative reuses. mcquillan says the company is dehydrating sparcs and turning them into a dried vegetable blend that he compares to bouillon. baldor plans to make it available for its clients and retailers by the end of 2017.\n\nother sparcs that are less useful to humans, such as cantaloupe rinds or mango pits, are sold in enormous bags at 5 to 12 cents per pound to brick farm market in hopewell, n.j., where they are fed to pigs or are composted. the bulk of baldor's food waste — about 120,000 pounds a week — is trucked to a processing plant, where it is donated for use in chicken feed. the only sparcs that do not go into the chicken feed are any bits that have fallen to the floor or that were scraped off plates in the company's cafeteria. those byproducts are processed on-site in a waste to water system.\n\nthe landfill can no longer be an option for any food, for any reason, mcquillan said.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nit's also better for baldor's business.\n\nthere is a substantial benefit to the bottom line in two ways: if you are able to sell the sparcs, now you have revenue generation. you're also saving whatever it would cost to eliminate it, he said.\n\npreviously, the company would pay to have its discards hauled away and processed. now, other companies are paying for those same discards, which are delivered as part of a baldor truck driver's regular route. the only cost is for hauling discards to the chicken feed factory, but it's a third less than what the company would have paid its previous waste processor, and we felt very good about the fact that it was being used in feed, mcquillan said.\n\nad\n\nso if it's good for the planet and good for the company, why isn't every produce processor doing this? it's partly because it can be hard to convince people that it is a good idea.\n\nad\n\nwhen we first started talking about sparcs, operationally speaking, there was a resistance to change the way we processed this food, mcquillan said. i think this would be the case in any food-processing facility. if you are processing a certain way, you have protocols in place to handle any aspect of production. changing those protocols is challenging.\n\nafter all, it's easier to just send thousands of pounds of garbage away in a truck. it's harder to turn them into sparcs and find a second use for them. but mcquillan hopes that more food producers will find a way to use these remnants in their products, whether to feed the needy or just to sell to everyday consumers.\n\nad\n\nand even though corporate changes could have a huge effect, mcquillan hopes to see sparcs-based cooking at the consumer level, too. the easiest step is that time-old trick of throwing vegetable odds and ends into a plastic bag in the freezer and using them to make a big pot of broth at the end of the week. according to the natural resources defense council, we throw away 25 percent of the food we purchase. the average family of four spends an average $1,560 each year on food they never eat.
last week, del. lee j. carter (d-manassas) announced his bid for the party's nomination for governor, joining former delegate jennifer d. carroll foy (d-prince william) in this year's primary election.\n\nmeanwhile dels. hala s. ayala (d-prince william) and elizabeth r. guzman (d-prince william) are competing in a crowded field of democrats who want to become lieutenant governor.\n\nad\n\ntheir bids reflect the fact that once-conservative prince william has become a hub of liberal energy in virginia, political analysts say — allowing local democratic activist candi king to raise nearly four times as much as republican heather mitchell in tuesday's special election to fill the seat carroll foy vacated in december to focus on her gubernatorial bid.\n\nad\n\nwin or lose in 2021, the influence of democrats in prince william will grow in the coming years, said stephen j. farnsworth, a political science professor at the university of mary washington in fredericksburg. prince william county has been one of the locations with the greatest democratic gains over the last decade, and it makes sense that the field of statewide candidates reflects that.\n\nonce predominantly white, prince william was long known for the former head of its board of county supervisors, republican firebrand corey a. stewart, who became a fierce acolyte of president trump after the 2016 election.\n\nad\n\ntoday, 55 percent of the county's population is either latino, african american or asian, and the local democratic party committee has been infused with new activism fueled by the demographic shift.\n\nad\n\nin 2017, voters in prince william and nearby manassas city and manassas park also elected danica a. roem (d-manassas), the nation's first openly transgender lawmaker, into the house of delegates.\n\nin 2019, the county board flipped to a 5-to-3 democratic majority after being controlled by the gop for more than a decade.\n\nlocal democrats say the area reflects the broader changes occurring in virginia, and a desire to do more about issues of long importance to democrats such as affordable health care, workers' rights and criminal justice overhauls.\n\nad\n\nthere are still conservative pockets in the area, but republicans have been able to win only local races in recent years — a reality stewart cited in 2019 when he decided against pursuing another term as county board chair.\n\nwhere goes prince william county, so goes the commonwealth of virginia, said carroll foy, whose former district includes portions of nearby stafford county, which in november voted blue for the first time in nearly half a century. we are a community filled with working families and millennials, people of color and women, and that's what our party looks like. we are the center of democratic energy.\n\ncarroll foy, 39, presents herself as a gritty embodiment of that energy, telling voters in her gubernatorial race about how in 2017 she campaigned for office while she was pregnant with her twin sons, with morning sickness and swollen ankles.\n\nshe, guzman and ayala were part of a group of activists who brought a sense of urgency to the local democratic party committee, which has since evolved into a formidable fundraising apparatus for new candidates like king.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthat movement was born during the local backlash against new immigrants in the county that helped launch stewart's political career.\n\nit gained more enthusiasm in 2008, when barack obama held the final campaign rally of his first presidential run inside the prince william county fairgrounds, where the then-senator from illinois urged a crowd of about 80,000 to change the world.\n\nit was really inspiring to see a democratic candidate who was a person of color inspire so many people, said guzman, one of the early opponents of the federal 287(g) agreement championed by stewart that allowed the county to hold incarcerated undocumented inmates for deportation after their jail sentences expired.\n\nthe most important part was, if we really believed in his message, we needed to grab a clipboard and start knocking on doors, guzman, 47, said of obama's impact.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nafter trump's 2016 victory, more activists began eyeing the area's general assembly seats that had long been held by republicans.\n\nayala, who recently announced she will not seek reelection to her house seat in the fall, said those officials did not appear to understand the needs of a growing population of constituents in their districts who were struggling to stay afloat in the increasingly expensive washington region.\n\ni understand how thin that bridge is between struggle and success, said ayala, 47, who was a single mother dependent on medicaid for her son, who suffered from various health issues, before she went on to become a cyber­security specialist for the department of homeland security.\n\nad\n\ncarter, a self-proclaimed socialist inspired by the presidential run of sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.), argued that the coronavirus pandemic has made it necessary for all of virginia to move further to the left.\n\nad\n\nwe've got to make sure that, when we rebuild the economy, we're not engaging in the same kind of corporate handouts we've engaged in during the past decade, said carter, 33.\n\nwhether the more-liberal positions of all of the prince william candidates resonate enough with the state's democratic electorate is an open question, political analysts say.\n\nhistorically, more-moderate democrats have prevailed in virginia, including gov. ralph northam in 2017 and former governor terry mcauliffe in 2013.\n\nad\n\nthis year, mcauliffe is again the likely front-runner in a democratic field of gubernatorial candidates that also includes lt. gov. justin fairfax and state sen. jennifer l. mcclellan (richmond), political analysts say.\n\nin the lieutenant governor's race, guzman and ayala are competing against six other well-known democrats — making it harder for them to gain traction with voters outside of prince william.\n\nad\n\nthat makes the decisions by carroll foy and ayala to let go of their house seats a gamble, said quentin kidd, director of the wason center for public policy at christopher newport university.\n\nthere is a real risk to jumping too soon and not being successful, and then you're gone, essentially, kidd said.\n\nboth democrats said the risk is worth a chance to set the state's direction on the economy and long-ignored social inequities from a higher office. they also expressed confidence in their party's ability to hold on to their seats.\n\nad\n\nin tuesday's race, mitchell, who lost to carroll foy by 22 points in 2019, has emphasized her experience as a former senior aide to stewart on the board of county supervisors.\n\nmitchell, who declined to be interviewed, has also played up her residency in stafford county, where the district's more conservative voters live.\n\nad\n\ngarren shipley, the spokesman for house minority leader todd gilbert (r-shenandoah), said the fact that both candidates have had less than four weeks to campaign gives mitchell a strong chance at victory on tuesday.\n\nhe noted that the turnout for early voting for the special election, an option overwhelmingly picked by democrats in november's presidential race, has been low. as of monday, about 850 had voted early in a district of nearly 51,000 active voters.\n\nthe fact that we saw such a bifurcated vote in november, between democrats voting early and republicans voting on election day, makes me hopeful, shipley said.\n\nking, a program assistant for the bill and melinda gates foundation, acknowledged that she may not be as well-known in the district as mitchell.\n\nbut king, who has outraised mitchell $103,000 to $27,500, believes there is enough democratic enthusiasm in the area for her to prevail.
before the senate confirmed droegemeier by voice vote, the vacancy at ostp under trump had set a record: never before had a modern president waited so long to install an administrator in that office. the delay had drawn sharp criticism from lawmakers and academics, who said the president had erred by forging ahead with his policy agenda — including his 2017 decision to leave a key international carbon-reduction pact — without a top science adviser in place.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbut trump's decision in july to nominate droegemeier — who previously helped guide federal science research under both democratic and republican presidents — earned the white house widespread accolades from the research community. peter mcpherson, president of the association of public and land-grant universities, applauded droegemeier's scientific credentials. simply put, this is a terrific choice, mcpherson said in a statement issued after the nomination.\n\ndroegemeier is the first meteorologist to hold this position. many researchers expressed hope droegemeier might give them a louder voice in trump's decision-making process. he did not face significant opposition during his senate confirmation process, though it took lawmakers months to vote.\n\nmarcia mcnutt, president of the national academy of sciences, tweeted late wednesday she looked forward to working with droegemeier. congratulations on your confirmation, finally(!!!)\n\nad\n\nad\n\ncontacted thursday, a spokesman for ostp was not available to comment because of the government shutdown.\n\ndespite the earlier absence of an administrator, ostp over the past two years has forged ahead with a full agenda. it has sought to advance private-sector research in areas such as artificial intelligence, in part by convening tech giants and other industry experts for a new, policy-focused task force in 2018. it has helped guide the white house's early work to put more self-flying drones in u.s. skies and expand internet access to rural areas. during that time, the office's most senior official was michael kratsios, a former aide to venture capitalist peter thiel. kratsios joined the administration in its early days to serve as deputy chief technology officer.\n\nthose and other issues now fall to droegemeier, who, like other appointees in the administration, faces a challenge in breaking through to trump's inner circle. his predecessor, john holdren, had a close relationship with president barack obama, and ostp had a much larger staff under obama's watch.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwe hope that the president and senior administrators use him more fully, said former congressman rush holt, chief executive of the american association for the advancement of science. in some administrations, the head of ostp has a formal role as an adviser to the president, has direct access to the oval office, has responsibilities on the national security council and the domestic policy council. in other administrations, that's not so. we'll see how this develops.\n\nholt said the challenge will be especially acute on climate change. droegemeier's background in extreme weather contrasts greatly with the president, who said in november in response to a report about the effects of climate change: i don't believe it.\n\ni hope he will find some way to use his background, combined with his very pleasant and accessible manner, to elevate the concern for action with respect to climate change. that's going to be hard for him, holt said.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nsen. john thune (r-s.d.), who oversaw the committee that questioned droegemeier in the previous congress, praised him on thursday for his ability to communicate effectively with both ends of the political spectrum, adding: he'll need to continue doing that to be successful, and i'm confident he will.

to assist passengers with immediate travel plans, airlines have relaxed their rules, eliminating change and cancellation fees and differences in fares. american, for one, will waive the change fee on tickets to nearly 20 northeast destinations (boston, portland and montreal, among them) booked by tuesday for travel through saturday. passengers may switch their dates to travel through jan. 9. however, they must keep the same itinerary and seat category or, in the latter case, pay the increase in fare. united has implemented a similar policy: anyone holding a ticket to one of 14 northeast airports for travel through friday can rebook without penalty for travel on or before jan. 8. for mid-atlantic airports, including reagan national and washington dulles, passengers supposed to fly thursday can change their departure date to no later than jan. 7. jetblue travelers with flights leaving thursday or friday to any of 15 northeast cities can reschedule for travel through jan. 11. southwest, which doesn't charge a change fee, is allowing passengers with plans to fly thursday or friday to nine cities to rebook in the same seat category or travel standby within 14 days of their original departure date.
the iowa caucuses remain 13 months away, but a pent-up demand for change in the white house is tangible among democrats eager for the 2020 campaign to start in earnest. the throngs of voters bombarding events in iowa are testament to something fearful for republicans: the huge tide of democratic voters who powered the party's 2018 gains have not lost interest as attention turns to the 2020 presidential race.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ni've never been to a rally, but i wanted to for a long time, said dan elliott, as he waited in the ornate orpheum theatre lobby in sioux city for warren to speak saturday morning. i'm surprised by the energy here. the lines are longer than people expected.\n\niowans cited a slew of reasons for their eagerness to begin the lengthy nomination process to settle on a leader to go up against president trump. there were the tax cuts that one voter called a waste of time and money; the trade war with china depressing demand for exports and hurting farmers; the hostility toward immigrants, a labor pool heavily used on iowa farms; the rolling back of environmental regulations that impact iowa's rivers; a foreign policy approach changing the country's status in the world; and the general chaos and lack of civility in the white house.\n\nit is never too soon to try to get rid of donald trump, said shannon kennedy, a 48-year-old iowan who stood in line to take a selfie in front of a barn-door-size american flag at the orpheum theatre. there is an urgency to get things back on track. our country is a laughingstock right now.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nit's not just warren drawing interest in what amounts to the widest-open caucus competition since 2004.\n\nbooker was greeted by enthusiastic crowds when he made his first trip to iowa in early october for the democratic party gala. his visit included standing-room-only turnout at an event advertised as a discussion on agricultural issues and hosted in the boone county democratic offices.\n\nas sen. kamala d. harris (calif.) gave a speech in ankeny during her pre-election iowa tour, she was greeted by a shout: run for president! when she spoke in iowa city and des moines, she filled rooms holding about 500 people.\n\nthey're paying attention because they don't think this guy can be reelected, said rep. john delaney (d-md.), who has already visited all 99 counties in his presidential bid. and the takeaway i hear from a lot of democrats is that 2016 wasn't a good primary. it was about people going into their camps early. this year, it's the opposite; democrats are focused on how we beat this guy in 2020, and they come into the primary process with an open mind.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhelping to channel some of this democratic enthusiasm are organizations like siouxland progressive women, one of thousands of groups that have cropped up on the left since the 2016 election.\n\nwe're so ready, said susan leonard, 64, a co-founder of the group. her 200-member organization campaigned for j.d. scholten, the democrat who unsuccessfully challenged rep. steve king (r-iowa). now they're turning to 2020.\n\nwe've got invitations out to several presidential candidates already, leonard said. it's a big group, and we want to hear their ideas.\n\nthere are plenty of candidates and potential candidates coming to iowa to meet with democratic activists. a day after warren departs sunday, julián castro, the former housing and urban development secretary and san antonio mayor, is planning stops in cedar rapids and iowa city. delaney, who was the first democrat in the race, will open campaign offices here when he returns to iowa for events friday and saturday.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ntom steyer, the billionaire who has been campaigning to impeach trump as he ponders his own presidential bid, is returning soon for an event about education reform. he said in an interview that trump's actions in the past few weeks had added to what was already highly charged enthusiasm. he specified the government shutdown and the departure of defense secretary jim mattis.\n\nwe added 5,000 people to our list this morning; we added 10,000 people to our list yesterday, steyer said. just look at the turnout on november 6: it broke records, and we think the people on our list turned out something between 75 and 80 percent. and subsequent to that, they literally can't get [an agreement] to keep the government open, and the most respected member of his cabinet resigned!\n\nprogress iowa drew about 150 people to its 2014 meeting that featured sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.). last month's attendance doubled even though the roster included lesser-known potential candidates such as rep. eric swalwell (calif.), sen. jeff merkley (ore.) and south bend, ind., mayor pete buttigieg.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwe've seen massive jumps, said matt sinovic, the group's executive director. online donations are also up, he said.\n\nthis jolt of iowa energy for democrats began in early 2017, as trump took office and republicans assumed control of both houses of the legislature and retained the governor's mansion here, he said.\n\nnow that we have the chance to take on president trump directly, now that he's on the ballot, you're going to see that continue to grow, sinovic said.\n\nrepublicans have noticed the enthusiasm.\n\nthe democrats are in a constant hissy about president trump. it is sustained year around, said david kochel, a gop strategist who oversaw iowa campaigns for mitt romney in 2012 and jeb bush in 2016. he predicted that democrats will see a big caucus turn out in 2020.\n\nad\n\nthey've been hungry for this presidential campaign to start in a real way, kochel said. that's what you'll see with attendance and turnout early this year. they are champing at the bit to get started.\n\nad\n\nfor warren, a friday night event in council bluffs meant for 300 people drew an extra 200. i'm sorry that there's not enough room to get inside, but i'm glad you're all here, she said. she would repeat that apology saturday when several dozen couldn't squeeze into a panel discussion at a storm lake community center.\n\nthe crowds coming out are eager to engage. in sioux city, when warren told the audience there that she couldn't do anything about trump's insults, glenda verhoeven, a 63-year-old farmer, shouted, yes, you can!\n\nad\n\nverhoeven, who did not caucus for any democrat in 2016, said that she considered the senator a strong challenger to trump because the president seemed obsessed with her.\n\nany time he starts calling people names, they're the people who bother him, verhoeven said. she already knows the enemy, and he knows her.\n\nverhoeven, whose farm and investments have been hurt by the administration's trade war, said trump's actions make her more interested in the election.
it's frustrating to get this message and feel like the initial price you saw really isn't real-time or accurate, says angarano, who, as an it specialist at the university of rochester medical center, is something of an expert on technology.\n\nad\n\nairline experts and people familiar with airline reservations systems claim it's not intentional. rather, it's the result of caching, or temporarily storing information on a website. that allows prices to be retrieved faster, but makes them a little less accurate. so when a customer tries to book a ticket, they sometimes get a price has changed or ticket unavailable error message.\n\nad\n\nit's a radioactive topic in the airline industry. i reached out to several airline law experts, and all of them refused to comment on the record. but while they may be reluctant to talk, passengers aren't. they are only too willing to detail their frustrations with now-you-see-them-now-you-don't fares.\n\nella nusenbaum, a business student from richmond hill, ontario, says she often runs into this kind of pricing on airline and online booking sites. one incident stands out — a flight initially advertised at $1,500.\n\nad\n\nin the confirmation window, it suddenly told me that my flight's price went up to $2,600, she recalls. i suspect their system understood my city and dates were firm and decided to push a higher price on me, knowing that i had to book the trip.\n\nairlines and agencies have long denied that they leverage customer data to display an initial low fare then switch it out with a higher price once they know you're interested in buying a ticket. it's difficult to prove or disprove. it would probably take a lawsuit, a government investigation and an it audit to determine whether the phenomenon is intentional.\n\nad\n\nit's an unfair practice, says amena tareen, an occupational therapist from marietta, ga., who says the fare increase has happened to her many times.\n\nad\n\nthe price usually goes up by $20 to $60, with a message stating the fare is no longer available, she says.\n\nbefore online booking sites, this wasn't a problem. travel agents used a reservation system such as worldspan or sabre that displayed real-time fares, for the most part. human agents, who still rely on these systems, say they don't count on a fare unless they see it on their screens.\n\ni never quote anything to a client until i can confirm it in worldspan, says becky mcguire, an independent travel agent from lake havasu city, ariz. if a fare is no longer available, then it should be pulled from the system.\n\nit's difficult to estimate the additional revenue generated by changing fares. but here's a rough measure: domestic airlines earned $91.2 billion from fares in 2016 according to u.s. department of transportation data, which accounts for about 73 percent of their total annual operating revenue from domestic operations. they sold about 719 million domestic tickets. assuming every other passenger paid just $10 more than expected because of these tactics, then airlines reaped a cool $7 billion by switching fares in 2016, or about 6 percent of their domestic ticket revenue.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nit's not that hard to refresh web pages to prevent having outraged consumers, says eric johnson, a professor at the columbia business school who recently published a paper on how consumers react when they encounter hidden fees.\n\nand if airline executives and booking sites think their customers will grow accustomed to this kind of pricing, his research suggests the opposite. over the long term, it could drive customers away.\n\nwhile economists think a price is a price, behavioral science thinks the way the price is portrayed makes a difference, johnson says. the problem is that when that price is not available, people react to the pain of the increase plus the pain of the original price.\n\nad\n\nthe department of transportation (dot), which regulates airfares, has a full-fare advertising rule that prohibits carriers and ticket agents from utilizing bait-and-switch methods. it would be illegal, for example, to advertise a low fare at the beginning of the ticketing process only to present the consumer with a higher fare at the end.\n\nad\n\ni checked with dot spokeswoman caitlin harvey, and she said the agency was aware of the complaints about allegedly cached fares. but to bring any enforcement action, the agency would need proof of an airline systematically and intentionally using this tactic to lure consumers to its website or increasing the prices ultimately paid by passengers.\n\nput differently, there's no smoking gun. and until there is, nothing is likely to change.\n\nthat's wrong, says paul hudson, president of flyersrights.org, an organization that advocates for air travelers. it is not up to the consumer to prove that an airline is engaging in bait-and-switch tactics, he says.\n\nfor passengers, the takeaway is dead simple: don't always believe what you see when you're shopping for airline tickets.
a day after montgomery approved its bill, the internal revenue service announced taxpayers could deduct prepayments only if their properties had already been assessed for 2018.\n\nthat means those who prepaid in maryland, and in neighboring virginia, are almost certainly out of luck.\n\nad\n\na number of jurisdictions in virginia, which has allowed prepayment for years, say they are exploring whether they can issue refunds to those who want them. montgomery's law does not allow for refunds, but hans riemer (d-at large), council president, said lawmakers may try to change that when they end their recess later this month.\n\nad\n\ni don't know that we're done with this issue, riemer said. i think we're going to have to continue with it later in january, and of course we're going to have to continue understanding the fallout of the federal tax bill. that's hardly done.\n\nriemer said the majority of montgomery residents who prepaid did so knowing that tax experts were still divided on whether those checks would be deductible. a signed form residents had to submit with their prepayments said as much — in capital letters, to make sure people saw it.\n\nad\n\nriemer said the council has still been contacted by people seeking refunds.\n\nthe day after the council passed its prepayment law, 700 residents showed up at county offices to prepay taxes in person, according to patrick lacefield, a spokesman for montgomery county executive isiah leggett (d). those payments totaled about $8 million. another 1,500 residents paid in person on dec. 28.\n\nad\n\nas for the thousands of prepayments submitted by mail, michael coveyou, chief of the finance department's treasury division, said all envelopes postmarked by dec. 31 hadn't necessarily reached county offices yet. he said the finance department received more than 20 boxes of mail on tuesday and wednesday, with the latest shipment set to arrive thursday afternoon.\n\nad\n\nthis might be the last day we get a large amount of mail from last week, coveyou said. i'm just hoping this is the last day.\n\nthe district said wednesday that it had collected $50 million in prepayments from about 7,500 taxpayers. officials believe those taxpayers will be able to claim the deduction, because the city has already assessed its properties.\n\ncoveyou said few montgomery residents seemed bitter over the prospect of not receiving a deduction.\n\nad\n\nthey were thinking, 'the worst thing is i've prepaid my 2018 taxes, and the bill i get in july will be significantly smaller than what it normally is,'  he said.\n\nleroy walters, who lives in bethesda and testified at the council's public hearing on prepayment legislation, said it was worth the effort by local lawmakers and taxpayers who hoped early payments would be deductible.\n\nhe said it remained to be seen whether congress will revisit the tax plan and, specifically, the issue of property tax prepayments.\n\ni'm not holding my breath, walter said. i feel satisfied that everyone in montgomery county acted in good faith and did what they could.
the teenagers pour off buses near denver's union station under a baking september sun. giggling with excitement at skipping out on friday classes, they join a host of others assembled near the terminal. native american drummers and dancers rouse the crowd, and there's a festive feeling in the air. but this is no festival. the message these young people have come to send to their city, to their state, to the nation — to the world of adults — is serious. deadly serious. we won't die from old age, reads one of the signs they hoist above their heads. we'll die from climate change.\n\nhigh school sophomore sophie kaplan is marching in a bright yellow flowered sundress, but the sentiment on her poster is hardly so sunny: why should i study for a future i won't have? she thinks about climate change every day, she tells me. she reads about how we're on the brink and hears her teachers and parents tell her that it's up to her generation to fix things. i don't understand why i should be in school if the world is burning, she says. what's the point of working on my education if we don't deal with this first?\n\nas the estimated 7,500 marchers converge on the state capitol, i come upon chris bray and his children, sixth-grader arianna and second-grader colin. dressed in plaid shorts and blue sunglasses, colin hovers shyly behind a homemade sign (a picture of coal with the word why? and a shining sun with the words why not?). the boy is scared about the planet, he tells me, but it feels good to be surrounded by so many other people who care, since he can sometimes feel as if nobody else is worried.\n\nclimate change, say chris and his wife, amber, is a big topic of discussion in their home. colin and arianna have always shown an interest in the environment. they've cried over nature documentaries about the destruction of the coral reefs and sought out coverage of 17-year-old swedish climate activist greta thunberg.\n\nchris and amber are proud that their children are so aware, and of the way their kids' interest has informed their own actions. but at the same time, like many parents, they're concerned that their children could be overwhelmed by predictions about the environment that seem to be growing ever more dire.\n\nthe united nations' intergovernmental panel on climate change said in 2018 that policymakers have just 12 years to avert the worst consequences of global warming; news coverage is constantly filled with apocalyptic stories of storms and wildfires. young people, absorbing the gravity of these warnings, have become the defining face of the climate movement — marching, protesting and berating their elders for bequeathing them an uncertain, unstable future. underlying their anger, though, is another a-word: anxiety. and it's something they're increasingly voicing. teachers hear their students talk about panic attacks when wildfires break out, and psychologists face young patients weeping about their fear of never having a family. amber bray recalls colin solemnly telling her on his eighth birthday, my life would be better without climate change.\n\nhow to handle such fears? the adult world seems unsure, at best. the brays, for their part, think it's important to work through the anguish and keep talking to their kids. we've decided to be open and honest. they have feelings, we validate them, chris says. at the same time, he admits, it's sad, it's hard.\n\nas climate change continues unabated, parents, teachers and medical professionals across the country find themselves face-to-face with a quandary: how do you raise a generation to look toward the future with hope when all around them swirls a message of apparent hopelessness? how do you prepare today's children for a world defined by environmental trauma without inflicting more trauma yourself? and where do you find the line between responsible education and undue alarmism?\n\nstudents and others at a climate change protest in new york in may. photo by erik mcgregor/pacific press/lightrocket via getty images\n\nthe nexus between climate change and the mental health of children is rarely at the forefront of the discussion around environmental politics, but it's very real: in a washington post-kaiser family foundation poll of american teenagers released in september, 57 percent said that climate change made them feel scared and 52 percent said it made them feel angry, both higher rates than among adults. just 29 percent of teens said they were optimistic. reports like the u.s. government's national climate assessment have cited mental health concerns as a side effect of climate change. the american academy of pediatrics issued a policy statement in 2015 warning that climate change poses threats to children's mental and physical health, and that failure to take prompt, substantive action would be an act of injustice to all children.\n\nin expert testimony for the plaintiffs from 2018 in juliana v. united states — a lawsuit filed by a number of young people seeking to force the u.s. government to adopt policies to fight climate change and end fossil fuel subsidies — psychiatrist lise van susteren wrote that children will be at the center of the storm as climate change worsens and that they may already be feeling mental health impacts. day in and day out worrying about the unprecedented scale of the risk posed by climate change ... takes a heavy toll on an individual's well-being, wearing them down, sending some to the 'breaking point,'  she wrote. children are especially vulnerable. those words, she told me, were really painful to write. interviewing children about their fears for nature and their worries about their future families, she says, left her with a sense of shame.\n\neco-anxiety or climate depression is playing out in real terms among young people, sometimes in extreme ways: a 2008 study in an australian medical journal chronicled the case of a 17-year-old boy who was hospitalized after refusing to drink water during a nationwide drought, in what the authors called the first case of climate change delusion. a psychiatrist i interviewed told me a patient had confessed that she secretly wished a pandemic would strike to ease stress on the planet.\n\nbut the anxiety can manifest in subtler ways as well. sarah niles, an 18-year-old from alabama, told me that her fears about climate change have simply become a part of her life. i feel like in my peer group, you just go right from talking about polar bears dying to 'did you see what maya posted on snapchat?' nobody has a filter to adjust, niles says. it's like, the ice caps are melting and my hypothetical children will never see them, but also i have a calculus test tomorrow.\n\naccording to the national institutes of health, nearly 1 in 3 people ages 13 to 18 experience an anxiety disorder, and a study published in april 2018 in the journal of development and behavioral pediatrics found that anxiety diagnoses in children ages 6 to 17 increased 20 percent between 2007 and 2012. there's no single cause: a nonstop barrage of social media, a heightened political climate and the threat of school shootings are all stressors. and that's on top of being a teenager, with all the tumult that entails.\n\nbut the often apocalyptic nature of the news about climate change is perhaps uniquely paralyzing. elizabeth haase, a psychiatrist in nevada, describes how some of her patients can be overwhelmed by the scale of the problem: i'm supposed to be emotionally hopeful in a hopeless situation, and i'm supposed to act powerful when the source of power is collective power and it's overwhelming, and i'm supposed to feel faith and do things to be sustainable when nature is declining around me. overcome by a sense of powerlessness, they simply feel stuck in a situation, with no way out.\n\nit's like, the ice caps are melting and my hypothetical children will never see them, but also i have a calculus test tomorrow, says sarah niles, an 18-year-old from alabama.\n\n(janelle barone for the washington post)\n\npark guthrie knows about this paralysis in climate-change-spooked kids. a sixth-grade teacher in sonoma county, calif., he has seen the toll that the state's raging wildfires can take on the generally enthusiastic 11- and 12-year-olds in his classes. he has witnessed panic attacks triggered by the mere smell of smoke. when smoke from a nearby controlled burn once drifted to the school, he recalls, one boy smiled blankly and announced, i think i'm having ptsd. last year, after the kincade fire burned nearly 78,000 acres in the county in late october, guthrie found himself, not for the first time, comforting students worried about their homes and their relatives.\n\nguthrie understands how much climate change troubles his students, but he doesn't shy from talking about it. he confronts not only their fears, but also the political reality of denial and decades of inaction, all of which is disturbing to his students. it's like there's a paradigm shift, like when you learn that santa claus isn't real, he says. everything we teach them, that science is a tool for understanding the world, that adults are protecting you, falls apart. there's nothing to prepare them for this enormous problem that we simply haven't solved.\n\nan army brat who lived as a high schooler in berlin, guthrie recalls going to east berlin to watch a tribute to the berlin wall, a communist display of propaganda. back then, it made him believe that the wall would never come down, but today he realizes how much that fictional exercise reinforced the wall's symbolic power. now, he fears that by not speaking up forcefully about climate change as a generational issue, institutions are propping up this fictional story that you can care for kids in our country while neglecting or ignoring the climate. as a teacher, guthrie is a mandated reporter, someone legally required to speak up about signs of child abuse and neglect. if climate change will harm his students and is causing them anguish, isn't silence on the issue a violation of that duty?\n\nguthrie has taken his views national as the co-founder of the nonprofit schools for climate action (s4ca), which asks schools and other educational groups to pass resolutions highlighting the effects of climate change on children. since december 2017, more than 100 resolutions have been passed, 66 by school boards and 29 by student councils. many set sustainability goals or call on congress to take climate action. most are shepherded by students, who write the resolutions with the help of administrators and school board members.\n\nthough they don't commit organizations to any specific action, the resolutions send a signal that there are support networks for students struggling with climate change. they also bolster the idea that students can at least make a difference by raising awareness: jordyn bauer, a 20-year-old sophomore at california's sonoma state university who worked to pass a resolution in her california school district in 2018, said it helped validate her ability to do something. too many people are just standing by, she says. i felt like it was my responsibility to take charge.\n\nnot everyone, however, is on board with guthrie's agenda. last spring, guthrie and a number of s4ca partners — including several students — lobbied the national association of school psychologists to adopt a resolution stating that climate change is a children's issue, as the group's california chapter had done. but the organization declined. the group's executive director, kathleen minke, responded in an email to guthrie that her group focuses on issues that have a very direct impact on schools, student learning and children's mental and behavioral health. climate change, she said, falls outside this professional focus. when i interviewed her later, minke told me that her organization isn't ignoring climate change and has dedicated resources to help school psychologists deal with kids affected by natural disasters. but when it comes to managing anxiety, their focus is on coping, not causes. you're not going to develop an entire curriculum around anxiety related to 'x,'  she says. there are too many x's for that to be efficient.\n\nlikewise, s4ca's efforts to get national school board groups to lobby on climate change have come up short. chris ungar has been a school board member for 20 years in california's san luis coastal unified school district. last spring, he proposed language to the national school boards association recognizing climate change as a threat and asking congress for funding to help schools affected by natural disasters. it easily passed a policy committee, but before the full association the resolution was, in ungar's words, gutted — the climate change language stripped because delegates from some states worried that it could obscure the natural-disaster funding request.\n\nthat outcome underscored one of the biggest barriers to guthrie's work: education and youth groups don't always see climate change as having a direct link to children if they're not being displaced by a disaster — and sometimes not even then. still, more schools have picked up the s4ca resolution model, and in september, rep. barbara lee (d-calif.) introduced a nonbinding resolution acknowledging climate change as a social justice issue and supporting more climate education. by failing to address climate change in a meaningful way, we are failing our children, she said in a floor speech, and they know it.\n\nthe people's climate march in new york in september. (andrew burton/getty images)\n\nalthough there's little question that climate change will harm younger generations, there's considerably more debate about a related concern — that the rhetoric surrounding the issue is equally injurious. when young people seize on the u.n. warning that governments need to take action in 12 years to conclude, incorrectly, that the planet has only a decade remaining (rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez said last year that millennials fear the world is gonna end in 12 years if we don't address climate change), or when the website of the u.k.-based activist group extinction rebellion warns that societal collapse and mass death are seen as inevitable by scientists and other credible voices, it can be terrifying. some voices are now sounding the alarm about alarmism, suggesting that we'd all be better off if we dialed down some of the hyperbole.\n\nthis message of 'we're all going to die, how dare you say there might be something we can do' ... that's just not supported by the science, says kate marvel, a climate scientist and mathematician at columbia university. i'm not saying we can all rest, and i'm not saying we live in the best of all possible worlds. but one can have a sense of optimism by working towards a solution.\n\nmany of the adults i talked to said the heightened rhetoric around climate change reminded them of the panic around nuclear weapons during the cold war, when school lessons were interrupted by duck and cover drills and there was perpetual fear that the world might end at any moment. the 1983 tv movie the day after, which dramatized the fallout from a nuclear attack on the midwest, emerged as an apocalyptic touchstone; surveys after the film aired found viewers were more depressed about their chances of survival and were less optimistic about their ability to influence nuclear weapons policy.\n\nmichael shellenberger, an author and founder of the california-based nonprofit environmental progress, which promotes nuclear energy, remembers how panicked he felt after watching the movie. now, he considers it bizarre that adults would have decided to traumatize teenagers with that. today, he says, some in the environmental movement are making climate change the new apocalypse.\n\nthese scenarios of apocalypse, of really cataclysmic climate change that people are scaring children around, are in the realm of an extreme, unpredictable event, he told me. he has reflected on eco-anxiety while observing his 14-year-old daughter and her friends grow more worried about the planet; his book on the topic, apocalypse never, is due out in june. he's not advocating that children be shielded from the science, but rather that it be presented seriously. the headline-grabbing threats of mass extinctions and deaths may motivate action, he says, but at what cost?\n\nwe have people that know the power of fear manipulate consciously the psychology of young people in a way that is wrong and should stop, he argues. what people need to understand is that there are extreme scenarios ... and they are not the same thing as predictive science. indeed, scientists say that while some warming is baked in, action now could avert the worst consequences. marvel puts it this way: there are so many futures between doomed and fine.\n\neven the lower end of that range of futures, however, can mean destructive storms, displacement and economic upheaval, and that's the reality that teachers have to communicate. to meghan duffy, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the university of michigan, the climate change lecture in her introductory biology course is the most important class she teaches. but, worried that the class might be overwhelming or not communicated well, she surveyed her students for a study published in 2019. after the climate change lesson, students knew more but felt worse: only 4 percent of the class thought humans would successfully address climate change. one student wrote in an anonymous survey, i understand that global warming is an important part of learning from this class, but at some point one of the lectures gave me an anxiety attack, so that wasn't fun.\n\nstudying that emotional response forced duffy to reevaluate her syllabus. this past fall, she added a second lesson about solutions, highlighting the drop in the cost of renewable energy and improvements in battery technology for storing clean energy. it's a strategy duffy says is necessary for any climate communicator, but especially one working with young minds. there's a danger in having the instruction emphasize climate catastrophe, she says. it's tempting to say how bad things are, how much we need to stop it. but at some point you've accidentally said this is a foregone conclusion. we can overemphasize how scary it is to the point where people feel hopeless and panicked.\n\nworking toward a solution, in fact, is the consensus approach to calming young people's fears about the future. the key to addressing eco-anxiety at any age, says psychiatrist haase, is getting unstuck, losing that feeling of paralysis in the face of the problem's magnitude. haase is a founding member of the climate psychiatry alliance, an ad hoc group that has sprung up to offer patients and doctors advice on discussing climate anxiety. it's one of a number of such groups that are tackling the growing rate of patients panicked about the state of the world: the good grief network was launched in 2016 to offer group counseling sessions to the climate-anxious.\n\nthe emphasis, doctors say, should be on personal responsibility and empowerment. for an overwhelming problem like climate change, being able to take some action — whether eating less meat or switching to an electric vehicle — can help fight paralysis and get patients to recognize that the worst of climate change is not a fait accompli and that some progress can be made. haase says patients can often end up at one of two poles: one focused on catastrophe, the other essentially ignoring the problem. recognizing the middle space can open up your thoughts. by going back and forth, it creates a larger space for you to think in and feel in, she explains, and out of that come innovative solutions.\n\neverything we teach them, that science is a tool for understanding the world, that adults are protecting you, falls apart, says california teacher park guthrie.\n\nas the ones usually tasked with bringing climate change information to their students, teachers are increasingly taking on the weight of the psychological implications. lisa balazs, a science teacher at a private school outside birmingham, ala., told me she persuaded her school to offer a specialized climate change class last year. she wanted to walk students through the physics and chemistry of the changing climate, but also focus on solutions. i wanted them to feel like they were empowered in the way you could have an intelligent conversation, she says. the scary part is feeling like there's nothing you individually can do, especially when you look at the government. so turning it around and putting it back in your personal control, this is what you can vote for and work for.\n\nbalazs highlighted how politicians even in her conservative state have promoted clean energy, and she encouraged her students to take political action. sarah niles, who took balazs's class as a senior, says it was inspiring to learn about solutions to climate change, especially since, so often, the subject felt like devastation with no hope. she recalls days after class where we would go to the common room and just sit because we didn't know what to do. now, she's taking a gap year before college and volunteering in rockport, tex., to help rebuild the community, which was devastated by hurricane harvey in 2017. it's a way, she says, to put a face and a name to things you learn about in class, and feel as if she's making a small difference.\n\nof course, before you can bring up solutions, you have to be able to bring up climate change at all. schools, however, have sometimes been slow to bring climate change into the classroom, especially in conservative areas. lawmakers in states such as florida and texas have pushed bills that would strip climate change from curriculums entirely. in pennsylvania's central bucks school district in 2017, a republican school board member used fears about rising anxiety among the young in lobbying to remove textbooks that discussed climate change.\n\nmoreover, many teachers are unequipped to deal with it. a survey from the national center for science education and penn state's survey research center during the 2014-15 school year found that fewer than half of the teachers responding had taken a formal course on climate change. the same survey found that only two-thirds of teachers said they emphasize that human activity is the primary driver of climate change, despite the scientific consensus that humans are the cause. (jeanne kaidy, a high school science teacher in rochester, n.y., told me she gets a distressing amount of pushback from students and teachers disputing the science.)\n\nbut many teachers told me they're supported by the next generation science standards, written in 2013 to overhaul science teaching. created by officials from 26 states and several national science education organizations, the standards take climate change as a given, expecting students to be taught that human activities contribute to global warming and that the phenomenon is having a dire effect on human life. they also go deep on solutions, such as clean energy. so far, though, only 20 states and the district of columbia have adopted the standards, although 24 other states have drawn up their own guidance based on them.\n\nrenee belisle, a curriculum specialist for denver public schools, says that the standards, which passed narrowly in colorado, have played a hugely significant role in a rewrite of the district's high school science curriculum, which now integrates climate change into biology, physics and chemistry classes. each climate change unit contains an action item; as early as middle school, students are taught that steps such as changing your diet or turning off the lights can have an effect. that arc of ending with the empowerment is a way to help mitigate that pessimism that could develop, belisle says, particularly with kids, who might feel disenfranchised.\n\nstudents take a break after marching during the youth climate strike in boston in september. (craig f. walker/the boston globe via getty images)\n\nand yet the seemingly best approach — making young people feel enfranchised to deal with climate change — comes with both upsides and potential downsides. on the one hand, what better way for young people to process climate change worries than to pressure adults to actually do something about the crisis? campaigns like the youth-led sunrise movement, founded in 2017, have pursued this strategy, placing young people on the front lines of the fight over the green new deal; the group gained internet notoriety in february 2019 with a video of students, some as young as 11, confronting sen. dianne feinstein of california over her lack of support for the plan.\n\non the other hand, high schoolers are still high schoolers, with homework and soccer practice and dates and part-time jobs. and teenagers i spoke with admitted that activism can be a burden. i'd love to not be doing this. i'd much rather be hanging out with my friends, watching something stupid on netflix, says jonah gottlieb, 17, a high school senior in california. i have to because adults have left us no choice.\n\nthat feeling of responsibility, of being let down by prior generations, permeated the conversations i had — and there probably isn't a good solution, aside from actually solving climate change itself. for now, parents are left to walk a tightrope between being honest and being comforting, between empowering their kids and weighing them down with the responsibility of saving the world.\n\nthe bray family, at least, is erring on the side of not underplaying the situation — or the need for everyone to contribute to solutions. amber bray recalls the day the u.n. panel issued its 12-year warning. when arianna came home from school, amber told me, she hugged her daughter tight and, with tears in her eyes, apologized. both said that day changed their perspective and rallied the family to work harder to reduce its environmental impact. some parents might think they should shield their children from the realities, amber says. i believe it's my job as a parent to prepare my children to be ready, make good choices, be part of the solution. it's a disservice to our children if we don't teach them about life's dangers and how to protect themselves, even as we pray it is never necessary.\n\njason plautz is a writer in denver.\n\nphoto editing by dudley m. brooks. design by christian font.
tagovailoa, inserted for a struggling jalen hurts to start the third quarter, was entrusted with a crucial fourth-down play late in regulation and he made that work, as well, by hitting calvin ridley for a game-tying touchdown. in between his late-game heroics, alabama kicker andy pappanastos missed a 36-yard attempt that would have won the game with no time left in regulation, and georgia kicker

instead of a short field goal attempt.\n\nthe gamble worked, as tua tagovailoa hit calvin ridley in the end zone on a seven-yard pass that, combined with the ensuing extra point, tied the game at 20-20. ridley, expected to be a first-round pick in this year's nfl draft, had been quiet all game, but he came up huge, as did the freshman quarterback, when it mattered most for the tide.\n\nalabama

sideline, where he appeared to be going after a teammate.\n\nalabama turns interception into field goal, down 20-10\n\nad\n\nif the first half of the college football playoff championship game was fairly quiet, the third quarter has been filled with big plays and sharp swings of momentum. no sooner had georgia picked off alabama's tua tagovailoa than the crimson tide returned the favor, intercepting the bulldogs' jake fromm on a pass that bounced off one defender into the opportunistic arms of another.\n\nafter alabama's raekwon davis got the interception, he returned it into georgia territory. from there, the tide drove into field goal range, and andy pappanastos banged it through the uprights from 43 yards out, trimming the bulldogs' lead to 20-10.\n\ngeorgia matches alabama td with 80-yard bomb\n\nad\n\nad\n\njust when alabama thought it had snatched momentum, georgia grabbed it right back with an 80-yard bomb. jake fromm hit mecole hardman, who scored the team's first

to see if hardman's foot touched the boundary line as he ran toward the end zone, but the play was upheld, and a penalty on georgia for sideline interference was enforced on the ensuing kickoff, not affecting the touchdown.\n\nwhen alabama got the ball back, tua tagovailoa forced a ball into coverage while under pressure on a 2nd-and-10 play. the pass was intercepted by georgia's deandre baker, giving his team possession deep in crimson tide territory.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbackup qb leads alabama to desperately needed td\n\nit was tua time! in a big way in atlanta. backup quarterback tua tagovailoa, brought in at the start of the second half to replace alabama's jalen hurts, produced a desperately needed touchdown on his second drive. that got the crimson tide back in the game, albeit still behind at 13-7.\n\ntagovailoa completed four straight passes to end that drive, the last of which found henry ruggs iii for a six-yard score. earlier in the drive, tagovailoa also showed toughness by bouncing off a big hit and picking up a critical third down with his legs.\n\nalabama benches starting qb jalen hurts to begin second half\n\nad\n\nmake that two true-freshman quarterbacks playing in the game. alabama's tua tagovailoa started the second half in place of the struggling jalen hurts, joining georgia's jake fromm on the field.\n\nad\n\nit remained to be seen how long alabama coach nick saban stuck with tagovailoa, a hawaii native who came into the game with 53 pass attempts this season, mostly in mop-up duty late in games the crimson tide was leading. however, hurts had done little to move the offense, and with alabama down 13-0 after the first two quarters, saban felt the need to make a move.\n\nthe early results were not much better for alabama, however, as the tide went three-and-out in its first drive with tagovailoa.\n\nad\n\njake fromm, georgia take 13-0 lead at halftime\n\njake fromm is a true freshman. that's worth pointing out, because the georgia quarterback has looked anything but overmatched in a championship battle with alabama's vaunted defense. the bulldogs finished the first half with a 13-0 lead.\n\nfromm, who originally committed to alabama before deciding to switch to his home-state bulldogs, overcame an early interception, in which his receiver had the ball pulled away by a crimson tide defender, to throw for 126 yards. he seemed to gain confidence as the half went along, and he led several lengthy drives, the last of which ended in a one-yard rushing touchdown by georgia's mecole hardman with seven seconds left in the second quarter.\n\nalabama's quarterback, jalen hurts, was far less effective in the first half. the second-year starter threw for just 21 yards, completing three of eight passes, although he did some damage on the ground, rushing for a team-high 47 yards on six carries.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nsumming up alabama's first-half futility was the fact that its star receiver, calvin ridley, was held to just one catch for nine yards. meanwhile, his younger, less accomplished brother, georgia's riley ridley, led all players with four catches for 62 yards.\n\ngreat sideline catch helps georgia take 6-0 lead\n\ngeorgia extended its first-half lead over alabama to 6-0 with another long drive that ended in a field goal. one of the highlights of the second march downfield was a catch on the sideline by the bulldogs' javon wims that was reviewed before being allowed to stand.\n\nafter a no-score first quarter, georgia strikes first with a field goal\n\nmany predicted the college football playoff national championship game would be a low-scoring affair, and the first quarter certainly played out that way. in fact, there was no score at all, with the big play being a missed field goal by alabama's andy pappanastos.\n\nthat field goal attempt was set up, in part, by an interception by alabama's tony brown, who pulled the ball away from georgia's javon wims on a deep pass. the bulldogs' sony michel was the offensive star in the early going, with 38 yards on four carries.\n\nad\n\nforty-six seconds into the second quarter, bulldogs kicker rodrigo blankenship ended the scoring drought by kicking a 41-yard field goal to give georgia a 3-0 lead. blankenship is known for, among other things, his eye-catching eyewear.\n\npayne takes flight\n\nalabama's da'ron payne showed an impressive ability to get airborne on a first-half tackle.\n\npresident trump's motorcade unhappily greeted by fans stuck outside stadium\n\nwith president trump in attendance for the game, security at atlanta's mercedes-benz stadium was tight, and thousands of fans had to wait longer than they expected outside the stadium before being allowed in. the fact that it was raining likely didn't improve anyone's mood, but some reportedly booed trump's motorcade as it arrived.\n\nthere were also some reports of booing when trump strode onto the stadium floor, accompanied by military personnel, ahead of the national anthem. loud cheering could also be heard on the telecast.\n\nas alabama players walked through the stadium toward the field, crimson tide running back bo scarbrough appeared to hurl an epithet about trump.\n\nas alabama takes aim at georgia in title game, nick saban eyes bear bryant's record\n\nad\n\natlanta — on new year's day in 1980, alabama got two first-half touchdown runs from major ogilvie, beat arkansas 24-9 in the sugar bowl, reached 12-0 and won the 1979 college football national championship just ahead of 11-0-1 southern california. it had allowed only 67 points all season and had permitted only two opponents, tennessee and auburn, the thrill of reaching double figures. in the 13,887 days since then, one coach's name has sat atop the list of national title hoarded in a given lifetime.\n\nit has been, of course, paul bear bryant, who won national championships with an 11-0 team in 1961, a 10-1 team in 1964, a 9-1-1 team in 1965 (a shared title), an 11-1 team in 1973, an 11-1 team in 1978 (a shared title) and that 12-0 team of 1979. for 38 years and one week, his total of six has gone unmatched. it has seemed forever ahead of the five for bernie bierman at minnesota, the five for woody hayes at ohio state, the five for howard jones at yale and southern california, and the four for frank leahy at notre dame and john mckay at southern california.\n\nas the sport took on a bit more parity, with miami (fla.) as a breakthrough empire in the 1980s and early 1990s, it seemed that six could remain untouched. it seemed so still when a shocking turn of the bowl championship series computers at the last minute, in 2003, afforded lsu a spot ahead of southern california in the sugar bowl that doubled as bcs championship game. when lsu beat and beat up oklahoma, 21-14, lsu coach nick saban had a national title (with southern california the associated press poll winner), but two seasons later, he had made off for the nfl and the miami dolphins.\n\nfor monday night in mercedes-benz stadium, the historic aspect would hang over the title game between georgia, the no. 3 seed in the four-team college football playoff, and alabama, the no. 4 seed. if saban were to win, his chronic war against human nature and human complacency would push him alongside bryant, not that he would belabor the point himself.\n\nhe would, instead, probably turn to recruiting as fast as he could, with his uncommon understanding that glory is fleeting.\n\nwell, i think that i'm always looking for the next challenge, he said monday. i don't know if it's the way i was raised or whatever, that you're kind of only as good as your last play, as your last game. i think everyone has heard me talk about the fact that success is not a continuum, it's momentary, and it's human nature to get satisfied and get a little complacent when you have success.\n\nin continuing this description for a few more sentences, he said at one point, i hate to lose.\n\nthat does seem clear.\n\nin alabama's last 10 seasons, the dud of the bunch is the mark from 2010 of 10-3, which would get a coach considerable bump-up raises in many a college town. alabama previously won national titles in the 2009 season, the 2011, the 2012 and the 2015. it also has reached the playoff all four seasons the playoff has existed, finishing as runner-up in 2016.\n\nabout an hour and change before kickoff monday, saban and his team emerged. as they bunched together in one end zone before preparing to warm up, the head coach leaped into a body bump with the star safety minkah fitzpatrick, one of the abundant players saban has extolled across these unusual years. the former defensive back from kent state did appear younger than 66. this impossibly driven sort had found his way to another, yet another, championship night.\n\npregame reading:\n\nwhat you need to know:\n\nwho: alabama (12-1) vs. georgia (13-1)\n\nwhere: mercedes-benz stadium, atlanta\n\ntime:

to label those assisting with or committing suicide at the end of life as perpetrating a sin against god is a belief that some justify in the wording of an ancient book with no author. to castigate as sinners those who choose to end their suffering when there are no good alternatives is callous. offering the equivalent of thoughts and prayers to the terminally ill is as tone-deaf to the afflicted and their families as it is to the families of the victims of gun violence. it is neither helpful nor sought and carries no real meaning. in certain respects, it is a dodge: an anti-solution. we should all fully support the separation of church and state, in this as in all matters, and leave this law as is.

over the weekend, though, it became apparent that irsay, like a duck paddling furiously, has a lot going on beneath the surface, reportedly courting peyton manning to return to indy to head up football operations, a la john elway in denver, and wooing jon gruden as coach.\n\nfox sports' jay glazer reported saturday that irsay had hoped to have manning and gruden working together. although gruden apparently is not interested, irsay is still working on manning, who won a super bowl and then tearfully left in 2012 when the team was ready to draft andrew luck. perhaps irsay was taking him at his word when, in his farewell news conference in indianapolis, the quarterback tearfully said, i'll always be a colt.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ngruden has no such ties to the franchise and espn's adam schefter reported that gruden, the monday night football analyst and super bowl-winning coach, turned down the job although he and irsay met last weekend for 10 hours, per indianapolis's fox 59 reporter brian bondus.\n\ngruden hasn't coached since 2009 and he isn't ready to leave the cushy life of a critic/analyst. i know nothing, he told schefter. i've told people, i'm not coaching. i'm a broadcaster. i'm not a coach.\n\ngruden, who remains espn's highest-paid broadcaster, raking in around $6.5 million per year, began his nfl coaching career in 1998 when he took a job with the oakland raiders. after sticking around for four seasons, he moved to the tampa bay buccaneers in 2002 and led the team to a super bowl win that season. gruden, whose brother jay is the head coach of the washington redskins, remained with the buccaneers until 2009 when he was fired after overseeing what's been deemed one of the biggest collapses in nfl history. after starting the season 9-3, the team ended on a four-game skid, and missed the playoffs.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ngruden didn't remain unemployed for long. by may 2009, espn scooped him up for its monday night football broadcasts, where he's remained ever since.\n\npagano came to the colts in 2012, and led the team to three straight 11-5 seasons, although he missed most of his first season while being treated for leukemia. the colts went to the afc championship game after the 2014 regular season, but since then, they've twice finished 8-8 and a great deal of the blame for that has gone to grigson, who hasn't stocked the team with much talent.
1. how many covid-related lawsuits have been filed?\n\na total of 1,315 lawsuits related to covid-19 claims had been filed in the u.s. as of dec. 28, according to fisher phillips llc, a law firm tracking the litigation. relatively few have been filed by workers who blame their employers after contracting the virus, according to several lawyers who have been following the field. melissa camire at fisher phillips, said that the most common kinds are cases filed by workers who said they needed, but were denied, time off because they contracted covid-19 or had to take care of a sick person. the next most common categories were suits in which employment discrimination claims were tied to the pandemic, including claims by parents saying they were fired for taking care of their children, and whistle-blower cases.\n\nad\n\nad\n\n2. who's been sued?\n\nmost covid exposure suits have been against companies whose workplaces are densely staffed, such as meatpackers and food processors, according to john beisner, a partner at skadden arps slate meagher & flom llp in washington, d.c. janie schulman, an attorney at morrison & foerster in los angeles, said smaller companies and those in the health care industry are common targets. the fisher phillips data support her conclusion: companies with fewer than 50 employees are defendants in 461 covid-related lawsuits, or more than one-third of the total. suits have also been filed against companies over conditions in warehouses and product distribution centers, including one against amazon.com inc.\n\n3. what are those suits about?\n\nad\n\njuno turner, litigation director at towards justice, a denver-based workers' rights organization who filed the suit against amazon in brooklyn, said that many of them have been brought by low-wage, frontline or essential workers, who are disproportionately people of color. some, like the amazon suit, are seeking court orders requiring safe conditions. others seek damages for employers' egregious conduct on behalf of workers who've fallen ill or died, she said.\n\nad\n\n4. what can people who think they got covid on the job do?\n\nthe vast majority of workers arguing they contracted covid due to unsafe workplaces are required to pursue their claims through worker compensation programs, an administrative process that generally makes it impossible to sue employers directly over workplace injuries. labor lawyers argue the programs don't have the teeth required to change practices at dangerous workplaces.\n\nad\n\n5. how about workers worried about infection risks?\n\nsome cases are being filed as public nuisance suits in an attempt to avoid the normal channels for such complaints. the case against amazon accused the company of contributing to the spread of covid-19 by telling plant workers to emphasize speed over distancing, hand-washing and sanitizing work spaces. a federal judge in brooklyn dismissed the case in november, saying workers should bring their concerns to the federal occupational safety and health administration instead. two of the legal non-profits that brought the amazon lawsuit, towards justice and public justice, are separately suing osha in a federal court in pennsylvania, saying the agency has arbitrarily and capriciously failed to address imminent dangers to workers at a meatpacking plant in the state.\n\nad\n\n6. what are states doing?\n\nad\n\nwhile congress has remained gridlocked on any federal measure, at least 10 states have created their own legal shields for businesses and individuals, says fisher phillips lawyer chantell c. foley. they include georgia, north carolina, utah and wyoming. georgia's law shifts the burden of proof so that instead of a company first being required to show how it complied with state and federal health guidelines, plaintiffs must prove it didn't. workers must show their employer willfully and wantonly failed to follow the guidelines, foley says. that's a pretty high burden. california in december put in place a new rule requiring employers to implement coronavirus safety measures and setting standards for virus testing, notifying workers of infections, and paid medical leave.\n\n7. what would a federal liability shield do?\n\nad\n\nas outlined by senate republicans in a proposed stimulus measure that failed to win democratic support, lawsuits couldn't be brought under common law or medical malpractice statutes, only through a specially designed federal cause of action. defendants could be found liable only if they didn't make reasonable efforts to comply with relevant public health guidelines and were either grossly negligent or engaged in willful misconduct. thresholds for acceptable evidence would be stricter. compensatory damages would be limited to the plaintiff's economic losses; punitive damages, awarded only if the defendant's willful misconduct caused the injury, could not exceed compensatory damages. an employer couldn't be held liable if it relied on, and generally followed, relevant health and safety standards. the shield would apply to virus exposure on or after dec. 1, 2019, and until at least oct. 1, 2024.\n\nad\n\n8. what do opponents say?\n\nseveral democrats, including house speaker nancy pelosi and senate minority leader chuck schumer, say that the liability shields would place workers in dangerous conditions without giving them legal recourse to recover damages or demand change. they also object to the length of the proposed shield. labor groups and workers' rights organizations say the main effect of a shield would be to encourage employers to not take the required safety precautions. turner said republicans were using an exaggerated concern about purportedly frivolous litigation to justify blanket immunity for corporations that break the rules.\n\nad\n\n9. is the idea dead?\n\nad\n\nno. a bipartisan group of senators has vowed to continue working in 2021 on a deal that would pair a liability shield with financial aid to state and local governments, a democratic priority. that group had been working on a measure that would establish a nationwide gross negligence standard for covid-19 exposure, medical malpractice and workplace testing claims. its protections would apply to claims arising from injuries that occurred from december 2019 through the later of one year after enactment or the end of the coronavirus public health emergency.\n\n(an earlier version of this article misspelled the name of chantell c. foley in question six.)\n\nfor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com
the senators contend they are not trying to reverse the election results, but rather give voice to those who don't believe it was conducted fairly, despite no investigation nor court finding any evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nstill, president trump and many of his republican allies see next week's joint session of congress to certify biden's victory as their last stand to contest the election results, even if doing so is largely political theater to undermine and delay biden's inevitable win.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nto wit, congress should immediately appoint an electoral commission, with full investigatory and fact-finding authority, to conduct an emergency 10-day audit of the election returns in the disputed states, the senators wrote in a joint statement. once completed, individual states would evaluate the commission's findings and could convene a special legislative session to certify a change in their vote, if needed.\n\nsens. ron johnson (wis.), james lankford (okla.), steve daines (mont.), john neely kennedy (la.), marsha blackburn (tenn.) and mike braun (ind.) — along with sens.-elect cynthia m. lummis (wyo.), roger marshall (kan.), bill hagerty (tenn.) and tommy tuberville (ala.) — joined cruz. sen. josh hawley (r-mo.) has already said he will contest the electoral college vote certification.\n\nsen. josh hawley (r-mo.) on dec. 30 pledged to challenge president-elect joe biden's victory next week when congress convenes to certify the electoral (reuters)\n\nvice president pence, who will preside over the joint session in his role as president of the senate, supports the gop lawmakers' efforts, according to a top aide.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe vice president welcomes the efforts of members of the house and senate to use the authority they have under the law to raise objections and bring forward evidence before the congress and the american people on jan. 6, said marc short, pence's chief of staff.\n\nby law, if members from both the house and the senate object to the electoral college slates, both chambers must debate and then vote on the contest. the republicans' plans to muddy up the proceedings could force wednesday's ceremony to go all night and into the next morning.\n\nfor each successfully contested state, the joint session must recess, allowing the house and senate to individually debate up to two hours and then vote on the challenges. because of coronavirus precautions, house votes during the pandemic have taken an hour or more to conduct — meaning disposing of challenges for each state could take three to four hours.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmany house republicans have already said they will contest the electoral college votes from multiple states. if republican senators join house members in contesting all six won by biden where the trump campaign has questioned the results — arizona, georgia, michigan, nevada, pennsylvania and wisconsin — the proceedings could conceivably last 24 hours or more.\n\nultimately, though, the gop challenge will fail because democrats hold more seats in the house and because a number of senate republicans have already recognized biden's win and are unlikely to support their colleagues' effort.\n\nnow that we're locked into doing it, we'll give air to the objections and people can have their day in court and we'll hear everybody out and then we'll vote, said senate majority whip john thune (r-s.d.) regarding hawley's initial plans to contest the results. in the end, i don't think it changes anything.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthune has indicated that he will vote to certify biden's win, drawing a rebuke from trump, who called for south dakota gov. kristi l. noem (r) to run against him in a primary. she has said she will not challenge him.\n\nsen. patrick j.

effort to disenfranchise millions of voters in my state and others, toomey said.\n\ndemocrats in both chambers are also preparing to defend the election results during the debate period for each state. sen. amy klobuchar (d-minn.), who will help manage the proceedings as the top democrat on the senate rules and administration committee, said she and other democratic leaders are calling on lawmakers from those six states to be prepared to rebut the challengers and explain their states' election processes.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwe are ready for every contingency, she said in a friday interview. this isn't like we just woke up this morning and said, 'oh, this is coming up!' we've been working on this since election day.\n\ni would very much hope it gets resolved on the 6th, she added, but it could go on for quite a while.\n\nklobuchar said she had no doubt that, at the end of the process, biden and vice president-elect kamala d. harris would be confirmed as the rightful winners of the election. she praised senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) and other republicans — such as sen. ben sasse (r-neb.), who wrote a long and scathing critique of the efforts to question the election results — for defying trump's attempts to undermine the democratic process.\n\nad\n\nour democracy will prevail, klobuchar said. i just think this is kind of a sad, sad statement that some members are putting their own fear of donald trump in front of our democracy.\n\nhouse speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) on dec. 30 said the election results would be certified by congress on jan. 6. (the washington post)\n\nthough mcconnell has rejected calls from members of his party to challenge biden's win, a senate republican aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly describe internal gop dynamics, said that the decision of the 12 senators to do so should not be interpreted as a rebuke of mcconnell — who was reelected party leader for the new congress by acclamation in november and helped each of the senators-elect win their races — but rather a reflection of political reality.\n\nad\n\nthe 2022 and 2024 considerations definitely factor in, the aide said, referring to senators up for reelection in the next election cycles. if you think trumpism is a lasting, dominant force in the party, and he's set this up as a test, you're going to do this.\n\nad\n\nsen. kelly loeffler (r-ga.), herself in the middle of a hard-fought runoff election next week, campaigned with cruz on saturday, but she wouldn't say that she supported his effort.\n\neverything's on the table; we're looking at what we can do to make sure that this is a free and fair election and that we fight for the president, she said.\n\nrick hasen, a leading election law expert, said gop senators supporting the challenge are trying to have it both ways.\n\nthey didn't fully endorse the president's claims of a rigged election, so they are trying to please the trumpian base of the republican party while also not fully endorsing the unsupported dangerous claims of a stolen election that have come out of trump's mouth incessantly, hasen said.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin their weekend statement, the 11 senators cited a public opinion poll showing that about 40 percent of americans believe the election was rigged. they contend that additional vetting is needed to restore trust in u.s. elections. trump spent months leading up to the election and afterward sowing doubt and confusion about the voting process and outcome.\n\nbut, whether or not our elected officials or journalists believe it, that deep distrust of our democratic processes will not magically disappear, the senators said. it should concern us all. and it poses an ongoing threat to the legitimacy of any subsequent administrations.\n\nthere is no evidence that there was widespread fraud in the election, a finding echoed by christopher krebs, the former head of the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency, and former attorney general william p. barr. krebs was fired and barr resigned before the end of trump's term.\n\nad\n\nthe trump campaign has brought dozens of cases alleging voter fraud in six states, and judges have rejected nearly every claim. the u.s. supreme court has also twice refused to take up the cases.\n\nrepublican sen. mitt romney of utah said his colleagues' challenge continues to spread the false rumor that somehow the election was stolen.\n\nlook, i lost in 2012. i know what it's like to lose. i have people today who say, 'hey, you know what, you really won,' but i didn't, i lost fair and square, said romney, who was the gop presidential nominee that year. of course there were irregularities — there always are — but spreading this kind of rumor about our election system not working is dangerous for democracy here and abroad.\n\ncorrection: an earlier version of this story said former attorney general william p. barr was fired by trump. he resigned on dec. 15.
a new metro safety oversight commission is a step closer to happening as the virginia and maryland legislatures convene this week.\n\nofficials in both states had been concerned that the legislation would be delayed this year, but the plan got a boost after virginia obtained a concession that the new commission's board would have to give unanimous consent before ordering any shutdown of the transit system, legislators and others said.\n\nthe d.c. council passed a bill last month creating the commission. maryland and virginia must approve identical versions of the legislation to establish the commission, which will have more authority over metro safety than its widely criticized predecessor, the tri-state oversight committee.\n\nthe commission will not be set up in time to meet a feb. 9 deadline set by transportation secretary anthony foxx. by failing to meet the deadline, the three risk losing millions in federal transit funds.\n\nbut they hope to buy more time with the incoming administration by showing they are making clear progress toward creating the commission.\n\nestablishing the safety body would mark a significant step forward for metro since the federal transit administration took over safety oversight for the rail system more than a year ago.\n\nfoxx took the unprecedented step of transferring safety oversight of metro's rail operations to the fta with the understanding that it would be temporary — until the three jurisdictions could develop a compact to create an oversight agency. the move was made after federal officials determined that the tri-state oversight committee was woefully inadequate for the job.\n\n[md. and va.won't meet deadline for new metro safety body. what happens now?]\n\nofficials said the virginia and maryland legislatures, whose annual sessions begin wednesday, are likely to approve the commission, both to avoid federal financial penalties and to end the embarrassment of relying on the fta.\n\nthis piece of legislation should not be a heavy lift for the three jurisdictions, said maryland state sen. brian j. feldman (d-montgomery), who co-chairs a joint committee on federal relations at the state house in annapolis.\n\nconcern lingers that conservative critics of metro in the virginia house of delegates may try to attach conditions to the safety commission bill, such as adding requirements to overhaul the metro board or weaken union protections.\n\nbut the bill's sponsor in the virginia house, del. james m. lemunyon (r-fairfax), has sought to minimize that risk by providing conservatives with political cover. he has filed a separate, nonbinding resolution that would formally urge the governor to open talks on rewriting metro's founding document to change its governance and labor practices.\n\nby giving conservatives a separate means of pressing metro to adopt reforms, lemunyon's resolution should help ensure that the safety commission legislation is approved, according to lawmakers from both parties.\n\ni view the issues as separate, lemunyon said. he said it would be fruitless and a non-starter for any metro-related legislation to change the language of the safety commission bill.\n\n[how to salvage metro? rewrite the compact, says influential dc business group.]\n\nthe three jurisdictions reached tentative agreement in may on the draft legislation, but two disputes arose that required further work.\n\nmost recently, some virginia legislators objected to a provision that decisions were to be made by a majority of commissioners — meaning that the jurisdictions would not have effective veto power, as they do on the metro board.\n\nthe new commission will have six voting members and three alternates, evenly divided among the three jurisdictions.\n\nthe bill was revised to require unanimous consent of the voting members for any decision to shut down or restrict service on all or part of the system.\n\nthe compromise that's been struck recognizes that you did not want to have two jurisdictions voting to shut down part of the system when the third jurisdiction did not agree, said virginia sen. george l. barker (d-fairfax), who is sponsoring the senate version of the bill.\n\ndel. david b. albo (r-fairfax), who was outspoken in his desire for a jurisdictional veto, remained skeptical, but said he might have to support the bill anyway to avoid facing the federal financial penalties.\n\ni kind of feel i'm being bribed into voting for it, albo said.\n\nearlier changes were made in the draft to address objections that the commission could shield much of its work and findings from the public. it was agreed that the commission would be subject to the u.s. freedom of information act and other federal transparency policies.\n\nthe new panel was proposed after years of frustration with the tri-state committee, which had virtually no enforcement authority. by contrast, the commission will be empowered to adopt and enforce metro safety rules, conduct inspections, order corrective action plans, impose fines for noncompliance, issue subpoenas and compel the agency to spend more money on safety-critical issues.\n\n[maryland, virginia and d.c. reach agreement on new metro safety commission.]\n\nlemunyon's resolution for rewriting the metro compact reflects growing interest in the region in radically restructuring metro. the 50-year-old compact has long drawn criticism for providing an unwieldy governing structure and inadequate funding.\n\nthe resolution urges the virginia governor to open talks with the maryland governor and district mayor to rewrite the compact to improve the governance, financing and operation of metro.\n\nthe resolution notes that the federal city council, a district-based organization of business and civic leaders, recently proposed rewriting the washington metropolitan area transit authority compact of 1966 as a way to address metro's chronic problems with safety, reliability and financial management.\n\nit specifically urges the jurisdictions look at changing the structure of metro's board of directors, such as by requiring that all members have expertise and experience gained outside of government service in the operation of large transportation enterprises.\n\nin its most controversial sections, the resolution calls for changing labor policies, such as eliminating the requirement that contract disputes be settled by outside arbitration.\n\nit also calls for adoption of a right to work provision, so that no metro employee would be required to belong to a union as a condition of employment.\n\nand it says that the employee pension plan, which has an unfunded liability of more than $2.5 billion, should be converted to a potentially less-costly defined contribution plan.\n\nvirginia transportation secretary aubrey layne said his boss, gov. terry mcauliffe (d), is unlikely to support the union-related provisions in the resolution.\n\nin general, however, the mcauliffe administration is open to discussing changes in the metro compact, layne said. he has said previously that there is no doubt that metro governance needs reform.\n\nwe're happy to talk with [lemunyon] about a resolution looking at governance issues, [but] we're not prepared to spell out specifically what the changes should be, layne said.
start with a bang\n\nseveral years ago, a group of 120 students at the university of chicago were recruited by two economists — gary charness and uri gneezy — to participate in an experiment about exercise habits. a randomly assigned third of the students were paid $175 for merely attending an information session and giving researchers permission to track their gym attendance. another third got paid if they attended the information session, allowed their gym attendance to be tracked and went to the gym at least once in the next month. the final third of the students were paid for attending the information session, for allowing their gym attendance to be tracked and for hitting the gym at least eight times in the next month.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nunsurprisingly, the group who had to make eight gym visits to get paid exercised more than the other two groups. but what's really interesting is what happened after all of the payments stopped.\n\nthe students who had just finished a month of unusually high exercise activity (the ones who had just earned $175 for working out eight times) kept going to the gym at a far higher rate than others. they worked out at the gym nine times in the following seven weeks, and the other students in the study went roughly half as often.\n\nthis illustrates that if we can get people (or ourselves) to try something new intensively for as little as a month (even with an instrument as blunt as a cash payment), we can kick-start lasting behavior change. so even if you can't promise yourself to stick with something for long, there's a huge benefit in putting in a burst of energy for a few weeks — it may pay off for longer than you think.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ntake a mulligan (or two)\n\nmany of us find it hard to stick to good behaviors all the time, which might suggest setting easy new year's resolutions to avoid the discouraging experience of failure — an experience that can lead us to give up on our goals. on the other hand, research has shown that setting tough-to-attain goals is more motivating than setting easy ones. so how can we balance these two facts? a recent study may offer the perfect solution.\n\ntwo marketing professors — marissa sharif and suzanne shu — offered hundreds of people $1 for every day in a week that they remembered to go online and complete a set of 35 annoying tasks. these wage-earners were then randomly assigned different goals and given a $5 bonus on top of their other earnings if they achieved their goal.\n\nad\n\nsome participants were randomly given the goal of completing their assignment seven days out of seven — a tough but achievable goal. others were randomly given the easier goal of completing their assignment on just five days out of seven but encouraged to aim to complete the tasks every day to maximize their earnings. finally, a mulligan group was given the goal of completing their assignment seven days out of seven but told in case you need it, up to two days will be excused. in other words, this mulligan group was only required to do the assignment on five days out of seven to earn their $5 bonus just like the easy goal group, but they had been given the tough stated goal of doing it every day of the week. remarkably, even though the mulligan group faced exactly the same incentives as the group with the easy target, they were significantly more successful: 53 percent of them earned $5 compared to 26 percent of the participants with the (identical) easy goal and 21 percent of participants with the seven day per week goal. what this suggests is that the perfect goal to set for yourself is probably a tough one but with the explicit allowance for a mulligan or two so you won't be discouraged by the occasional slip up.\n\nad\n\npiggybacking and temptation bundling\n\nresearch points to the benefits of what's called a piggybacking strategy. piggybacking involves linking something you'd like to start doing regularly — like flossing or eating an apple a day — with something you already do regularly, like brushing your teeth or drinking a morning cup of coffee. in one small study, people attempting to kick-start a flossing habit were more successful when they were prompted to floss after brushing their teeth rather than vice versa.\n\nad\n\nrelated to piggybacking is an idea my collaborators and i call temptation bundling. temptation bundling means linking something you'd like to do more often with something indulgent that you crave. for instance, imagine you love binge-watching game of thrones but feel guilty about doing this at home when you should be spending quality time with family. imagine you'd also like to start a gym habit. your temptation bundle might be to watch game of thrones only when exercising at the gym. you'd stop wasting time at home on tv and start craving trips to the gym to find out what happens in the next episode. not only that, you'll enjoy game of thrones and exercise more together — you won't feel guilty watching it, and time will fly at the gym.\n\nad\n\nin one study of 151 people who wanted to exercise more, we randomly assigned 75 to a temptation bundling group. these people came to the gym for a workout and during it, they listened to the start of a tempting audio-novel of their choice (books like the hunger games or the da vinci code). at the end of their workout, participants were told that if they wanted to hear what happened next in their novel, they would have to come back to the gym because their audiobook on a loaned ipod would be held in a locked, monitored locker at the gym for the next 10 weeks and they could only access it when exercising. the other 76 participants in our study also completed an initial workout but without any kind of temptation bundle.\n\nover the next seven weeks, participants in the temptation bundling group visited the gym 27 percent more frequently than participants in the control group. sadly, the temptation bundling trick fell apart over the thanksgiving holiday when the gym closed (so access to tempting audio-novels went away). forced separation is the best known cure for cravings, so maybe this isn't surprising, but it means temptation bundling may not have the staying power to kick-start a habit that will last through all of 2018. still, it may be a useful trick for changing behavior particularly when combined with other tactics.
the question is: do they deserve such extraordinary sums?\n\nschwarzman declined an invitation to talk through that question. but it's a fair guess that as a staunch defender of free markets, he considers his take a proper reward for his talent, hard work, ingenuity and willingness to take risk over many years. in the past, he has criticized those who blame the wealthy for stagnant middle-class incomes and rising inequality. and when the obama administration proposed a change in tax law that would have reduced his income, an outraged (and later apologetic) schwarzman likened it to adolf hitler's invasion of poland.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin the theoretical models favored by economists, what schwarzman or anyone else earns in the marketplace is thought to reflect how much we add to economic output — in the language of economics, our marginal productivity.\n\nmy own reading of the evidence is that most of the very wealthy get that way by making substantial economic contribution, harvard economist greg mankiw wrote in a much remarked-upon essay a few years back that was titled defending the one percent.\n\nindeed, if we still had an economy of independent, self-sufficient farmers and artisans, mankiw's mental model might be the correct one. someone could point to a bushel of tomatoes or a hand-knit sweater and credibly make the claim, i produced that. it is the fruit of my labor, so what i earn from it in the competitive marketplace is my property, my just desert.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbut in a modern economy, creating products and services is a team sport, with individuals constantly interacting with other individuals and firms in complex arrangements that make it much more difficult to determine each person's contribution to overall economic output. there are differences in market power between firms, and differences of individual power within firms, both of which have a significant effect on exactly who earns what.\n\none of the reasons blackstone is so successful, for example, is that as one of the biggest private-equity firms, it gets a first look at most of the best investment opportunities. everyone who works at, or invests with, blackstone benefits from that kind of market power. and within blackstone, schwarzman has the sole discretion in setting the bonuses for top executives, according to its annual proxy filings.\n\nmore significantly, the amount anyone earns at blackstone, or any other firm, is influenced by the rules, laws and norms that govern business behavior and market competition.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nas someone who buys and sells companies, for example, schwarzman has benefited handsomely from a uniquely american business environment in which companies are run with the single-minded focus of maximizing returns to shareholders and investors, rather than balancing the interests of all stakeholders.\n\nthe hotel companies and amusement parks that blackstone has owned (hilton, la quinta, motel 6, six flags, busch gardens) have benefited from a federal minimum wage that hasn't budged in more than a decade, and labor laws that now make it almost impossible for workers to vote in a union at any company that is determined to stop them.\n\nover the past 30 years, the weakening of antitrust enforcement and regulations meant to protect consumers and investors have boosted the profits and increased the value of blackstone-owned companies in the waste management, cable television, telephone, funeral and nursing home industries.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nas a big investor in corporate debt, blackstone also has benefited from bankruptcy rules that favor bondholders over workers, as it did in the restructuring of telecom firm avaya in which $360 million in unfunded pension liabilities was effectively shifted to the government's pension guarantee agency.\n\nthe extraordinarily low interest rates engineered by the federal reserve in recent years have boosted valuations for the many real estate investments that blackstone has made, including its $37.7 billion purchase of equity office properties at the top of the last real estate bubble. low interest rates also have provided blackstone with the financial headroom to shower its investors and executives with huge one-time dividends financed with debt.\n\nliberalized trade treaties have made it possible for blackstone-owned firms such as freescale semiconductor and trw auto parts to lower costs by moving work to low-wage countries overseas. the same treaties have also made it possible for blackstone to attract more foreign investors, like the sovereign wealth funds of china and saudi arabia, while opening new investment opportunities for blackstone abroad, such as legoland and versace.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nscharzman and his partners have benefited handsomely from the favorable tax treatment for carried interest, and the ability to defer taxes on profitable investments that are exchanged for new ones. and under the new law, their taxes will be lower, and returns higher, as a result of the new lower rates for corporations and partnerships. the repeal of the estate tax will also leave wealthy families with more money to invest in blackstone funds.\n\nthe point here is not to quarrel with these policy choices (although there is much to quarrel with) or to suggest that blackstone has benefited more than other firms (although that is probably the case). rather, it is to illustrate that the amount that schwarzman or anyone else earns in any year in the marketplace is determined in no small part by rules and norms that govern market competition.\n\nthose rules and norms were not set in place by some all-knowing invisible hand — they were politically and socially determined. that is why wars have been fought over them, legislative battles have been waged over them and elections have been won and lost because of them. and it is why blackstone and other companies spend lavishly on lobbying and electing friendly politicians who are in a position to shape them.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nunder different sets of rules and norms, the market might have valued schwarzman's economic contribution last year at a measly $393 million — half of what he did receive, but surely still enough to persuade him to contribute his excellence.\n\nmarkets, in other words, are social constructs, and the idea that they generate a distribution of income based on a purely objective measure of individual economic contribution is a fiction, nothing more than free-market ideology. when it comes to the distribution of income, there is no pure market. any distribution is, by its nature, political, reflecting changing social norms and the distribution of political power.\n\nto point this out is not to suggest that i know of a more objective system for determining how income should distributed. rather, it is to suggest that if we, as a society, decide that we find the current distribution of income unacceptable — if it offends our moral intuitions that a single financier earns as much in a year as 15,000 elementary school teachers — then it violates no great moral or economic principle to alter that distribution.\n\nad\n\nad\n\none way to make the distribution of income more equal would be to change some of the rules and norms that govern market competition.\n\nanother would be to leave the rules and norms in place and alter the distribution after the market has delivered its judgment, through more progressive taxation and government spending.\n\nthe first has been called predistribution, the second redistribution, and there may be good economic and political reasons for favoring one or the other. but from a moral viewpoint, there is no meaningful distinction between the two. both reflect the ways that societies determine the distribution of income based on subjective judgments of what is fair.\n\nad\n\ndefenders of free markets have long argued that shifting income away from those whom the market judges more talented and more productive would be to deny them their just deserts. but as a moral concept, just deserts is inadequate and incomplete.\n\nad\n\nfor in determining whether any distribution of income is just, it is not enough to inquire whether someone has earned his income by playing by the rules. we must also look at the distribution of income and ask whether the rules themselves are fair and just.
there. there it is, a woman said.\n\nhe's perched. now he went to the right. and i lost him, said frank witebsky, an 82-year-old retired pathologist from silver spring, looking into his binoculars.\n\nare you kidding me? said carla morris, who lives in potomac, staring at the hillside in disbelief that this glorious bird was here, of all places.\n\nad\n\nit was a male painted bunting, a bird known for its kaleidoscope of colors — blue heads, red underparts, and green backs. it's a bird commonly seen in florida and other parts of the south but rarely in maryland.\n\nad\n\nit's unclear why the bird made its way this far north. but a recently published study from the national audubon society demonstrated that climate change is causing a shift in some birds' ranges during winter and breeding seasons.\n\nthe unusual sighting of the bird, along the potomac river, was first documented last week on the popular birding website ebird. as word spread, via listservs and facebook groups, excited birders poured into the park from across the region, hoping to catch a glimpse — or perhaps even a photo.\n\nad\n\nstanding between the 18th and 19th locks of the c&o canal, they came with their toddlers and infants, pushing strollers and adjusting masks on children's faces. they were amateurs and professionals, ages 6 months old to 82 years old, originally from hong kong and switzerland and wisconsin and new york.\n\non saturday, a warm and sunny day for the start of the new year, more than 1,100 people visited the park — about double the size of the typical crowd seen on a nice winter day. by 3 p.m., just a couple of hours before the park's closure at sundown, more than 80 cars were still in line to get in.\n\nas the temperatures dropped and rain fell over the region sunday, devoted birders returned. by midday, more than 100 people had visited the park, the majority of whom said they had come to see the bird, according to one visitor-use assistant for the national park service.\n\nad\n\nad\n\none of the first people in the park was jacques pitteloud, switzerland's ambassador to the united states. the 58-year-old has been birdwatching for half a century, ever since his parents gave him a bird guide as a boy growing up in switzerland. he has photographed birds all over the world and has published his pictures in several books and publications in kenya and south africa.\n\nbut he had always hoped to see the painted bunting someday, somewhere in the united states. to see it close to d.c., that was absolutely unrealistic, he said. at about 8:30 a.m. sunday, a birder next to him pointed it out, and he saw it just long enough to capture it with his camera lens.\n\nit was, he said, exceptional.\n\nad\n\nas he walked out of the park after spotting the bird, a woman passed with her two children.\n\ndid you see it? the woman asked. he told her he did, and offered to show her the photo on his camera.\n\nad\n\noh, my gosh, she said. so cool.\n\nfurther down the path, dozens of birders lined up along the canal, looking up at brush and trees on the hillside across from the towpath. the bird, which generally forages in shrubby areas and overgrown fields, stayed low and hidden between rocks and grass.\n\nbut morris was holding out hope that she'd catch a glimpse.\n\ni live for this, she said. i wish i'd brought my kids out here today.\n\nshe saw her first painted bunting years ago in florida, on vacation with her family. they had driven an hour and a half to see the bird from afar, but it was a bucket-list item, a bona fide lifer, as she and many other birders called it.\n\nad\n\nthey look like a splash of tempera paints splashed all over a canvas, she said.\n\nbut that was in its natural habitat. she never could have imagined the chance to see one here, so close to her home. in the winter, are you kidding? she said.\n\nad\n\nit was a moment she needed now more than ever. she had spent the holidays grieving her father, who died of covid-19 in wisconsin. she had wept watching the ball drop in times square on new year's eve, hearing a performance of pentatonix on tv at home with her children.\n\nthis brief and unexpected flash of beauty, after a time of so much sorrow, it's just magical, she said. it's a magical way to start the new year.\n\nad\n\na few feet away, vickie kwong and her husband, benson kwong, had arrived at the park from their home in rockville for the second day in a row. saturday's crowd was so large that it was nearly impossible to park, vickie kwong said. but the couple returned, hoping to see the bird they had heard so much about on social media.\n\nvickie kwong has watched birds for years, in central and south america, florida and europe. but it wasn't until the pandemic that she started searching for birds in her own neighborhood. this has been what's keeping me sane, she said.\n\nad\n\nin the past several months, her husband, benson kwong, 61, has also become invested — describing it to their children as their own version of pokémon go. the couple look at ebird every day, and they often drive to parks hours from rockville in hopes of spotting a new bird. they even made a book with their photos.\n\nad\n\nwe go bird crazy, vickie kwong said.\n\nto see the painted bunting, here, just minutes away from her home? vickie kwong's eyes lit up at the thought. she clapped her hands together in excitement.\n\nthat would make my year, she said.\n\nclarification: while the audubon society invoked the painted bunting in announcing its climate change study, the bird was not one of the species included in the study.
the defense department is continuing to abide by the other court orders that allow transgender men and women to enlist and serve, the pentagon said friday.\n\nad\n\neven so, the five-page ruling was a blow to the civil rights and gay rights organizations challenging the policy nationwide. in reversing a lower-court ruling, the appeals court wrote, the district court made an erroneous finding that the [administration's policy] was the equivalent of a blanket ban on transgender service.\n\nad\n\nthe appeals court order came after oral argument last month before judges thomas b. griffith, robert l. wilkins and stephen f. williams.\n\nthe court noted that its order was not a final ruling on the merits of the challenge, but that judges must give deference to military leaders when it comes to policy decisions about standards for service.\n\nad\n\nattorney jennifer levi, director of glad's transgender rights project, said the decision is based on the absurd idea that forcing transgender people to suppress who they are in order to serve is not a ban. it ignores the reality of transgender people's lives, with devastating consequences, and rests on a complete failure to understand who transgender people are. glad is an acronym for glbtq legal advocates and defenders.\n\npresident trump announced a sweeping ban on transgender people's military service via twitter in july 2017, citing what he viewed as the tremendous medical costs and disruption. the administration's order reversed president barack obama's policy of allowing transgender men and women to serve openly and receive funding for sex-reassignment surgery.\n\nattorneys for active-duty service members went to court to block the policy shift, which could subject current transgender service members to discharge and deny them certain medical care.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe court rulings were met with another policy revision this year from then-secretary of defense jim mattis, who issued a plan to bar men and women from the military who identify with a gender different from their birth gender and who are seeking to transition. mattis's plan makes exceptions, for instance, for about 900 transgender individuals who are already serving openly and for others who would serve in accordance with their birth gender.\n\nthe order friday said the lower-court erred by not giving sufficient weight to the administration's effort to revise its policy in response to the initial court ruling. the appeals court specifically mentioned the creation of a panel of military and medical experts for input.\n\nit was clear error to say there was no significant change, on the administration's part, the appeals court said.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe government took substantial steps to cure the procedural deficiencies the court identified, according to the order. although the mattis plan continues to bar many transgender persons from joining or serving in the military, the record indicates that the plan allows some transgender persons previously barred to join and serve.\n\nthe policy is not a blanket ban, the court concluded, because not all transgender persons seek to transition to their preferred gender or have gender dysphoria.\n\nshannon minter, legal director of the national center for lesbian rights, called the decision cursory and misinformed and said it rests on the utter fiction that this ban is not a ban. every other court has immediately understood that when you say you can serve only if you serve in your birth sex, that is a ban. it is dangerous and irresponsible.\n\nad\n\nad\n\npentagon spokeswoman jessica maxwell said friday the department would continue to press our case in the courts.\n\nas always, we treat all transgender persons with respect and dignity, she said in a statement. it is critical that the department be permitted to formulate personnel policies that it determines are necessary to ensure the most lethal and combat effective fighting force in the world.\n\nthe administration has separately asked the supreme court to intervene to allow the government to have the policy take effect. the high court has not yet acted on the administration's request.\n\npaul sonne contributed to this report.
thankfully, there are already resources to help translate our commitments to tangible actions. the social change ecosystem map is one such tool that i developed for individuals and organizations. it's anchored in a fundamental premise: that each of us can get better at doing good in the world when we are aligned with our values, clear about the roles we play and deeply connected to the people around us. this framework emerged during a period of confusion and uncertainty in my own life about how to show up in movements for justice during the emergencies of the past four years. as i began to observe how people were responding to various crises, i realized that they were engaged in an array of practices, from disrupting and storytelling to building and healing. these roles and many others are reflected in the social change map.

lifetime, she asked lawmakers: which side of history do you want to be on? . . . the world is watching — your mothers, your sisters, your daughters.\n\nad\n\ndel. vivian watts (d-fairfax) held up a photo of herself and her daughter demonstrating for the era in washington 44 years ago, when her daughter was 14. watts wore the same sash wednesday that she wore in the photo.\n\nit should be ancient history, watts said. forty-four years is a long time to wait.\n\nrepublican lawmakers, who bottled up the era in subcommittee during their 26 years in control of the house of delegates, tried to postpone action with parliamentary challenges. several also said the vote was merely symbolic, because it remains unclear whether the amendment can actually be ratified so long after its initial approval.\n\nad\n\nfirst proposed in 1923, the era was reintroduced in every session of congress until it passed in 1972. u.s. lawmakers set a deadline of march 22, 1979, for three-quarters of the states to ratify the amendment, a measure era supporters now say is unconstitutional because it was not included in the amendment text.\n\nad\n\nas that deadline approached, congress extended it to june 30, 1982. because only 35 of the needed 38 state legislatures ratified the era by that time, the amendment was declared a failure.\n\nsubsequently, legislatures in idaho, kentucky, nebraska, tennessee and south dakota rescinded their ratifications. era supporters say there is no provision for rescissions in the constitution, and therefore they do not count. no federal court has conclusively ruled on that question.\n\nsince 2017, nevada and illinois have ratified the era, which put virginia in place as the final state needed for ratification, if the five withdrawals are not counted. but the u.s. justice department last week issued a finding that the amendment had expired and could no longer be ratified.\n\nthe finding was requested by three state attorneys general who sued the archivist of the united states late last year in an attempt to keep him from registering the amendment if virginia passed it. their lawsuit is being challenged by two massachusetts organizations, who say only congress — not the executive branch — can interfere in a constitutional amendment process.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nseparately, several efforts are underway on capitol hill to either extend or restart the ratification process.\n\nelizabeth holtzman, a former member of congress from new york who sponsored the resolution extending the original ratification deadline to 1982, said wednesday that virginia's vote is a very big step forward.\n\nit's a recognition by three-quarters of the states that american women firmly belong in the united states constitution, she said in a phone call from paris. it's been a long time coming, far too long.\n\nwednesday's votes in richmond were not for final passage of the amendment. under parliamentary rules, each chamber still has to approve the other's version, even though they are identical. that process could take several days, but in this case is considered a formality.\n\nthe state senate has passed the era with bipartisan support several times in past sessions. this year, both chambers designated the measure joint resolution 1, signifying its priority status.\n\nthe house vote was recorded as 59-41, though one republican — wendell walker of lynchburg — said he voted yes inadvertently and filed a vote change. the other three republicans who sided with every democratic lawmaker were dels. carrie coyner (chesterfield), glenn davis (virginia beach) and jeff campbell (smyth county).\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe 28-12 senate vote included seven republicans in favor of the amendment. two of them — sens. siobhan dunnavant (henrico) and jennifer kiggans (virginia beach) — made floor speeches. kiggans, a former navy helicopter pilot and the first female military veteran in the general assembly, said that women have not needed the era to achieve great things, but that the measure's symbolism had value.\n\nconservative opponents say ratifying the era would make it harder to limit abortion and illegal to separate the sexes in bathrooms, college dormitories and school sports — assertions supporters dispute.\n\nthe so-called equal rights amendment will not give women any more rights than they have today, sen. amanda chase (r-chesterfield) said on the floor wednesday.\n\nsome era critics pointed to the presence of female legislators in richmond as proof that women were able to achieve in society even without the amendment.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbut supporters say the amendment is a matter of guaranteeing women rights and protections.\n\nit is our time, together, to embrace equal rights under the law for everyone, del. danica roem (d-prince william), the first openly transgender member of the virginia legislature, said to cheers and applause before the house vote.\n\nin the senate, which scrapped its planned agenda to take up the matter as its first order of business, sen. mamie locke (d-hampton) said she was baffled by the controversy over timing.\n\nthere's no time limit on equal rights, she said.\n\nabove, in the gallery, lynda bird johnson robb — a former virginia first lady and the daughter of president lyndon b. johnson — sat front and center, decked out in a purple pantsuit, the trademark color of the era movement.\n\nad\n\nshe also wore a purple sash displaying a half-dozen era pins she'd collected while supporting the cause. i wore this when i marched — i think it was 1980 or '79 — down pennsylvania avenue, she said.\n\nad\n\nstate sen. jennifer l. mcclellan (d-richmond) acknowledged the strides women have made in society and in the general assembly, where women hold a record number of seats, committee chairmanships and other leadership posts.\n\nand yet, we still have a long way to go, mcclellan said. i don't want to leave this fight unfinished for my daughter.\n\nafter the senate acted, era supporters celebrated in crowded capitol hallways.\n\nthis was 100 years in the making, said eileen davis, a longtime virginia era advocate and the mother of u.s. rep. abigail spanberger (d-va.). it's for all the women who didn't live to see this day, and all the women who barely lived to see this day.
as republican lawmakers took sides ahead of wednesday's joint session of congress to certify the electoral college results, some on monday voiced rare criticism of trump for his attempt to pressure georgia elections officials to change vote totals there during a saturday phone call, a recording of which was published by the washington post.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nsome congressional republicans on jan. 4 criticized president trump for asking georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger to find votes. (the washington post)\n\nrep. liz cheney (wyo.), the no. 3 house republican, said the call was deeply troubling and urged all americans to listen to the hour-long conversation, while sen. patrick j. toomey (r-pa.) condemned it as a new low in this whole futile and sorry episode. even one of trump's most loyal defenders, sen. marsha blackburn (r-tenn.), said it was not a helpful call.\n\ntrump signaled he had little patience for defections by members of what he dubbed the surrender caucus. after sen. tom cotton (r-ark.) announced that he was not joining the band of gop lawmakers objecting to the electoral college results, trump attacked cotton on twitter and warned that voters would never forget!\n\nthe president is trying to mobilize a show of strength that could intimidate lawmakers who certify the result, exhorting his supporters to travel to washington for mass protests wednesday. he is planning to speak to the crowd on the ellipse around midday wednesday, two officials familiar with the planning said.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ntrump in recent days has blasted senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) for having no fight, publicly recruited a primary challenger to the senate's no. 2 republican, john thune (s.d.), and called on georgia gov. brian kemp (r) to resign.\n\nthirteen senators and more than 100 house members are planning to object to the electoral college results in wednesday's proceedings, but trump is befuddled as to why many more republicans are not falling in line with him, advisers said.\n\nfueling the president's indignation is his belief that he is the true victor because that is what the advisers in his ear continue to tell him, according to one of trump's closest advisers, who like some others interviewed for this report spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid.\n\nad\n\nhe incontrovertibly thinks he won — and he thinks he won big — and the people around him don't disabuse him of that because they don't want to get crosswise, and because they told him he was going to win, so they can have it both ways, this adviser said. it's not about his inability to move on. it's about his inability to even diagnose what happened. he won't yet conduct the autopsy, if you will.\n\nad\n\nstill, trump is not entirely blind to reality. he has asked several advisers in recent weeks for advice on what he should do instead of attending president-elect joe biden's inauguration on jan. 20, according to two people who have spoken to him.\n\nafter days of watching trump toss hand grenades at fellow republicans, party officials said they were deeply concerned he might veer off script and continue his destructive antics onstage monday night in georgia, at a rally on the eve of runoff elections that will decide which party controls the senate.\n\nad\n\naides had encouraged the president to deliver a simple message to georgia voters that they must turn out to protect his legacy. but trump had something else in mind. the first words out of his mouth at the rally in dalton were: there's no way we lost georgia. that was a rigged election.\n\nad\n\ntrump went on to bash kemp and georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger, claim they were not real republicans, and promise to campaign against both men when they stand for reelection in 2022.\n\nthe president also falsely said he had won reelection in a landslide and suggested that he expects vice president pence to make it so when he fulfills his constitutional duty to preside over wednesday's joint session of congress, even though the vice president does not have the power to overturn the results.\n\nad\n\ni hope mike pence comes through for us, i have to tell you, trump told the applauding georgia crowd. of course, if he doesn't come through, i won't like him quite as much.\n\ngop strategists say trump's infatuation with personal grievances and false claims of a rigged and stolen election in november could depress their party's turnout tuesday, dooming republicans david perdue and kelly loeffler.\n\nad\n\ngeorgia's voting systems manager, gabriel sterling, refuted trump's voter fraud claims point by point at a news conference monday in atlanta. this is all easily, provably false, yet the president persists, sterling said. we have claim after claim after claim, with zero proof. zero.\n\nad\n\ntrump has been uninterested in governing or managing the pandemic — or even burnishing his legacy — and is almost entirely focused on the election, spending considerable time talking about it with white house chief of staff mark meadows and presidential personnel director johnny mcentee, officials said.\n\ntrump has complained that he does not think he will get credit if perdue and loeffler win but will be blamed if they lose, according to the close adviser.\n\ntrump's focus on georgia has been less about the marquee senate contests than about rewriting his own history. though he has been preoccupied by scheming to reverse the national outcome, advisers said trump has been singularly fixated on georgia — a once solidly red state he had assumed he would easily carry.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ninstead, trump became the first republican presidential candidate to lose georgia in three decades — a fact he cannot fathom and a historical distinction he loathes, according to people familiar with his thinking. trump campaign officials were so convinced they'd win in georgia that they rejected calls to direct more money and staffing to the state, a former senior campaign official said.\n\nhonestly, i think that he cannot handle being the sitting republican president that lost georgia, said a gop official in frequent touch with the white house.\n\nseveral republicans in georgia said they're not sure trump really wants loeffler or perdue to win because if they do, it undermines his central complaint that the state's elections are rigged. it would also pour salt in the wound of his defeat in the state, something he has struggled to understand, stating repeatedly on the weekend call with raffensperger that it's simply not possible for him to have lost there.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ntrump advisers said he is especially bothered that a democratic politician he has long disdained, former state house minority leader stacey abrams, is credited with orchestrating the winning ground game in georgia and that two republican politicians he thought would do his bidding, kemp and raffensperger, refuse to try to rig the result in his favor.\n\nthe president's animus toward kemp is especially pronounced. as one republican familiar with his transactional thinking explained it, trump believes that he made kemp governor by endorsing him in a competitive primary in 2018, and therefore kemp is his lackey and should do precisely what trump instructs him to do.\n\nstill, reversing the georgia result would not be enough for trump to retain the presidency.\n\nlet's say you get raffensperger to commit fraud and get you the 11,000 votes — what does that even get you? said the republican official in frequent touch with the white house. you still need three other states. i don't understand what the 'win' is here. there's no strategy.\n\nad\n\ntrump has been focused on reversing the outcomes in other states, too — including arizona and pennsylvania. but of the states where biden notched narrow wins, only georgia has a republican governor and secretary of state, a fact trump has assumed could work to his advantage. elections officials in several other battlegrounds where he contested his defeat said the president has not reached out to them as he did to raffensperger.\n\nin private conversations with advisers and associates, trump has been fixated on a handful of states and ticking through various ways he says he was robbed in each of them, according to one adviser who spoke to the president about the issue last week.\n\nmost everyone doesn't want to talk to him about it anymore, this adviser said. he's a broken record.\n\nthe president's comments to raffensperger on their hour-long phone call echoed comments he has made privately to aides and advisers recently.\n\ntrump had tried to reach raffensperger at least 18 times before saturday's call, according to raffensperger's deputy, jordan fuchs, but the calls were patched to interns in the press office who thought it was a prank and didn't realize it was actually the president on the line. meadows arranged saturday's call after collecting all the participants' cellphone numbers and connecting with them directly.\n\ntrump's intensifying drive to overturn the election results has deepened a gop divide on capitol hill. mcconnell last month urged republican senators not to object to the electoral college vote certification in wednesday's joint session. but now that 13 have said they would, the leader has stepped back from any significant effort to tamp down the brewing rebellion. he is not whipping votes and has not spoken to trump in weeks.\n\nin conversations with other senate republicans, mcconnell has stressed that their decision now will be a matter of conscience and that each senator should vote the way he or she has to vote, according to two senior gop officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to relay the majority leader's private posture.\n\nsome republican senators have expressed concerns that voting to certify — and against trump — would open them up to a primary challenge from the right, while others worry that voting to object would make them vulnerable in a general election, a person familiar with the deliberations said.\n\ni think it is revealing that there is not a single senator who is arguing that the election was stolen from president trump, said josh holmes, an outside adviser to mcconnell. the divide in the party is whether it's appropriate to pull the pin on an electoral college grenade, hoping that there are enough responsible people standing around who can shove it back in before they detonate american democracy.\n\nloeffler on monday said she would object to certification, as sen. josh hawley (r-mo.) and a separate coalition of 11 senators led by sen. ted cruz (r-tex.) have also pledged to do.\n\nmichael steele, a former republican national committee chairman and a trump critic, warned of the long-term peril for those who object.\n\nthey are sealing themselves inside the very tomb that donald trump built for them, steele said. when they commit this act on wednesday, where do they go from there? . . . these people are wholly owned subsidiaries of trump inc. they are functionaries like the men and women who manage his properties and mop his bathrooms and clean his hotels.\n\nat least two more gop senators said monday that they would vote to affirm the electoral college results, joining toomey and others. in a lengthy statement, sen. rob portman (r-ohio), who is up for reelection in 2022, said he would vote to affirm the duly chosen electors from any contested state. he said that he cannot support allowing congress to thwart the will of the voters.\n\nand sen. shelley moore capito (r-w.va.) said it would be a grave step for lawmakers to reject votes that were certified by the states. i swore an oath to support and defend the constitution of the united states, she said. recognizing the individual chosen by the american people to be our president is in keeping with this oath.\n\ntrump sought monday to try to scare republican lawmakers from breaking with him on certification. he tweeted, the 'surrender caucus' within the republican party will go down in infamy as weak and ineffective 'guardians' of our nation, who were willing to accept the certification of fraudulent presidential numbers!\n\nsenate gop leaders have remained in the dark about the extent of the rogue senators' objections, largely because the rebels had yet to finalize their strategy with less than 48 hours before the joint session.\n\nhawley has said he will object to the counting of electors from pennsylvania but has not ruled out other states. members of the faction led by cruz have yet to identify a single state they plan to contest, saying only that they plan to reject electors from unspecified disputed states unless they secure a 10-day audit of election returns.\n\ngop officials said monday that the extent of the cruz group's objections was still being discussed, although the lack of a clear endgame has privately worried even some aides involved in the effort.\n\nin the house, the top two republican leaders have largely remained silent on efforts to object, but the no. 3 official, cheney, circulated a detailed memo warning that questioning the state-certified results would set an exceptionally dangerous precedent that essentially usurps the responsibility of individual states. objecting to the electors, cheney argued, was directly at odds with the constitution's clear text and our core beliefs as republicans.
1. why is this mutation alarming?\n\npreliminary analyses suggest it is 56% to 70% more transmissible than other circulating sars-cov-2 strains and contributing to a spike in cases in the u.k. dubbed the b.1.1.7 lineage, the strain has acquired 17 mutations compared to its most recent ancestor -- a faster rate of change than scientists typically observe. some of those are in key areas involved in the virus's ability to infect cells. researchers have found no evidence that the mutation causes more severe illness. a report by imperial college london researchers released on dec. 31 found a small but statistically significant indication that this particular mutation affects younger people -- those under 20 -- more than other variants do, though the reason could be circumstantial. a team of scientists concluded in an analysis released by the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine that, without new control measures in the u.k., the increase in transmissibility would likely lead to more hospitalizations and deaths in 2021 than in 2020.\n\nad\n\nad\n\n2. what's known about when it emerged?\n\nthe two earliest known specimens were collected in late september in london and the nearby county of kent, and cases continued to be found through early december. one reason the new variant proliferated was that its emergence coincided with the festive season traditionally associated with increased family and social mixing. scientists have hypothesized that the strain may have resulted from the transmission of the virus from a chronically infected patient.\n\n3. how quickly has it spread?\n\nthe new variant was responsible for 62% of sars-cov-2 infections in london in the week ending dec. 9, up from 28% in early november, according to paul hunter, a professor of medicine at the university of east anglia's norwich school of medicine. an analysis of 641 covid-19 cases in the u.k. found those with the variant had 10-to-100 times higher concentrations of the coronavirus in their noses compared with infections caused by 'regular' sars-cov-2, which may explain the higher transmissibility.\n\nad\n\nad\n\n4. where else has the virus been seen?\n\ncases have been identified in more than 30 countries including the u.s., australia, canada, germany, italy, japan, lebanon, the netherlands, singapore and south korea.\n\n5. is it increasing covid-19 transmission?\n\nwhile factors such as people congregating indoors more in colder weather may also contribute to spread, the new variant has become the dominant strain in some areas, suggesting it has a selective advantage over other versions, according to the u.k.'s new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group. in minutes from a dec. 18 teleconference, the group noted that the b.1.1.7 lineage may result in an increase in the basic reproduction number, or r0 (the average number of new infections estimated to stem from a single case) in the range of 0.39 to 0.93 -- a substantial increase in transmissibility compared to other variants. infection rates in areas where the strain has been circulating have increased faster than expected, public health england said dec. 20.\n\nad\n\nad\n\n6. how many other mutations are there?\n\nviruses constantly change through mutations that arise naturally as they replicate and circulate in their hosts. as a result of this ongoing process, many thousands of mutations and distinct lineages have already arisen in the sars-cov-2 genome since the virus emerged in late 2019. a new variant in south africa, known as 501.v2, has driven a surge in infections there, according to country health officials. that strain has also turned up elsewhere, including in the u.k. and finland. as mutations continue to arise, novel variants are increasingly found, with the vast majority of mutations having no apparent effect on the virus. scientists pay most attention to mutations that involve genes like the one that encodes the sars-cov-2 spike protein, which is altered in the u.k. variant. targeted by vaccines, this protein is associated with viral entry into cells and influences immunity and vaccine efficacy.\n\n7. will vaccines still be effective?\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe extent to which sars-cov-2 may evolve to escape immunity induced by infection or vaccination isn't currently known. maria van kerkhove, the world health organization's technical lead on covid-19, told the bbc dec. 20 that information as of then suggested the new variant doesn't have any impact on the vaccines being rolled out. drug makers including biontech se, astrazeneca plc and curevac nv have said they don't believe their vaccines' efficacy will be affected. over time, however, as more mutations occur, vaccines may need to be altered. this happens on an annual basis with seasonal flu, which evolves quickly. unlike flu, coronaviruses have a genetic self-correcting mechanism that minimizes mutations. covid-19 shots that have proved effective in trials can be easily tweaked if necessary, vaccine makers said.\n\n(adds research on viral load in no. 3 and updates tally in no. 4)\n\nfor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com
the board's decision presents a serious hurdle for the project, which had been approved by federal and state regulatory agencies.\n\ncolumbia gas, a subsidiary of transcanada, could challenge the board's decision. the company will consider our options over the coming days to keep this project on track, spokesman scott castleman wrote in an email.\n\nad\n\ntoday's vote denying our easement request is unfortunate, castleman wrote. that being said, it does not change the need for, or the company's commitment to, our eastern panhandle expansion project.\n\nad\n\nthe 3.5-mile pipeline, known as the potomac pipeline, would bring natural gas from pennsylvania to west virginia, bisecting the narrowest slice of maryland's panhandle and running beneath the potomac river and chesapeake and ohio canal in western maryland.\n\ncastleman called the pipeline critical for west virginia's eastern panhandle and said an extensive review process has confirmed that through proper design and construction our project can be completed in an environmentally responsible and safe manner.\n\nad\n\nenvironmentalists said the pipeline could jeopardize the drinking water supply of about 6 million people, many of them in the washington area, even though the proposed maryland route is about 100 miles from the district.\n\nopponents of the pipeline who came to the board of public works meeting wednesday in annapolis applauded after the final vote.\n\nad\n\nthey agreed to protect the public, said barbara stiefel, an activist from west virginia, referring to hogan, comptroller peter franchot and treasurer nancy k. kopp, who make up the board of public works.\n\nfranchot, a democrat, said the board found testimony from activists, who spoke at a public hearing in december, compelling.\n\nad\n\nwe were being asked to jeopardize the environment and not get any economic benefits, franchot said in an interview following the vote. he called the unanimous vote a great victory.\n\nin brief remarks, hogan said the board's decision had nothing to do with any letter from the legislature. the governor said he had to leave the board meeting last month early but had thought the easement request had been voted against then. instead, the vote was deferred until wednesday's meeting.\n\nad\n\nwe were always going to have a 3-nothing vote, hogan said.\n\nin a letter sent to the board of public works on tuesday, state senators and delegates said the pipeline would reverse course on our state's efforts to protect the health of our residents and combat climate change.\n\nad\n\nmoreover, enabling fossil fuel production runs counter to our state's goals of increasing renewable energy production, the legislators wrote.\n\nsome activists expressed surprise that hogan joined franchot and kopp in voting against the easement, noting that he did not halt the project when they requested he do so last year. at the time, hogan's office said the issue was for the army corps of engineers to decide.\n\nann bristow, an activist with the group frack-free frostburg, said she was pleasantly surprised by hogan's vote. she compared it to his 2017 decision to call for a ban on fracking, after previously supporting it. he said then that he had changed his mind because he didn't believe it could be done in an environmentally sensitive manner.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhe saw the writing on the wall — he wants to be on the right side of history, she said.\n\nmeanwhile, environmental activists in virginia have been waging their own fight against two fracked gas pipelines proposed to run through rural sections of that state.\n\nopponents of the proposed atlantic coast pipeline have won a string of legal victories that have brought work on the $7 billion, 600-mile natural gas pipeline to a halt, at least temporarily. several rulings are under appeal, while an even bigger case looms in the new year.\n\nthat project, spearheaded by dominion energy, would carry fracked natural gas through rugged mountain terrain and several national forests from west virginia through central virginia and into north carolina.
the uncertainty surrounding the length and terms of his stay has caused tension in my relationship with my boyfriend, and more than a few fights. we have had ongoing issues, but before bart arrived, our relationship was in a good place, although communication is clearly still something we need to work on.\n\nad\n\nall i want is a rough timeline and clear expectations. after more than a year of living in my boyfriend's parents' infested and cluttered basement, i want our home back. i want bart to reevaluate his own expectations, find his own apartment and start building his life, so we can focus on building ours.\n\nad\n\ni'm not sure i will get wally 100 percent onboard with having this conversation with bart. i have asked him to, but he said he doesn't want to ask him too many questions because he believes it is none of our business.\n\ni would like to casually start the conversation with both of them in the room so that both of us can hear what bart's thoughts are concerning his future.\n\nad\n\ni know what i want to say, but how do i say it without coming off like i'm kicking him out?\n\ncrowded\n\ncrowded: you co-own this house. you have an equal right to express how the house is run and who lives there. i suggest you firmly locate your backbone and freely share your reasonable concern with both men. because you have allowed this man to live in your home as a tenant, it might be more difficult to get him to leave than you realize.\n\nad\n\nmost important, you are in a relationship where you don't think you have an equal voice. you seem to have agreed to this tenancy beforehand, and either you were too passive to express your doubts at the time, or the reality of this has given you second thoughts.\n\nad\n\ndon't ask permission to express yourself. tell your boyfriend that as a co-owner of this property, you'd like to make this casual arrangement official, including an end date. call a house meeting, present a legal short-term lease with a definite expiration, ask bart to sign it and then hold him to it. bart's plans are his own business, just as his tenancy in your home is your business.\n\ndear amy: i've been with my boyfriend for four years. we have been living together for three years.\n\nlately, i feel i'm wasting my time with this relationship.\n\nad\n\nhis family always comes first, and i can't take it anymore. i've talked to him about it, many times, and he always says that things will change soon — but they don't.\n\nad\n\ni don't know how to approach the situation. this is a major block in our relationship. we have talked about the future, but it doesn't look bright to me. can you please give me some help?\n\nalmost done\n\nalmost done: you and your guy have been together for several years. you don't give details about his family priorities, but in a healthy relationship, partners put themselves at the center of their family life. his family — and yours — should accept some realignment.\n\nyou have described this as a major problem in your relationship, and despite talking about it he either isn't able — or doesn't want — to change.\n\nyou already know everything you need to know. if this isn't the relationship you want to be in, you should consider leaving it.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ndear amy: i just wanted to thank you for your advice for burdened, the man worrying about the child he had fathered as a teenager who was given up for adoption. honesty and truth are the absolute best policy.\n\nas someone who works to reunite adopted children and birthparents, burdened's other children would probably be far angrier to find out about their half-sibling after his death.\n\nthank you for encouraging him to be honest.\n\nadvocate\n\nadvocate: there has been a large and compassionate response to this question. thank you.
as the sole democrat on georgia's state election board on sunday urged raffensperger to investigate the president over the call, some lawyers and legal scholars said trump's actions indeed appeared to violate both state and federal criminal statutes.\n\nad\n\non social media, much of the conversation among legal observers and trump critics revolved around a federal statute, 52 u.s. code 20511, which makes it a crime to knowingly and willfully deprive or defraud a state's residents of a free or fair election — or to attempt to do so.\n\nad\n\neric h. holder jr., the former attorney general under president barack obama, shared the text of that statute on twitter on sunday. as you listen to the tape consider this federal criminal statute, holder wrote.\n\nthe question, according to justin levitt, a law professor at loyola marymount university, is whether trump was knowingly and willfully pressuring raffensperger to count nonexistent votes when he told the gop official, i just want to find 11,780 votes.\n\nad\n\nin other words: does trump actually believe that 11,780 ballots in his favor were cast but not counted?\n\nconsidering that two recounts, an audit and several judges have upheld president-elect joe biden's win in georgia, levitt said it is clear trump was not pushing for an honest tally of the votes.\n\neither the president was engaged in the commission of a felony, he said, or he has lost his hold on reality such that he can no longer distinguish fact from the fictions he has been fed.\n\nad\n\nmichael r. bromwich, a former justice department inspector general, put it more bluntly on twitter: his best defense would be insanity.\n\nsince 52 u.s. code 20511 was adopted as part of the national voter registration act of 1993, it has been used sparingly by federal prosecutors. it was used in 2005 to go after milwaukee woman kimberly prude, who voted illegally in the city while still on probation. but levitt said there is no precedent to use it against someone of trump's stature.\n\nad\n\nother legal scholars said that trump possibly violated 18 u.s. code 241, which makes it illegal to participate in a conspiracy against people exercising their civil rights. that long-standing statute has been used frequently to prosecute acts of voter intimidation, especially those committed by the ku klux klan against black voters.\n\nad\n\nbut charging trump under that code would require prosecutors to show that someone else on the phone call was also aiding and abetting a scheme, levitt said.\n\nadditionally, trump's apparent threat of criminal consequences if raffensperger failed to act could be seen as an attempt at extortion, the post reported.\n\non the state level, trump's call could also have violated a georgia statute.\n\nad\n\nleigh ann webster, a criminal defense attorney in atlanta, told the post that in georgia, trump could run afoul of a state law that makes it illegal to cause someone else to take part in election fraud — by soliciting, requesting or commanding it.\n\nthat's the same statute cited sunday by david j. worley, the georgia election board member who asked raffensperger to investigate trump. in his email to the gop official, worley said that probable cause may exist to find violations of that law.\n\nit's a crime to solicit election fraud, and asking the secretary to change the votes is a textbook definition of election fraud, worley said in an interview with the post.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe argument may be more straightforward compared to a potential federal case. under the georgia statute, webster said the crime would be merely asking someone else to partake in one of several forms of election fraud, including interfering with the secretary of state's handling of an election.\n\nbut because such matters at the state level have rarely been interpreted in court, none of this is bulletproof, she said.\n\nand whether trump broke federal state law, it's a different question of whether any prosecutor would try to charge him.\n\nuntil biden is sworn in on jan. 20, legal scholars say there is virtually no chance of federal charges being filed. besides the short time frame, levitt said, the justice department maintains a long-standing principle that a federal prosecutor may not prosecute a sitting president.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nno such principle exists once a commander in chief is out of office. yet under a biden administration juggling many competing priorities, going after trump in the courts could be a politically fraught choice.\n\ntrevor potter, a republican and former federal election commission chairman who was appointed by president george h.w. bush, told the new york times there is a good argument that trump was pushing for a fraudulent vote count during the call.\n\nbut even if the biden justice department thinks they have a good case, is that how they want to start off the biden presidency? he said. that is a policy decision.
text: george w. bush's speech to the naacp emediamillworks\n\nmonday, july 10, 2000 following is the transcript of george w. bush's speech delivered at the naacp's 91st annual convention. bush: thank you all very much. well, herb (ph), i'm glad they picked you. and i'm glad you introduced me. it's a great honor to be here, and i can't think of a better introducer than a fellow texan. i'm honored to be here with chairman bond, president mfume, members of the board of directors, the executive committee. i want to thank you all for your warm welcome. i've been looking forward to this, i really have, i've been looking forward to coming to tell you something. (applause) i'm reminded--i'm reminded--i'm reminded of what the great jackie robinson once said when president kennedy did something that upset him. jackie robinson said that he was sure the president was a fine man, but he reserved the right to change his opinion. and for those of you who support me--i see a couple here... (applause) maybe more than a couple. (applause) i hope you won't change your opinion. (laughter) and for those of you who don't, i hope at least you take jackie's position as your own and give me a chance to tell you what's on my heart. (applause) i recognize the history of the republican party and the naacp has not been one of regular partnership. but our nation is harmed when we let our differences separate us and divide us. so while some in my party have avoided the naacp, and while some in the naacp have avoided my party... (laughter) ... i'm proud to be here. i'm proud to be here. (applause) i'm here--i'm here because i believe there's so much that we can do together to advance racial harmony and economic opportunity. before we go to the future, we must acknowledge our past. in the darkest days of the civil war, president lincoln pleaded to our divided nation to remember that we cannot escape history, that we will be remembered in spite of ourselves. one hundred and forty years later, that's still true. for our nation, there is no denying the truth that slavery is a blight on our history and that racism, despite all the progress, still exists today. for my party, there is no escaping the reality that the party of lincoln has not always carried the mantle of lincoln. recognizing and confronting our history is important. transcending our history is essential. we're not limited by what we have done or what we have left undone. we're limited only by what we're willing to do. (applause) our nation must make new a commitment to equality and upward mobility to all of the citizens. this is a great moment of national prosperity, but many still live in prosperity's shadow. the same economy that is a miracle for millions is a mystery to millions as well. from the beginning of this campaign, i have said that prosperity must have a purpose. the purpose of prosperity is to ensure the american dream touches every willing heart. and we cannot afford to have an america segregated by class, by race, or by aspiration. america must close the gap of hope between communities of prosperity and communities of poverty. we have seen what happens--we've seen what happens when african-american citizens have the opportunity they've earned and the respect that they deserve. men and women once victimized by jim crow have risen to leadership in the halls of congress. (applause) professionals and entrepreneurs have built a successful and growing and ever stronger african-american middle class. it must be our goal to expand this opportunity, to make it as broad and diverse as america its success--america itself. and this begins by enforcing the civil rights laws. (applause) discrimination is still a reality, even when it takes different forms. instead of jim crow, there's racial redlining and profiling. instead of separate but equal, there is separate and forgotten. strong civil rights enforcement will be a cornerstone of my administration. (applause) and i will confront another form of bias: the soft bigotry of low expectations. (applause) several months ago i visited central high school in little rock, arkansas, where african-americans confronted injustice and white americans confronted their conscience. in 43 years, we have come so far in opening the doors of our schools. but today we have a challenge of our own. while all can enter our schools, many--too many, are not learning there. there's a tremendous gap of achievement between rich and poor, white and minority. this, too, leaves a divided society. and whatever the causes, the effect is discrimination. my friend phyllis hunter (ph), of houston, texas, calls reading the new civil right. equality in our country will remain a distant dream until every child, of every background, learns so that he or she may strive and rise in this world. no child in america should be segregated by low expectations, imprisoned by illiteracy, abandoned to frustration and the darkness of self-doubt. (applause) there's reason for optimism in this land. a great movement of education reform has begun in this country built on clear principles: to raise the bar of standards, expect every child can learn; to give schools the flexibility to meet those standards; to measure progress and insist upon results; to blow the whistle on failure; to provide parents with options to increase their option, like charters and choice; and also remember the role of education is to leave no child behind. i believe in these principles, and i've seen them work; i've seen them turn around troubled schools in my state, schools labeled by the world at-risk. at-risk means you're not supposed to learn, but we've challenged that in the state of texas. i've seen these schools and principles bring new hope, inspiring new confidences and ambitions. and i'm especially proud, in my state, that we're improve--our minority students are improving faster than almost any other state in the union. and i am especially proud of this fact: that african-american fourth graders in the state of texas have better math skills than any other students--african-american students in any state in the united states of america. (applause) and we can make this progress at the national level. a central part of my agenda, for example, is to challenge and change title 1, to make sure we close the achievement gap, to make sure that children are not forgotten and simply shuffled through the system. under my vision, all students must be measured. we must test to know. and low-performing schools, those schools that won't teach and won't change, will have three years to produce results, three years to meet standards, three years to make sure the very faces of our future are not mired in mediocrity. and if they're able to do so, the resources must go to the parents so that parents can make a different choice. you see, no child--no child should be left behind in america. (applause) see every child can learn. every child can learn. and every child in this country deserves to grow in knowledge and character and ideals. nothing in my view is more important to our prosperity and goodness than cultivated minds and courageous hearts. as w.e.b. du bois said a century ago, either the united states will destroy ignorance or ignorance will destroy the united states. education is the essential beginning, but we've got to go further. to create communities of promise, we must help people build the confidence and faith to achieve their own dreams. we must put government squarely on the side of opportunity. there's a higher and older tradition in my party. lincoln argued that every poor man should have a chance. he defended a clear path for all. he financed colleges and welcomed immigrants, promoted railroads and economic development. through the homestead act, he gave countless americans a piece of land for a start in a life. i propose a new prosperity initiative that reflects the spirit of lincoln's reforms, a plan to remove obstacles on the road to the middle class. you see, instead of helping people cope with their need, we will help them move beyond it. and here's some of the ideas of the new prosperity initiative--just some of the thoughts. we must provide a family health credit that covers 90 percent of the cost of basic health policy for low-income families. we must make it possible for more people to become homeowners in this great land, to own a part of the american dream. we would allow low-income families to use up to a year's worth of section 8 rental payments to make a down-payment on their own home, then use five years of those payments to help with the mortgage. (applause) we'll start an american dream down-payment fund, matching individual savings to the down-payment for a home. behind these last two proposals is a simple belief: i believe in private property. i believe in private property so strongly i want everybody to have some. (applause) education helps the young. empowerment lifts the able. but there are those who need much more: children without role models; young people captured by gangs, addiction or despair. government can spend money, but it cannot put hope in someone's heart or a sense of purpose in someone's life. this is done by caring communities, by churches and charities that serve their neighbors because they love their god. every day they prove that our worst problems are not hopeless or endless. every day they perform miracles of renewal. what we need is a new attitude that welcomes the transforming power of faith. in the words of a writer who visited the mount haven (ph) section of bronx, ``the beautiful old stone church is a gentle sanctuary from the terror of the streets outside.'' in city after city, for the suffering and hurting, the most powerful passageway is the door of the house of god. we're going to extend the role and reach of charities and churches and synagogues and mosques, mentors and community healers in our society. as president, i will rally the armies of compassion in neighborhoods all across america. i'll lift the regulations that hamper private and faith-based programs. i'll involve them in after-school programs and maternity group homes, drug treatment programs and prison ministries. and i have laid out specific incentives to encourage an outpouring of giving in america. here's one example: more than 1 million children have one or both parents in prison. these are the forgotten children, almost six times more likely to go to prison themselves. and they should not be punished for the sins of their fathers. we should give grants to ministries and mentoring programs that offer support and love and concern for these children. let us bring hope and help to these other innocent victims of crime. i'm not calling for government to step back from its responsibilities, but to share in them. we'll always need government to raise and distribute funds, to monitor success and set standards. but we also need what no government can provide, the power of compassion and prayer and love. (applause) these are some of my goals for america to help make opportunity not only a hope and a promise, but a living reality. the naacp and the gop have not always been allies. i know that. but recognizing our past and confronting the future with a common vision, by doing that, i believe we can find common ground. it won't be easy work, but a philosopher once advised, when given a choice, prefer the hard. we will prefer the hard, because only the hard will achieve the good. that's my commitment, and that is our opportunity. thank you for having me, and god bless america.\n\n© 2000 the washington post company\n\nfront | political news | elections | the issues | federal page | polls\n\ncolumns - cartoons | live online | online extras | photo galleries | video - audio
but they are going to have to do it without the services of wide receiver jordy nelson, who was ruled out of sunday's game against the dallas cowboys with multiple rib fractures.\n\nrodgers and nelson became the most prolific quarterback-receiver combination in franchise history this season with their 58th touchdown pass and catch, surpassing brett favre and antonio freeman, and the two have been near perfect during the packers' run the table winning streak, including the playoffs, connecting on 45 of 56 targets for 607 yards, five touchdowns and zero interceptions since week 12 — resulting in the highest passer rating (141.6) between a quarterback and receiver during that stretch. rodgers's other receiver, davante adams, ranked no. 2.\n\nrodgers struggled when nelson missed the 2015 season with a knee injury, producing his lowest rating (92.7) as green bay's starting quarterback, but he doesn't think nelson's absence will be an issue.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwe're doing a lot of different things than we were last year, a lot of things better, rodgers told the associated press on thursday. i think our offensive line is playing better. our scheme has advanced, and we're getting more contributions from the tight end at this point.\n\ndavante [adams] is a legit receiver in this league, and obviously randall cobb, who is established as well.\n\nrodgers is right, the packers offensive line has improved. left tackle david bakhtiari was awarded the highest pass-block rating among tackles from the game charters at pro football focus this season and right tackle bryan bulaga was ranked at no. 4. center corey linsley, who has started the past 10 since he returned from a hamstring injury, ranked ninth at the position. overall, green bay's offensive line is allowing a sack rate of 5.5 percent this season after adjusting for down, distance and opponent, a huge improvement over last year (7.4 percent rate in 2015).\n\nad\n\nad\n\ntight end jared cook, who thinks rodgers is part pocket ninja and part robot, was a huge asset the packers passing game this season and appeared to be a ninja himself with the way he kept getting open against the giants secondary. per espn stats and information, rodgers has 21 touchdowns and just one interception with cook on the field this season.\n\nadams took a big step forward in his third season, catching 75 of 121 passes for 997 yards and 12 touchdowns. he caught eight passes for 125 yards and a touchdown against the giants — all after nelson was forced out of the game.\n\nhobbled by an ankle injury that left adams unable to get open consistently in 2015, it didn't matter this season if he was open or not. according to matt harmon of nfl.com, adams caught the highest percentage of targets in tight coverage — less than a yard of separation from his defender — this year (69.6 percent). the chicago bears' alshon jeffery was second with a 60.9 percent catch rate in tight coverage.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nrodgers can also count on cobb and his versatility. more than two-thirds of his routes during the regular season were from the slot (78.4 percent) but he showed how productive he can be anywhere on the field after catching five passes for 116 yards and three touchdowns (tying the nfl for most in a single playoff game) against the giants in the wild-card game, which included a game-changing hail mary to end the first half.\n\nand then there is ty montgomery, the converted wide receiver who has carried the ball 77 times for 457 yards and three touchdowns, adding 44 receptions for 348 yards catching passes out of the backfield. the second-year pro is averaging 5.9 yards per carry with 4.5 of those yards coming after contact.
nixon hoped antitrust threat would sway network coverage by walter pincus and george lardner jr.\n\nwashington post staff writers\n\nmonday, december 01, 1997; page a01\n\nfrom the post\n\nthe nixon tapes on washingtonpost.com\n\nwatergate report\n\nthe best way to intimidate the nation's three major television networks, president richard m. nixon concluded in 1971, was to keep the constant threat of an antitrust suit hanging over them. if the threat of screwing them is going to help us more with their programming than doing it, then keep the threat, nixon told a white house aide in a tape-recorded oval office conversation recently transcribed for the first time. don't screw them now. [otherwise] they'll figure that we're done. preoccupied with unfavorable treatment by the news media, nixon frequently sought ways to retaliate or at least to counterbalance negative portrayals. white house tapes transcribed for the washington post and newsweek further reveal a president obsessed with efforts to improve his image and eagerly plotting to discredit his detractors. the newly transcribed tapes — among 200 hours of conversations released by the national archives after a long court battle — bolster other nixon archival records, which were compiled before the taping system was installed in february 1971 and which show that some schemes were devised in the earliest days of nixon's presidency. nixon's previously unpublished pronouncements about the television networks occurred during a july 2, 1971, discussion with aide charles w. colson, who played a central role in pressuring the news media to change their critical coverage of the nixon administration. colson told nixon that whether filing an antitrust case against abc, nbc and cbs is good or not is perhaps not the major political consideration. but keeping this case in a pending status gives us one hell of a club on an economic issue that means a great deal to those three networks ... something of a sword of damocles. nixon responded, our gain is more important than the economic gain. we don't give a goddam about the economic gain. our game here is solely political. ... as far as screwing them is concerned, i'm very glad to do it. although attorney general john n. mitchell wanted to file an antitrust suit against the networks because of their monopoly ownership of prime-time programs, according to the nixon-colson tape transcript, nixon decided to have mitchell hold it for a while, because i'm trying to get something out of the networks. colson then regaled the president with a description of how nbc had readily agreed to carry a prime-time special about the wedding of nixon's daughter, tricia, just days after all three networks had covered the june 12, 1971, white house wedding live. colson had organized a nationwide network of republicans and then prompted them to inundate nbc with telephone calls demanding a reprise of the wedding. colson had then persuaded gulf oil co. to sponsor the broadcast. in describing his accomplishment to nixon, colson said nbc would never have run the half-hour wedding special if nixon hadn't met with the network president, julian goodman, and other nbc executives a week earlier, a meeting at which nixon complained about how biased most commentators and reporters were. following that june 8 meeting, colson declared, julian goodman jumped out of his chair to air the wedding again in prime time. colson contrasted the quick change of heart with nbc's attitude toward a speech nixon had given the previous fall at kansas state university, when the president denounced the outbursts of violence plaguing college campuses. the reader's digest publishing company had offered to buy time from nbc to air that speech, colson said, but the network declined. this time, colson added, they couldn't oblige us fast enough. the june 21, 1971, half-hour wedding special drew more than 10 million viewers. not bad considering it was a rerun of something 60 million people had watched before, colson observed the day after the show ran in a note to white house chief of staff h.'r. haldeman. as for the antitrust actions, the white house kept the justice department from filing suit until april 1972, at which time the government accused the networks of monopolizing prime-time entertainment with their own programs. the suits were dismissed in 1974 after the nixon white house refused to turn over subpoenaed records. the ford administration renewed the complaints and subsequent consent decrees curtailed prime-time productions by the networks. colson's orchestrated telephone barrage was part of nixon's media strategy. for instance, in a memo to white house aide patrick j. buchanan on june 24, 1969, five months after nixon took office, haldeman wrote, the president feels very strongly that we need to develop a 'letters to the editor' and 'calls to broadcasters' program somewhere within the administration. the president wanted a thorough and efficient nixon network whose task will be to really raise hell with the people who unfairly take us on, and pour praise on those who take a more productive viewpoint, haldeman continued. buchanan originally set up the operation at the republican national committee, where plans were made to generate letters on a moment's notice to either national publications or to the networks as soon as word came from the white house, according to a memo from buchanan to haldeman. but it was the president's tv image that was paramount — really all that matters — haldeman stressed in another memo, written jan. 14, 1970. nixon's aides paid close attention to daily coverage. in the summer of 1970, for example, the white house conducted weekly surveys of network news, calculating to the second how much air time was devoted to pro-nixon and anti-nixon stories. nbc and cbs have given us a hard time on the economy and the [vietnam] war, according to a may 1970 memo sent to colson from another aide. in covering the u.s. economy, nbc earned two favorable ratings from the white house, along with 15 negative and four balanced ratings. with nixon's support, colson visited each of the network presidents in the fall of 1970. colson expressed pride in one memo to nixon about how hard he had pressed cbs regarding the way they slanted the news. noting the obvious fear the networks displayed, colson surmised that they're obviously concerned about the fcc [federal communications commission]. in a sept. 20, 1970, memo to haldeman, colson added, [the networks] are very much afraid of us and are trying hard to prove they are 'good guys.'' he [colson] started very low-key, but the tougher he got, the nicer the networks seemed to get, a nixon memo to haldeman observed. the president subsequently invited network executives individually to washington. all three networks, nixon was reminded in a memo before the abc meeting, were having some economic problems, which have been accentuated by the ban on cigarette advertising. in the spring of 1971, cbs was especially sensitive in light of complaints over the selling of the pentagon, an expose» of defense department public relations activities. house of representatives investigators subpoenaed cbs president frank stanton for all outtakes and other materials left out of the broadcast. facing a contempt of congress citation for refusing to comply, stanton turned to the nixon white house for help. he sent a message to colson in early july through sandy lankler, a lawyer who represented cbs and who also was maryland state republican chairman. colson jotted his notes of the conversation on a legal pad: if we'll help on subpoena, stanton will cut a deal — will 'play ball' with us. although a house committee voted to cite stanton for contempt, the issue was subsequently buried in a vote by the full house in a legislative maneuver arranged by cbs lobbyists, according to memos in the archives and media accounts. in a phone conversation with lankler that colson taped on the day of the house vote, colson took credit for saving stanton. he and the cbs lawyer subsequently agreed that colson would call lankler once or twice a month, tell him the stories the white house wanted covered and the stories considered unfair; lankler then would pass the word to cbs headquarters in new york, according to a transcript colson had made of the taped discussion. the deal is that all we ask for is honest coverage and, goddam it, we're going to be looking to you and frank stanton to see that we get honest coverage because we have been consistently screwed by cbs, colson said, according to the transcript. all we want is to be able to call you and say, 'sandy, you guys just screwed us again. fix it.' lankler took stanton to a meeting with colson july 15 to nail down the arrangement. according to a memo on the meeting that colson sent haldeman, stanton acknowledged the white house had been badly treated and at one point said he was taking several steps to correct 'the situation.' closely monitoring cbs's news coverage in the following weeks, colson believed that he detected a favorable tilt toward the administration. i don't know that i can stand it, colson sarcastically told haldeman in a july 23 memo. cbs morning news yesterday gave us a sickeningly favorable report on the casualty situation [in vietnam]. ... i don't know what's next, but at the rate they are going, they might even start having [anchor walter] cronkite praise the vice president [spiro t. agnew]. i'll bet this is really paining these guys. lankler has since died. in a new book, fighting for the first amendment — stanton of cbs vs. the congress and the nixon white house, which was written with stanton's cooperation, the former cbs president is quoted as saying he was apprehensive about the meeting with colson because it might be misconstrued. stanton listened to colson's complaints about cbs coverage, noted them and said he wanted to hear any pitches they wanted to make in the future, according to author corydon b. dunham. but stanton made no commitments about news coverage, dunham adds. network coverage of the burgeoning watergate scandal ignited white house wrath anew. a cbs report on the scandal less than a week before nixon's 1972 reelection provoked an oval office discussion on the morning of oct. 28, a newly transcribed tape shows. despicable, haldeman told nixon in describing the report. when colson entered the office, nixon said, with apparent sarcasm, i was telling bob [haldeman] how beautifully you're controlling cbs. after the white house conveyed its anger to cbs, network chairman william s. paley called colson on nov. 3. paley was pleading, colson exulted in a memo to haldeman. he sounded like a whipped dog and was almost on the verge of tears. my voice was steely cold. ... chalk up one for our new task of destroying the old establishment. © copyright 1997 the washington post company back to the top
thanks to this precisely calibrated ecosystem and the european union's borderless trading zone, british shops can order fresh produce early in the morning and receive it by the end of the day.\n\nbut a no-deal brexit threatens to throw it all into chaos, resulting in trucks backed up for miles, vegetables spoiled and economic pain for everyone.\n\nad\n\nthe netherlands — britain's main trading partner on mainland europe — is among the most prepared for the possibility that britons will leave the e.u. on march 29 without a deal to manage the withdrawal. but leaders here fear that the best efforts of a nation that loves to be prepared may not be enough to safeguard against the mess. and britain's other trading partnerships in europe could be even worse off.\n\nad\n\neveryone is fully aware that something is going to happen, said mark dijk, head of external relations at the port of rotterdam, whose docks, rail yards and warehouses handle nearly 1 million tons of goods moving to and from britain every week. the port has been working on brexit emergency plans for more than a year and is trying to alert businesses that they need to brace for a wave of restrictions.\n\nbritain's efforts to manage the withdrawal are so chaotic that it's hard for people to be sure there won't be a [no-deal] brexit, dijk said.\n\nad\n\nno precedent exists for a country scissoring itself out of the interconnected modern world. and yet that outcome appears increasingly likely, as the british parliament prepares to resume debate on a draft withdrawal agreement that has meager support.\n\nin a no-deal scenario, london's powerful banks could find themselves in legal limbo when they want to trade in europe's market. millions of british citizens who have lived and worked in the e.u. legally for years, as well as e.u. nationals in britain, could suddenly become undocumented. connections between british and european law enforcement agencies would go dark.\n\nad\n\nbritish leaders have warned of shortages of food and medicines, and they have asked importers to build stockpiles. defense secretary gavin williamson has put 3,500 troops on standby to deal with potential disruptions. in all, cabinet ministers have approved $2.5 billion of contingency spending.\n\nad\n\nthe countries that will remain in the european union also are amping up their no-deal preparations. irish lawmakers may have to set aside all other business this month to pass 45 pieces of emergency legislation aimed at mitigating the impact of brexit. france is building roads, warehouses and checkpoints near its ports in preparation for new customs controls.\n\nthe e.u.'s headquarters in brussels unveiled a list of proposals to protect e.u. citizens from the worst consequences of a no-deal brexit, but that would offer little relief to the british side. british airlines, for example, would be able to carry passengers to e.u. airports only from britain.\n\nad\n\nhere in the netherlands, exports to britain could fall by 17 percent if brexit happens without a deal, according to a study from the organization for economic cooperation and development.\n\nad\n\nthe dutch government is scrambling to limit the damage, hiring nearly 1,000 more customs agents for the inspections that would become necessary. the agency, whose officials inspect meat, dairy products and animals, is scouring eastern europe for veterinarians and giving them crash courses in dutch because they cannot find enough qualified people at home. and a legion of dutch farmers and flower growers who take orders from british customers are worried that their supply lines could get tangled in bureaucratic knots.\n\nit's all fresh, so you need to be able to deliver on very short notice, said pim leenheer, who works in sales at a dutch company, dailyfresh logistics, that organizes food and flower shipments to britain.\n\nad\n\non a gusty afternoon last month, tractor-trailers were arriving as little as 15 minutes before the vast stena hollandica ferry — which can hold 3.5 miles of trucks — pulled away. at the other end of the journey, in the british port of harwich, the ferry can unload in 30 to 45 minutes, said annika hult, who directs north sea shipping for the stena line.\n\nad\n\nthe process goes quickly in part because no customs agents are involved. in 1993, countries that belonged to what was then called the european economic community pulled down their customs posts and stopped checks between countries.\n\nlittle would change if british lawmakers approve the withdrawal deal negotiated by the e.u. and prime minister theresa may. britain would remain inside the e.u. customs union at least until new trade agreements are devised.\n\nad\n\nbut britain's leaving with no deal in place would set trade back decades.\n\nall of a sudden, you're going to have certain checks, hult said.\n\nbusinesses would need to file paperwork with e.u. and british customs agencies when they want to send shipments between countries. food and animals would need inspections on both sides. truck drivers already pass through passport checks, since britain is not a member of europe's passport-free travel area, but the post-brexit checks would be far stricter. dutch lawmakers are digging into their archives to figure out which old treaties with britain might still be in force. some date to the 1940s and 1950, when europe was rebuilding after world war ii.\n\nad\n\nsome shipping and logistics companies expect that what currently takes a day to get to britain could take a day and a half — a dramatic increase for a system whose margins of error are measured in minutes. they also fear the roads leading to the ports will turn into parking lots. at present, there is no overflow space for trucks that cannot be driven straight onto ships. there has been no need.\n\nad\n\nit's like a queue in the supermarket. if the queue gets just a little bit larger than the capacity of the cashiers, the queue expands exponentially, said pieter omtzigt, a dutch lawmaker who is responsible for his country's brexit preparations.\n\nhult said operators of ferries such as hers were ready to find ways to speed any customs checks — if only they knew what to expect.\n\nad\n\nthe challenge here is the lack of clarity, she said. if there's certainty about what the framework is going to look like, and if the systems are there, we can act quite fast.\n\nthe agencies that will have to do the inspections are bracing for complications.\n\nthe feeling is that we are doing what we can to be prepared as possible, but i won't say that there won't be any incidents in the first weeks, said jan meijer, director of inspection at the netherlands food and consumer product safety authority.\n\nad\n\ndutch authorities estimate that 35,000 small and medium-size dutch businesses do business with britain but have no experience with customs, since they keep their commerce inside the e.u. they would either have to navigate the complicated new terrain or cut off ties to britain. the government is trying to get them ready. it is as if illinois businesses suddenly need to contend with an international frontier to trade with indiana — and have less than three months to figure out how to do so.\n\nad\n\nif we are preparing and companies are not preparing, then everything breaks down, said nanette van schelven, director general of the dutch customs authority. the agency has been running disaster drills to prepare for chaos.\n\nthat's basically the motto of this government: hope for the best and prepare for the worst, she said.\n\nad\n\nbut dutch policymakers are nervous that dutch businesses may still be too complacent.\n\nthere's still a lot of rationalizing going around, saying, 'things surely wouldn't get that bad, would they?'  said rem korteweg, a senior research fellow at clingendael, the netherlands institute of international relations, who has advised dutch lawmakers and businesses about preparations for brexit. there's a lot of wishful thinking going around, and that's a problem.
