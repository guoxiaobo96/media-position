Much like the offensive coordinator and defensive coordinator, they head up major units within the team. Finally, the head coach in business is the chief executive. To be a top NFL football team, you need players with talent who are developed by the various coaches. You need excellent coaches who know how to guide, develop and teach these players how to be at their best at their respective positions.

The newly solidified conservative majority on the court will inevitably decide more cases in line with the society's ideals — which include checking federal power, protecting individual liberty and interpreting the Constitution according to its original meaning.

Under my vision, all students must be measured. We must test to know. And low-performing schools, those schools that won't teach and won't change, will have three years to produce results, three years to meet standards, three years to make sure the very faces of our future are not mired in mediocrity. And if they're able to do so, the resources must go to the parents so that parents can make a different choice. You see, no child--no child should be left behind in America. (APPLAUSE) See every child can learn. Every child can learn. And every child in this country deserves to grow in knowledge and character and ideals.

The finding suggested they may have gotten infected from the package, although that wasn't confirmed. Experiments with salmon indicate the virus can survive up to eight days in the cold-chain conditions used to export fish, scientists in China said in a report ahead of publication and peer review. Those results, which match laboratory experiments conducted in Singapore, support the Chinese government's rationale for testing imported meat, packaging and containers and blocking goods deemed potentially infectious. No live virus had been isolated out of almost 3 million samples tested until the Qingdao case. Only 22 came back positive as of mid-September, but none was suspected of posing an infection risk.

He firmly rejects the Great Marxisant fallacy, according to which any revolution worthy of the name can be conducted only by a class intent upon overthrowing the whole of bourgeois society and culture; it was this fallacy that inspired Herbert Marcuse to create a new revolutionary class, composed of students, blacks and other marginalized and disaffected groups. Marwick's own methodological explanation is more complex and sophisticated (so complex and sophisticated, perhaps, as to offer little practical guidance): Cultural and social change, while influenced by human agency, by contingency and convergence, takes place within the opportunities offered, and the constraints imposed, by structural, ideological, and institutional circumstances. Like a good disinterested historian, he also professes to reject the familiar ideological interpretations of the '60s: the radical view that sees it as a movement of social and sexual liberation, a boon to blacks, women, gays and other oppressed minorities; and the conservative view that harps on such disagreeable matters as the increase of crime and violence and an assault upon the universities and rational inquiry. Marwick does not, to be sure, refrain from judgment. Instead he couches his judgments in the familiar If . . . but, on the one hand . . . on the other hand mode. Thus, if a relaxed censorship brought an explosion of porn and exploitation, it was also accompanied by a remarkable continuity in the revival in serious American film-making.", "augmented": []}

The Redmond, Wash., software giant said Wednesday that it would not meet the fiscal third-quarter guidance it offered in January for the unit that includes its Windows operating system sales. At the time, Microsoft said it expected $10.75 billion to $11.15 billion in quarterly revenue for its More Personal Computing segment. While demand from personal computer makers for Windows remains strong, the company said the supply chain for the business is returning to normal operations at a slower pace than anticipated because of the coronavirus outbreak. As a result, the company believes it will not meet its earlier guidance for the segment. Microsoft did not provide an updated forecast. But Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analyst Brad Reback, who had expected Microsoft to generate between $3 billion and $4 billion in sales of Windows to PC makers in the quarter, said it is not absurd to think half of that could be impacted. And several hundred million dollars of sales from Microsoft's Surface PC business also could be at risk, he said. But those sales, Reback noted, are not lost, just deferred until the effect of the coronavirus subsides.

Buchanan on June 24, 1969, five months after Nixon took office, Haldeman wrote, The president feels very strongly that we need to develop a 'Letters to the Editor' and 'Calls to Broadcasters' program somewhere within the administration. The president wanted a thorough and efficient Nixon network whose task will be to really raise hell with the people who unfairly take us on, and pour praise on those who take a more productive viewpoint, Haldeman continued. Buchanan originally set up the operation at the Republican National Committee, where plans were made to generate letters on a moment's notice to either national publications or to the networks as soon as word came from the White House, according to a memo from Buchanan to Haldeman. But it was the president's TV image that was paramount — really all that matters — Haldeman stressed in another memo, written Jan. 14, 1970. Nixon's aides paid close attention to daily coverage. In the summer of 1970, for example, the White House conducted weekly surveys of network news, calculating to the second how much air time was devoted to pro-Nixon and anti-Nixon stories. NBC and CBS have given us a hard time on the economy and the [Vietnam] War, according to a May 1970 memo sent to Colson from another aide. In covering the U.S. economy, NBC earned two favorable ratings from the White House, along with 15 negative and four balanced ratings.", "augmented": []}

And grass-roots opinion has shifted in favor of conspiracy theories, a pattern that both follows the cues of political leaders and incentivizes those leaders' abasements. For instance, Twitter equips Trump to instantaneously air any theory, no matter how nutty, to raucous and affirming plaudits. Fox News also capitalizes on this shift to amplify Trumpian claims (Russia didn't hack our democracy, Fox host Tucker Carlson recently parroted). It's no wonder that, as Gallup found last February, 30 percent of Republicans see Russia in a favorable light.

Nixon concluded in 1971, was to keep the constant threat of an antitrust suit hanging over them. If the threat of screwing them is going to help us more with their programming than doing it, then keep the threat, Nixon told a White House aide in a tape-recorded Oval Office conversation recently transcribed for the first time. Don't screw them now. [Otherwise] they'll figure that we're done. Preoccupied with unfavorable treatment by the news media, Nixon frequently sought ways to retaliate or at least to counterbalance negative portrayals. White House tapes transcribed for The Washington Post and Newsweek further reveal a president obsessed with efforts to improve his image and eagerly plotting to discredit his detractors. The newly transcribed tapes — among 200 hours of conversations released by the National Archives after a long court battle — bolster other Nixon archival records, which were compiled before the taping system was installed in February 1971 and which show that some schemes were devised in the earliest days of Nixon's presidency. Nixon's previously unpublished pronouncements about the television networks occurred during a July 2, 1971, discussion with aide Charles W. Colson, who played a central role in pressuring the news media to change their critical coverage of the Nixon administration. Colson told Nixon that whether filing an antitrust case against ABC, NBC and CBS is good or not is perhaps not the major political consideration.", "augmented": []}

He condemned all of the sophistries that I hear, rationales, justifications -- 'Everybody does it. It was just about sex.' In the wake of the GOP's poor showing in last week's elections and the continuing large majority of Americans who say they would like Congress simply to drop the subject of Clinton's alleged misconduct in the Monica S. Lewinsky matter, the president's prospects for avoiding impeachment seemed significantly improved. But committee Republicans yesterday appeared more energized than chastened, despite their party's five-seat House loss and the conclusion by strategists in both parties that the GOP may want to consider an exit strategy for an investigation that may have backfired politically.

As far as screwing them is concerned, I'm very glad to do it. Although Attorney General John N. Mitchell wanted to file an antitrust suit against the networks because of their monopoly ownership of prime-time programs, according to the Nixon-Colson tape transcript, Nixon decided to have Mitchell hold it for a while, because I'm trying to get something out of the networks. Colson then regaled the president with a description of how NBC had readily agreed to carry a prime-time special about the wedding of Nixon's daughter, Tricia, just days after all three networks had covered the June 12, 1971, White House wedding live. Colson had organized a nationwide network of Republicans and then prompted them to inundate NBC with telephone calls demanding a reprise of the wedding. Colson had then persuaded Gulf Oil Co. to sponsor the broadcast. In describing his accomplishment to Nixon, Colson said NBC would never have run the half-hour wedding special if Nixon hadn't met with the network president, Julian Goodman, and other NBC executives a week earlier, a meeting at which Nixon complained about how biased most commentators and reporters were.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "H istorians are notably wary of the word revolution. They are even grudging in applying it to political events (was the English Revolution of 1688 a revolution or merely a restoration? ), still more so to social or cultural events. And still more to social or cultural events in their own time. Surely a longer perspective (the famous long view that historians are supposed to cultivate) will dissipate the effect of ephemeral experiences and reveal the continuity behind ostensibly dramatic changes. Yet occasionally, very occasionally, historians are privileged (or doomed) to live through real revolutions, even social and cultural ones. Arthur Marwick, a professor of history at the Open University in England, maintains that the 1960s witnessed one such revolution. And a revolution, moreover, that transcended political and national boundaries. Marwick confines himself to four countries, Britain, France, Italy and the United States (with passing references to Germany, Eastern Europe and Japan). As a good historian, he apologizes for focusing on so artificial a period as a decade, and then, with further apologies, for prolonging the sixties to encompass the long decade of 1958 to 1974. The apologies are unnecessary. There was a revolution in these (and other) countries, and decades are sometimes significant units of time, even though they spill over into the adjacent years.

Inflation stands at 65 percent, and an estimated 75 percent of the nation's 23 million people live in poverty. Among his core supporters, however, anxiety was not an issue.

Some of those are in key areas involved in the virus's ability to infect cells. Researchers have found no evidence that the mutation causes more severe illness. A report by Imperial College London researchers released on Dec. 31 found a small but statistically significant indication that this particular mutation affects younger people -- those under 20 -- more than other variants do, though the reason could be circumstantial.

Equality in our country will remain a distant dream until every child, of every background, learns so that he or she may strive and rise in this world. No child in America should be segregated by low expectations, imprisoned by illiteracy, abandoned to frustration and the darkness of self-doubt. (APPLAUSE) There's reason for optimism in this land. A great movement of education reform has begun in this country built on clear principles: to raise the bar of standards, expect every child can learn; to give schools the flexibility to meet those standards; to measure progress and insist upon results; to blow the whistle on failure; to provide parents with options to increase their option, like charters and choice; and also remember the role of education is to leave no child behind. I believe in these principles, and I've seen them work; I've seen them turn around troubled schools in my state, schools labeled by the world at-risk. At-risk means you're not supposed to learn, but we've challenged that in the state of Texas. I've seen these schools and principles bring new hope, inspiring new confidences and ambitions.

Although some research has found a recent uptick in Democratic support for conspiracy theories (a jump caused by a lack of political power), elected Democrats have typically fenced their party off from wild-eyed claims promulgated on the left. They never embraced the theory that the 9/11 attacks were an inside job carried out by the Bush administration, for example. During the 2004 presidential primary race, even the most lefty antiwar candidates — Dennis Kucinich, Howard Dean, Carol Moseley Braun — largely eschewed conspiracy theories that President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney had gone to war for oil or to enrich their friends in the construction business.

He financed colleges and welcomed immigrants, promoted railroads and economic development. Through the Homestead Act, he gave countless Americans a piece of land for a start in a life. I propose a new prosperity initiative that reflects the spirit of Lincoln's reforms, a plan to remove obstacles on the road to the middle class. You see, instead of helping people cope with their need, we will help them move beyond it. And here's some of the ideas of the new prosperity initiative--just some of the thoughts. We must provide a family health credit that covers 90 percent of the cost of basic health policy for low-income families. We must make it possible for more people to become homeowners in this great land, to own a part of the American dream. We would allow low-income families to use up to a year's worth of Section 8 rental payments to make a down-payment on their own home, then use five years of those payments to help with the mortgage.

Rumsfeld in the 1970s, Dan Lamothe reports. The article brings together a group of Republicans and Democrats who disagree on many national security issues. Its genesis is a conversation between Eric Edelman, a former U.S. ambassador and defense official, and former vice president and defense secretary Richard B. Cheney about how the military might be used in coming days … While Trump has called reports that he discussed the possibility of invoking martial law to overturn election results 'fake news,' he did have Michael Flynn, a retired Army general and former national security adviser for Trump, at the White House recently after Flynn suggested on television that Trump could declare martial law and use the military to hold new elections. Protests are expected in Washington on Trump's behalf this week, and the president has encouraged his supporters to show up, tweeting: 'Be there, will be wild!' … After Cheney expressed interest in co-authoring an opinion piece, Edelman solicited participation from other former defense secretaries, and wrote a draft of the article along with Eliot Cohen, a former Republican national security official who is dean of the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies.", "augmented": []}

The House has the political discretion to express its dismay, disappointment, recrimination, and still conclude it is not appropriate to take up the time of the Senate, he said. But George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley said that were the House to conclude that Clinton committed impeachable offenses, the role at that point should be the submission to the Senate. . . .

Today's election marked the first time in four decades of democracy that Venezuela's two traditional parties -- Democratic Action and the Social Christian Party -- did not field a presidential candidate. Chavez's victory will reshape the nation's political landscape by ending four decades of domination by the two parties, which have been assailed for corruption, mismanagement of the country's oil wealth and catering to a small elite. Chavez, who attempted to overthrow the democratically elected government of Carlos Andres Perez in 1992, drew his support largely from among Venezuela's poor majority, waging an anti-Establishment, anti-corruption platform that called for radical political and economic reforms. The former paratroop's campaign rhetoric was interpreted as critical of free-market economics -- and sometimes dictatorial -- at a time when the region has been embracing more liberal economic policies and greater democracy. Chavez vowed to fire the head of the state-run oil company and proposed restricting the expansion of Venezuela's petroleum sector and foreign investment in the industry.

Georgia's law shifts the burden of proof so that instead of a company first being required to show how it complied with state and federal health guidelines, plaintiffs must prove it didn't. Workers must show their employer willfully and wantonly failed to follow the guidelines, Foley says. That's a pretty high burden. California in December put in place a new rule requiring employers to implement coronavirus safety measures and setting standards for virus testing, notifying workers of infections, and paid medical leave.", "augmented": []}

Experts on both sides expressed concerns about the constitutionality of censuring the president in some way and, in particular, imposing some kind of fine on him. In light of the founders' concern that the president not be subjected to political molestation by Congress, it cannot be emphasized too strongly that impeachment is the only means granted to Congress to censure the president, said University of London professor Gary McDowell, a GOP witness.

In light of the ROK government's declaration of the highest alert level 'severe' on COVID-19, the ROK-US Alliance made the decision to postpone the combined command post training for the ROK-US Combined Forces Command until further notice, U.S.-South Korean Combined Forces Command said in a statement. With 334 new virus cases, South Korea's national tally of the virus jumped to 1,595, which includes a U.S. soldier stationed in the country. The 23-year-old man is the first member of the U.S. military to contract the virus. Thursday's jump was expected as South Korea conducted over 10,000 virus tests the previous day. President Trump said the United States may need to restrict travel to virus-hit countries outside China. At a news conference on Wednesday, Trump responded to a question about travel restrictions on Italy and South Korea, saying, At the right time we may do that. Right now it's not the right time.

For Americans especially, it is useful to be reminded that the American experience was not unique -- certainly not the product, as is sometimes suggested, of the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War. And the insistence upon the interaction between the dominant culture and the counter-culture (the term itself was coined in 1968) is also fruitful, obliging us to recall another aspect of the revolution that is too often forgotten, the fact that so many of the revolutionaries proved to be imaginative, ambitious and eminently successful commercial entrepreneurs, creating whole industries out of the counter-culture itself -- boutiques, experimental theatres, art galleries, discotheques, nightclubs, 'light shows', 'head shops', photographic and model agencies, underground films, pornographic magazines.", "augmented": []}

Kelly Loeffler, the Republican incumbent whom Warnock is trying to unseat, called him a radical liberal more than a dozen times. A pro-Loeffler attack ad features a video clip of Warnock warning members of his congregation that they cannot serve God and money, or God and the military, at the same time (Matthew 6:24). The ad is spliced with snippets of Warnock yelling during sermons. Over action-movie-trailer music and lo-fi lighting, a grim-sounding narrator explains the threat Warnock poses to the republic: Raphael Warnock attacks our soldiers. Warnock attacks our police. . . . Raphael Warnock is radical and dangerous.", "augmented": []}

He offered a list of his progressive successes — on voting rights, minimum wages, net neutrality, transportation, etc. — and made the case that green technology makes climate change a jobs message as well. He might consider stressing his entire record as evidence of his ability to successfully govern, which includes climate change policies, and his role in challenging Trump's vile immigration policies. Almost as an afterthought, he notes that renewable-energy legislation helped launched a multibillion-dollar wind industry and helped his state lead in GDP growth and wages. That seems to be his greatest selling point — creating a progressive haven while growing the economy, raising wages and saving the planet.

The evidence about transmission is less clear, though children are less likely to have symptoms and asymptomatic individuals are less likely to transmit.

The turnabout by the giant computer chip maker followed an announcement by privacy advocates earlier in the day that they would urge consumers to boycott Intel products in protest of the chip's ID component. This is a significant victory for privacy, said Barry Steinhardt, associate director for the American Civil Liberties Union, who praised Intel for responding to the criticism so quickly. They did it on Internet time. In announcing the ID feature of the new Pentium III microprocessor last week, Intel officials described it as an important step for Internet security. The ID number would help verify the identity of people doing business online, company officials said. While each chip still will have a unique number, Intel officials said yesterday, software will be configured in such a way that consumers will be required to turn the ID function on instead of turning it off, as the company had planned. Chuck Mulloy, a spokesman for the Santa Clara, Calif., company, acknowledged that Intel is reversing course to show consumers it is sensitive to acute concerns about privacy aired last week after the chip's design was announced. We're listening to what the marketplace is telling us, that they would prefer to turn it on as opposed to turning it off, Mulloy said.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "In the United States, surgical abortion is usually a 10-minute procedure—vacuum aspiration with local anaesthetic; in Canada, a cumbersome two-stage procedure, involving the insertion of a laminaria tent, and dilatation and curette under general anaesthetic 24 hours later, is preferred; in Russia, which has the highest abortion rate in the world, no anaesthesia is used; in Britain, vacuum aspiration under general anaesthetic is usual. Recently, the use of better pregnancy testing and smaller cannulas has made possible the surgical removal of the fertilised ovum as early as eight to 10 days after conception, when it is no bigger than a pinhead—at much the same point that it would be shed by the women using the contraceptive pill or an intrauterine device. At the time of writing, only about 20 of the clinics affiliated with Planned Parenthood are using the method—and only in the United States. To be pregnant against your will is to see your life swerve out of control. To become a mother without wanting to is to live like a slave or a domestic animal. Like any other adult, a woman would wish to be infertile and fertile when appropriate: she is led to believe that contraception is her duty and that the available techniques are easy to use and completely effective. If she were totally in control of the manner in which she is sexually active, she might insist that her male partner control his excessive fertility rather than delegating to her the responsibility for inhibiting his power to fecundate."}

The interesting thing about this particular con is that men need marriage more than women do. A man without a wife is fragile; prisons are full of men who never married and unmarried men are more likely to die violently. A wife, whose first duty is to stand by her man, reassure him, build up his confidence and attend to his creature comforts, is an asset to any man; performing such a role is not necessarily advantageous to the performer. Yet marriage is represented to women rather than men as a sign of success so effectively that failure in a woman's pair-bonding will neutralise success in any other field. Success which might put pressure on her pair-bond is success too dearly bought. Magazine after magazine offers young women advice on how to get their man to commit himself; there is nothing comparable in men's literature. Men buy literature about men's toys and pastimes; women buy magazines about men and relationships. Though young men have searing anxieties of their own about relationships, relationships are not represented to them as the only things of value in their lives. This fundamental asymmetry distorts all youthful male-female interaction: the girls put too much into their sexual relationships and set too much store by them, making demands that immature males cannot afford to recognise."}

{"original": "Greer on Body Image Show me a woman who loves her body Every woman knows that, regardless of all her other achievements, she is a failure if she is not beautiful. She also knows that whatever beauty she has is leaving her, stealthily, day by day. Even if she is as freakishly beautiful as the supermodels whose images she sees replicated all around her until they are more familiar than the features of her own mother, she cannot be beautiful enough. There must be bits of her that will not do: her knees, her feet, her buttocks, her breasts. However much body hair she has, it is too much. However little and sweetly she sweats, it is too much. Left to her own devices, she is sure to smell bad. If her body is thin enough, her breasts are sad. If her breasts are full, her arse is surely too big. What is pathological behaviour in a man is required of a woman. A bald man who wears a wig is a ridiculous figure; a bald woman who refuses to wear a wig is being stroppy and confrontational. Women with too much (i.e., any) body hair are expected to struggle daily with depilatories of all kinds in order to appear hairless. Scientists call abnormal preoccupation with a perceived defect in one's appearance Body Dysmorphic Disorder, or BDD. Yet no one would say that the woman who puts herself through the agonising ordeal of hot-waxing her bikini-line must be suffering from BDD."}

{"original": "Not content with showing pre-teens how to use foundations, powders, concealers, blushers, eye-shadows, eye-liners, lip-liners, lipstick and lip gloss, the magazines identify problems of dryness, flakiness, blackheads, shininess, dullness, blemishes, puffiness, oiliness, spots, greasiness, that little girls are meant to treat with moisturisers, fresheners, masks, packs, washes, lotions, cleansers, toners, scrubs, astringents—none of which will make the slightest difference and all of which would cost money the child does not have. Pre-teen cosmetics are relatively cheap but, within a few years, more sophisticated marketing will have persuaded the most level-headed young woman to throw money away on alchemical preparations containing anything from silk to cashmere, pearls, proteins, royal jelly, placenta extracts, ceramides, biotin, collagen, phytotensers, bisabolol, jojoba, hydra-captors, serine, fruit hydroxy-acids, oleospheres, corneospheres, nanovectors, glycerol—anything real or phony that might fend off her imminent collapse into hideous decrepitude. Yet consumer research regularly reports that nothing applied to the surface of the skin can affect the underlying structures or prevent aging, and still the anti-aging products sell. Every day, hospitals put placenta into special freezers to be collected once a week by unmarked vans and sold to face-cream manufacturers. So desperate are some women to stave off aging that they are prepared to submit to injections of botulin toxin to freeze their facial muscles and prevent wrinkles. What is truly depressing about the false dawn of feminism is that, as we have been congratulating ourselves on largely imaginary victories, BDD has become a global pandemic."}

{"original": "Women's liberation did not see the female's potential in terms of the male's actual; the visionary feminists of the late sixties and early seventies knew that women could never find freedom by agreeing to live the lives of unfree men. Seekers after equality clamoured to be admitted to smoke-filled male haunts. Liberationists sought the world over for clues to what women's lives could be like if they were free to define their own values, order their own priorities and decide their own fate. The Female Eunuch was one feminist text that did not argue for equality. At a debate in Oxford, one William J. Clinton heard me arguing that equality legislation could not give me the right to have broad hips or hairy thighs, to be at ease in my woman's body. Thirty years on, femininity is still compulsory for women—and has become an option for men—while genuine femaleness remains grotesque to the point of obscenity. Meanwhile, the price of the small advances we have made towards sexual equality has been the denial of femaleness as any kind of a distinguishing character. In the last 30 years, women have come a long, long way; our lives are nobler and richer than they were, but they are also fiendishly difficult. The career woman does not know if she is to do her job like a man, or like herself. Is she supposed to change the organisation, or knuckle under to it? Is she supposed to endure harassment, or kick ass and take names?"}

The rest of the money was spent on personnel, operations and maintenance, and research and development. AD AD"}

In March 1998, we learned that fetuses are alert and can learn at 20 weeks gestation, before the formation of a cerebral cortex. The evidence was unconvincing, in that reaction was being construed as consciousness, but it had the desired effect—which was to worry women. Feminists have argued that delaying abortion is immoral, but all measures to put in place speedy and non-traumatic abortion procedures, which would be embryologically identical with what passes for contraception, have been blocked by the same authorities who regularly produce evidence about the developing sensibilities of the fetus. A woman who is granted an abortion does not get to choose between abortions: abortion is presented to her as a single entity, when there is a bewildering array of options. Non-surgical, do-it-yourself abortion has been possible for 20 years or more, but the health establishment rations and controls access to it. In the United States, the so-called morning-after pill is unavailable. In Britain, it is not usually made available until the client has endured a sermon on reliable contraception. (One of the best-kept secrets in gynecology is the use of methotrexate and other cytotoxics for non-surgical abortion.)"}

{"original": "Though vasectomy is available, it is culturally invisible. Men don't get pregnant, therefore men don't bother about contraception. Men do get sexually transmitted diseases so they do use condoms, sometimes, but nowhere near as often as they should. These days, contraception is abortion, because the third-generation Pills cannot be shown to prevent sperm fertilising an ovum. Yet no one feels so strongly against abortion at any stage that they picket the factories where birth control pills are produced. IUDs are clearly abortifacient: these devices work by creating inflammation of the uterus, often accompanied by infection. Women who accept them as contraceptive devices are actually being equipped with a do-it-yourself abortionist's tool. The outcome is frequent occult abortion, heavy bleeding and pelvic inflammatory disease, with the accompanying elevated risk of ectopic pregnancy. Whether you feel that the creation and wastage of so many embryos is an important issue or not, you must see that the cynical deception of millions of women by selling abortifacients as if they were contraceptives is incompatible with the respect due to women as human beings. You must also see that expecting women to be grateful for the opportunity to have inserted into their bodies instruments for sucking and scraping out the products of avoidable conception shows them as much contempt. Fake contraceptive technology manipulates women in ways that we are coming to condemn when they are practised on members of other species. What women don't know does hurt them."}

Two hundred women had applied for assistance, 50 of whom had borne children, with 50 more on the way. Cardinal Winning no doubt hopes that government will take over his responsibility and offer support to every child conceived. Feminists should share his hope, but the media has locked feminists into a position which they define as pro-abortion. Feminism is pro-woman rather than pro-abortion; we have always argued for freedom of reproductive choice. But a choice is only possible if there are genuine alternatives. In Britain, the anti-abortion lobby in the House of Commons brings Private Members' Bills year after year, apparently unaware that the medical establishment has no intention of allowing any curb on its right to dispose of blastocysts, fetuses and embryos as, when and how it sees fit. Feminists react to each successive attack on the availability of abortion with grave concern, fighting a battle on behalf of the richest and most powerful organisations in the world.

For 30 years, I have done my best to champion all the styles of feminism that came to public attention. Though I disagreed with some of the strategies and was troubled by some of the more fundamental conflicts, it was not until feminists of my own generation began to assert with apparent seriousness that feminism had gone too far that the fire flared up in my belly. When the lifestyle feminists chimed in that feminism had gone just far enough in giving them the right to have it all—i.e., money, sex and fashion—it would have been inexcusable to remain silent. In 1970, the movement was called women's liberation or, contemptuously, Women's Lib. When the name libbers was dropped for feminists, we were all relieved. What none of us noticed was that the ideal of liberation was fading out with the word. We were settling for equality. Liberation struggles are not about assimilation, but about asserting difference, endowing that difference with dignity and prestige, and insisting on it as a condition of self-definition and self-determination."}

{"original": "Preoccupation about her appearance goes some way towards ruining some part of every women's day. Multi-million-dollar industries exploit both her need for reassurance and her need to do something about the way she looks. Thirty years ago, it was enough to look beautiful; now a woman has to have a tight, toned body, including her buttocks and thighs, so that she is good to touch, all over. Remember, she will be told, beauty starts from within, so she keeps her bowels open with plenty of fibre and her kidneys flushed with lots of pure water. Being beautiful from within takes even more time than slapping beauty on from without. Demi Moore is said to work out for four hours a day, beginning with a cardiovascular aerobic workout, then working her legs and buttocks with pliés, standing lunges and thigh lifts, her upper body with shoulder and punching exercises, and toning her abdominal muscles. She also eats only non-processed, pesticide-free, totally vegetarian foods. The result—taut abs, a rock-hard butt and twanging musculature—was still not enough to save her marriage. Whatever a woman does, she must not look her age. The fitness regime is lifelong, to go with the lifelong sexual activity that is nowadays obligatory. The UK beauty industry takes ú8-9 billion a year out of women's pockets. Magazines financed by the beauty industry teach little girls that they need make-up and train them to use it, so establishing their lifelong reliance on beauty products."}

Barbie was descended from a swimsuit-clad German porno-toy called Lilli—a 12-inch peroxided nymph with a sidelong glance, designed to be sold to men in tobacconists' shops. At her American debut in the spring of 1959, Barbie was the first toy to be directly marketed to three- to 11-year-old girls on Saturday morning television. American girls now own eight Barbies apiece, British girls six. With her non-functional body, boasting a nipple-free bosom more than twice the circumference of her minute waist, legs twice as long as her torso, and feet so tiny that she cannot stand on them, Barbie is unlikely to have been very effective in her career roles as astronaut, vet or stewardess. Every year, Barbie gets 120 new outfits, including a range of sexy underwear, and a new career. She has 35 pets, as well as a kitchen, a bathroom and a patio. She is put together by 11,000 Chinese peasant women in two factories in Guangdong Province; 23p of the total price of a Barbie doll is payment for their labour. Sales last year topped $1.2 billion. More than one billion Barbies have been sold since 1959; she is brand leader in every one of the 140 countries where she is sold."}

The unusual gathering will give Europeans a chance to coordinate plans among all 28 member states. Leaders have been reluctant to publicly condemn the United States for Soleimani's killing, focusing most of their ire on Iran, which they view as the core threat to their security interests. But they have invested more than a year of efforts to try to preserve the 2015 Iran nuclear deal following Trump's pullout. Many European diplomats view Soleimani's death as the final blow to hopes that the accord could hold together until the possible election in November of a U.S. president more supportive of the nuclear agreement than Trump. Iran on Sunday announced that it would take major additional steps to depart from the terms of the nuclear accord, although it stopped short of saying it would significantly increase its uranium enrichment. Europeans took that as a sign that Tehran is still interested in extracting concessions in exchange for returning to at least partial adherence to the deal, rather than walking away from it altogether. Triggering the process that could lead to the reimposition of sanctions would entail additional months of negotiations."}

Another poll, carried out by MORI, showed that abortion was no longer a minority issue; 45 percent of the sample knew close friends or members of the family who had had abortions, compared with 27 percent in 1980. The people polled were asked if they thought that abortion should be available for all who wanted it and 64 percent answered in the affirmative; of the 11 percent of the people polled who were Catholics, half agreed with what 30 years ago would have been considered an extreme position. People also showed the beginnings of a retreat from the notion of eugenic abortion in cases where mental or physical handicap was suspected, which was supported by 84 percent of people in 1980 and by only 66 percent in 1997. In the contest between the doctor's right to choose versus the woman's right to choose whether to deliver a handicapped baby, the woman appears to be gaining ground."}

Prestige and power have seeped out of professions as women joined them. Teaching is already rock-bottom; medicine is sliding fast. Though they are close to parity in numbers, the total earned by British women is only 60 percent of what men earn; their pay hour by hour is 79 pence for every pound earned by a man. The differential between women's pay and men's pay has now been enshrined. A woman who brings a case before an employment tribunal will wait for years before a decision will be reached; a decision in a single case is simply that. British equal pay legislation is legislation meant to be ineffective, designed to be ineffective. Women are discriminated against by building societies, who treat maternity leave as long-term sick leave and will not lend to couples with both partners in work if the woman is pregnant. Women pay 50 percent more for medical insurance. Women are the stomping ground of medical technology, routinely monitored, screened and tortured, to no purpose except the enactment of control."}

Women are ignored by manufacturers of video games, which are mostly war games of one sort or another. Popular music is split as never before; the consumers of commercial pop are female; the rock music that appeals to men is deliberately, unbelievably and outrageously misogynist. While women were struggling to live as responsible dignified adults, men have retreated into extravagantly masculinist fantasies and behaviours. Every day, terrible revenges are enacted on women who have dared to use their new privileges. Female military recruits are sexually abused and harassed, young policewomen subjected to degrading ordeals, and hideous brutality inflicted on women apparently simply because they are female. On every side, we see women troubled, exhausted, lonely, guilty, mocked by the headlined success of the few. The reality of women's lives is work—most of it unpaid and, what is worse, unappreciated."}

At a time when more and more consumers expect business to benefit the greater good, the book is timely. It asks big questions like whether socially virtuous business tactics are actually compatible with shareholder capitalism, and, as he writes in the preface, what may matter most: Whether in the collective judgment of corporate executives, executives actually believe it is possible — or sensible — to try to do good as they seek to do well."}

The men who leave ziggurats of dirty dishes festering in the sink are actually involved in a power play which they have no intention of losing. All they need to do is to exploit inertia, and wait it out. Sooner or later, the woman will give in, because the squalor is not held against the menfolk but against her. A man who is slovenly and untidy is considered normal; the woman who is, either a slut or a slommack or a sloven or a slag. The external attribute becomes a moral quality, as it does not for a man. This works both ways; a house-proud woman equates her spotless house with her virtuous self and derives her sense of self-worth from the orderliness of her cupboards, rather than qualities of her mind or soul. The only way to escape this tyranny of housework is to abandon the house. You can live with nomads or hunter-gatherers, maybe, or become a nun with nothing but a cell to distract you from the day-long excitement of prayer. Or maybe you can make a vow that no more than an hour in any day may be spent on housework—and keep it."}

We are repositioning forces throughout the region … beyond that, with regard to that letter, which I have read once, I can't tell you the veracity of that letter, I can tell you what I read, that letter is inconsistent with where we are right now, Esper said. Milley said the letter was a draft that the U.S. military sent to Iraqi military officials for coordination purposes but hasn't been signed or finalized. That letter — it was a draft, it was a mistake, it was unsigned, it should not have been released, Milley said.

Asked whether the U.S. military was prepared to strike Iranian cultural sites, as President Trump has suggested, Esper said the military would follow the laws of armed conflict.

{"original": "What women won was the right to undergo invasive procedures in order to terminate unwanted pregnancies—unwanted not just by them but by their parents, their sexual partners, the governments who would not support mothers, the employers who would not employ mothers, the landlords who would not accept tenants with children, the schools that would not accept students with children. Historically, the only thing pro-abortion agitation achieved was to make an illiberal establishment look far more feminist than it was. The abortionists who went to prison in the run-up to legalisation for helping girls in trouble were all male. All saw themselves as champions of women and defenders of women's rights. They were repaid with the love and loyalty of women, who were grateful for the right to expiate their sexual activity in pain and grief. The goal was every child a wanted child; it should also have been every abortion a wanted abortion, but the two sides of the phony debate were never to meet. Any feminist who saw abortion as an assault on women and agitated for a concomitant right to bear children without being condemned to poverty, misery and failure was suspected of being a crypto-right-to-lifer. In 1997, Cardinal Winning [leader of Scotland's 750,000 Catholics] took the first step in the direction of providing a genuine alternative to abortion by offering support in the form of an unspecified lump sum of money to women who would otherwise have an abortion because they could not afford to have a baby."}

Though the houseworker doesn't now scrub and polish floors or pound clothes on a washboard or put aside an evening for ironing, she is equally busy Hoovering, spraying-and-wiping and stuffing clothes in washing machines. As more and more home appliances have appeared in more and more homes, they have brought anything but increased leisure for the houseworker (who probably also has to earn the money to pay for them). Changing standards and notions of cleanliness have made cleaning more time-consuming than ever before. Kitchen worktops need to be constantly wiped; kitchen floors need to be mopped whenever a footprint or a pawprint appears; the bath has to be cleaned between baths; once a day is not often enough for the toilet. Every few minutes, a television commercial illustrates the standard and shows a way of achieving it, tightening the headlock on the housewife.

{"original": "Greer on Sex and the Singly Woman Out of 3.8 million British women in their thirties, almost a million are single or divorced. Not only are many women not at present half of a couple, and not likely to become so, but they are also sexually inactive, which is a dereliction of their duty to themselves and the body politic. There is very little they can do about this, bar spending a fortune on body, clothes, face and hair, because, though they can signal availability in a dozen ways, they cannot actually make themselves attractive. The power to make an object attractive lies with the beholder of the object, not the object itself. As a woman grows older, her chances of mating on any but humiliating terms grow less and less. The constant pressure to be sexually active, which has replaced the old pressure to reproduce, actually places unmated women in jeopardy, and fills them with anxiety and the sense of failure. It is the greater pity then that so many feminists accept and perpetuate the notion that people who are not sexually active are of no account. So let this feminist say it again: No sex is better than bad sex. Bad sex is bad for you. Looking for sex can be humiliating, disappointing and dangerous. Making yourself available can mean putting yourself in jeopardy. No sex does you no harm at all."}

Houses no longer smell of cooking; they smell of cleaning. Yet kitchens are not operating theatres and antisepsis in kitchens is as undesirable as it is impossible, because it can only be achieved by huge overuse of powerful chemicals. Millennial food preparation takes less time than the old methods; the time spent getting food on and off the table has shrunk by a third, but it must not be thought the houseworker has more leisure time as a result. Housework expands to fill the time available. Time not spent doing one task will be taken up by another. Washing used to be done on a single day of the week, usually Monday.

No. But he was planning, coordinating and synchronizing significant combat operations against U.S. military forces in the region — and it was imminent, Milley added.

In a sane world, meaningless repetition of non-productive activity would be seen to be a variety of obsessive-compulsive disorder. People who said that they enjoyed doing housework, or needed to do it, or that doing it made them feel good would be known as addicts. Once the word got out that a person was cleaning her toilet every day, therapists would come to her house and reclaim her for rationality and the pleasure principle. Instead, we have Professor Jean-Claude Kaufman of the Sorbonne telling us that housework is a deeply sensual experience—for women, that is, not for himself. Women do menial work because it turns them on; it doesn't turn men on, therefore they should not be expected to do it. Strange, isn't it, how much men know about sensations they have never had? Kaufman knows a woman in whom dish-washing produces explosions of joy. According to him, rhythmic, repetitive, mindless tasks function as sexual anticipation, building up pleasurable tension until it climaxes in conjugal relations. Faking it in bed has clearly not been enough; now women are having to fake sexual arousal even when they are cleaning the toilet."}

We know the current situation is now far more complicated, and we have to accept their process, he said, but it is more complicated than just one vote. Canada has hundreds of military personnel in Iraq as part of both the NATO mission and the global coalition fighting the Islamic State. It has suspended both of those missions, but Sajjan said he hopes they will continue. He told the CBC that Canada has taken the appropriate steps for force protection in Iraq and that some nonessential personnel have been moved out of the country in the wake of Soleimani's killing. Asked if U.S. officials had given Canada notice of their plan to kill the Iranian general, Sajjan said that Canada had an indication something was going to happen but did not know what was going to happen.

{"original": "There can be no gainsaying that women cannot manage their own lives if access to abortion is to be denied, but the need for abortion is itself the consequence of oppression. If we accept every instance of abortion as the outcome of unwanted and easily avoided pregnancy, we have to ask ourselves how it is that women are still exposing themselves to this risk. A woman who is unable to protect her cervix from exposure to male hyperfertility is certainly not calling the shots. The man is most likely to have initiated the episode of intercourse, to have chosen the place and the time; the woman is probably still dancing backwards. If the child is unwanted, whether by her or her partner or her parents, it will be her duty to undergo an invasive procedure and an emotional trauma, and so sort the situation out. The crowning insult is that this ordeal is represented to her as some kind of a privilege: her sad and onerous duty is garbed in the rhetoric of a civil right. She is confronted with other people who know better than she what she ought to do. She will be required to undergo investigations of her pregnancy for which there is no treatment but termination, whether she would countenance a termination or not. If she undergoes the tests, say for Down's Syndrome, and refuses the termination, she will be asked why she had the test in the first place. And she will probably be talked into the termination."}

Those same people think that, for once, marching and shouting were effective. Reluctant authorities gave in to the women's screaming, and allowed a tide of feticide to sweep the world. This is not what happened. In the United States, the crucial factor was a decision in the Supreme Court in the case of Roe v. Wade, which upheld the principle that, as the law had no part to play in what passed between a woman and her doctor, intervention by the state to prevent an abortion was a breach of the patient's privacy. Jane Roe or Norma McCorvey, a sometime carnival barker and druggie who was pregnant for the third time, was the stooge selected by a young Texas lawyer. She has subsequently been born again and now repudiates her part in the decision that legalised abortion in the U.S. The decision in Roe v. Wade did nothing to confront, let alone resolve, the deep moral conflicts surrounding the issue of abortion. Pregnancy is unlike other patient-doctor relations in that there are two other individuals involved—the father-to-be and the child-to-be. Every time a fetus is recognised as a party to other litigation, the safety of the decision in the case of Roe v. Wade is called into question."}

{"original": "Such insecurity has been instilled into women over generations; we have made not the least headway in the struggle to dispel it. Every issue of every woman's magazine exploits women's anxiety about unwanted hair. Even if you escape hairiness, you will fall foul of cellulite. When The Female Eunuch has written, cellulite was a French disease. The English word should by rights be cellulitis, but, as British pharmaceutical companies jumped on a bandwagon set off by sales campaigns for French products, they adopted the French word. Cellulite is subcutaneous fat, pure and simple. It keeps women warm and softens the contours of their bodies and, if it builds up, it often dimples. Whether or not your fat dimples is a matter of genetic endowment; some women have tight smooth fat and some women have softer fat, which droops and dimples, even on their knees, invariably on their bottoms. The characteristic orange-peel appearance can be seen even in the bottoms of babies who have not eaten chocolate, drunk coffee or alcohol or smoked, or committed any other of the sins that are punishable by cellulite. Once upon a time, men and women both admired dimply fat; it took 20th-century marketing to render it disgusting. Most of what is written about globular fat cells, poor lymphatic drainage and toxins that have solidified is cynical tosh. Dimply fat will only disappear if it is starved off; no amount of pounding or vibrating or massaging will have any effect on it whatsoever."}

Even now, women may enter political institutions only after those institutions have formed them in the institutional mould; the more female politicians a parliament may boast, the less likely it is to address women's issues. Prime Minister Blair has less trouble keeping his party under an unprecedented degree of central control because so many of the Labour MPs are inexperienced, young and female. A male Labour MP called them the Stepford Wives with a chip inserted in their brain to keep them on message; the media call them Blair's babes. Few of the silly rituals of the House have been abolished, nor has the parliamentary timetable been modified. After a year in the rowdy bear-garden that is the British House of Commons, and many weeks without seeing their families for more than a few minutes at a time, the new women MPs were reporting levels of stress approaching the unbearable.

Though the bride herself may not feel that she has left the family of her father and been taken into the family of her husband, the ancient dynamic still prevails. His friends will now be her friends, but her friends are unlikely to become his; even if her parents are not entirely displaced by his, his will take precedence. The dynamic of mutual accommodation that propelled a couple's informal cohabitation is unnecessary once marriage has confined them. As both are bound, the power will come to be concentrated in the person best prepared to take advantage of the situation, and that person is the male partner. Having been so lucky as to acquire a wife, he begins to take the liberties that husbands have traditionally taken, comes and goes as he pleases, spends more time outside the connubial home, spends more money on himself, leaves off the share of the housework that he may have formerly done. She sees her job as making him happy; he feels that in marrying her, he has done all that is necessary to make her happy."}

Your cellulite is you, and will be with you till death or liposuction, which is expensive and extremely painful and sometimes more disfiguring than the dimply fat itself. As fat distribution is hormonally regulated, the fat will probably build up again gradually after liposuction. As cellulite will neither kill you nor go away, it is a goldmine for doctors, nutritionists, naturopaths, aromatherapists, fitness experts and lifestyle managers. The manufacturers of creams, exercise equipment, skin brushes and dietary supplements all make a bundle out of women's carefully cultivated disgust with their own bodies, scarfed about as they are by unsightly fat cells. Criminalising cellulite is just another way of demonising fat, any fat, anywhere. As a way of inducing them to buy products of no use or value, women have been deliberately infected with BDD. Conditions that practically all women suffer from are spoken of as unsightly and abnormal, to make women feel that parts of their bodies, perhaps their whole bodies, are defective and should be worked on, even surgically altered. Most women think that their hair is not good enough and dye it or bleach it or perm it. Most women feel that their legs are not long enough, that their thighs are too heavy or not firm enough. Most women are unhappy about their bottoms, which are either too flat, too low-slung, too fat or too broad."}
