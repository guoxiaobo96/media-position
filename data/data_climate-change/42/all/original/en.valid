He will not say in all of these personal issues he's had in the past that he's changed his ways or even acknowledge that he is on a different path. So that's some very clear testimony to people across the state, that he is doing what politicians do best, and that is putting a good spin on the kind of person he really is. He's never held public office before so when he gets to Washington, DC, he's not going to even necessarily know how to be a U.S. senator and will clearly follow the direction of his leader. His leader is going to be Schumer. That's concerning to us that we would be putting somebody there who is going to be following what Pelosi's agenda is, and what Schumer's agenda is and be falling right in line with what Kamala Harris would want to see in the White House.

{"sentence": "The initial push to distribute COVID-19 vaccines around the U.S. has been sluggish, reflecting many of the same problems that has allowed the disease to rampage across the country. Government efforts lack coordination, as a patchwork of federal, state and local authorities struggle to implement dozens of disparate plans. Millions of people are wary of being inoculated, polls suggest, just as millions still resist wearing masks despite the nearly 370,000 deaths from the disease. Vaccine misinformation and conspiracy theories are rife.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Despite such hurdles, public health experts express optimism that the vaccination campaign will soon pick up speed. Economists also predict a swift recovery in activity by consumers and businesses as infections slow and the country nears herd immunity later this year. Here's a look at why the rollout is lagging and when most Americans can expect to get vaccinated.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Why isn't the U.S. moving faster to vaccinate people?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "As of January 11, 25 million doses of a coronavirus vaccine have been shipped to hospitals and specialty pharmacies nationwide, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Although the pace of distribution has been picking up, less than 9 million doses — or about a third —have been administered since vaccines began shipping on December 13. At that pace, it would take more than three years for the entire U.S. population to be vaccinated.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "A range of factors are holding up vaccinations. The biggest problem, experts say: There is no overarching federal plan to inoculate Americans nationwide. The Trump Administration has mostly left it up to the states to decide how to distribute and administer the vaccine. What's more, the federal government was slow to approve funding that the states said they needed to administer the vaccine.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "It's federalism at its worst, said L.J Tan, a vaccine expert and chief strategy officer for the Immunization Action Coalition, an advocacy group.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "A number of states also appear to have had experienced major snafus in commencing vaccinations. In Arizona, a problem with a scheduling software left two of the five vaccinations locations in Maricopa County, which is the state's most populated area, empty for days at the beginning of the vaccine roll out. The problem has been fixed, and Arizona's governor has announced changes to address the delays. But distribution in the state remains sluggish. Through January 11, more than 75% of the doses that have been shipped to Arizona have yet to be administered.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Another possible factor: Many people are refusing to be vaccinated. In early January, the governor of Ohio said that as many as 60% of nurses in the state were opting out. Dr. David Basel, vice president of Sioux Falls, South Dakota-based Avera Health said the vaccine refusal rate he has seen is more like 25%, and is most common a concern among pregnant women.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Who is getting the first vaccine doses?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Vaccines aren't being offered on a first-come, first-served basis. When you will get the vaccine depends on your age and what you do for a living. It also might matter where you live.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Originally, the federal government and states said that the first doses would go to hospital workers as well as nursing home residents and staff. But in the past week several states, including New York, have reversed that stance and are now offering the vaccine to older people, as well as teachers, firefighters and other first responders. Those groups account for about 50 million Americans.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Who comes after health and safety workers?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "To speed up distribution, the federal government on Tuesday gave states permission to vaccinate anyone over the age of 65, as well people over 16 with a prior health condition, such as asthma or diabetes, that would make them more likely to get severely ill if they contracted COVID-19.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Ultimately, however, it is states that make the final decision on how to distribute vaccines. A number of states have started to distribute doses beyond medical workers, but it's unclear how many will begin providing it to all older Americans.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "The federal government has said essential workers should be next in line. But who exactly is defined as an essential worker remains unclear.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "The problem: Some 204 million Americans fall into of these categories — essential worker, at greater risk of a severe COVID-19 case or over 65. That's far more than the amount of vaccine that the U.S. currently has on hand.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "When will vaccines be more widely available? Will there be enough to go around?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "The U.S. has ordered as much as 1.2 billion doses of various coronavirus vaccines. That's more than enough to inoculate the entire American population.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "But that tally includes orders for some vaccines that have not yet been approved. Some, like the 500,000 doses of the Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine that the U.S. has ordered, are likely to be delivered. Less certain is the 100,000 doses ordered from drugmakers GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi. The testing of that vaccine was suspended in December because of its low efficacy rate and hasn't been resumed.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Even the 400 million doses the government has purchased of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, which are the only two approved for use in the U.S., aren't entirely available yet. The two companies have delivered 45 million doses in total so far.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Another 75 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine are expected to be delivered by the end of March, with another 75 million doses to follow over the next three months.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "As for Moderna, the company has agreed to deliver 180 million doses on a rolling basis, with the last shipments arriving by the end of June. That translates to about 30 million doses a month starting in January.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Because 400 million doses of the two-dose vaccines will only be enough to vaccinate 200 million people, COVID-19 vaccines will likely not be available for everyone in the U.S. until the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is approved for use in the U.S., possibly this spring. The government has not released a timetable for when the 500,000 doses it has ordered of the two-dose vaccine will be delivered.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "What can be done to speed up vaccinations?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Vaccine distribution has picked up recently, with about 700,000 doses a day being administered in the second weekend of January. Still, experts say that upwards of 2 million Americans need to be inoculated per day in order to reach herd immunity by spring — achieved either through vaccination or people being exposed to the virus. For now, that target seems optimistic.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "The U.S. distributes about 80 million doses a month of the annual flu vaccine each fall. Tan of the Immunization Action Coalition thinks COVID-19 distribution could reach nearly the same pace. Given that the vaccines all require two doses, roughly 40 million Americans a month could be vaccinated.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "At that pace it would take nearly seven months before 80% of Americans were vaccinated, the threshold the CDC estimates would be needed for life to return more or less to normal in the U.S. It also suggests that most people won't get their shots until at least the second half of the year.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "In early January a number of officials, including U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams, encouraged states to start distributing vaccines more widely, instead of reserving the majority of doses for health care workers or those most at risk.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "But it's not clear opening up vaccine eligibility to the general public would pick up the pace of distribution. Florida, for instance, has allowed anyone 65 and older to sign up for the vaccine. The result has been long lines, and not much more success at distributing the vaccine.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "As of January 11, according to CDC data, Florida had distributed less than 40% of the vaccine it had received from the federal government in the past month. That puts it on par with other states, like New York, which until recently had been giving the vaccine only to health care workers.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "If you are going to open it up to everyone, then you need to make sure you have vaccination access points, Tan said. They were not ready for it, and that's what is happening in Florida.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Do I have a choice of which vaccine to take?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "For now, most Americans will have to take whatever vaccine they are offered. That may change in the second half of 2021 as more vaccines are available, but it could require going to the back of the line if you are eligible to get vaccinated and the vaccine available at the time is not the one you want.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "The good news is that there appears to be little difference between the two currently available vaccines. Both are over 90% effective, require two shots and have been shown to produce only mild side effects — including fevers, headaches and arm soreness — in about 20% of all patients.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "As of yet, neither vaccine has been approved for kids or teens. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been cleared for people 16-years-old and up. The Moderna vaccine has been authorized for people 18 and older.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "A big change could come if Johnson & Johnson's vaccine, which only requires one shot, is approved. But that won't happen in the U.S. until the spring at the earliest, observers said, and even then there will only be 100,000 doses of that vaccine — targeted at poorer nations — available for Americans.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "While death and taxes may be two inevitabilities of life, some people like to push the envelope when it comes to the latter.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Procrastinators live among us, given that about 20 percent of taxpayers wait until the last two weeks of the tax season to file their returns. The majority of Americans tend to file early because of the anticipation of receiving their tax refund, said Lisa Greene-Lewis, CPA and tax expert at TurboTax. Others, however, may have complicated tax issues or late-arriving tax forms that delay their ability to file, while some might simply put it off because they are worried or confused about the process.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "But issues such as higher preparation costs and even more delays may come hand-in-hand with putting off tax preparation until the last minute. Because the workload intensifies leading up to the filing deadline -- which is April 18 this year -- some certified public accountants will ask their procrastinating clients to file a tax extension. Consumers relying on tax software programs or online filing will face higher costs than if they had filed earlier in the season.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "TurboTax, for instance, ended its early season pricing on its online filing products on March 17, which means that consumers will now pay as much as 25 percent more for the same products. The company still offers its federal free edition, which is geared for consumers filing either the relatively simple 1040EZ or 1040A forms, although TurboTax said that is subject to change. TurboTax's Deluxe edition now costs $54.99 for federal returns, for instance, instead of the $34.99 before March 17.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "H&R Block, meanwhile, appears to have kept its online and software prices steady. Like TurboTax, it also offers a free filing option for simple tax returns. Still, many of those free filing options disappear later in the tax season, according to research from Oppenheimer & Co. cited by Bloomberg News. H&R Block didn't immediately return a request for comment.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "As for taxpayers who rely on accountants, there's the danger that your CPA may not have time to handle your returns the closer you wait until April 18. It's not all that unusual to file for an extension, since about 8 percent of all returns the IRS receives are filed with the additional 6 months that the extension provides.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "As far as using an accountant, what I've seen, having worked for a CPA firm, they may (have) a deadline about when they want to see your tax documents because they get backed up, said Greene-Lewis. They may have a cut off where they put you on an extension.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "There are a few issues to be aware of with extensions, such as the fact that payments are still due on April 18. That means people filing extensions will need a reasonable estimate of what they owe the tax agency by the deadline.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "You should try to file as soon as possible, said Greene-Lewis, who noted that TurboTax users can file up to 11:59 p.m. on the night of the tax deadline. People who rush at the last minute may leave something out or forget about tax deductions and credits, even though we do remind you. It's best to do everything earlier.", "label": 1}

Eventually he could earn a contact visit with me. Yet, to this day, he remains in solitary confinement with no reclassification. What is the point of commutation if his life does not improve? No one within TDCJ can explain why. Administrative segregation is a lingering death that defeats the purpose of commutation. Life is more than drawing breath and pumping blood alone in a prison cell; it means interacting with others, such as family for whom commutation was given as much as to Thomas.", "label": 1}

{"sentence": "Yes. You know, I think we're all sort of products of the conversations we hear around the dining room table, the kitchen table in our families. And in my family, a lot of the stories were about the fact that so many of the people that came before me were refugees or immigrants of one kind or another. I had a grandfather who came here at the turn of the last century fleeing pilgrims in what's now Ukraine, was welcome to the United States, built a life for himself, for his children, a stepmother who fled communism, literally, in the dead of night on a train, made her way, at a very young age with her mother, to the United States.", "label": 1}

His entire immediate family was wiped. Bialystok was the center of Jewish living in Poland.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "He wound up in virtually all of the concentration camps one can remember from history, Auschwitz, Dachau, Majdanek. At the very end of the war, he made a run for it.

{"sentence": "How old was he at the time?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "At this point, he was 16. So he was in the camps from age 12 to 16. And somehow, they made it to the woods. And they hid out during the day and moved around at night. And after a few days of this, one day, they heard this rumbling sound. And as he looked out from their hiding place, what he saw was a tank.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "But instead of having the dreaded iron cross or a swastika on it, he saw something else. He saw a five-pointed white star. And in a kind of crazy way, he ran to the tank. And the hatch opened up. And an African American GI looked down at him. And he got down on his knees. And he said the only three words that he knew in English that his mother had taught him before the war, God bless America. And at that point, the GI lifted him into the tank into freedom, in effect, into the United States. That was kind of the image that I had of my country growing up, what it represented to people around the world. And I think that's what motivated me as much as anything else to get into foreign policy.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "So I don't want to jump too far ahead. But what we're seeing in our country now with the feelings about immigrants and refugees must cut to the core with you.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "It does. And, you know, on the one hand, look, I think we all get it. People feel a tremendous sense of confusion right now and chaos and a loss of identity. They don't recognize themselves. They don't recognize the country. And it's deeply, deeply, deeply confusing.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "At the same time, we know from our own history that we've gone through successive waves of migration each of which has made the country stronger but each of which, at different points in history, had a counterweight whether it was Irish, whether it was Italians, whether it was Jews, whether it was Asians, whether it's Latinos.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "And we know that this is incredibly disruptive. And it takes some time to sort it all out. Each time, it's made the country stronger. But during these periods of transition, it's tough. And we have to find a way forward that works for all of our communities as well as working for the people that want to come here.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "So in those previous moments of backlash, how did we emerge from them?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "You know, in these previous moments, there was a transition period. And it was challenging. And I don't want to minimize the disruptions that took place. But there was a recognition the economy might improve as we saw success, as we saw what immigrants were bringing to the country. There was a recognition that this made sense for America. Now, when we look across the broad swath of the economy, look at every pursuit. Who are the folks who are picking our crops?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Who are the folks serving food at our tables, cleaning our homes and, then, as you move up the ladder, nursing the sick in underserved communities, doctoring them and, then, at the highest end, half of our fortune 500 companies foundered or co-foundered by immigrants or the sons and daughters of immigrants, half of the startups in Silicon Valley, the same thing.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "So we see the success time and time again. But now, in this particular moment, these disruptive forces are more intense and more acute than they've been. And you get a feeling things are just moving in fast motion. And it's very hard for people to be grounded and have a sense that they're going to come out okay on the other side.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "So with this historical understanding, are you confident that we're going to come out the other end here?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Look, this could be the exception that breaks the rule. It's hard to be fully confident. You know, I'm reminded of the late John McCain who said, It's always darkest before it goes completely black. But all of that said, I don't believe that.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "I think that most of us have a sense of optimism based on our history because we've been through incredibly tough periods before. The 1960s, to take a recent example, the late 1960s were far more disruptive than the period that we're going through now. The dawn of the progressive era, to me, this is maybe most closely approximate to that.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "We had, before the progressive era, capitalism fully unleashed in this country producing tremendous wealth and, in many ways, tremendous progress but also in a way that was not evenly distributed, that was leaving too many people out, too many people behind.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "And thankfully, we had a progressive era in which the rough edges of capitalism were rounded off. More people were brought into the mix. We made major investments in education, in healthcare, in infrastructure, progressive taxation. Now, in a sense, we need a progressive era but on a global scale. That's really the change of the moment to figure out how we can take these incredible forces that are at play, bringing tremendous advantages globalization, but in way that doesn't leave too many people out of the deal.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Yeah. So I heard Warren Buffet say not long ago, you know how there's things that people say that stay with you for the rest of your life, this was one of those moments, he said, I believe that capitalism was the greatest force for good in the history of mankind, which I believe, too. And, then, he said, But I fear we're going to lose it unless we take care of the people that it leaves behind.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "I couldn't agree more. There is a crisis of legitimacy for capitalism that we're going through now. And, again, we've been through it before. This is what happened before the progressive era. It happened before the New Deal. And in a sense, it's happening now but, again, on a global scale.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "And we figured out how to get through these periods before. Now, could this be different? Absolutely. At each big transformation there was a transitional period. And somehow, we wound up on the other side in a better place. That may still happen. But you still have to get to the other side. And that's the challenge we're in now.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Okay. Then, the impact of all of this on our foreign policy and our role in the world, how do you think about that?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Well, I think there's increasingly recognition that whatever foreign policy we pursue, it actually has to work for people here at home. And if it doesn't, then, it's going to be very difficult to sustain it. And so, for example, if we have a foreign trade policy, an economic policy that's not also working to materially improve the lives of the people here, it's not going to be sustained.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "If we have a foreign policy that people perceive is somehow getting us into problems that we shouldn't be involved in, that may be difficult to sustain as well. So being clear with our fellow citizens explaining what we're doing, why we're doing it, what the objectives are, how it's going to actually make their lives better is usually important. But, Mike, I'd say another thing, we shouldn't be a prisoner to history. But we should at least be informed by it. And I think the period after World War II was hugely instructive and remains very instructive because that was a period in time when, after the war, we could've retreated as we did after World War I.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "We could've pulled back. Or we could've used the tremendous power that we had to, basically, lord it over others. And we didn't do either of those things. Famously, we spent time building the institutions, developing the norms, the rules that others live by but also ourselves. And that seemed counterintuitive.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "And spending a tremendous amount of money rebuilding our enemies.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Absolutely. But here's what we got out of it, we did, we invested in their prosperity. We invested in their security. But we got new markets for our products. We got new partners to deal with global challenges. We got new allies to deter aggression. Those investments, we got ten, 20, 100 times over in return. And that's why, as we think about today, we shouldn't be blind to what we did in the past because it does hold lessons.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "So, Tony, one of the things that I worry about is that we national security folk, foreign policy folk, have a hard time articulating for the average American why America's role in the world is so important to them. I mean, I've been places in the country where people say to me, Mr. Morell, why does it matter what Vladimir Putin does in Ukraine? Or why does it matter what the Chinese do in the South China Sea? How does that affect me? How do you answer that question?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "You know, I spent about 25 years in government. And one of the things I took away is this, the world doesn't govern itself. And over the past 70-plus years, the United States has played a lead role in helping to govern the world, again, establishing the institutions but also defending them, helping to put in place the rules and the norms.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "And we know this, if we're not doing it, if we're not playing a lead role, then, one of two things: either someone else will and probably not in a way that advances our interests and values or even worse, perhaps, no one does. And, then, the forces of anarchy and chaos prevail. And in the past when that's happened, that's created big global conflagrations World War I, World War II.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "It's pay now or pay a lot more later. And the other thing I'd say is this, we have extraordinary resources in this country. And with those resources, with that wealth, with that success I think comes a certain amount of responsibility to at least do our part in advancing the common good. But it's also something called enlightened self-interest. Yes, it's doing right by others. But, ultimately, that does well by us.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Okay. Let's do an around the world kind of hotspots approach. And as we do these, Tony, I would ask you to kind of assess the situation, assess the Trump administration's approach to that issue. And if you disagree with it, say what would you recommend to the president instead. Okay. So let's start with Saudi Arabia.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Saudi Arabia, I think the administration has missed a tremendous opportunity to use a horrific, terrible event, the murder of this journalist, Khashoggi, to use that as a way to influence Saudi behavior and Saudi policies in a way that better reflect our interests and our values. There was a moment to go to Saudi Arabia and say a few things. One, your new leader or de facto leader, the crown prince, acts in impulsive and sometimes reckless ways.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "We're not telling you who should lead your country. But we are telling you he needs to be reined in in some fashion. You choose how. Second, this horrific war in Yemen that is doing extraordinary damage to tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands, of innocent civilians, that needs to end.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "You need to actually take the first step in helping to end it. We're here to defend you. We will defend you from any aggression by the Houthis in Yemen. But you need to take steps to end this war. And we won't be complicit in it anymore.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Third, this crazy division with Qatar, that needs to end. You need to resolve it. And you also need to demonstrate to the world that the things you're talking about in terms of liberalizing your country you mean. And that means letting people who've been simply trying to advance and advocate for their rights out of jail.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "There was a moment to do all of that. That moment seems to have been squandered. Saudi Arabia seems to have a blank check. This is not about ending the alliance or the partnership with Saudi Arabia. It is making sure that the alliance actually reflects our interests and our values not just Saudi Arabia's.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Your view on the likelihood that Mohammad Bin Salman is going to change, because, I mean, there's been such a pattern here of reckless behavior. Right? And it seems to flow from both an arrogance and a paranoia. And people who have paranoia, as they get older, it tends not to go away. So I'm really wondering here about how likely he is to change, ultimately.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Look, I'm skeptical, which is why I think Saudi Arabia needs a governor on his impulsiveness and his recklessness of their choice -- whether it's a regent, whether it's a council, something. But look, he is whatever he is, 33, 34 now. I don't want to rule that out either.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "You know, I met him when he was 29. He had just become defense minister. And this was just after the Houthi aggression taking over Sana'a and Yemen and then, moving on the rest of the country. And then, the Saudis and the emirates intervened with our backing. And I was dispatched to Saudi Arabia to say two things. One was to make it clear that we were committed to Saudi Arabia's defense if they were attacked in any way by the Houthis, we would be there.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "But two was to ask them, 'What are you trying to accomplish in Yemen? What's the strategic objective?' And the answer I got from Mohammad Bin Salman in the meeting with him was, immediately, 'To remove every last vestige or Iranian influence in Yemen,' to which I responded, 'Good luck, not going to happen.'", "label": 1}

{"sentence": "We'll see. Just across the Persian Gulf, Iran.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Look, I think the irony with Iran is that we have a lot of problems and challenges posed by Iran including its support for terrorism, including its meddling in various countries in the region, including, of course, its abysmal record at home on human rights. The irony is this: the one thing we got right, actually curbing its nuclear weapons program and putting a check on it, is the one thing we just tore up -- which makes no sense. And now, it actually makes it more difficult to deal with the other challenges posed by Iran.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Two reasons, first, I think the reason the Obama administration focused like a laser on trying to deal with the problem that was an urgent problem, which was Iran having the capacity to move to a nuclear weapon very, very quickly, to have the capacity to have enough fissile material on very short order to build a weapon was urgent, because of the immediate threat that that would pose if they actually developed a weapon -- but also because it would allow them to act with even greater impunity in these other areas where they posed a threat to our interests and to what we were trying to achieve in the region. Now, I think we have the worst of both worlds. Iran, for the time being, continues to abide by its obligations under the deal. It's trying to see if it can get the economic benefits it bargained for from Europe and from other countries. And we'll see if that's sustainable.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "What I worry about it this, given the administration's efforts to squeeze Iran economically and to use the leverage that we have with our economy to force other countries to abandon any kind of economic relationship with Iran, at some point, those in Iran who are against the nuclear deal from the beginning will reassert themselves and say, We're no longer abiding by our obligations. And, then, Mike, we'll be right back where we were before we got into the deal which is Iran on the threshold of having enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon. And we'll be faced with the binary choice that we tried to avoid.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Right. Right. And we're sending a signal, a very strong signal, whether it's the policy or not, I don't know. But we're sending a signal that we're all about regime change. And if you're the Iranians, why would you ever negotiate with people who want you to go away?", "label": 1}

{"sentence": "And this goes against a lot of, I think, instincts that a lot of us have because we know what the Taliban regime meant to the people of Afghanistan -- and not in a good way. We know that real progress has been made in improving the lives of people in Afghanistan. At the same time, the position we're in is not sustainable.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "And where I'm particularly frustrated is this --and you'll remember this well -- virtually every year, we would hear from our colleagues, We just need one more year, just one more year. And it will be self-sustaining. The Afghans will be able to fend for themselves.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "The military will be able to control the security situation along with the police. And year after year, it was just one more year. I think our finger's been in the dyke in Afghanistan for a long time. I, obviously, worry what will happen when we take it out. But I also think that, at this point, it's just not sustainable.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "And we also have to remember why we were there in first place. As much as one can appreciate some of the successes that the international community had in improving the lives of Afghans, the bottom-line, hard reality is that we were there because of 9/11 and because of Al Qaeda. And that threat has been, if not eliminated, significantly reduced to the point where I think it can be contained without having 15,000 Americans in Afghanistan.", "label": 1}

And, yet, he succeeded in reasserting Russia on the world stage, to some extent to distract from problems at home, to some extent to try to realize a vision that he has of a greater Russia, but mostly I think for this reason -- the biggest threat to Putin's continued leadership in Russia is really the success of democracy.", "label": 1}

And he has a profound strategic interest in trying to demonstrate to his own people that democracies are failing, that our system is no better than his. It's not delivering better results. To the contrary, it's chaotic, not stable. And so, unfortunately, whether we like it or not and even if we pull back and didn't engage Russian aggression, I believe he would continue to try to create trouble in Europe, in the United States, within our societies and between them.

{"sentence": "I asked myself where would the Baltic states be right now if they were not in NATO? Where would Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic be in their own ways? I think that's proved to be a tremendous deterrent to Russian aggression. But states like Ukraine that are not in it, there's a reason that we got involved in leading the effort to put pressure on Russia to stop its aggression, and, we hope, actually return sovereignty to Ukraine. And it's not because on a basic level Ukraine, itself, is that critical to the United States or to countries in Europe. It's because the norms that were violated in terms of aggressing a democratic country on Russia's borders, changing its borders by force, trying to dictate to people their choices about with whom they would ally or associate, if you allow that to stand, it is an open invitation to aggression and anarchy throughout the world.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "So we have to stand up against that. And I think sustaining that is important. And we've sustained it.

We need to actually be very clear about what we'll actually do if we're attacked, and mean it and actually do it. And, then, we probably have to look at how we would use these tools ourselves, and also what the right responses would be. And they may well be asymmetric, responding tit for tat, for example, against some kind of cyber--", "label": 1}

At the same time in elevating Kim Jong Un, in declaring success and even saying, at one point, that the nuclear problem was resolved, the president gave a green light to other countries, starting with China, to go back to something approaching business as usual. What had been working and where the administration deserves credit was it not only continued, but it actually deepened the pressure program that the Obama administration put in place to cut off every economic tie that North Korea had, diplomatic ties, political ties. And that was starting to have an effect.", "label": 1}

You worked very closely with two people who may run for president in 2020, Joe Biden and John Kerry.

What the former New York City mayor hasn't said: He'd pay as much as $3.5 billion less under his wealth tax than he would under similar proposals from Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, two of his rivals for the party's nomination. Bloomberg's plan would also generate far less government revenue.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Bloomberg, who released his tax plan last week, said the proposal targets the very rich. That includes him: Bloomberg is worth an estimated $61 billion, according to Forbes.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Much of that fortune is tied to Bloomberg LLC, the global financial data and media empire he founded four decades ago. The candidate owns 88% of the company, which generated an estimated $3.8 billion in income last year alone, according to industry consultant Douglas Taylor. And his nearly 90% ownership stake in the media enterprise entitled him to about $3.3 billion of that income stream.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Bloomberg would certainly pay significantly more in taxes under his tax proposals than what he is paying under the current tax code. But that's not unique. All of the major Democratic presidential candidates are proposing tax plans that would raise taxes on the wealthy.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "What's more, even outside his proposed wealth tax, Bloomberg's broader tax plan could save him and his company millions versus what he would pay under plans proposed by his rivals. For instance, Bloomberg would raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from a current 21%, but not all the way back to the 35% where it was before President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans lowered it in late 2017. (Rivals like Pete Buttigieg, Sanders and Warren would like to roll back Mr. Trump's corporate tax cut completely.) That 2017 corporate-rate change saved Bloomberg's company roughly $550 million last year.", "label": 1}

Here's a breakdown of what we currently know — and don't know — about Bloomberg's wealth tax proposal and how it compares to what other Democratic candidates have proposed, including Sanders and Warren as well as Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "How much more Bloomberg would pay under his proposed wealth tax: $1.2 billion per year, compared to his current tax bill.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "How it would work: A key in understanding Bloomberg's plan to tax the rich is that it isn't really a wealth tax — it's simply an income tax. That means it would be easier to administer than a wealth tax.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Bloomberg's wealth tax is an incremental change, and that's an advantage because it won't require the construction of a new administration of the IRS to put in place, said Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. But it will also create a lot less new tax liability for the wealthy.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Currently, the top tax rate for all income over $500,000 is 37%. Bloomberg's proposal adds a new tax of 5% on incomes over $5 million a year. He calls that a new surtax on high incomes, but it's essentially just adding a higher tax bracket.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Bloomberg also plans to raise that base rate — before the surcharge — for income above $500,000 to 39.6%, which is what it was under President Barack Obama. That would bring the highest income tax rate under Bloomberg's plan to 44.6%. That's still less than Sanders's top proposed income rate of 52%, but more than what the other campaigns are proposing.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "How many people would pay Bloomberg's wealth surcharge: Income taxes generally hit a larger portion of the population than wealth taxes. But that might not be true for Bloomberg's wealth surcharge, even though it is structured as an income tax.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Roughly 11,000 Americans earned at least $5 million in 2017, according to the latest available statistics from the Social Security Administration. Include investment income from things like gains on stock sales or flipping houses, and many more people would pay Bloomberg's wealth surcharge — it just isn't clear how many.", "label": 1}

{"sentence": "How much government revenue it would raise: Bloomberg's tax proposals would generate a total of $5 trillion in new government revenue over a decade, according to his campaign. But that is for all of his proposals — not just the wealth tax.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Based on earned income alone, Bloomberg's surcharge targeting the rich wouldn't raise much, maybe around $4 billion a year, or $40 billion over a decade. Consider all forms of income, however, and the potential haul could be roughly $1.8 trillion over a decade, based on the University of Pennsylvania's Penn Wharton Budget Model estimate of $200 billion a year from just raising the capital gains tax to 42% (slightly less than the 44.6% top rate that Bloomberg is proposing). About $140 billion of that would come from the top 1% of all earners.", "label": 1}

{"sentence": "How it would work: Sanders's plan is a true wealth tax. After that, it gets complicated.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Sanders is proposing eight wealth tax brackets that start at 1% for couples with wealth above $32 million, and goes up to 8% for wealth above $10 billion. Tax thresholds are cut in half for individuals, who would start paying his 1% wealth tax at $16 million.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "The advantage of a wealth tax is that it taxes all types of assets, not just income. For instance, it would capture those who have inherited their fortune or got to eight figures from investments.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "The disadvantage is that the government would have to create a whole new system to asses wealth — including real estate and private business ownership — and then tax it. That wouldn't be cheap. And many experts say it's even easier for rich people to avoid a wealth tax than an income tax as they can shelter much of theIr wealth overseas.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "How many people would pay the wealth tax: The Sanders wealth tax would likely affect more Americans than those who would pay Bloomberg's surcharge. The Sanders tax would be paid by the 180,000 wealthiest American families, according to his campaign and an independent assessment from economists and income-inequality experts Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. That's about 40,000 more households than Bloomberg's wealth tax.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "How much government revenue it would raise: The Sanders campaign says $4.4 trillion over a decade. Penn Wharton's analysis puts the revenue projection at $3.3 trillion, and possibly as low as $2.8 billion if the wealth tax slows the economy.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "How much more Bloomberg would pay under Warren's proposed wealth tax: $3.7 billion.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "How it would work: Warren's plan, like Sanders, is a direct tax on wealth. But her blueprint is simpler.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "There are just two brackets for both couples and individuals: Warren is proposing that millionaires pay a 2% tax on all their wealth above $50 million. Billionaires would pay 6%. That should make administering a wealth tax slightly easier, but still more complicated than just raising income tax rates, as Bloomberg proposes.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "How many people would pay: The Warren campaign, as well as economists Saez and Zucman, say her tax plan would affect 70,000 households. But another study by a trio of economists estimated that nearly 300,000 people would have to pay Warren's wealth tax for it to generate the total money Warren says it could.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "How much government revenue it would raise: Saez and Zucman peg the expected revenue from her wealth tax at $4 trillion. Penn Wharton estimates it at $2.7 trillion, and $500 billion less, or $2.3 billion, if her wealth taxes slow the economy.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "How much more Bloomberg would pay under the other candidates' proposed tax hikes: $1 billion.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "How their plans would work: Neither Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg nor Amy Klobuchar are proposing a designated wealth tax. Of the three, only Klobuchar has said she is open to one. Buttigieg called Warren's wealth tax extreme.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "In fact, Biden and Buttigieg are proposing to tax billionaires like Bloomberg less than what the media mogul has outlined. Klobuchar is proposing a 30% minimum alternative tax for those earning more than $1 million a year, but hasn't given many details on how it would work.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Instead, and like Bloomberg, all three want to raise income taxes on the wealthy, mostly by taxing investment gains at the same rate as wages. That would hit the rich more than average Americans who may not participate in the stock market beyond their 401(k)s, IRAs and other pre-tax retirement plans.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "The candidates have also proposed returning income tax rates for top earners to where they were before President Trump took office. That would raise the tax on capital gains to 39.6% from its current top rate of 20%.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "How many people would pay more tax: The Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar plans are by far the broadest because their additional tax revenue would come from raising the capital gains tax on all Americans, not just the super wealthy.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "As of 2017, some 1.4 million American households had annual income of more than $500,000. Nearly all of them would likely pay more under the three candidates' plans.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "How much government revenue they would raise: Penn Wharton has said Biden's total tax plan can generate $2.6 trillion over a decade. But that includes everything from raising the corporate income tax to eliminating tax breaks for companies that produce fossil fuels. About half of that, or $1.3 trillion, would be raised from top wage earners, according to Penn Wharton's calculations.", "label": 1}

Members of early golf societies in Scotland and England from the early 1700s onwards were quite frequently military men who would often have military style coats -- it was the fashion of the day to wear a button coat, Fleming told CNN. Different societies had different colors -- red is an R&A color and other societies also wore red, but others wore blue, green, there are instances of yellow (coats). It was symbol of membership. They would have special buttons for different societies, in the same way today that clubs have their own crest on jumpers and jackets, blazers, club ties.

Often what would happen is that they would weight their skirts with wire along the bottom edge rather than having the Miss Higgins Hoop, Fleming says.

{"sentence": "Election security has come under scrutiny over the last year – and deservedly so. The 2016 election opened our eyes to how new technologies we rushed to purchase after the butterfly ballots and hanging chads of the 2000 election created new vulnerabilities hard to imagine at the time.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "We have known how bad this problem is for over a year, so the logical question is: What have we done about it?", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Sadly, not as much as we could have. But the reasons are more complicated than you might think.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Secretaries of state and state and local election administrators have been scrutinized for hardware, software, and vendor choices. This scrutiny is healthy, but often fails to address the big picture: Yes, our election equipment and procedures are in need of an upgrade, but so are the policies that shape those choices in the first place.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "The reality is that, even when officials want to do the right thing, red tape, contorted lines of authority and a lack of resources and inaction from Congress and state legislatures often hold them back. Our laws, procedures and financial commitment to elections need fixing – and that won't happen unless we pressure our lawmakers to do it.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Many people don't realize that election system is not monolithic. It is not run like the Transportation Security Administration, a national bureaucracy with a unified leadership structure, budget and security protocols. Quite the opposite – there are around 7,000 election jurisdictions nationwide. Some states run their elections centrally, some delegate authority to counties or localities.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Everything from budgets, equipment, human resources and policy are set differently and at different levels of government. Even the titular heads of elections vary by state, ranging from an elected secretary of state to administrators or commissions selected by governors or legislators. The system's diversity can make it more resistant to attack, but it also means one-size-fits-all solutions aren't workable.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Moreover, election officials at every level are confined within the restraints of law, budget and bureaucratic architecture as much as any other part of government. Even if an election official decides her state needs new machines with a paper audit trail, she can't necessarily go out and buy them – she may need the legislature to appropriate millions of dollars and go through a procurement process.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "There are other complications. The integrity of our election system is ultimately a question of perception, not reality. The Russians don't actually need to manipulate vote tallies to achieve their desired outcome of distrust and chaos. They need only create the perception of interference.

{"sentence": "Given this reality, we can't just secure databases and machines, we have to secure our civic ecosystem against the kind of foreign-born lies and distractions that we saw documented in Friday's indictment of Russians by special counsel Robert Mueller. This requires collaboration between our national security and intelligence services, law enforcement, social media platforms and our election officials.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Congress must act to align our intelligence services so they will be best equipped to detect and prevent information operations. Social media platforms should not wait for rules or regulations to fully disclose the content that is spread on their platforms and force users to declare who they are.

{"sentence": "Our election system is deeply vulnerable and in dire need of an upgrade. We don't need more evidence of that.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "We need to start posing the right questions to policymakers. Do election administrators have the funding they need to make necessary improvements to our election systems and the tools to hold vendors accountable for security? Do they have access to the intelligence they need to anticipate incoming threats? And are the state's IT and procurement systems sufficiently modern to account for a dynamic threat like cybersecurity?", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "None of these challenges should be excuses for negligence, but they explain why change has been painfully slow. We must focus our attention and advocacy on the people who can really change all of this: our legislators, especially our state legislators and governors, who have the power to remove financial, bureaucratic, and policy hurdles that slow reform. Congress has a unique ability to bring financial and intelligence resources to bear.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "There is good legislation ready for a vote. At the federal level, a bipartisan group of senators have introduced a very sound bill that would provide states with an infusion of money, badly needed intelligence on cyberthreats, and federal support to get election technology up to date and keep it current.

The President is unwilling to accept this risk to our troops, she added.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "The policy represents a major reversal from the approach of the Obama administration which in 2014 committed the US to largely adhering to the 1997 Ottawa Convention, the international agreement which banned the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel landmines. The Obama policy committed to replacing landmines in the US stockpile after they expire and directed the destruction of stockpiles not required for the defense of South Korea.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "Speaking to reporters on Friday Victorino Mercado, who is performing the duties of Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy, Plans, and Capabilities, acknowledged that landmines were an emotional issue but stressed that the US would only use landmines with these safety features, noting that China and Russia maintain a stockpile of thousands of persistent landmines that are seen as much more likely to kill or maim civilians.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "The new Pentagon policy gives the authority to use landmines in combat to the commanders of the US military's combatant commands, usually a four-star general or admiral, such as the commanders of US Africa Command and US Central Command which oversee operations on the African continent and the Middle East respectively.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Defense officials argue that landmines can play an important role in defending US forces from both enemy armored vehicles and ground forces, helping to ensure US forces are not outflanked or overrun during an attack and can help influence the enemy's direction of movement in a manner to give US troops the advantage.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "One of the drivers of the change in policy is greater concern about the prospect of a major conflict with a great power adversary like Russia or China where denying conventional enemy forces access to critical terrain would be seen as a more urgent need than it has been in recent years where the US has focused on counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations. Moscow and Beijing are not parties to the Ottawa treaty.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "Too many Americans underestimate the value of their employer-sponsored retirement savings accounts, particularly if the employer is willing to match some, or all, employee contributions.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "While the majority of workers with 401(k) plans contribute more than enough to take full advantage of their employer's matching program, there are still about 20% of people who don't.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Sure, it doesn't seem like a ton of money to be missing out on now, but you might be surprised at how much of a difference it can make when you eventually retire.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "About 75% of companies offering 401(k) retirement plans offer some type of a matching program, generally based on an employee's contributions capped at a percentage of their salary.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "For example, a 401(k) matching policy may be 50% of employee contributions, up to 6% of total compensation. In other words, if you earn $50,000 per year and contribute $3,000 to your 401(k) -- 6% of your salary -- your employer will contribute an additional $1,500 on your behalf.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "However, about one in five participants don't contribute enough to take full advantage of their employer match, according to several different surveys. Besides cashing out your 401(k) and spending the money, this is perhaps the worst retirement savings mistake you can make.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Why the employer match is so important", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Here's a simplified example that shows why this is so important. Let's say that you earn $100,000 per year and that your employer will match 50% of your contributions, up to 5% of your salary. So, you choose to contribute $5,000 into your 401(k) each year and your employer matches 50% of your contributions for a total of $7,500 flowing into your account annually. Over a 30-year period, your account could be expected to grow to approximately $708,000, assuming 7% annualized investment returns.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "On the other hand, let's say that you choose to contribute just 3% of your salary, which is a common automatic contribution level set by many employers. Including the employer match, this means that just $4,500 will go into your account per year. Each year, you're missing out on $1,000 in employer contributions that you could have received for contributing the 5% matching limit. What's more, a move like this can really add up over time -- assuming the same 7% annualized returns, your account would only grow to about $425,000. That $283,000 difference could have a big impact on your financial security after retirement.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "For this reason, the maximum contribution level your employer is willing to match should be the bare minimum you choose to put into your 401(k). Not doing so is literally turning down free money. Would you turn down a raise? Of course not. Not taking advantage of your employer match is just as silly.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "This is an especially common mistake among younger people just starting out in their careers. Understandably, if you're starting your first job with an employer-sponsored retirement account, choosing to effectively reduce each of your paychecks to contribute to a retirement account may seem like a lot of money.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Plus, many employers' 401(k) plans have automatic enrollment for new hires, often with a low contribution rate such as 2% or 3%. Many workers simply don't think to change it.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "Sun flips magnetic field (CNN) -- The poles of the sun's powerful magnetic field have reversed, signaling a time of peak solar activity that could spell trouble for planet Earth, astronomers said this week. The sun's magnetic north and south poles were in their respective northern and southern hemisphere several months ago. Yet since then they have migrated to the opposite sides of the star. The bipolar flip did not take astronomers by surprise. It takes place like clockwork on the sun, once about every 11 years. This always happens around the time of solar maximum, NASA physicist David Hathaway said in a statement. The magnetic poles exchange takes place at the peak of the sunspot cycle. In fact, it's a good indication that Solar Max is really here. During Solar Max or solar maximum, the sun tends to exhibit more sunspots and eruptions, and jettison more solar flares, which send powerful streams of charged particles into the solar system. Solar blasts heading toward Earth can stoke up beautiful auroras in the nighttime sky, and wreak havoc on communications satellites and electrical power grids. Astronomers consider the current solar maximum more powerful than average, but less intense than the last two in 1989 and 1979. Earth's magnetic fields also change places but with much less predictability and frequency. The reversals take place between intervals lasting from 5,000 to 5 million years. The last one happened 740,000 years ago, scientists estimate. Some suggest the planet is overdue for another one.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "1. Traditional IRAs and qualified retirement plan accounts", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Perhaps the largest ticking time bomb from a tax perspective comes from the money that Americans have in IRAs, 401(k) plans, and other qualified retirement plans. 401(k)s have about $5.3 trillion in assets, according to the Investment Company Institute, and total retirement assets amount to $27.2 trillion. That second number includes annuities and traditional pensions, and both figures consist of both traditional and Roth-style IRAs and 401(k) plans. Nevertheless, it's fair to assume that there's somewhere between $10 trillion and $20 trillion in pre-tax assets held in retirement plans.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "The problem with traditional IRAs, 401(k)s, and similar retirement accounts is that when you withdraw money from them, you have to pay income tax on what you pull out, and that reduces the size of your effective after-tax nest egg.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Even if you don't want to withdraw your pre-tax retirement money, these accounts are almost universally subject to required minimum distribution rules that kick in at age 70 1/2. Once you reach that age, you have no choice: You must start withdrawing a portion of your account and paying taxes on it.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "What's more, the withdrawals you have to include in taxable income can subject other sources of income to tax. The most common example is Social Security, where benefits become taxable if your outside income lifts you over certain threshold amounts.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "One solution is to make greater use of Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k) plan options. Roth accounts let you save after-tax money, with distributions being tax-free in retirement. Not all employers offer Roth 401(k)s, but conversions of existing traditional retirement assets to Roths are generally available.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Many people own savings bonds without even knowing it. As popular gifts from older generations to children, savings bonds differ from most bonds in that they accumulate interest on a tax-deferred basis. You don't have to pay taxes on the income that they generate each year.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "The price you'll pay, though, is that you have to pay tax when you cash in your bonds. Because currently issued savings bonds stop earning interest after 30 years, you either have to cash them in and suffer the tax consequences or allow them to sit without earning any interest at all after their final maturity date.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Fortunately, one solution is to take the money from maturing bonds and transfer it into a 529 college savings plan account. Doing so lets you exclude the accumulated interest from taxation. Otherwise, you'll have to pay tax on the entire increase in value from what you paid for the bond and what you received when you cashed it in.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Finally, your personal residence can be a ticking tax time bomb. Most homeowners get the benefit of one of the most lucrative tax breaks on the books: the capital gains exclusion of up to $250,000 for singles or $500,000 for joint filers. What that means is that if a couple saw their home rise in value from $300,000 to $800,000 over their lifetimes, they can sell it and pay no tax at all.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "So how is this a tax trap? The potential problem is that the exclusion is available only for property that's been used as your principal residence during at least two of the five years preceding the sale. There are special rules that reduce that requirement to just one year if you need to leave your home for long-term care in a nursing home or other institution, but failing to meet the requirement can eliminate the exclusion entirely. Moreover, if you decide to change the nature of the home to a nonqualified use -- such as renting it out -- then capital gain that's attributed to the period of nonqualified use can be taxable.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "The solution is to sell your home long before there's any danger of losing the personal residence exclusion. Otherwise, you could turn the most profitable investment of your life into a major tax hassle.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush, in Philadelphia on Tuesday urging Americans to perform community service, has directed his Cabinet to report within 30 days on ways to boost volunteerism, an administration official said. The directive is part of the president's USA Freedom Corps initiative, detailed in his State of the Union address in January, calling on Americans to give at least two years of service, the equivalent of 4,000 hours, to others. Bush renewed that call in Philadelphia, where he participated in a discussion on volunteerism that was preceded by a tour of the People's Emergency Center, a shelter for homeless women and children. This is a good place to come and start a dialogue, the president said. Societies change one heart, one soul, one conscience at a time, and government can hand out money but it cannot put hope in people's hearts. Bush said volunteerism has increased since his State of the Union address, and said he had instructed government agencies to make it easier for Americans to volunteer. A senior administration official said the president wants federal agencies to review service opportunities and barriers. Lindsey Kozberg, communications director for the USA Freedom Corps, said the goal is to get the federal house in order so that we know where service opportunities exist, we make sure the public knows about those opportunities and we ... break down any barriers or hindrances to volunteer service that exist in our regulations or programs.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "CORKE: From the Situation Room, Rose Garden, briefing and cabinet rooms, and this weekend, the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, President Trump carefully crafted a forward leaning posture during the shutdown this week but for all the crime statistics and letters to Congress imploring lawmakers to fund border security including the wall, an ominous realization has a cast a pall over the nation's capital, with no sign of movement in the negotiations, a partial government shutdown is unlikely to end anytime soon.", "label": 3}

But it would be outrageous for Democrats who agree with the president -- that's what's the most outrageous thing to me, and something that frankly is so just incomprehensible -- they agree with the president. They agree that we need border security. They just are unwilling to let this president win.", "label": 3}

{"sentence": "SANDERS: They have. I'm not saying we oppose those six. I'm just saying, to make it like this is an easy deal; we want to be able to negotiate, but at the same time you can't just keep passing the buck. This is a major point of contention. And let's just sit down and work it out.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "WALLACE: OK. But if this shutdown lags on, not months or years, but even in to February, it's going to start to hurt real people.", "label": 3}

Millions of people will lose rental assistance payments and union leaders say hundreds of TSA workers are already off the job because they can't afford to get to work. President Trump thinks the border wall is worth all of that?", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "SANDERS: Look, the president certainly doesn't want any of those things to happen. But you know what else he doesn't want to see happen? He never wants to make a phone call like the one he made earlier this week, where he spoke to Officer Singh of California's widow because an illegal immigrant came up off their border and killed him in cold blood. This shouldn't happen in this country, particularly when we have things that we know can help prevent it.", "label": 3}

And the State Department says that there is, quote, their words: no credible evidence of any terrorist coming across the border from Mexico.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "SANDERS: We know that roughly, nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally, and we know that our most vulnerable point of entry is at our southern border.", "label": 3}

{"sentence": "SANDERS: It's by air, it's by land and it's by sea. It's all of the above. But one thing that you're forgetting is that the most vulnerable point of entry that we have into this country is our southern border, and we have to protect it.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "And the more individuals that --", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "WALLACE: But they're not coming across the southern border, Sarah. They're coming and they're being stopped at airports.", "label": 3}

{"sentence": "And the more and more that our border becomes vulnerable and the less and less that we spend time and money protecting it, the more that we're going to have an influx, not just of terrorists but of human traffickers, drug inflow and people that are coming here to do American citizens harm.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "WALLACE: OK. The president now says, and this was a revelation on Friday, that he can go around Congress and build this wall on his own. Take a look.", "label": 3}

{"sentence": "WALLACE: How serious is he about that? Has the White House drafted an emergency order? A resolution that he could, that he could -- that he could announce tomorrow -- we're going to declare a national emergency; we're going to build the wall.

{"sentence": "SANDERS: The president's prepared to do what it takes to protect our borders, to protect the people of this country; he knows that the number one job he has as president and commander-in-chief is to protect its citizens.

{"sentence": "But not just securing the border, but fixing the immigration system as a whole; it's completely broken. The president wants to make sure we look at all of the different things, loopholes we can close, to make that better.

We passed appropriations bill that were passed unanimously by the Senate. They were supported by Republicans. There was an agreement on those bills.", "label": 3}

So, we passed again the Senate approved version that -- it was the Republican path forward. That passed the House in a bipartisan way with Republicans and Democrats. We sent that to the Senate.", "label": 3}

{"sentence": "WALLACE: Let me just interrupt for a second, because Speaker Pelosi and Democratic Senate Leader Schumer have been hinting at this on Friday after the meeting, is that the Democratic view know that there can be no negotiations on the border wall at all until the president agrees to reopen the rest of the government?", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "CICILLINE: I mean, I think we believe the government must reopen immediately. I mean, it's having real consequences not only to the federal workers, but to the contrary, in terms of food stamps, in terms of tax refunds, in terms of the safety at the airports with the TSA. I mean, there are real consequences to a prolonged shutdown. The president doesn't seem to understand that but it's really impacting small business. It's impacting people's lives.", "label": 3}

{"sentence": "REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: We are not doing a wall. Does anybody have any doubt that we are not doing a wall? The wall, in my view, is an immorality. It is, again, a waste of money and opportunity cost to protect the American people. But it is a diversionary tactic on the part of the president.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "WALLACE: I want to ask you a specific question, Congressman, why is a wall immoral? I'm not asking why it's ineffective or why you think the money could be spent better, but the speaker keeps saying the wall is immoral. There's a wall or a fence around the White House. People build walls around their homes.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "Why is a border wall immoral?", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "CICILLINE: I think what the speaker is saying is that we believe in securing our borders. We have appropriated $1.7 billion over the last two years for border security. The department has spent less than 6 percent. But we are prepared to do more because we need to do more, but we want to do it in a way that's effective.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "WALLACE: If I may just press, why is a wall immoral?", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "CICILLINE: Well, that's a question the speaker will have to answer, but I think what she means by that is it doesn't reflect our values as a country, that America has been a place that welcomes refugees and immigrants, people who are fleeing violence and war.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "But I think the real point of that, the rest of her sentence is it's not cost-effective. It doesn't achieve the objective. Democrats are committing to securing our borders. We have voted to secure our borders and appropriate significant resources to do it.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "CICILLINE: But let's use technology, let's use drones, let's use satellites, let's do cargo inspections, which aren't happening. Let's do things that will actually secure the border.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "WALLACE: OK. But let's talk about the effectiveness of it. Brandon Judd is the president of the National Border Patrol Council. He's been a border patrol agent for 21 years. Here's what he says.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "BRANDON JUDD, NATIONAL BORDER PATROL COUNCIL PRESIDENT: Anywhere that you look where we have built walls, they have worked. They have been an absolute necessity for border patrol agents in securing the border.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "WALLACE: Here's a guy who has been on the front lines, on the border for two decades. He says border walls work.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "CICILLINE: Well, look, I think there's no question there are places we have walls and fencing and other kind of barriers. I think good border security is going to be a combination of things. But what we've heard of from the president is he wants a big great concrete wall that will be a thousand miles --", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "WALLACE: No, no, he's given up on the concrete wall. He is talking about steel fencing out.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "CICILLINE: But I think the reality is this is actually a fight the president has created to distract from the real issues that he's facing. The fact is the Republicans were in control of the House, the Senate and the White House for two years.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "And if this is such an important priority for the president, why didn't he do it at the beginning of the administration? He waited to the lame duck. Why? Because his defense secretary left with a strong rebuke of his foreign policy, his national security advisors sentencing hearing blowup because of the seriousness of the charges. His foundation was closed on for persistent illegalities. The gentleman heading the ISIS effort resigned.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "CICILLINE: It was a bad couple of weeks. So what does the president do? He shuts the government down and he's distracted all the attention away from all of those pressing issues to the government shutdown.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "WALLACE: But, sir, the fact is, even The Washington Post today said that there is now a crisis at the border. There has been a dramatic spike in the number of family units coming across the southern border.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "I want to put up some statistics. In November of 2017, a year plus ago, the border patrol apprehended 7,000 family units at our southwest border. This past November, two months ago, they caught 25,000 family units coming across.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "And look at these recent incidents were border patrol agents had to fire tear gas at migrants who were trying to climb the fence and who were throwing rocks at the border agents.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "I mean, Congressman, the president is not making this up.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "CICILLINE: No, the reality is this is a complicated problem. It requires a sophisticated answer and I think the incoming chief of staff for the president and the outgoing chief of staff have both set up border wall doesn't solve this problem.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "We need to have comprehensive immigration reform. We need to have additional personnel. We need to use technology. So we want to secure our border and respond to these challenges but we want to do it in a way that works, a way that will achieve the objective.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "And so, what we are saying to the president is open up the government. These other departments have nothing to do with this. Do not punish the American people by shutting down government if you don't get your way.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "WALLACE: All right. I got --", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "WALLACE: Let me just interrupt because I have two minutes left and I want to get to questions in.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "WALLACE: The president said on Friday that he has the right, and he's even considering, and you heard it from Sarah Sanders just a moment ago, declaring a national emergency and building a wall in his own without congressional approval using funds that have been appropriated for military construction. If he goes ahead and does that, what will House Democrats like yourself do?", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "CICILLINE: Well, I don't think the president has that authority. He would have to meet a very high standard. Article One establishes the Congress of the United States and gives us the responsibility of appropriating money.", "label": 3}
{"sentence": "So I don't think the president has the authority to do that, and I hope you will continue to try to work with Congress to resolve this disagreement but open the government first.

They had 60,000 people they apprehended in November coming across the border.

{"sentence": "We now spend 10 hours a day looking at a screen. That's nearly half of our lives spent living in a virtual world. The iPhone was released just 10 years ago. Our existence has been radically transformed in a relatively short space of time. While it is hard to remember life before computers, research shows that we aren't as effective on screens as we might think. We tested the effects of multi-screening on brand recall and found that when dealing with more than one device at a time, the mental strain decreases our attention and emotional response and eventually leads to cognitive collapse – which means people are looking, but they haven't the mental energy to take more in (all too familiar a feeling in the connected lives we lead.)", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "But it's not just multi-screening that hinders us. Research shows that we are often more adept at analogue tasks versus their digital counterparts. A study from Princeton University showed that we process information better when writing over typing notes, as the exercise is slower allowing students to digest and better remember the content. Another study from the University of Stavanger in Norway suggests that the recall of a story's plot after using an e-reader such as a Kindle is poorer than with traditional books. The researchers suggest that the haptic and tactile feedback of a Kindle does not provide the same support for mental reconstruction of a story as a print pocket book does. In other words, the frictionless experience of a Kindle is less memorable than the weighty and physical experience of a book.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "You would be forgiven for thinking that brand experiences have their work cut out in a world that seems obsessed with 'frictionless' experiences. But in fact, the most memorable real-world experiences have a little bit of friction built in. AirBnB for example took the conscious decision to design in a little friction. They removed their role in managing any issues between hosts and guests. Counter-intuitively this direct connection of guests and hosts deepened satisfaction scores across both. Similarly, brands like Amazon recognise they have a problem with this because interactions with them are so fluid that people aren't actually engaging with the brand. Amazon themselves say they need to build in more of a human touch.", "label": 4}

To grow penetration, we needed to deliver unique reach of 2.4m samples, so we needed to identify new key opportunity areas outside of large city centres which have been historically targeted. Using socio-economic and Census based data modelling, we identified locations with the greatest clustering of belVita audience types, but lower sales penetration. This allowed us to target audiences with the best sales uplift potential, along with a high propensity to buy.", "label": 4}

Yes, Nick, there is a virgin birth story worth telling -- but its worth is measured not by assertions of what happened long ago, rather by signs of what happens in the telling now.

In each story, what brings witnesses to new life in Christ is hearing their Lord. Not seeing.

People rather discovered the stories, by the grace of God -- together, in communities, according to their most sublime and practical needs. The origins of the stories are shrouded in mysteries that need no probing (although they can withstand any amount of it) because an open heart and mind receive quite naturally the meaning of a godly story. It has nothing to do with fretting its facts. Faith's cares are different. So of course anyone is Christian who feels drawn to the light of the story like a wanderer to a candle in a window.

If here and there the Bible tells me so, and if people not convicted by its word say, That's not my word! -- how do I respond? Either I say, You are wrong because I am right, so you change or else I hold you in the wrong on fundamental things. Ah! Those so certain to put others in the wrong abandon the way of Jesus for paths of power and control along which are strewn all the bloody evils of empires past and future. What is the alternative?

{"sentence": "After eight competitive episodes of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars season two, and one episode of season three, finally, finally, fi-na-lly someone gets how to take advantage of the Lip Sync for Your Legacy format. It took Shangela Laquifa Wadley herself, queen of strategy in season three of the flagship show, to step up to the plate and start asking what the other queens will do for her if she saves them. Yes, at last, a contestant is looking at the eliminate-each-other format as a chance to build alliances, not as a burden. Now, hopefully, her fellow queens will follow suit.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Things look dismal when the episode opens, as BenDeLaCreme practically complains about sweeping the premiere's challenges. This sucks, she says as she wipes away eliminated queen Morgan McMichaels' lipstick mirror message. It's like not winning. It feels really bad. Despite the $10,000 prize for winning the Lip Sync for Your Legacy, and an early positive impression in the judges' minds, Ben's too wrapped up in having to make a tough decision and sending home one of her sisters.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Thorgy Thor, who I agreed with maybe once in season eight, speaks sense in her confessional: Wake up, bitch! You had to make a decision. Nobody envied you, but you made it. Move forward. Because that's the game. All Stars is not Drag Race. The difference in the format exists for a reason. The best of the best should be capable of making hard choices to get ahead. Ben is great at Drag Race, but as evidenced by her mealy-mouthed monologue when she had to eliminate Morgan, she may not be great at certain elements of All Stars.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Why the shift from original lyrics to a dance focus? It could be that Todrick Hall is now in charge, after the unfortunate public meltdown of former favorite Ru producer Lucian Piane. But that seems wrong, considering Hall is a prolific parodist, and his Kardashian was an original piece. Whatever the case, it gives queens relatively few chances to be funny or impressive — save Shangela, whose Mariah number is minimally about singing and more about camping it up, and Ben, whose hard-rapping Julie Andrews is perfect. Even a cold-hearted Ben skeptic like me can admit she utterly slays this challenge. Under Drag Race rules, she'd have been the sole winner (though, under the same rules, I think Aja would've been the champion last week).", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Joining them in the top is 10th queen Bebe Zahara Benet as Diana Ross. She effortlessly proves why less is more: She has few lyrics to lip-sync to, but every movement, every facial twitch, and every affect is right. Here's the key that everybody should look at for that: You didn't do much to embody Diana, head judge Michelle Visage says. Subtlety won out for her. Still, it'd be tough to argue for her win, considering how little she does compared to Shangela and Ben.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Taking into account both the challenge and the redeem-a-bad-look runway, some of the other results are puzzling. Trixie Mattel is safe after a terrific Dolly Parton impression, I'd imagine because it's too expected for her (though personally, I'd have put her in the top three over Bebe). Aja joins her; her Amy Winehouse is tame, but a spectacular reworking of her Princess Disastah runway keeps her in. Chi Chi DeVayne falls just outside the bottom two, even though her Patti LaBelle is a laugh riot. The problem seemingly lies with her reworked neon look, which judge Carson Kressley knocks as basic. Her dancing diva sister Kennedy Davenport is not as lucky, as a poorly executed Janet Jackson impression lands her in the bottom two.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Then there's Thorgy, bless her heart. Thorgy was a fantastic competitor on Drag Race season eight, continually scoring high in the challenges, until her lack of wins and imagined rivalry with eventual champion Bob the Drag Queen got the best of her. When she started overthinking things, she sunk into a pile of self-doubt, and never fully recovered.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "All Stars brings out all the worst parts of Thorgy. She's a mess from the word go this week, questioning why her part as Stevie Nicks isn't as funny as the others. (Having seen the full show: Girl, save Mariah and Julie, none of them were that funny.) In rehearsals with Todrick, she imagines herself focused and galvanized, but as Ben later points out in a confessional, she spends the whole time subconsciously self-sabotaging. It's honestly distressing to watch a talent like Thorgy melt down like this. As a result, her actual performance is kind of a mess. She looks like Stevie, but her affects are twitchy and bizarre. Her insistence during judging that Stevie Nicks isn't a gay icon — really, girl? — doesn't help her case.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Said meltdown is ultimately her undoing, as Lip Sync for Your Legacy winner Shangela's reticence to send home her Texas sister Kennedy trumps Thorgy's offer of an alliance. Shangela is playing strategically, and she sees Thorgy's weaknesses for what they are. An ally is only good to her if they'll actually perform well. So the season eight queen goes home — or rather, to wherever Morgan is as they await a potential chance to Ruturn to the competition. If Thorgy wants to get back in, though, she'll have to get through a lot of personal demons, and fast.", "label": 4}

During the premiere, while Trixie, Kennedy, and Bebe seemed happy to be called safe, Milk looked annoyed. This week, she doubles down, whispering angrily to fellow safe queens Trixie and Aja at the back of the stage after her performance as Celine Dion registers as neither spectacular nor disappointing with the judges.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "This is fucking ridiculous, she says. I hate this. She's mad not being in the top three, Trixie asks to clarify. Yes, Milk insists. Those three? Really? Fucking stupid.

{"sentence": "There's clearly a narrative being built here of Milk as villain.

{"sentence": "Her sniping remarks after being called safe, however, as well as a breakdown during deliberations, make me think these are Milk's true colors. She bursts into sobs over not being in the top — I think that's a lot of emotion for safe, Trixie says in her confessional — and complains that she's not being commended properly for her hard work. She basically throws a temper tantrum because the teacher didn't give her a gold star.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "I didn't mind Milk in her season, and was even pretty impressed with her post-show modeling gigs. But her casting on All Stars confused me. I wasn't sure she had more to offer in this arena. After all, being successful off the show does not automatically make you great at Drag Race. But seeing her complain that the judges didn't properly congratulate her is a new low — a case of spoiled Milk. What's more, it's an off-putting display of her privilege.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Milk is a hot, white man out of drag. That does not make the work she does in drag any less artistically valid. But it does mean we have to keep perspective on why she's able to do the drag she does. If, for example, Kennedy's drag was half as outré as Milk's, she'd be relentlessly blasted by fellow queens and trolls alike. We know this because Kennedy gets hate just for doing her drag as-is, much less something so unconventional. Milk receives the benefit of the doubt in a way someone less classically handsome (or non-white) would certainly not.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Again, just to be clear: This doesn't discount the value of Milk's drag. She is one of the most avant-garde thinkers Drag Race has ever seen, up there with Sharon Needles, Raja, and Kim Chi. As she reminded us in the premiere, she has literally inspired Drag Race challenges. But whining that she's not getting kudos — and discounting her fellow queens' performances while doing so — is ignoring the ways in which she benefits from her privilege. She gets to stay in the competition and continue to show her unconventional drag, despite her flawed execution of it.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Because therein lies the rub: Safe is honestly a generous placement for Milk. Her Celine is weird and frenetic (and in not-very-Celine ways), and her runway is bland. She probably deserves the bottom three spot over Chi Chi this week. She absolutely deserved to be in the bottom two last week. Rather than throwing a fit, she should be glad she's still in this race — because if she continues performing as she has, she won't be around much longer.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "The Lip Sync for Your Legacy is much more evenly edited this week; thank you, Drag Race, for learning from the premiere's Aja snub.

One example he gives is something he learned from mentor Kelly Vohs, who taught him that a restaurant has to have something called MELT. It's music, entertainment, lighting, temperature. If one of those is off, you don't feel comfortable in the space and you won't want to go back to it, even if you don't know why. As an owner, you have to ask yourself if one of those things is off. So when we look at a restaurant, we want to make sure, before we open a restaurant, is the music and volume correct, is the temperature correct and does it need be adjusted throughout the night.", "label": 4}

We keep fare prices under constant review and the price rises for this year are capped in line with inflation, with 97p out of every £1 paid going back into the railway. Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group which represents train operators, said: On average, fares will rise by less than inflation this year. For every pound paid in fares, 97p goes directly back to operating and improving services and, with more people travelling, that means more money for investment by the private and public partnership railway to build the better network Britain needs.", "label": 4}

The new variant, known as the B.1.351 lineage, has quickly become the dominant strain in South Africa, driving a rapid increase in infections up and down the coast.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Some experts are concerned the variant could be even more dangerous than the strain found in the U.K. Both strains are thought to be more infectious than the previously dominant strain going around, but there's also concern the B.1.351 variant could wind up being resistant to the vaccines.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Before you panic: It appears the vaccines we currently have on the market offer some level of efficacy against the strain; others currently in trials are showing less efficacy against the variant. That said, scientists predicted this would happen to some degree and they could tweak the vaccines to effectively work against new variants.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Here's what to know about the new strain identified in South Africa:", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "What's different about this COVID-19 variant?", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "The new strain has multiple different mutations, one of which involves the spike protein — the part of the virus that binds to cells.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Any change to the spike protein raises a little red flag to scientists. The spike protein's main job is to glue itself to our cells so the virus can start replicating itself over and over again to create an infection.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "If the spike protein mutates in a way that makes it more efficient at binding to our cells, the consequences are clear: More people will become infected.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "There was a favorable mutation and it looks like it can get transmitted more easily. That's good for the virus, and if we let things go naturally, that strain could become our dominant strain, said Bradley Pollock, the associate dean for public health sciences at the UC Davis School of Medicine.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "What impact do the mutations have?", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Health officials are pretty confident that the variant is more transmissible than previous strains, as it's recently been dominating infections in South Africa. Same goes with the strain in the U.K., which has a similar mutation within the spike protein making it more infectious.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "We need more data to confirm this is the case, but there's enough evidence to suggest the strain infects people more efficiently, according to Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security and an infectious disease expert.

{"sentence": "Still, greater infectivity means more cases, and inevitably, more hospitalizations and deaths.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "The other big question is whether this particular variant could be resistant to vaccines. After all, the spike protein is what the vaccines are designed to recognize and go after.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "But what if it could resist the vaccines?", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "That probably wouldn't be a major dilemma, Pollock said.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "First of all, if a mutation occurs to the spike protein (as it has), and if you've been vaccinated and have protective antibodies, your body will still have a strong chance of beating the virus.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "It's theoretically possible that a mutation could occur that would diminish the efficacy of the vaccine a bit, but Pollock said scientists could easily adjust the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines — like the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines — to respond to the mutations.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "You can go in there and very quickly engineer a solution for that, Pollock said. There may be approval issues and new clinical trials, but tweaking a mRNA vaccine itself is relatively simple.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Infectious disease experts aren't surprised to see these new variants. Coronaviruses mutate all the time — most of the time, those little mutations don't make a difference in the virus's behavior.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "But once in a blue moon, a mutation causes the virus to become more efficient at its job of infecting people and making them sick. It may be one in a million or one in a billion where you get these sequence shifts [that have an impact]. It doesn't happen that often, Pollock said.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "We've already seen the coronavirus mutate and become more infectious. For example, there was the D614G variant that appeared in Australia and India back in May which was more transmissible.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "The new strain isn't thought to cause a more severe, deadlier disease, and all the precautions we've been taking to protect ourselves will work just fine against any new variants that come our way. (Experts do say that it might be worth double masking now, though, just to protect yourself against any strain.)", "label": 4}

In Western culture, black has been associated with mourning for centuries, but the tradition of wearing black to funerals dates back even further to the Roman Empire, according to Wonderopolis. The custom was also reportedly adopted by Queen Victoria, who wore black to funerals to show her dignity and respect for the deceased.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "It should be noted, however, that various cultures around the world have different customs when it comes to funerals. In China, for instance, the traditional color of mourning is white, while in Thailand widows wear purple while mourning their spouses. And traditions, in general, continue to change.

{"sentence": "Everyone thinks you have to wear a black suit to a funeral. Well, you may not have a black suit if you're a man, but you could wear [a dark suit], Diane Gottsman, etiquette expert and owner of The Protocol School of Texas, told HuffPost, adding, If you're a woman, you don't have to wear black, but wear something that's not going to make you stand out and make you look as if you're celebrating.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "You want to honor the spirit of the event, Daniel Post Senning, co-host of the Awesome Etiquette podcast and co-author of Emily Post's Etiquette, 19th Edition, told HuffPost. Traditionally, that [meant wearing] things that were darker tones. It didn't always have to be black, but the idea was that you weren't really festive. The idea was that you were expressing mourning.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Senning went on to explain that traditions have changed over the years, and not everybody wants to approach a funeral service in the same way. For instance, as Elaine Swann, founder of the Swann School of Protocol, told HuffPost, sometimes the family may ask everybody to wear a particular color, because it was the deceased's color.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "You basically want to allow the family to set the tone for that sort of thing, Swann added.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "All three experts agreed, though, that choosing more subdued tones like black, gray or navy is definitely a safe choice, because, as Gottsman said, you don't want to draw attention to yourself.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "Short is fashionable, but it's too short when people are taking second and third looks because you can't sit down, that's too short, Gottsman said.

{"sentence": "As far as skirts are concerned, you want to choose something that is more modest in nature, so at the knee or just above the knee is a good idea in terms of the length, Swann said.", "label": 4}

Is this hemline a little too low or too high? Is this fabric a little too sheer? Is this knot in my tie a little too creative? you should err on the side of caution.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Other things that should be avoided include anything too glittery, like sequins or flashy metallic fabrics, or heavy cologne or perfume, as it can be quite distracting. In terms of footwear, Gottsman suggested choosing a shoe that can easily take you from a funeral home or place of worship to a burial site, where you might be walking in grass or gravel. And definitely no sneakers.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "″[Sneakers are] a no, Gottsman said. I think it just says, 'I tossed something on to come here and I'm getting ready to leave.' The same goes for flip-flops and canvas slip-ons, she added.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "You still want to make an effort to show respect to the solemn nature of the occasion, he said.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "This year it may be an issue. In fact I think it is, in part because of the circus that has been the presidential campaign season so far.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "I think people already are troubled by some of the extreme rhetoric that we've seen in the presidential race. I think people already are troubled by the extreme gridlock in Washington. I think people already are concerned about excessive obstructionism that goes beyond principled disagreements, but becomes a systematic no to everything.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And when you then have — add to that a situation in which for the first time in anyone's memory you have the head of the Senate saying, I won't meet with a nominee; I won't provide a nominee a hearing; I will not provide a nominee a vote, and that, if, in fact, was maintained, would be the first time in the modern court where we would have a seat unfilled for over a year. That matters to people.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And so, you're right, Nina, that generally speaking, people aren't closely following Supreme Court cases unless you have a big seminal case like same-sex marriage come down. But people are following the fact that, increasingly, our political institutions are broken — and it troubles them. And this becomes I think a symbol of a process that, if Republicans stick to their current posture, promises a tit-for-tat process in which we will never have a clean nomination process on the merits, and presidents — whether they're Democrats or Republicans — are only going to be able to get their nominees through when they have their own party controlling the Senate.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "At that point, the judiciary becomes a pure extension of politics. And that damages people's faith in the judiciary — because everybody understands that there's some politics involved in appointing judges, but we also expect that the judicial system can rise above the political process.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And so I — we've seen already the surveys that say, number one, people are paying attention to this; and number two — it's not just Democrats, but a sizable number of Republicans who vote against me, have said this is — this can't be the way we run our government. And what's particularly ironic is the degree to which a number of people who say they're not going to nominate somebody, claim to be people who want fidelity to the Constitution, respect for our founders' intentions.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "There's nobody who would suggest that our founders anticipated that a new rule is read into the Supreme Court nomination process in which for an entire year, we don't do that because there's an election going on. George Washington nominated a couple of Supreme Court justices in his last year. And obviously George Washington had better poll numbers, I'm sure, than I did, but nevertheless if you care about original intent, I think, you know, you don't want to see this becoming — degenerating into just a pure political battle.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "So we've reported that Republican — leading Republican senators sent a message sort of back-channel: OK, if you appoint Merrick Garland, we — we still will oppose him now, but we would confirm him in the lame-duck session after the election if there's a Democratic president. Did that play any role in your decision?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "I have not had conversations like that.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "No, I didn't say you had.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "What I have seen are the public statements of leading Republicans like Orrin Hatch broadly complimenting Judge Garland as a brilliant, fair jurist, who should be confirmed to the Supreme Court.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "So did that play a role in your choosing him, the fact that Republicans really do like him?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Well, there's no doubt that what played a role, as I said earlier, was that, number one, I think he's the best person for the job. Number two, I think he's a consensus builder. And the court would benefit from that at the moment.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Justice Scalia was a larger-than-life figure, and he helped to shape the dialogue and the debate. But if you think about when the Supreme Court has been held in the highest esteem and has moved the country forward in the most powerful of ways, generally it hasn't been divided just along 5-4 votes. And Judge Garland, if you look at his work on the D.C. Circuit, has been able to bring together conservatives, liberals and move them to find common ground. And I think that's a valuable quality that has been reinforced by the statements that were made by Republicans.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "It certainly told me that this is somebody who is widely respected. And I said at the outset I would not use this appointment as a political symbol, as a way to score points, as a way to gin up my base.

He's not, you know, he's not going to — this is, this is our shot to really change the debate at the Supreme Court.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "What do you say to that — those folks?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Well, first of all what I would say is take a look at the appointments I've made since I've been president of the United States. I've appointed as many African-Americans to the Circuit Court as any president ever; more African-American women on the federal courts than any other president; more Hispanics, more Asian-Americans, more LGBT judges than any president in history.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "We actually now have a majority of women and/or minorities on the Circuit Courts, something that's never happened before. So my record of appointing a judiciary that reflects the country is unmatched.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "When it comes to the Supreme Court, I've appointed two women, one Hispanic. And in each case, the good news is that I appointed the person who I absolutely thought was the best person for the job. In this case, Merrick Garland is the best person for the job.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And I have confidence that — without knowing how he's going to decide any particular case — he's going to be somebody who understands the law, understands precedent, understands the Constitution; and possesses the values that recognize the unique role of the court in preserving our rights, preserving our liberties; and making sure that the powerful get a fair hearing, but that the powerless also are heard and have access to justice.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "Well, sometimes I just ask about family and background and what made you want to be a judge. You learn a lot just by talking to people about what their story is.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And when you hear Judge Garland's background — when you hear that story about him as a valedictorian speaker standing up for a fellow student who was about to be censored by the parents, when you hear about the care with which he dealt with the victims and the families who had been affected by the Oklahoma City bombing — you get a sense of who that person is. And I spent a lot of time on that.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "With respect to judicial philosophy, I have the advantage of having taught constitutional law, so I don't need to get into the weeds on their thinking on a lot of these cases — because I can just read their opinions and the quality of their work and I have a pretty good sense of how they approach cases.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "One thing I, I do ask them is how do they generally approach a problem where the text of the Constitution might be ambiguous. What do they do to — to understand either the meaning of the text, to what extent do they draw on historical data, to what extent do they draw on their sense of how society is dealing with that problem today? You know, so you'll get some sense of their judicial philosophy.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But most of the time, by the time they get to me, you know, they've probably gone through a confirmation process before. And they have a pretty good sense of what they can talk about and what they shouldn't talk about.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "But can you blame the Republicans who look at this nomination and say, There's going to be a shift in the court if we approve this nominee, and we don't like that shift in the court. So can you really blame them for trying to prevent a significant shift in the court, hoping that they'll win the presidential nomination [sic]. And if the shoe were on the other foot, wouldn't the Democrats do the same? They called — they're all already calling it the Biden rule.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Well, a couple of things. First of all, this speech that they continually quote from Joe Biden when he was on the Judiciary Committee — if you actually read the speech, number one, he was speaking hypothetically. [Cellphone rings]", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "Wow, Nina. You're supposed to turn off your phone.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "I'm not — I'm supposed to be a pro.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "I'm assuming you can just splice the question and I'll just answer it, so Nina doesn't have to answer — ask it again.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Well, first of all, if you look at what Joe Biden actually said many years ago, he was saying if, hypothetically, there were to be a Supreme Court opening, then his advice to a president in his last year would be to not make the nomination unless he had consulted widely and arrived at a consensus candidate.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Well, you know what? That's exactly what I've done. And so there's no contradiction between what I'm doing and what Joe Biden suggested a president in my circumstances should do.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Number two, with respect to my actions when I was a junior senator, you will recall that I never said that a nominee should not get a hearing. I never said that a nominee should not get a vote. And what I also said at the time was that I was concerned about some of Judge Alito's views that I considered more troubling. But in the case of Merrick Garland, we haven't seen a substantive argument against his jurisprudence.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "This is just raw politics. We don't want somebody who's been nominated by a Democrat — a claim that I would have never made at the time.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Now what is true, Nina, is, is that, you know, we have a divided court on a lot of important issues. Justice Scalia was a big figure who was viewed as providing a majority on conservative positions on some of the cases that came before the court. And so I understand the politics that Republican senators are dealing with, and the price they would pay if in fact they confirmed a nominee.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Here's the problem we have, though: If in fact we've gotten to the point where they can't confirm somebody because a Democratic president is nominating them, what's to stop them from saying next year, We've got another excuse for not confirming a Democratic president's nominee?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And at that point the process has broken down. Democrats have not been blameless in this process. You cannot point to me a circumstance in which Democrats have left a seat open when a Republican president was in office simply because they didn't like the possibility that it would change the makeup of the court.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Justice Kennedy was confirmed by Ronald Reagan, and I'm quite certain that there were a whole lot of Democratic senators who understood at the time that he was unlikely to favor their positions on a number of issues. But ultimately, he was confirmed. And he was confirmed in the last year of President Reagan's office. So we actually have evidence — we have proof, not that Democrats are perfect, but that they do at a certain point recognize that the process and the sanctity of the Supreme Court, and the integrity of the institution, not just the Supreme Court, but the integrity of the Senate, and the office of the president, requires them to do their job.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And my simple pitch to them is, be fair — not to ignore politics. I'm not demanding that Republicans vote for Merrick Garland, but do not stop the process in its tracks — because if you do, then the ever-escalating, ever-worsening problems behind not just judicial nominees, but nominations generally, are going to continue to make our government more and more dysfunctional. And at some point, it's got to stop.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "A good place for it to stop is when we're talking about a Supreme Court seat, and we have an impeccably qualified candidate who the Republicans themselves have acknowledged is deserving of being on the court.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Are you taking this on the road?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Well, you know, I'm going to make the case — I'm going to make the case for a fair process. Give Judge Garland a hearing; give him a vote. And look at the qualities of the man. That's what the American people expect. And, you know, one of the most puzzling arguments that I've heard from Mitch McConnell and some other Republicans is this notion that the American people should decide — we should let the American people decide, as part of this election, who gets to fill this seat.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Well in fact, the American people did decide, back in 2012 when they elected me president of the United States with sufficient electoral votes. And they also decided that the Republicans would be in the majority. They didn't say, We're going to decide that you're in charge for three years, and then in the last year you all take a break. They said, No, you're the president for four years, and Mr. McConnell, you're going to be the leader, because we've given you a majority in the Senate.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "So the American people already have decided. They've already weighed in. They will have another opportunity to weigh in, so that if there is another vacancy that comes up, the next president will fill that vacancy.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The bottom line is that there has not been a coherent argument presented. The real argument is the one that you made, Nina, which is that they don't want a Democrat filling the seat, and they are worried and scared about their political base punishing them if they allow a Democrat to fill the seat.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But one of the things that's broken down in our politics is a recognition that you don't always get your way 100 percent of the time. And sometimes in the integrity of the institution and the process and governance, and the interests of the American people actually matter more than your short-term politics. They actually matter more than doing what is politically expedient. And there have been a number of times where, as president of the United States, I've had to do things that I knew were bad politics but I understood were important to the country or important to the institution of the presidency.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And I would expect that the senators who've been elected by their constituents will find in themselves the kind of respect for this incredible democratic experiment that our founders crafted, that they're not going to want to see it continue to degenerate into just a bunch of poll-driven, negative-ad-driven, polarized name-calling, because that's not what made us the greatest country on Earth.", "label": 5}

So, there must be a universe for each different value. I conclude that we live in one of infinitely many universes – one for each value of the gravitational constant.

{"sentence": "And not only the constants can change from one universe to another, the locations of particles relative to each other can also be different. Since there are infinitely many universes in which to arrange the particles, some of these universes will be very similar to our own, just that eventually some initially tiny deviation will lead to an alternative history.

{"sentence": "The purpose of science is to explain observations. In theoretical physics, we use mathematics for that. Our theories need a set of assumptions plus a way to identify math objects with observables. But none of the assumptions should be unnecessary, a criterion known as Ockham's razor (named after the 13th century theologian and philosopher William of Ockham). Ockham's razor is extremely important — as without it you could literally add invisible gods and angels to any scientific theory.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "For centuries, progress in the foundations of physics has been characterized by simplification. Complex processes — such as the multitude of chemical reactions — turned out to arise from stunningly simple underlying equations. And simplicity carried us a long way. According to physicists' best theories today, everything in our universe emerges from merely 25 elementary particles and four types of forces.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "So, yes, simplicity — often in the form of unification — has been extremely successful. For this reason, many physicists want to further simplify the existing theories. But you can always simplify a theory by removing an assumption. Like the assumption that the gravitational constant has a some value that you inferred from observation (up to some precision). Or similar assumptions about, say, the values of the masses of elementary particles, or the cosmological constant, or the strength of the four forces. These are assumptions some theoreticians are now throwing out.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "If Ockham could see what physicists are doing here, he'd pray for God to bring reason back to Earth. You should remove unnecessary assumptions, alright. But certainly you shouldn't remove assumptions that you need to describe observations. If you do, you'll just get a useless theory, equations from which you can't calculate anything.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "These useless theories which lack assumptions necessary to describe observations are what we now call a multiverse. And they're about as useful as Ockham's prayers.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Since you cannot calculate anything in the multiverse, the assumptions which physicists removed must then be replaced with something else. That something else is a probability distribution on the multiverse, which tells you not what we do observe, but what we are likely to observe. But it is simpler to assume a constant than an infinite number of universes with a probability distribution over them. Therefore, Ockham's razor should shave off the multiverse. It's superfluous. Unfortunately, this argument carries little weight among many of today's theoretical physicists who value the multiverse because it excuses boundless speculation.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "There are a few cases where the invention of an infinite number of new universes gives rise to observable consequences. Everyone's favorite example is that our universe might, in the past, have collided with another universe, leaving correlated rings in the cosmic microwave background (see here). Another idea suggests that if we live in a multiverse, certain types of black holes are more likely (see here). But if such predictions are not confirmed, then this merely means we do not live in a multiverse with these particular properties.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Let me also add that these examples of predictive multiverses are ad hoc constructs invented for the very reason of convincing skeptics that some types of multiverses can have observable consequences. Don't fall for it. Just because a theory is falsifiable doesn't mean it's scientific. For a theory to be scientific its predictions must also have a reasonable chance to accurately describe reality. Construing up one of an infinite number of multiverse variants has no reasonable chance.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Theoreticians justify their multiverse research by claiming that it continues the noble quest for simplicity. But as we have seen, this argument is wrong because it neglects the need to introduce a probability distribution on the multiverse. The multiverse replaces a simple explanation with a more complicated one. Such a move is only justified if the added complication explains additional data, but for the multiverse that isn't so.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Why then has the idea become popular? A cynic may argue it's because the multiverse offers infinitely many new opportunities for paper writing. But I don't want to feign hypotheses.", "label": 5}

And then on the basis of that extended interview - and some of these interviews will go on for days - radio programs will be created.", "label": 5}

And in that case, I don't feel that particular experience because I do a performance which is similar to the radio programs that I present. And the audience seems to enjoy it.

{"sentence": "Enlarge this image H. Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStock/Getty Images H. Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStock/Getty Images", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "At a conference last week, I received an interesting piece of advice:", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The advice came from Brian Nosek, a fellow psychology professor and the executive director of the Center for Open Science. Nosek wasn't objecting to any particular claim I'd made — he was offering a strategy for pursuing better science, and for encouraging others to do the same.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "To understand the context for Nosek's advice, we need to take a step back — to the nature of science itself, and to a methodological revolution that's been shaking the field of psychology.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "You see, despite what many of us learned in elementary school, there is no single scientific method. Just as scientific theories become elaborated and change, so do scientific methods. The randomized controlled trial — which we now take for granted as a method for evaluating the causal efficacy of a drug — was a methodological innovation. Statistical significance testing — which is often taken for granted as a method for evaluating the probability that an outcome was due to chance alone — was a methodological innovation.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Triggered by a so-called replication crisis, the field of psychology has been actively engaged in a critical evaluation of our methods and how they ought to be improved. This has involved a close look at how psychological science is produced, evaluated, and published, alongside a shift in norms concerning how decisions about studies are made and reported.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "For example, many academic journals have moved away from a narrow focus on statistical significance testing to consider a broader range of statistical measures. And some journals now allow researchers to submit papers that undergo peer-review prior to data collection, thus ensuring that decisions about the study are not made after seeing the data, and that the evaluation of the paper is not based on whether the data fit in with reviewers' preferences or expectations. These, too, are methodological innovations.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But methodological reform hasn't come without some fretting and friction. Nasty things have been said by methodological reformers; nasty things have been said about methodological reformers. There have been victims (though who they are depends on whom you ask). Few people like public criticism, or having the value of their life's work called into question. On the other side, few people are good at voicing criticisms in kind and constructive ways. So part of the challenge is figuring out how to bake critical self-reflection into the culture of science itself, so it unfolds as a welcome and integrated part of the process, and not an embarrassing sideshow.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "In some ways, science is already the poster child for critical self-reflection. As a community, we actively try to falsify our own and other people's ideas. Peer-review is basically structured peer criticism, and the methodological innovations that fuel science come from science itself. But scientists are still humans and, like any human community, the scientific community can benefit from norms that make it easier to embrace our overarching values. These values include a commitment to seeking out and pursuing scientific methods that yield reliable conclusions — even as we use the tools of science to determine what those methods ought to be.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "So how can the scientific community better instantiate such norms? What, for example, does this mean for scientists conducting basic research?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "When Nosek recommended that I and other scientists assume that we are wrong, he was sharing a strategy that he's employed in his own lab — a strategy for changing the way we offer and respond to critique.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Assuming you are right might be a motivating force, sustaining the enormous effort that conducting scientific work requires. But it also makes it easy to construe criticisms as personal attacks, and for scientific arguments to devolve into personal battles. Beginning, instead, from the assumption you are wrong, a criticism is easier to construe as a helpful pointer, a constructive suggestion for how to be less wrong — a goal that your critic presumably shares.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "This advice may sound unduly pessimistic, but it's not so foreign to science. Philosophers of science sometimes refer to the pessimistic meta-induction on the history of science: All of our past scientific theories have been wrong, so surely our current theories will turn out to be wrong, too. That doesn't mean we haven't made progress, but it does suggest that there is always room for improvement and elaboration — ways to be less wrong.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "One worry about this approach is that it could be demoralizing for scientists. Striving to be less wrong might be a less effective prod than the promise of being right. Another concern is that a strategy that works well within science could backfire when it comes to communicating science with the public. This is a topic I've written about before: Without an appreciation for how science works, it's easy to take uncertainty or disagreements as marks against science, when in fact they reflect some of the very features of science that make it our best approach to reaching reliable conclusions about the world. Science is reliable because it responds to evidence: As the quantity and quality of our evidence improves, our theories can and should change, too.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Despite these worries, I like Nosek's suggestion because it builds in epistemic humility (there are things I do not know!) along with a sense that we can do better (there are things I do not know yet!). It also builds in a sense of community — we're all in the same boat when it comes to falling short of getting things right. Perhaps the focus on a shared goal — our goal as scientists and humans of being less wrong — can help compensate for any harms in scientific motivation or communication.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "I also like Nosek's advice because it isn't restricted to science. Striving to be less wrong — rather than more right — could be a beneficial way to construe our aims across a variety of contexts, whether it's a marital dispute or a business decision. I may be wrong about who did the dishes last night, or about which stock is the best investment; if I begin from the assumption that I'm fallible and striving to be less wrong, a challenge may not feel so threatening.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Unfortunately, this still leaves us with an untested psychological hypothesis: that assuming one is wrong can change community norms for the better, and ultimately support better science (and even, perhaps, better judgments and decisions in everyday life).", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "Yes, there's some energy for it on the left — some House Democrats have already said they will support the bill.

While Latinos are more than a quarter of U.S. box office, we're between 1 and 6% of the folks that are making decisions and making the movies and television shows here in Hollywood.

Warner Media's 150 has a scripted proof concept deal. Shine Global, a company here, has a development deal that they committed to for a documentary. And we will just continue making deals.

{"sentence": "People around the world watched in shock on Wednesday as thousands of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building, descending on the halls of Congress and postponing the vote that would make Joe Biden's election official. And while there was much to take in — windows shattered, Trump flags waving, a man with his boots up on Nancy Pelosi's desk — many were particularly struck by what they saw from police at the scene. The police force seemed quickly overwhelmed and unable to secure the Capitol. In some cases, officers were even criticized for appearing sympathetic to the will of the crowd.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Over and over in the news and on social media, people imagined how different — and likely more deadly — the police response would have been if those people lined up outside the barriers had been Black or brown. And that alternate scenario is raising complicated questions about what role the police can, and should, play in response to protests, riots and mobs.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But Alex Vitale, author of The End of Policing, says it's a mistake to boil Wednesday's events down to questions of police force and tactics. Rather, Vitale, who is a professor of sociology and coordinator of the Policing and Social Justice Project at Brooklyn College, says that, in addition to examining the role of the police in these incidents, we need to open up a broader conversation about race, politics and justice. (We'll be talking more about this, and other aspects of Wednesday's events, on the next episode of the Code Switch podcast.)", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "As you were watching the footage of what was going on at the Capitol Building on Wednesday, what were you noticing? What stood out to you?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Well, the thing that was most striking was the intense militancy of the crowd. The willingness of the demonstrators to engage in physical combat with the police — to fight with them over barricades, to fight with them with their own pepper spray and weapons. To see thousands of Americans engaged in violent attacks on police is extremely rare in American history. And that was deeply concerning to me.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "What do you think made the people on Wednesday feel empowered to confront the police in this violent way, as opposed to other situations?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "I think it's absolutely appropriate to talk about the racial disparities that are so crucial and so obvious. Mostly peaceful demonstrations, not just this summer, but over the last six years, calling for fundamental rethinking of our use of police and the status of African-Americans in our society have been met with very high levels of police violence, massive restrictions, criminal investigations, the labeling their movements as black identity extremists by federal law enforcement. The posture of police towards their demonstrations is entirely different. Cori Bush, a member of Congress newly elected from St. Louis, said if there had been Black and brown people pushing through police lines, running up the Capitol steps, people would have been shot down and at the very least, tear gassed and beaten. And I think that's absolutely correct.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And I think that the kind of angry white man, white supremacy at the center of the movement we saw yesterday is emboldened by their racial status. They feel like they have the right to engage in this kind of behavior. Clearly these white nationalists, extremists feel that they have the right to do this. And without having to worry about any consequences.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "One of the scenes that I saw yesterday seemed like a strange inversion of what we've seen at some of the other protests from the past year. An African-American police officer was basically chased up the stairs of the Capitol by a group of white people. And you could see in this video that he seemed perhaps afraid, but certainly questioning what to do in that moment, how much to react. He had a gun, which he seemed to reach for and didn't touch. Did you see that scene, and what did you make of it?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Yes, I did see that. So we've seen a handful of videos that have shown either the D.C. Metropolitan Police or the Capitol Police sort of giving way to the demonstrators. And this has been used to talk about their alleged affinity with the demonstrators or their complicity in this kind of right wing politics. And while I'm sure there are officers who were very sympathetic to the protests and we know there are officers who buy into a lot of these conspiracy theories, I think if we look a little bit more carefully at these videos, what we see is officers who were overwhelmed by an extremely violent and persistent crowd and are making a discretionary judgment about the use of force in a situation where they have lost control.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And I think if that African-American officer had started shooting people, then I think the national crisis we're experiencing right now would be worse. And we know that in one case, an officer did shoot someone to death, and I've seen those videos as well. This was someone trying to climb through a window into a more secure part of the Capitol. And a lone officer made the decision to kill someone rather than to allow them into this more secure part of the Capitol. And that, too, in my view, is a failure of policing.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "I've been hearing a lot is people saying, as you described, that the police were kind of letting this happen. That some police seemed sympathetic to what was happening. People described seeing some officers taking selfies with protesters. Do you think that's what was happening on a larger scale?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "No, I don't. If you look really at a broad array of these videos, you see police really fighting to keep these demonstrators out of the Capitol. Several officers were injured, some seriously.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Now, there was a failure of planning. There was a failure of deployment. There are ways that this could have been prevented. The fact that we got ourselves into this mess in the first place is the real problem. So, while there are clearly sympathies within law enforcement to the demonstrations, to the Trump administration, to the kinds of conspiracy theories that they are in league with, I don't think that that is the way to understand what happened.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "One of the things that I heard was people talking about the fact that the police weren't prepared for this moment. And people were contrasting that to, you know, the very geared up, militant looking police officers that were stationed around the Capitol during some of the Black Lives Matter protests over the summer. And whether that difference in preparation says a lot about who we expect to be violent and who we think of as a real threat in this country.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Police, before a demonstration, engage in threat assessments. They gather intelligence, they sit around in a room, sometimes in consultation with political leaders. And they make a threat assessment. One of the things we know from extensive research is that these threat assessments are colored by police world views, which means that threats from the left and threats from racial minorities are always exaggerated, and threats from the right and from white nationalist groups are always diminished.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "So that, you know, left the Capitol Police and the D.C. Metro Police unprepared to manage the level of extremist violence that they were confronted with, and that then puts individual officers or groups of officers in this kind of untenable situation.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Another theme that I saw coming out of all this was these different narratives about what to make of the way that police force was used. I saw some people saying, Look at this reaction, this is proof that the police are ineffective! Different people were saying, Look at this, we need police to be stronger and more prepared and have more weapons at their disposal. And then I saw other people saying that this is how police should respond to any situation, with the sort of calm and restraint that kept things escalating even more. What did you take from Wednesday's events? And what do you think other people should be considering?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "I think that it is a huge mistake, at the end of the day, to analyze this event in relationship to questions of policing. Because even if we had the perfect police deployment, and the Capitol was protected, [yesterday's violence] would have required high levels of force by police that would have just played into these existing polarizing narratives. It would have done nothing to resolve the underlying political problems, and might just have inflamed additional resentments. Which then just means police have more work to do.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "So, yes, the policing did not work. It both failed to protect the Capitol and used what I think is probably unnecessarily deadly force against people. It was a double failure. And then to the take away from that the message that, well, we just need to do more of that seems misguided. What we need is a real national reckoning about political responsibility for this mess we're in. And I think we're starting to move in that direction.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Just to put a finer point on it, where do you think the failures that led to yesterday stem from, and where do they need to be addressed?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "I think the real accountability for this rests with the Trump administration and his core supporters. [The election marked] a repudiation of this politics in the national political arena. But we have to continue that process, that those members of Congress who have supported this politics need to be voted out of office. And I think ultimately that is the most important form of accountability here, is the kind of popular rejection of this kind of white nationalist extremist politics. Trying to use the criminal justice system to fix those political problems is not the right way to go and is unlikely to be successful.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "It's not a simple solution and it doesn't happen very quickly, right? It's going to be two more years almost until we have another round of congressional elections. And so we have to sustain this analysis. We have to sustain this anger and indignation about what's happening. And we have to turn that into real political power. And to see members of Congress last night talking about using the Sedition Act against protesters as somehow the logical solution to this problem is a way of absolving their own responsibility for this mess.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The history of this is to turn what are essentially political problems over to the police to manage, whether it's mass homelessness or deep political divisions in our society or longstanding racial inequalities. The police are not capable of doing that. And to the extent that they attempt to do so, they often make those problems worse.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "I'm guessing there are a lot of people who might agree with what you're saying. But people who were also, in the moment, watching what was going on yesterday and having the sort of visceral reaction of: I want to see something happen. I want to see some consequences for people who feel like they have the right to just come in and storm the government and not fear any consequences.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Well, look, Americans are deeply committed to their retributive impulses. The United States has become a gigantic revenge factory. So obviously, people are falling back on these impulses — imagining justice as a question of punishment. Imagining that accountability is going to be measured in years of incarceration.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But that is not the only possible way to imagine these things, right? There is going to be accountability for this, which is that these movements are going to become politically isolated. The politicians who support them are going to become politically isolated. We're already seeing that happen. I think that this is going to be a turning point in the kind of extremist Trump ideology, and I think that the voters of Georgia helped cement this, because this problem didn't just emerge yesterday on Capitol Hill. This was in Charlottesville. This was in the streets of Portland, Oregon. This is an ongoing problem. And I think a majority of Americans have spoken clearly against this approach. And I think that trend is going to continue.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Many Black people, and more broadly, other people of color, are not really under the illusion that the police are going to keep them safe. But a lot of white people are. And a lot of white people, I think, see chaos or violence or what they perceive to be dangerous situations and think, I want a police force. I want something standing in the way of me and violence. The solutions that you're talking about and the kind of radical change that we're talking about are obviously going to take time. In the meantime, how much is that fear of violence a barrier?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "One of the major bulwarks of policing is not right wing extremists, it's centrist liberalism. It's the belief that what's most important is the production of order. And the willingness to to turn that problem over to police and the criminal legal system. And the kind of willful ignorance about what the consequences of that turning over are for the people who are subjected to it. So part of what's happening is a racial reckoning. That the folks who've been subjected to that system of order are unwilling to put up with it anymore.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And so this continues to be the problem: Whites who have benefited from this system of order continue to support order over justice. And what I think is being demanded in this moment is some courage. Some willingness to stare a little bit of disorder in the face. As a necessary part of producing a more just and ultimately more stable society, because, look, our state, our society, is a mess. The standards of living are declining for all but the richest. People are miserable. And to say that we need to hold on to that system at the expense of racial justice because it's less scary is a profound kind of cowardice.", "label": 5}

The Red Sox, as we all know, have had incredible racial problems from going back to - from 1945 up to the present. And I think that equally old with a new chapter is the response from a lot of the fans and a lot of the talking heads in the media responding to this by saying, well, you know, this is just a few bad apples. And why do we all get lumped into this? Well, because it's been happening for so long. And also to the players who play for the Red Sox.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "Hospitals are facing the new year with new requirements to post price information they have long sought to obscure: the actual prices they negotiate with insurers and the discounts they offer their cash-paying customers.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The move is part of a larger push by the Trump administration to use price transparency to curtail prices and create better-informed consumers. Yet there is disagreement on whether posting the prices for hospital services and procedures will actually achieve that goal.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "As of Jan. 1, the facilities must post on their websites prices for every service, drug and supply they provide. Next year, under a separate rule, health insurers must take similar steps. A related effort to force drugmakers to list their prices in advertisements was struck down by the courts.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "With the new hospital rule, consumers should be able to see the tremendous variation in prices for the exact same care among hospitals and get an estimate of what they will be charged for care — before they seek it.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The new data requirements go well beyond the previous rule of requiring hospitals to post their chargemasters — the hospital-generated list prices that bear little relation to what it costs a hospital to provide care. Also, few consumers or insurers actually pay those listed prices.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Instead, under the new rule put forward by the Trump administration, these are the real prices in health care, says Cynthia Fisher, founder and chairman of Patient Rights Advocate, a group that promotes price transparency.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Each hospital must post publicly online — and in a machine-readable format that is easy to process by computers — several prices for every item and service they provide: gross charges; the actual, and most likely far lower, prices they've negotiated with insurers, including de-identified minimum and maximum negotiated charges; and the cash price they offer patients who are uninsured or not using their insurance.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "In addition, each hospital must also post, in a consumer-friendly format, the specific costs for 300 common and shoppable services, such as having a baby, getting a joint replacement, having a hernia repaired or undergoing a diagnostic brain scan.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Those 300 bundles of procedures and services must total all costs involved — from the hardware used to the operating room time, to drugs given and the fees of hospital-employed physicians — so patients won't have to attempt the nearly impossible job of figuring it out themselves.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Hospitals can mostly select which services fall into this category, although the federal government has dictated 70 that must be listed — including certain surgeries, diagnostic tests, imaging scans, new patient visits and psychotherapy sessions.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "No. At best, these are ballpark figures.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Other factors influence consumers' costs, like the type of insurance plan a patient has, the size and remaining amount of the annual deductible on their health plan, and the complexity of their medical problem.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "Zack Cooper, an associate professor of public health and economics at Yale, doubts that the data alone will make much of a difference for most consumers.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "It's not likely that my neighbor — or me, for that matter — will go on and look at prices and, therefore, dramatically change decisions about where to get care, Cooper says.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Some cost information is already made available by insurers to their enrollees, particularly out-of-pocket costs for elective services, but most people don't consult it, he says.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "That could be because many consumers carry types of insurance in which they pay flat-dollar copayments for such things as doctor visits, drugs or hospital stays — payments that have no correlation to the underlying charges.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Still, the information may be of great interest to the uninsured and to the increasing number of Americans with high-deductible plans, in which they are responsible for hundreds or even thousands of dollars in costs annually before the insurer begins picking up the bulk of the cost.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "If I have a $10,000 deductible plan and it's December and I'm not close to meeting that, I may go to a hospital and try to get the cash price, Nation says.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Employers, however, may have a keen interest in the new data, says James Gelfand, senior vice president at the ERISA Industry Committee, which lobbies on behalf of large employers that offer health insurance to their workers. Employers will want to know how much they are paying each hospital compared with others in the area and how well their insurers stack up in negotiating rates, Gelfand says.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "For some employers, he says, it could be eye-opening to see how hospitals cross-subsidize by charging exorbitant amounts for some things and minimal amounts for others.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The rule puts that all into the light, says Gelfand. When an employer sees these ridiculous prices, for the first time they will have the ability to say no. That could mean rejecting specific prices or the hospital entirely.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Typically, employers can't or won't limit workers' choices by outright cutting a hospital from an insurance network. More likely, they may use the information to create financial incentives to use the lowest-cost facilities, says Anderson at Johns Hopkins.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "If I'm an employer, he says, I'll look at three hospitals in my area and say, 'I'll pay the price for the lowest one. If you want to go to one of the other two, you can pay the difference.' ", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Will price transparency reduce overall health spending?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Revealing actual negotiated prices, as this rule requires, may push the more expensive hospitals in an area to reduce prices in their future bargaining talks with insurers or employers, potentially lowering health spending in those regions.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "It could also go the other way, with lower-cost hospitals demanding a raise, driving up spending.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Bottom line: Price transparency can help, but the market power of the various players might matter more.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "In some places, where there may be one dominant hospital, even employers who know they are getting ripped off may not feel they can cut out a big, brand-name facility from their networks, no matter the price, Anderson says.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Is the rule change a done deal?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The hospital industry went to court, arguing that parts of the rule go too far, violating their First Amendment rights and also unfairly forcing hospitals to disclose trade secrets. That information, the industry says, can then be used against them in negotiations with insurers and employers.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia disagreed with the hospitals and upheld the rule, prompting an appeal by the industry. On Dec. 29, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia affirmed that lower court decision and did not move to block enforcement of the rule.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "Apart from the litigation, the AHA says it plans to talk with the incoming Biden administration to try to persuade them there are some elements to this rule and the insurer rule that are tricky, says Tom Nickels, an executive vice president of the trade group. We want to be of help to consumers, but is it really in people's best interest to provide privately negotiated rates?", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "We're telling states today that they should open vaccinations to all of their most vulnerable people. That is the most effective way to save lives now, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said at a press briefing Tuesday.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The call is accompanied by a change in how vaccine doses are allocated to states. Currently, doses are given to states based on their total adult populations.

{"sentence": "Because we now have a consistent pace of production, we can now ship all of the doses that had been held in physical reserve, Azar said. We're now making the full reserve of doses we have available for order, [and] we are 100% committed to ensuring a second dose is available for every American who receives the first dose.", "label": 5}

Democratic governors and lawmakers have both urged the Trump administration in recent days to make changes to the distribution to improve the speed of the process.", "label": 5}

I no longer wanted to amuse myself with submissions from the slush pile, or continue filing author contracts and royalty statements in places where they did not belong, like my desk drawer. My freelance work, proofreading and copyediting manuscripts for a small press, was also waning in volume, because I had recently broken up with the editor who assigned it to me. The relationship had been stressful, but reliably consuming: the editor, several years my senior, had talked about marriage but wouldn't stop cheating.

An online superstore that had gotten its start in the nineties by selling books on the World Wide Web—not because the founder had a love of literature, but because he had a love of consumers, and consumptive efficiency—had expanded to become a digital bargain basement dealing in appliances, electronics, groceries, mass fashion, children's toys, cutlery, and various nonnecessities manufactured in China. Having conquered the rest of retail, the online superstore had returned to its roots and seemed to be experimenting with various ways to destroy the publishing industry. It had even gone so far as to start its own publishing imprints, which my literary friends scorned and derided as cheesy and shameless. We ignored the fact that we had many reasons to be grateful to the website, as the publishing industry was being kept afloat by bestselling novels about sadomasochism and vampires who fucked, hatched in the incubator of the online superstore's marketplace for self-published e-books. Within a few years, the founder, a chelonian ex–hedge funder, would become the wealthiest person in the world and undergo a montage-worthy makeover, but at the time we weren't thinking about him. All that mattered to us was that the site was responsible for half of all book sales, which meant it had wrested control of the most important levers: pricing and distribution.

I hated the bit at the beginning where you don't really look pregnant. You just look like you've let yourself go. You look like you've had too many Greggs or something. I liked that bit where I looked discernibly pregnant, and, like, my tits went really massive and I was a bit, like, that felt like quite sexy. I was like, Hey, yeah. I'm just carrying a child. It was really nice having nice hair. It was wavy and long. And there was more of it. And I had beautiful nails. That was really nice. The come down from that, not so nice. But I'd say, the middle of the pregnancy is a really great time, because you're still feeling really comfortable and you get all the benefits of the hormones kicking in. So that was awesome. The first time I was pregnant, I didn't get stretch marks until the last month. With him it was way more challenging on my body. I put on more weight.

And then you slowly start seeing it change, which is fine, because you're growing a human being. But when you finally give birth and then you're left with this new body that you took — it took you 30 years to accept and to love and to figure out and figure out what works and doesn't work and all of a sudden, it's a completely different body. I think that's where my issues with giving birth came from. Not being able to wear your own clothes sounds trivial. But actually, just is another thing that really makes you not feel like yourself. And it's one of the things that makes your life legible to you. Feeling my boyfriend slightly recoil from me, like on a sexual level. Like he would probably object to that word, but feeling that shift of his perception of me as no longer a sexual being, he was like, I don't want to cover you in spunk, I want to look after you.

For me, it wasn't really bouncing back into my normal intimate life with my husband. That took long, long time and I think two bottles of wine. But I mean, I'm talking about like seven months I think. The last couple of weeks of being pregnant, I lost all sensation in my hands. So one after another, all 10 fingertips went numb. It's some syndrome where your wrists swell up so much that the nerves that go through your wrist stop sending the impulses through from your fingertips. I think it took probably more than two to three months for sensation to come back in my hands. If you can't feel what you're doing, it's a very weird thing to be taking care of a very little child.

It would have been really nice to just be told, it's going to be almost as if you were going to die. Post-surgery recovery, that was a lot longer than I thought.

In the wake of the 1987 stock-market crash, landlords in the financial district rezoned their old skyscrapers for residential occupancy, and more than 20 towers were landmarked, including the ornate Standard Oil building at 26 Broadway and the home of Delmonico's at 56 Beaver Street. Battery Park City flowered; yuppies priced out of Tribeca came down to Wall Street; a new Guggenheim, designed by a fresh-out-of-Bilbao Frank Gehry, nearly arose by South Street Seaport.

With transgender rights in the news, this big group show on the concepts of trans and queer in art is ideally timed.

Trans is defined by the idea that the boundaries of gender (and race, and class) are porous, and that crossings in any direction are negotiable. Queer is even more category-averse.

Just over half of the gun possession cases brought citywide in 2014 resulted in a conviction, officials said. A third were dismissed, and in 10 percent of cases, district attorneys declined to prosecute. The big challenge on these gun cases is that the officer has to be able to articulate at a hearing how they were able to find this weapon, one law enforcement official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the plan before the announcement. Often the weapons are concealed in someone's jacket, coat, waistband, and they have to articulate what their basis was for the approach. A lot of these cases fall on the search.", "label": 6}

Evans, who is now a marketing consultant, wanted to be an actress, and although she had heard rumors about Weinstein, she let him have her number.

Before long, an assistant called to set up a daytime meeting at the Miramax office in Tribeca, first with Weinstein and then with a casting executive, who was a woman. I was, like, Oh, a woman. Great. I feel safe, Evans said. When Evans arrived for the meeting, the building was full of people. She was led to an office with exercise equipment in it and takeout boxes on the floor. Weinstein was there, alone. Weinstein told her that she'd be great in Project Runway, — the show, which Weinstein helped produce — but only if she lost weight.

I can't speak to whether or not those complaints were valid, but Rosenthal's boss is Cy Vance, the Manhattan prosecutor, the same one who had been criticized for not prosecuting Weinstein in 2015.

The president is fixated on his loss in Georgia, an obsession that can be explained by two powerful and concurrent motivations — one psychological, one impelled by calculation and grounded in political reality, people close to him said. For starters, Mr. Trump simply cannot believe he lost a once-red Southern state — and cannot comprehend that his own unpopularity hastened a political realignment already taking place in the swing state. At the same time, he is very much in touch with the reality that he holds sway over party's right wing, and sees the runoff as a valuable moment of final political leverage as president. Over the past week, he has whipsawed from supporting the Senate candidates, albeit tepidly, to griping about the legality of the runoffs, far more passionately.

Efforts to involve the U.S. armed forces in resolving election disputes would take us into dangerous, unlawful and unconstitutional territory, they wrote. Civilian and military officials who direct or carry out such measures would be accountable, including potentially facing criminal penalties, for the grave consequences of their actions on our republic. Retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser whom Mr. Trump recently pardoned, suggested on the conservative television network Newsmax last month that Mr. Trump could use the military to rerun the election in swing states, and later attended a meeting with the president at the White House. The former defense secretaries also called for cooperation at the Pentagon during the transition between administrations, an issue that President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his team have complained about. Last week, Mr. Biden said his transition team had faced obstruction from the Defense Department. In the op-ed, the former defense secretaries noted that transitions can be a moment when the nation is vulnerable to actions by adversaries seeking to take advantage of the situation, and they said it was critical that the transition at the Pentagon be carried out fully, cooperatively and transparently.", "label": 6}

Credit Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times WASHINGTON — Democrats returned Representative Nancy Pelosi of California to the House speakership on Sunday for what may be her final term, handing a tested leader control of the slimmest majority in almost two decades as Washington prepares for a new Democratic president. The nearly party-line vote punctuated an opening day marked more by precaution than pomp, as the 117th Congress convened under the threat of a deadly pandemic and awaited a pair of Senate runoffs in Georgia that will determine control of that chamber. Several House members sick with Covid-19 missed the session altogether and others cast their votes from behind a plexiglass enclosure specially constructed in a gallery overlooking the chamber. Her victory means that after two years as President Trump's most outspoken antagonist, Ms. Pelosi will now be responsible for trying to shepherd through Congress as much of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s agenda as possible. Scripture tells us that to everything, there is a season: a time for every purpose under the heavens; a time to build, a time to sow, a time to heal, she said in a speech after winning the speakership.

Biden Jr.'s incoming national security adviser said on Sunday that the new administration would move quickly to renew the last remaining major nuclear arms treaty with Russia, even while seeking to make President Vladimir V. Putin pay for what appeared to be the largest-ever hacking of U.S. government networks. In an interview on GPS on CNN, Jake Sullivan, who at 44 will become the youngest national security adviser in more than a half century, also said that as soon as Iran re-entered compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal — which he helped negotiate under President Barack Obama — there would be a follow-on negotiation over its missile capabilities. In that broader negotiation, we can ultimately secure limits on Iran's ballistic missile technology, Mr. Sullivan said, and that is what we intend to try to pursue through diplomacy. He did not mention that missiles were not covered in the previous accord because the Iranians refused to commit to any limitations on their development or testing.

{"sentence": "So when you're talking about the idea of worldwide, these local language originals like Barbarians from Germany, it's the top non-English show in the US for 2020. Money Heist, it's season four from Spain. Through its first 28 days, 65 million households chose to watch the show. Dark Desire from Mexico, July 2020, 35 million households in the first 28 days. When you're thinking about this idea, because Netflix used to break up content by markets, why is it significant that you're overseeing everything in Netflix global slate?", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "So I think for consumers, big picture, to really look at holistic programming slate is really great and making trade offs and making sure we're programming a wide breadth of tastes and types of shows, because we subtitle in 37 languages. We dub in 34 languages. So there's access to this. And so I think to be able to tell stories from all different kinds of countries in all different languages and export it to the world. So traditionally, Hollywood, the U.S. lands in Hollywood exported content around the world.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "Exported. And that was how people watched. Now on our platform, we're exporting content, storytelling all over the world. And I think people talk about representation a lot, and more so, I think, this year finally. But people talk about representation a lot. It's so personally rewarding, but just, I think, for consumers amazing that we're telling these stories from all over the world. And I don't think people — I'm not sure everybody realizes the amount — the power of that storytelling from all over the world and the amount of the big — like there's a big audience that watches so many shows not in English.", "label": 6}

{"sentence": "Local storytellers in front of, behind the camera, in their language that gets exported day and day around the world that day. And it's a global launch. So the reach of that. So during this year, during Covid, global pandemic year, the increase of non-English viewing was up 50%. The increase of K-dramas tripled, from Korean dramas, K-dramas. And anime had 100% increase. So it's just interesting to see the discovery of different types of shows told —", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "It also could be a response to the fact that Netflix has 73 million subscribers in the U.S. — very impressive — and Canada. A lot of people feel like it's approaching saturation. Also, half the revenue is now coming from abroad. Would you say the U.S. is its market now? When you're talking about this import export, the idea it was Hollywood exported, and except for perhaps the Indian market which has a very vibrant internal market there, has that changed utterly? Do you feel like that's the way it's going to go now?", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "There's room to grow in the U.S. There's still room to grow there. I do think there is a lot of room to grow outside of the U.S. still. And in Latin America, we started making originals five years ago. And this year, we launched our Africa slate. India was a few — like three years ago. So there's still more room to grow in many of these other countries. And I think big picture, U.S. is 5% of the world's population. We have over 190 million members. So there's definitely room to grow outside of the U.S. But I do think there's still room to grow here. And Hollywood has been the dream factory. Amazing writers, great shows come out of here. So that's not going away. But I do think when you think about something like Indian Matchmaker — Indian Matchmaker, which I'm not sure people realize is that I greenlight that show because to me, it was just a show in the U.S. I didn't greenlight it for the India team. It really was, oh, interesting matchmaker, a way to explore marriage, dating, relationships. So that was something that I just bet on. Isn't this just fascinating? It's subculture. It's a culture I know well clearly. But I think there were interesting things in there that people would be fascinated by. But again, I don't look any of it to purposefully feel like, oh, are we making a global show? It's just, are we making the best vision of that show?", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "And if that vision is true and it's great, it'll connect. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Sway.", "label": 6}

You'll be able to catch up on Sway episodes you may have missed, like my conversation with Warner Media C.E.O. Jason Kiler. And you'll get new ones delivered directly to you. More with Bela Bajaria after this break. [MUSIC PLAYING] Netflix made headlines the past year by signing splashy contracts with Shonda Rhimes, Ryan Murphy, paying them hundreds of millions of dollars for the privilege of featuring their shows. It's sort of changing the economics of these relationships which relied heavily on back end deals. So reviews have been mixed for some of the big creators. I know you have Bridgerton coming, which looks fantastic, by Shonda Rhimes.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "So exciting. It's so — it delivers on what you hope and imagine it would be.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "It looks very juicy. It looks very Shonda Rhimes, is all I'll say. How are these going versus, say, people that aren't as well known? Because a lot of your shows are people that aren't well known?", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "So overall deals have been around for a long time. This is not new to Netflix. They've been part of the business. I ran a studio with many overall deals. And so I'm very familiar with the deals and the relationship and what that is. I think overall deals are also — have always historically been a long-term investment. It's not a short-term thing. You usually start a relationship and build this and really look at the slate long term strategically. And it's also a very small percentage of our content budget. It gets outsized attention about the overall deals. So I think it's still early days with some of these deals. And I think we always have a mix of big, very experienced creators. Many times we have shows with other new voices that sometimes are supervised by other people. And we just have a mix of shows because we want a wide variety of shows.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "Do you see yourself doing big deals around the world with big names creators, or is it like creative retreads like Cobra Kai? I love Cobra Kai. It's the best thing ever. And it looks like you spent $12 on set design and everything else.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "So yes, I think it's just a wide variety of shows. The slates are very diverse in all of these countries. In Spain, we have a relationship with Álex Pina who did La Casa de Papel — Money Heist. And we have a deal with him there. But it really is just a wide range of shows. We did How to Sell Drugs Online in Germany with writers who had never done a scripted show before. And that became a big hit. So it's a wide range of very known filmmakers in many countries where there's a very robust film community. It's been filmmakers turning to episodic television for the first time in certain places. We have over 190 million members in 190 countries. It has to be a wide range of types of shows, and documentaries, and unscripted, and lots of other things.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "But you are heading into streaming wars. I think there's — it's very clear. There's Disney, there's HBO Max, whatever Apple is going to do, whatever they're all going to do, Amazon. What is your best pitch to creators in other places right now in this new environment?", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "Competition has been around for a long time and Blockbuster and Hotstar. And there's been Sky. There's been a lot of competition. And there's also room for many people to grow at the same time. While we've grown, HBO has grown, and Amazon has grown. And other people are going to grow because it's not zero-sum. The thing is, though, I feel like it's smart to know what your competitors are doing but not spend so much time on it, because I think it's hard to move forward if you're always looking over your shoulder.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "Yeah, but what's your biggest worry as they enter the market? Because eventually, they're going to get the technology right. They're not going to be as good as you are, but they'll get it right on some level. And then it's just down to what you had, because I subscribe to all the services, every one of them. And I subscribe for the shows, really, not the networks. I don't think of — although Netflix tends to have more shows I like at this moment, it doesn't mean they will. And I know my kids are often on Disney+ because they like all those Marvel movies. What's your biggest worry as they enter the market? Is it their I.P.? Because Warner makes movies. Disney makes movies. That's their main business. They're not selling toilet paper like Jeff Bezos.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "So the advantage that Disney definitely has, and even Warner Brothers, they've been at this for a long time — 100 years. They've been at it for a long time. They have I.P. They have catalog. They have those franchises. And for us, we've been in it for seven years and making original content. So now we have Stranger Things. And we have The Witcher. And we're growing our own, hopefully, I.P., and franchises, and original content. And so we're going to continue to do that around the world. Money Heist, La Casa de Papel definitely franchise for the company and growing what that is. So I think for us, it's to continue to do that. And again, creators have great experience. And then you hope you get their repeat business. They come back to work with you again. And I think for all of us, it really — you have to win, just like you're saying about what you watch, the consumer every day. Next year, I hope we still have more shows that you like than somebody else has. And I do think ultimately competition is good for consumers because I do think it keeps all of us trying to make the best shows, pushing forward, taking risks on content still. So I do think net net, it's great to have competition.", "label": 6}

{"sentence": "OK, smart. About getting new voices in Hollywood, Hollywood's been going through a big reckoning with its bad history with gender, and race, and so much other things. You're a woman, a person of color in a position of real power to make change in one of the biggest streaming companies. I've heard a lot of people say you talk about being an outsider a little bit. You often — you have said this here, telling people you're the only brown girl in the room. And people at first ignored you. And you see it as an asset. How do you see that shaking out?", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "It's a conversation that I think you have to be open to having. And there's many people on our content teams who are very passionate about more representation, about diverse stories, about different points of views. The one thing that I do talk about is sometimes people talk about these underrepresented groups. And it's this show to the side or this little show, but it'll be important to that group. I want to do big shows that have underrepresented voices and people. They can be big, and they can be commercial. And we want those shows to be seen, and talked about, and heard. So I think it's important. Netflix has done a great job in representation with Orange Is the New Black, and Never Have I Ever, and many other shows. And it is rewarding that we get to do it from all different countries and all different — with many representation from all over the world that everybody gets to see. And I do think that builds cultural affinity in many ways of seeing different people and seeing different stories. But I think it's something we just have to continue to do.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "It's been a perceived strength of Netflix, the diversity in its programming, reaching out to fresh voices, younger voices, different voices. This is something they can do. Is Hollywood too Hollywood-centric when you think about it? Because they do — they're kind of local. They're local in how they think, a lot of these studios, still.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "I think sometimes it depends on executives sitting in the seats. Who can greenlight a show? Who is going to champion and advocate for that show? Do you have enough executives? Are you giving shots, which — to enough creators that — oh, they haven't — it's always that chicken and egg. Oh, they don't have experience. Well, they can't get experience because you have to give them the shot to get the experience. In another company that I worked at, there was — we had bought an Indian sitcom, a family show, a family comedy that happened to be an Indian family. And somebody had said — a few people said to me, but we already have one. We already have one in development. And I said, so out of 100 things, we can't have two Indian? We already — so I think that, pushing back on that kind of thinking. And I think it depends on Hollywood executives sitting in those seats and taking a risk. You're going to have to give people a shot.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "So when you get that, when you have that, when here you are in a position of power, do you feel like you — I've had lots of women executives in tech. But they always say, I have to be the one to speak up. Do you feel that's too much burden on you? Do you use up your capital? Because there is capital in Hollywood. There is only so far if you don't get along. Or maybe that's changed.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "No. Look, I think I'm lucky in the sense that my whole life, I pushed back against a lot of gender norms of being Indian. And you should behave like this. And this is what should happen. And so I feel like I have been pushing back on, where are those boundaries? And where can I push through? And it's something which can be annoying to or used to be annoying to my family. But there is a lot of these questions and pushing back and saying it, so — because I don't think people are resistant to it. They're just more embarrassed. I had a script. There was a script that was given to me at some point in another company. And I said, you don't have any diverse characters in here. So they said, look, the security guard, the DJ, and the housekeeper. And I just said —", "label": 6}

Or I thought that went — oh, I just see this group differently than they do. And they were more embarrassed because they didn't even see it. And so I think it's a responsibility. And by the way, and I feel like I have really pushed myself at every level. So now people go, oh, you're in this job. So you can do it. But it's not just this job. It had to be the job before, and the job before, and the job before that to be able to bring it up at every level.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "When you say, OK, there's only — we can't have two Indian shows — I've heard that on boards. We can't have two women on boards. We've got one, kind of thing. When you think about that, can we have more than one top Indian woman executive? Do you feel that pressure, because it's still, when you look across the broad landscape of Hollywood, it's mighty white, and it's mighty male?", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "And it's interesting in your own personal career. You have this interest, this ambition, this drive, all of these things. And what you don't realize is many other people have been watching you along the way. And I didn't realize it until much later when Indian kids would reach out to me, or somebody said, I did it because you did it. And you don't realize that because that's not what I set out to do in any way. But I'll steal a Kamala Harris line of, I may be the first, but I'm definitely not going to be the last.

Ideally, that would have happened because Jeffery was already in decline and coming off foot surgery.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Instead, the Eagles kept Jeffery, even as he missed eight games to start the season. He has just six catches for 115 yards in seven games. Roseman also traded for DeSean Jackson in the spring of 2019. He will end up playing in only eight of a possible 33 games.", "label": 7}

Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So, instead, it burns fat. The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that aren't always positive.

And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well.

You may be thinking: what else is there to eat? The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go. That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally.

Bittman, as his book title suggests, advocates eating vegan before 6 p.m. An easier way to ease into this diet is by doing a few meatless days a week, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, the author of The Flexitarian Diet and a registered dietitian, until you reach the top tier, which is five meatless days a week.", "label": 7}

An extraordinarily simplified version of his theory is that lectins in the plants cause confusion in the immune system and inflammation. An extraordinarily dramatized version of his theory is that plants are waging war against us so we don't eat them and we're too dumb to adjust our diets.

{"sentence": "There's nothing quite like hotel room service. Be it an indulgence or a necessity, few things seem better suited to serve a jet-lagged traveler than a freshly delivered breakfast tray or a late-night sandwich. While seasoned road warriors may have their room service routines down to a science, many of us pause before picking up the phone to order. Maybe it's the fact that room service food can seem incredibly expensive, take forever to get to the room and is often tepid and less than tasty when it finally arrives. Here are five myths about room service.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "1. Room service menu prices are identical to those in the hotel's restaurant.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "It sure doesn't seem that way. John Mariani, the legendary food critic and author of Mariani's Virtual Gourmet Newsletter , says that they are usually somewhat higher plus they add a massive service charge and very often, a gratuity.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Larry Olmsted, author of the bestselling Real Food Fake Food, falls into that higher-priced camp as well, noting that in many cases, the exact same dishes are priced higher on the room service menu than in the hotel restaurants.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "The culprit may be the add-ons that make room service seem like an expensive indulgence.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Alexander Lobrano, a Paris-based food writer and restaurant critic whose newsletter is Hungry for Paris, says that room service prices aren't usually that far off those of prices in the restaurant.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "He insists that it is those extras that can make for an expensive tab when you order that club sandwich or bowl of pasta and have it sent up to your room. What drives the prices up is the fine print of service charges, tray charges and other ways of making you pay for the pleasure of private dining, something that most hotels have pretty much fallen out of love with because it's logistically complicated.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Those fees, add Olmsted, might include a service fee comparable to what you would tip downstairs, plus an 'in-room dining' surcharge, often in the $5-12 range, means it almost always costs more to dine in.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "2. Room service food is just as fresh as I'd get in the restaurant.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Ah, not exactly. Lobrano points out that most room service items are at least partially pre-prepared, since the room service kitchen or area of a larger kitchen dedicated to room service needs to work ahead of time. And if you really want to see what's pre-prepared or dead easy to slap together, study the night owl room service menu, since those are designed so that anyone can prepare their dishes easily.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Mariani agrees, noting that whatever is being made is usually not made from the same quality of ingredients. For example, it will be chicken roll versus freshly roasted chicken. Or it has been prepped in advance as much as possible. There is usually a separate brigade of cooks, most of whom loathe being on room service duty, especially at 3 a.m.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "The freshness debate aside, there's also the very important matter of what it tastes like when it arrives. Olmsted says it might be made just as fresh but it is practically guaranteed to take longer to reach you, meaning it is far more likely to be cold. And in most cases your entire meal is served at once versus one course at a time, exacerbating this problem.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "3. You must tip the hotel employee who delivers room service.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Every hotel is different but what doesn't change is being vigilant in examining the bill. It's often a three-tiered system of service add-ons, starting with an extra room service fee that is not negotiable. Then there's a gratuity that may be automatically added, often in the vicinity of 18%. That may or may not be negotiable. Then there's a blank line for a tip, which is essentially a second chance to tip on the room service charge. It all adds up fast.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "The problem, says Olmsted, is that with a built-in gratuity, you never know whether the staffer actually gets it. You certainly do not need to tip when two fees are added, service charge plus delivery charge, but I usually do it anyway to avoid guilt.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "So does Lobrano, who says that I'd always rather err on the side of generosity than caution when it comes to tipping.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Travel tipping guide: Who gets what?", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "4. Room service won't do special orders.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "They may like you to order off the menu, but hotel kitchens can accommodate you better than you might think. As a rule of thumb, room service is generally only offered at better hotels, and just like better restaurants, they will usually accommodate customers as best they can.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "The solution may be to keep it simple, says Lobrano, who says that I find most room service kitchens are happy to oblige a request for simpler food than what's found on their menu. To wit, a good grilled cheese sandwich with some soup, or spaghetti with just butter, Parmesan and a squirt of lemon juice.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "5. Hotels restrict food delivery services to encourage guests to use room service.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Many hotels now freely allow food deliveries from outside the hotel. In fact, in less expensive hotels, there are often restaurant delivery brochures in guest rooms. Of course, the dirty secret that the more expensive hotels don't want to 'fess up to is that outside delivery is typically far cheaper than the room service they have on offer. But hotels discourage it for other reasons besides lost revenue.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "For security reasons, many big-city hotels don't want their corridors filled with food deliverers and are also wary of the mess that ordered-in food leaves behind, Lobrano says. But an increasing number of business hotels will allow food delivery, and I find the best way to sway an undecided front desk is to say I'll eat my ordered-in meal in the bar with a glass of their wine — no one's ever refused this request.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "By now you've probably heard about the cryptocurrency craze.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Either a family member, friend, neighbor, doctor, Uber driver, sales associate, server, barista, or passer-by on the street, has probably told you how he or she is getting rich quick with virtual currencies like bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, or one of the lesser-known 1,300-plus investable cryptocurrencies.", "label": 7}

Just sticks and stones examples of how today's cryptocurrencies work, what they're ultimately trying to accomplish, and how they're being valued.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Simply put, cryptocurrencies are electronic peer-to-peer currencies. They don't physically exist. You can't pick up a bitcoin and hold it in your hand, or pull one out of your wallet. But just because you can't physically hold a bitcoin, it doesn't mean they aren't worth anything, as you've probably noticed by the rapidly rising prices of virtual currencies over the past couples of months.", "label": 7}

It's worth noting that the barrier to entry is particularly low among cryptocurrencies. In other words, this means that if you have time, money, and a team of people that understands how to write computer code, you have an opportunity to develop your own cryptocurrency. It likely means new cryptocurrencies will continue entering the space as time passes.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Technically, the idea of an electronic peer-to-peer currency was being tinkered with decades ago, but it wasn't truly successful until 2008, when bitcoin was conceived. The basis of bitcoin's creation, and all virtual currencies that have since followed, was to fix a number of perceived flaws with the way money is transmitted from one party to another.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "What flaws? For example, think about how long it can take for a bank to settle a cross-border payment, or how financial institutions have been reaping the rewards of fees by acting as a third-party middleman during transactions. Cryptocurrencies work around the traditional financial system through the use of blockchain technology.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "OK, what the heck is blockchain?", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Blockchain is the digital ledger where all transactions involving a virtual currency are stored. If you buy bitcoin, sell bitcoin, use your bitcoin to buy a Subway sandwich, and so on, it'll be recorded, in an encrypted fashion, in this digital ledger. The same goes for other cryptocurrencies.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Think of blockchain technology as the infrastructure that underlies virtual coins. It's the foundation of your home, while the tethered virtual coin represents all the products built on top of that foundation.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Why is blockchain a potentially better choice than the current system of transferring money?", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Blockchain offers a number of potential advantages, but is designed to cure three major problems with the current money transmittance system.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "First, blockchain technology is decentralized. In simple terms, this just means there isn't a data center where all transaction data is stored. Instead, data from this digital ledger is stored on hard drives and servers all over the globe. The reason this is done is twofold: 1.) it ensures that no one person or company will have central authority over a virtual currency, and 2.) it acts as a safeguard against cyberattacks, such that criminals aren't able to gain control of a cryptocurrency and exploit its holders.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Secondly, as noted, there's no middleman with blockchain technology. Since no third-party bank is needed to oversee these transactions, the thought is that transaction fees might be lower than they currently are.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Finally, transactions on blockchain networks may have the opportunity to settle considerably faster than traditional networks. Let's remember that banks have pretty rigid working hours, and they're closed at least one or two days a week. And, as noted, cross-border transactions can be held for days while funds are verified. With blockchain, this verification of transactions is always ongoing, which means the opportunity to settle transactions much more quickly, or perhaps even instantly.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "How are transactions verified on a blockchain?", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "You might be wondering how these blockchain transactions are verified. After all, there are logistics involved, such as making sure that the same virtual coin isn't being spent twice. Often this verification falls onto a group of folks known as miners.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Cryptocurrency miners are nothing more than people with high-powered computers who are competing against other people with high-powered computers to solve complex math equations. These equations are a product of the encryption designed to protect transaction data on the digital ledger.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "The first miner to solve these equations, and in the process verify transactions on the ledger, gets a reward, which is known as a block reward. This reward is paid out in virtual coins, and is an example of how bitcoin transactions are verified. This process is referred to as proof of work.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "The only other major verification process in place is known as proof of stake. Instead of having people use tons of resources trying to solve complex equations to verify transactions, the proof of stake model chooses who gets to verify the next block of transactions based on their ownership in a virtual currency. In essence, the more you own, the better chance you have of getting to verify transactions. With proof of stake, there is no competition among your peers and no excessive energy usage while solving complex equations, which can make it much more cost-effective.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "The proof of stake model also rewards those folks who verify transactions differently. Instead of being paid in virtual coins, the stakeholder earns the transaction fees tied to that block of transactions.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Are blockchain networks public or private?", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "The interesting thing is that blockchain has the opportunity to be public or private. As you might imagine, a private blockchain would appeal most to businesses, while public blockchains are most appealing to consumers who might want to use their virtual currency to buy goods or services, or to cryptocurrency investors.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "A private blockchain, just as it sounds, allows a business to place restrictions on who has access to data, and who can make transactions on the network. Meanwhile, public blockchains allow anyone to join and participate. Bitcoin is an example of a public blockchain.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Is it true that cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous?", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "The answer to this is, it depends. Most cryptocurrencies aren't as anonymous as you'd think. Sure, you don't have to supply your Social Security number or bank account to begin trading or investing in cryptocurrencies, but any transaction you make is still going to be recorded in the underlying digital ledger.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Recently, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) won a court case against cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase that required the exchange to turn over information on 14,355 users who, between 2013 and 2015, exchanged at least $20,000 worth of bitcoin. While the IRS primarily sought this info to go after possible capital-gain tax evaders, the bigger idea here is that these transactions aren't as anonymous as you'd think.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "There is, however, a group of cryptocurrencies known privacy coins that have a sole purpose of beefing up the anonymity and privacy of a transaction. They use specialized protocols to help hide the identity of the sender of a payment. Monero and Dash are examples of coins that belong to this specialized group.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "How do virtual coins fit into all of this?", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "As noted, digital currencies are what investors are buying. In nearly all instances, buying a cryptocurrency won't give an investor any ownership in the underlying blockchain technology. This happens to be one of the biggest differences between cryptocurrencies and traditional investments, like stocks. If you buy stock in a publicly traded company, you own a fractional percentage of that business. That's not the case with nearly all cryptocurrencies.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "So, what do the virtual coins do exactly? In many instances, the coins are required to pay for transactions fees on a blockchain. Ethereum, which is one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap behind bitcoin, requires users of its blockchain to pay transaction fees in its coin, known as Ether. But there are other potential applications.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "For example, Ripple's coin, known as the XRP, may serve as an intermediary that'll allow transactions to settle faster. Ripple is a blockchain company that's focused on partnering with big banks and financial institutions. Imagine that a customer in Japan wants to make a payment to a business in the U.K. If this payment were routed through Ripple's blockchain, it could take the payment in Japanese yen, convert that payment into XRP coins, then convert those coins into British pounds. All of this could theoretically be done instantly, or at the very least considerably faster than traditional banks (and hopefully for a lower cost).", "label": 7}

{"sentence": "Again, there's no 100% correct answer here, but the key in their success remains two factors. First, retail investors (i.e., non-professional investors) have accounted for most virtual currency trading. Institutional investors have kept to the sidelines because either their company won't allow them to invest in cryptocurrencies, or they're simply too volatile to merit an investment. Retail investors tend to be more reliant on their emotions relative to institutional investors, leading to moves that tend to overshoot to the upside, and downside.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "The second factor is that this isn't exactly a fair market. Among traditional equities, like the stock market, an investor has the opportunity to buy, sell, and even bet against an equity. Money can be made if an equity moves up or down. With nearly all cryptocurrencies, except bitcoin, buying or selling is the only option. There is no way to make money if a cryptocurrency goes down, which naturally tends to incentivize buying.

In 2003, the iPod shifted into a mainstream product when CEO Steve Jobs (who rejoined the company in 1997) opened it up to be used on Windows computers with the iTunes music store, the first easy-to-use, legitimate avenue for buying music, back then at 99 cents a song.

{"sentence": "3. The NFL's concussion protocol continues to be a fiasco. Even after the league and NFLPA mandated last month that players struggling to stay upright be taken to the locker room for evaluation, the Panthers seemingly failed to adhere to the new guideline when Cam Newton appeared dazed in the fourth quarter.

But their emergent defense might be the difference between this season's playoff run and last year's failure, when the D wore out in the face of the Patriots' ball-control Super Bowl blitzkrieg. Since then, Atlanta has added DT Dontari Poe and first-round OLB Takk McKinley to a talented, athletic bunch that mostly lacked depth and experience. And don't forget, DE Adrian Clayborn and No. 1 CB Desmond Trufant were on IR during Super Bowl LI.

{"sentence": "15. That said, some NFL team will be lucky to get Alex Smith, who will almost surely be traded so the Chiefs can give the offensive keys to first-round QB Patrick Mahomes. Smith dropped to 2-5 in his hard-luck postseason career despite playing fairly well. His all-time playoff numbers now include 14 TD passes, just two INTs and a 97.4 QB rating.

Current Milwaukee Bucks guard Malcolm Brogdon was the ACC player of the year when Virginia went to the Elite Eight two years ago and a key cog on back-to-back 30-win, ACC title-winning teams the years before that.

Then factor in upstart freshman De'Andre Hunter (6.6 ppg) and Rutgers transfer Nigel Johnson (6.5 ppg) as key contributors. Most important, Bennett has size (frontcourt players Jack Salt is 6-10 and Mamadi Diakite is 6-9) and a deep roster (seven guys average more than 6 points a game, which is abundant for Virginia) all of which he can utilize in sure-to-be grueling ACC action.", "label": 7}

We hoped it wasn't true, and even though there were signs over the last decade, the last four years has shown that what we had hoped were merely isolated thoughts of bigotry, racism and elitism were actually more pervasive than we thought.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "In 2020 it seemed like we were living in the apocalypse.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Using biblical language like that might sound like histrionics or exaggeration, but it is actually pretty accurate. The word apocalypse is from the Greek apokalyptein, or to uncover, disclose, or reveal. If anything, it feels like this last 12 months not only uncovered a lot of what we feared, but revealed a lot about America and its people.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "The coronavirus pandemic has revealed the lack of support we provide for our health care infrastructure — including health care workers — on a local, national, and global scale. Furthermore, the uprisings for racial justice after the killing of so many Americans such as Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd have revealed how systemic racism has only continued to grow in this country, not abate. The aftermath of the 2020 presidential election has revealed just how divided this nation truly is — with nearly half of the United States believing that facts and published reports are merely fake or just a hoax.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "The Apocalypse has been thrown around Christian circles for millennia, and while there were a few Christian voices that have been loud over the course of 2020 speaking out for justice, fighting for the poor and marginalized, and standing alongside those who have been disproportionately impacted by racism and a justice system that criminalizes their own existence, many Christians failed to speak out, or even speak up, at all during this new apocalypse. The discourse seemed to be coming from a few vocal Christians who chose to not fight for the marginalized, but to uplift an administration that contradicts what Jesus taught us about how to treat others.", "label": 7}

{"sentence": "In the biblical apocalypse there are false prophets claiming the voice of God. Similarly, today there are those who claim the same while simultaneously trying to put the lid back on what others have revealed to be the truth — that is, that Christ favored the poor and the marginalized over the mighty. Yet this message has been buried by some of our most prominent Christian leaders who seemingly have been seduced by the trappings of power, privilege, and prestige.", "label": 7}

{"sentence": "Those of us who claim to follow Christ have an opportunity, if not a responsibility, to fix what is broken and to help bring back a kind and just society that honors every person as a beloved child of God. Let us not use Christianity as a way to advance our own agenda, to fill a stadium or to raise money, but rather to be like Jesus in (and for) a broken world.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "As Christians, we have a choice: We can either emerge from our quarantined lives wanting to return to pre-pandemic normalcy, or we can use the knowledge revealed during the pandemic months — of health care system failures, systemic racism, and transgender violence to name a few — to lift these groups and others up to Christ and saddle up next to them in solidarity.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "We are therefore asking Christians of all denominations and sects to follow the call that we've all been given, and to fulfill the words of Isaiah to bring good news to the oppressed, to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and release to the prisoners. To do this means calling out racism, homophobia, transphobia, sexism and ableism, and then doing something to eradicate those sins in our lives, in our churches, in our communities and, sometimes, even within our own families.", "label": 7}

Let's cry out for justice like John the Baptist and the prophets once cried out in the wilderness. Let's call upon both the newly-elected and incumbents in office alike and remind them that our faith compels us to advocate for the poor and marginalized, those who are impacted by climate change, and those who endure harassment and discrimination just to earn a paycheck.", "label": 7}

During the Obama administration, for example, only 30 federal appeals court nominees were confirmed during his first four years in office, according to the report.

{"sentence": "Created by Steven Knight with Chips Hardy and star Tom Hardy (who worked with Knight on Peaky Blinders), Taboo is set in London in 1814 — a fetid mess so dank, you can practically smell it.

{"sentence": "Indeed, to say Taboo starts slowly would be unfair to slow things: It barely starts at all. It's mostly all portent — scene after scene of somber looks, eerie music and cloudy skies, occasionally interrupted by a profane outburst or a lustful look. Perhaps more and better is coming, but in this era of abundance, it's hard to imagine anyone but the most devoted fans of Hardy, Knight or FX having the patience to wait for it.", "label": 7}

{"sentence": "He will call plays from the field and be able to talk to his quarterback face-to-face between drives, which is the setup he prefers. He'll call plays the way he's comfortable, but his familiarity with what Kiffin was doing all season long will come into play, too.", "label": 7}

There's some carryover that Lane had brought with him that we had years ago — Lane and I hadn't coached together in over 10 years — but what I learned was the system (these last four months).

A Google Ngrams search of books shows that use of the term inflation targeting began growing exponentially in the early 1990s, when the target was typically far below actual inflation. The idea that we actually want moderate positive inflation — price stability, not zero inflation — appears to have started to take shape in policy circles around the time of the 1990-1991 recession. Lawrence Summers argued that the public has an irrational resistance to the declining nominal wages that some would have to suffer in a zero-inflation regime.", "label": 8}

Having an emergency fund equal to three months' worth of must-have expenses is a good goal after you get on track with retirement savings and have paid off troublesome debt such as credit cards.

Days that seem like transition points motivate people to take advantage of the fresh-start effect, research shows.

Researchers at the Wharton School came to this conclusion after they discovered that visits to the university fitness center spiked during these turning points.", "label": 8}

{"sentence": "You can't get to your destination if you don't know where you're going, says Gomez. If you want to lose weight, take that dream vacation, fall in love or watch more episodes of The Good Wife, get clear about what specifically you want and why you want it and identify at least three steps on how you're going to get there.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "Once you have a clear vision of what you want to accomplish, begin turning that into reality.

It does no good to have one if you don't use it. Set manageable goals, include some rewards, find an accountability partner and keep track of your progress. This enables you to stay motivated and get consistent results, she adds.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "Ultimately, the ability to follow through on a New Year's resolution involves the ability to regulate our impulses, says Timothy J. Bono, assistant dean for assessment and analytics at Washington University in St. Louis. Our impulse might be to eat a lot of junk food or waste time on social media instead of using it more productively. To override those impulses, we need willpower, or what psychologists call self-regulatory strength.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "Also see: How retirement planning needs to change in the new year", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "Bono likens strengthening willpower to becoming stronger physically. If we can get ourselves to exercise willpower in small, everyday behaviors — maybe we resist the temptation to get the candy bar when we're in the checkout line at the grocery store — those are the opportunities that allow our self-regulatory strength to grow. The more you practice, the easier it becomes.", "label": 8}

A better approach is one that enhances multiple areas of your life. For example, resolving to live in the moment helps achieve both personal and career goals.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "A long list of resolutions makes it less likely you'll be able to do all of them, so order them. If you already feel as if you're being spread too thin, you likely will not be able to keep multiple New Year's resolutions, says Carpenter.

{"sentence": "With my colleagues, Martin Lettau of the U.C. Berkeley Haas School of Business and Sydney Ludvigson of New York University, I set out to investigate what makes stocks move over time. What we found was surprising.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "Despite the widespread belief that firm productivity is a key driver of stock market returns, our results indicate that fluctuations in productivity play only a small role. Far more influential over long periods is the economic redistribution between workers and shareholders — meaning how a company's profits are divided between employees and investors.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "Our first step in this research was to consider which factors might be responsible for movement in the stock market in aggregate. Each firm that is represented in the stock market index produces a stream of revenues. After paying a portion to workers, the rest is left over as profits that can be distributed to shareholders as dividends. The stock price will rise whenever the rewards to the shareholders increase, which can be caused by one of three separate forces:", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "Productivity: The firm becomes more productive, increasing its stream of revenues. This increases the size of both slices, including the shareholders' slice. Redistribution: The size of the pie remains fixed, but the firm pays a smaller share to the workers, increasing the shareholders' slice. Market confidence: Neither the size nor the division of the pie changes, but more risk-tolerant investors demand more stock despite there being no change in their current dividends.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "Combining theoretical analysis with statistical estimation on macroeconomic and stock market data, we were able to determine the relative strengths of these three forces.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "Here's what we found: At short-term horizons of one-quarter to several years, market confidence shocks are dominant, explaining nearly all fluctuations. Essentially, short-run swings in stock prices are simply out of proportion to the movements in the underlying cash flows, ruling out the other two explanations.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "But at longer horizons of a decade or more, we found that redistributions between workers and shareholders play an increasingly important role, explaining half of the variation in overall stock prices at a horizon of 25 years.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "These redistributive shifts, taken individually, are quite small, and are not major factors in explaining quarterly returns. But unlike movements in market confidence, which tend to return to normal over a few quarters or years, these redistributive shifts are virtually permanent, allowing a sequence of small shifts to build up over time — with huge overall impact.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "Here's what Trump means for health care", "label": 8}

However, these changes do not always favor shareholders. Case in point: the period from 1960 to 1980 saw substantial gains for workers at the expense of lower stock returns.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "Finally, fluctuations in productivity play little role over any time frame. Certainly, improvements in technology are important, and changes in productivity may be central to the performance of individual stocks. But for explaining why the market as a whole rose more in one period than another — be it a quarter, year, or decade — differences in aggregate productivity growth are rarely the story.", "label": 8}

{"sentence": "In the wake of Donald Trump's election, many are looking to the stock market to learn what is in store for the economy. While much of the short-run action likely reflects movements in market confidence or uncertainty, upcoming decisions on corporate taxes or labor policy may influence what shareholders ultimately receive.

And it's a very sad thing. They walked out complaining. But the number is large.

But you also have substantial numbers of people, thousands and thousands, who went to the voting place on November 3rd, were told they couldn't vote – were told they couldn't vote because a ballot had been put in on their name.

That is – that was the tape that's been shown all over the world that makes everybody look bad – you, me, and everybody else – where they got – number one, they said – they said very clearly and it's been reported that they said there was a major water main break. Everybody fled the area. And then they came back – Ruby Freeman, her daughter, and a few people. There were no Republican poll watchers. Actually, there were no Democrat poll watchers. I guess they were them. But there were no Democrats, either. And there was no law enforcement. Late in the morning, they went – early in the morning, they went to the table with the black robe – the black shield and they pulled out the votes. Those votes were put there a number of hours before. The table was put there – I think it was – Brad, you would know. It was probably eight hours or seven hours before, and then it was stuffed with votes. They weren't in an official voter box. They were in what looked to be suitcases or trunks – suitcases, but they weren't in voter boxes.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "The minimum number it could be – because we watched it, and they watched it for certified in slow motion, instant replay if you can believe it. But it had slow motion and it was magnified many times over, and the minimum it was was 18,000 ballots, all for Biden.", "label": 8}

So all sorts of things could have happened to that box, including, you know, putting in the votes that you wanted.", "label": 8}

We had vast – I mean, you have – the state is in turmoil over this.

I mean, you know – and I didn't lose the state, Brad.", "label": 8}

They beat me in the – (inaudible 17:07) as you know, every single state – we won every state. We won every statehouse in the country. We held the Senate, which is shocking to people, although we'll see what happens tomorrow or in a few days. And we won the House. But we won every single statehouse and we won Congress, which was supposed to lose 15 seats and they gained I think 16 or 17 or something. I think there's now a difference of five. There was supposed to be a difference substantially more.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "But politicians – in every state, but politicians in Georgia have been given affidavits and are going to that there was no way they beat me in the – in the election, that the people came out – in fact, they were expecting to lose and they ended up winning by a lot because of the coattails, and they said there's no way – that they've done many polls prior to the election. There was no way that they won. Ballots were dropped in massive numbers, and we're trying to get to those numbers, and we will have them. They'll take a period of time, certified. But they're massive numbers, and far greater than the 11,779.", "label": 8}

{"sentence": "The bottom line is when you add it all up, and then you start adding, you know, 300,000 fake ballots, then the other thing they said is in Fulton County and other areas – and this may or may not be true, this just came up this morning – that they are burning their ballots, that they are shredding, shredding ballots and removing equipment. They're changing the equipment on the – on the Dominion machines. And you know, that's not legal. And they supposedly shredded I think they said 300 pounds of – 3,000 pounds of ballots, and that just came to us as a report today. And you know, it's – it's a very sad situation.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "But Brad, if you took – the minimum numbers were many, many times above the 11,779, and many of those numbers are certified, or they will be certified but they are certified. Those are numbers that are there, that exist, and that beat the margin – the margin of loss. It beat – they beat it, I mean, by a lot. And people should be happy to have an accurate count instead of an election where there's turmoil. I mean, there's turmoil in Georgia and other places. You're not the only one. I mean, we have other states that I believe will be flipping to us very shortly.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "But this is – this is something that's – you know, as an example, I think in Detroit and I think there's a section of – good section of your state, actually, which – we're not sure, so we're not going to report it yet. But in Detroit, we had I think it was 139 percent of the people voted. That's not too good.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "In Pennsylvania, they had well over 200,000 more votes than they had people voting, and that…that doesn't play too well. And the legislature there is – which is Republican, is extremely activist and angry. But I mean, there were other things, also, that were almost as bad as that.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "But they had an example in Michigan a tremendous number of dead people that voted. I think it was – I think, Mark, it was 18,000, some unbelievably high number, much higher than yours. You were – you were in the 4 to 5,000 category. And that was checked out laboriously by going through birth cert…by going through the obituary columns in the newspapers.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "So I guess with all of it being said, Brad, it's – the bottom line – and provisional ballots, again, you know, you'll have to tell me about the provisional ballots. But we have a lot of people that were complaining that they weren't able to vote because they were already voted for. And these are great people, and you know, they were shell shocked. I don't know if you call that provisional ballots. In some states we had a lot of provisional ballot situations where people were given a provisional ballot because when they walked in on November 3rd they were already voting – voted for.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "So that's it. I mean, we have many, many times the number of votes necessary to win the state. And we won the state, and we won it very substantially and easily. And we're getting – we have – much of this is very – you know, they're certified. Far more are certified than we need, but we're getting additional numbers certified, too. And we're getting pictures of drop boxes being delivered and delivered late – delivered three days later, in some cases. Plus, we have many affidavits to that effect.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "MR. MEADOWS: So, Mr. President, if I – if I might be able to jump in, and I'll give Brad a chance, Mr. Secretary.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "One, obviously, there is – there are allegations where we believe that not every vote or fair vote and legal vote was counted. That's at odds with the representation from the secretary of state's office.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "What I'm hopeful for is, is there some way that we can – we can find some kind of an agreement to look at this a little bit more fully? You know, the president mentioned Fulton County, but in some of these areas where there seems to be a difference of where the facts seem to lead. And so, Mr. Secretary, I was hopeful that, you know, in a spirit of cooperation and compromise, is there something that we can at least have a discussion to look at some of these allegations to find a path forward that's less litigious?", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "MR. RAFFENSPERGER: Well, I've listened to what…the president has just said. President Trump, we've had several lawsuits, and we've had to respond in court to the lawsuits and the contentions. We don't agree that you have won and we don't – I didn't agree about the 200,000 number that you mentioned. But I could go through that point by point.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "What we had done is we gave out state senate about one-and-a-half hours of our time going through the election issue by issue. And then on the statehouse, the Government Affairs Committee, we gave them about two-and-a-half hours of our time going back point by point on all the issues of contention. And then just a few days ago we met with our U.S. congressmen, Republican congressmen, and we gave them about two hours of our time talking about this past election.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "Going back, primarily what you're – what you've talked about here, focused in on primarily, I believe, is the absentee ballot process. I don't believe that you're really questioning the Dominion machines because we did a hand re-tally, a 100 percent re-tally of all the ballots and compared that to what the machine said, and it came up with virtually the same result. Then we did the recount and we got virtually the same result. So I guess we could probably take that off the table. I don't think there's an issue about that.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, Brad – Brad, not that there's not an issue, but – because I – we have a big issue with Dominion in other states and perhaps in yours, but we haven't felt we needed to go there. And just to, you know, maybe put a little different spin on what Mark is saying – Mark Meadows – yeah, we'd like to go further, but we don't really need to. We have all the votes we need. You know, we won the state.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "If you took – these are the most minimal numbers, the numbers that I gave you. Those are numbers that are certified: your absentee ballots sent to vacant addresses; your out-of-state voters, 4,925. You know, when you add them up, it's many more – it's many times the 11,779 number.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "So we could go through – we have not gone through your Dominion, so we can't give them blessing. I mean, in other states we think we found tremendous corruption with Dominion machines, but we'll have to see.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "But we only lost the state by – by that number, 11,000 votes, and – 779. So with that being said, with just what we have and – you know, with just what we have, we're giving you minimum – minimum numbers. We're doing the most conservative numbers possible. We're many times – many, many times above the margin. And so we don't really have to – Mark, I don't think we have to go through machines because –", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "PRESIDENT TRUMP: – because what's the difference between winning the election by two votes and winning it by a half-a-million votes?", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "PRESIDENT TRUMP: I think we probably did win it by a half a – you know, one of the things that happened, Brad, is we have other people coming in now from Alabama and from South Carolina and from other states, and they're saying it's impossible for you to have lost Georgia. We won – you know, in Alabama we set a record, got the highest vote ever. In Georgia we set a record with a massive amount of votes. And they say it's not possible to have lost Georgia. And I could tell you by our rallies. I could tell you by the rally I'm having on Monday night. The place, they already have lines of people standing out front waiting. It's just not possible to have lost Georgia. It's not possible.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "When I heard it was close, I said there's no way. But they dropped a lot of votes in there late at night. You know that, Brad. And that's what we are working on very, very stringently. But regardless of those votes, with all of it being said, we lost by essentially 11,000 votes, and we have many more votes already calculated, and certified too. So I just don't know – you know, Mark, I don't know what's the purpose – I won't give Dominion a pass because we found too many bad things, but we don't need Dominion or anything else. We have – we have – we have won this election in Georgia based on all of this.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "And there's nothing wrong with saying that, Brad. You know, I mean, having the – having a correct – the people of Georgia are angry. And these numbers are going to be repeated on Monday night, along with others that we're going to have by that time, which are much more substantial, even. And the people of Georgia are angry. The people of the country are angry. And there's nothing wrong with saying that – you know, that you've recalculated because the 2,236 on absentee ballots, I mean, they're all exact numbers that were done by accounting firms, law firms, et cetera. And even if you cut them in half, cut them in half, and cut them in half again, it's more votes than we need.", "label": 8}
{"sentence": "MR. RAFFENSPERGER: Well, Mr. President, the challenge that you have is the data you have is wrong. We talked to the congressmen and they were surprised, but they – I guess there was a person named Mr. Braynard that came to these meetings and presented data. And he said that there was dead people – I believe it was upward of 5,000. The actual number were two – two. Two people that were dead that voted. And so that's wrong. That was two.", "label": 8}

That was also the preferred route for Suzuki and Adams, two veterans who did not want to see their free agencies seep into 2019. Suzuki wanted peace of mind for both him and his family, and he officially signed with the Nationals on Nov. 20. Adams, who a year earlier had joined the Nationals on Dec. 22, again avoided stress by signing a week earlier this time around. Rosenthal, if anything like his pre-Tommy John self, could be the shutdown setup man the Nationals have been seeking. Suzuki helped the Nationals fill a glaring hole behind the plate, and Adams provides a left-handed-hitting first baseman to pair with Ryan Zimmerman. Springing into negotiations helped the Nationals land each player.", "label": 9}

Corbin called pitching to Gomes and Suzuki a huge part of his decision to sign with the Nationals instead of the New York Yankees or Philadelphia Phillies, even if the $140 million was the most attractive element of the equation. Gomes is a heralded pitch framer and Suzuki, at 35, is a respected game caller. Sanchez, who the Nationals signed to a two-year deal on Dec. 20, raved about Suzuki in a phone call with reporters and said the pair has a really good relationship between pitcher and catcher. They played together with the Atlanta Braves last season and Sanchez made tweaks to his pitching approach that turned his career around.

When the IOD is in its positive phase, the water is cooler than average off the coast of Sumatra, leading to reduced atmospheric lift there and reduced rainfall over Australia, and there are warmer-than-average waters off the coast of Africa.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "A positive IOD the past two years has meant drier-than-average conditions in much of Australia. The Bureau of Meteorology found that it is unusual to have back-to-back years with a positive dipole, which helps influence precipitation patterns across South Asia and Oceania.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "This natural climate cycle is changing over time as ocean and air temperatures rise in response to increased amounts of greenhouse gases from human activities, namely the burning of fossil fuels for energy. This is expected to make back-to-back positive IOD events more common and make Australia even more prone to drought conditions accompanied by extreme heat.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "While the IOD is a natural mode of variability, its behavior is changing in response to climate change. Research suggests that the frequency of positive IOD events, and particularly the occurrence of consecutive events will increase as global temperatures rise, the bureau stated.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "The scale of the ongoing disaster in Australia is difficult to fathom even for those on the ground. At least 12 million acres have gone up in smoke so far in Victoria and New South Wales alone, which dwarfs the amount of land that burned in California's worst fire season in 2018. It is equivalent to the burning of the entire state of West Virginia.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "Person-to-person close contact is widely considered the dominant mode of infection, because those infected expel droplets carrying virus particles when they speak, sing or just breathe normally. Hence the advice to keep your distance. There are other pathways which are considered less common. Scientists have implicated smaller particles called aerosols, which can float farther and for longer, adding to evidence that suggests good ventilation and face masks reduce the risk of infection. All such particles can contaminate surfaces when they land, creating fomites. People who touch the fomite can transfer virus particles to their own nose, mouth or eye and become infected. Frequent and thorough hand washing and cleaning of high-touch items like doorknobs mitigate that risk. Standard disinfectants kill the virus, as do sunlight and other sources of ultraviolet light.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Some scientists use a Swiss cheese model to illustrate how several layers or defenses are needed to minimize opportunities for the virus to find a new host.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Here's a more detailed look at these individual pathways.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Spending at least 15 minutes near an infected person, or even briefer periods with someone who is coughing or sneezing, is risky because they are spewing virus-laden particles. Living with other people increases the prospect of prolonged, high-intensity interaction, and that makes households and other residential settings, such as nursing homes and prisons, among the most likely places for SARS-CoV-2 infections to occur.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a distance of at least 6 feet, which is roughly how far such droplets usually can fly. The World Health Organization says at least 1 meter (3 feet, 4 inches) and an even greater distance indoors. Public health authorities also recommend people wash their hands frequently and forgo shaking hands, hugging and kissing. Infected people may be most contagious a day or two before starting to feel sick, and they may continue to be infectious as long as 15 days after symptoms emerge. People who experience very mild or no symptoms may also transmit SARS-CoV-2, which is why testing has been promoted as a way of detecting hidden carriers, who need to be isolated until they are no longer contagious and monitored for symptoms.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "For households with a suspected or confirmed case of infection, doctors suggest keeping that person separated from others as much as possible and cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces in common areas -- such as switches, tables and remotes -- daily. Where people are crowded together, such as on buses and subways, health authorities across the world are telling them to cover their faces. If medical masks are in short supply, many suggest using home-made versions.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "While humans are the biggest source of SARS-CoV-2, some pets, farm animals, zoo exhibits and bats are susceptible to the infection. Health authorities say there's no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus, however, and consider the risk of them doing so to be low.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "While the biggest respiratory droplets fall to the ground fast, aerosols can be carried farther and stay aloft longer, especially if they attach to other fine particles such as dust and pollution. Their small size increases the odds of them being inhaled deep into the lungs of a bystander, which can cause a more severe infection. A cough can disperse virus particles 4-to-5 meters and a sneeze can project them as far as 8 meters away, depending on humidity, temperature and airflow. Speaking loudly is also associated with increased particle emissions.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Indoor environments without adequate ventilation or air filtration exacerbate the spread of virus-laden particles. Nightclubs, bars, restaurants, exercise classes, call centers, and choir practice -- where people are crammed together in a confined space -- have spawned clusters of cases. Cold and stale air in meat-packing plants can also be hazardous, as can intensive-care units where patients may be undergoing certain procedures and treatments including inserting and removing airway tubes. The use of face masks, especially the more protective type known as N95 respirators, and ventilation systems that change the air at least 12 times an hour have been found to mitigate airborne transmission.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Infectious particles on surfaces, clothing, and other objects may also become airborne if they are agitated, making walking on a contaminated floor or removing contaminated clothing a potential risk. Since the virus can invade the gastrointestinal track and be shed in fecal matter, there is also potential risk that the virus might spread via aerosols generated by toilet-flushing and trapped air in sewage pipes and drain traps. In Guangzhou, China, viral traces were detected in the bathroom of a vacant apartment directly above one where five people had been confirmed as having Covid-19, and airflow and dispersal experiments found the pathogen may have wafted upward through drain pipes after a toilet was flushed.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Although there are no specific reports directly demonstrating fomite transmission, the WHO considers this a likely pathway, given consistent findings about environmental contamination in the vicinity of cases of infection. A study published in October found a person was infected by touching an elevator button that had been contaminated by virus-laden snot on the same day. The virus can be highly stable in favorable environments, lingering for weeks in cool temperatures on solid surfaces, such as glass and banknotes. Some scientists have hypothesized that that characteristic makes SARS-CoV-2 more difficult to control in the winter than summer. That's a feature of other coronaviruses and respiratory viruses. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through feces or urine hasn't been proven, though it may be relevant in areas with poor sanitation.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Covid-19 outbreaks have occurred in meat-processing plants or those preparing ready-made meals, but virus transmission via contaminated food or packaging is contested. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention in October detected potentially infectious, or active, virus on a package of frozen cod that had been handled by two port workers in Qingdao who tested positive five days later. The finding suggested they may have gotten infected from the package, although that wasn't confirmed. Experiments with salmon indicate the virus can survive up to eight days in the cold-chain conditions used to export fish, scientists in China said in a report ahead of publication and peer review. Those results, which match laboratory experiments conducted in Singapore, support the Chinese government's rationale for testing imported meat, packaging and containers and blocking goods deemed potentially infectious. No live virus had been isolated out of almost 3 million samples tested until the Qingdao case. Only 22 came back positive as of mid-September, but none was suspected of posing an infection risk. The WHO has said transmission by such means is highly unlikely, but recommends people who handle food practice good hygiene, including frequently cleaning and disinfecting work surfaces, to minimize the risk of contamination.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Dale Fisher, an infectious-diseases physician in Singapore who has studied the durability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has said that, although infections from contaminated food and packaging may be freakish events, the scale of the global food trade increases the chances of them occurring in settings where large volumes of potentially contaminated goods are handled. That's in contrast to supermarket shelves, which don't represent an infectious hazard.", "label": 9}

Having failed time and again with multiple lawsuits brought by his campaign's legal teams or their allies, all of which were rejected by the courts, Trump had nothing of substance to offer, just bluster and the baseless claims that he has made nonstop since he lost. He was trolling with rumor, innuendo (and the muscle that comes with calling from the White House), attempting one more time to bully and intimidate Raffensperger.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "Ryan Germany, the general counsel to the secretary of state, was similarly direct when Trump claimed that voting machines had been removed or in some way tampered with. No, he said. Asked whether he was sure of this, he said: I'm sure. I'm sure, Mr. President.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Trump will never let this go, not between now and the day he is forced to give up the office and Biden is sworn in, not in the days and weeks and months after that. That he is on a mission is evident, but to what end, other than to avoid the ignominious label of loser after a single term in the White House? That, at least, is consistent with the behavior he has exhibited throughout the four years of his presidency. He cares nothing about collateral damage to democracy.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "The president, however, is not on this mission alone. Instead, he continues to gather support from members of a party he has remade in his own image. On Wednesday, members of the House and the Senate will meet to approve the results from the electoral college. Those results show that Biden won 306 votes to Trump's 232.

I think that comes with experience. But there's no doubt, we want to get off to a fast start, but you know, the same thing two years ago, I think we were down 14-0 [early in the second quarter, before winning, 35-31].

A stovetop pressure cooker will need around 50 percent of the original timing, maybe even just 40 percent, depending on the cut of meat or the amount of root vegetables (see sidebar).

Thus, a slow cooker requires the least amount of liquid: sometimes half, even a third, of that required for a stovetop braise.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "A pressure cooker usually splits the difference, requiring about three-quarters of the liquid of a Dutch oven braise, a little more if it's a stove-top pressure cooker.

As a very general rule and starting from a Dutch oven recipe, double the dried herbs for a slow cooker and increase dried spices by 50 percent. For a pressure cooker, keep dried spices the same but increase dried herbs by 50 percent. For large-batch slow cooking (more than seven quarts), you may even need to triple dried herbs and double dried spices.

{"sentence": "In general, stove-top braises accent natural sugars, intensifying the sweetness all around.

However, that court saw him plead guilty in November to seven counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, and in a court in nearby Eaton County a week later, he admitted guilt to three more counts of abusing girls.", "label": 9}

The last couple years, there's been a lot of talk about us, and so a lot of pressure on, and so it was nice to kind of be able to go out and figure it out as a team because we knew we were going to have some new guys. I think for a lot of us coming back that have been here for a while, we knew that obviously the goal was to be where we're at right now, in first in the division and to keep building. It's been a fun season. It's been fun having new guys and building a new identity with a new group of guys. We're hot right now, like you guys said.

That's our mind-set.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "No one puts more expectations and more pressure on ourselves than us, Beagle said. No one else can put more pressure on yourself to perform than yourself. You want to win more than anyone. That's what's gotten you here, and that's what drives you. When you have that extra kind of pressure and that extra . . . just people always scrutinizing and looking at everything as a team and individually, I think it adds pressure that's necessarily not very good. It's nice this year to come in at the beginning of the year and just to be able to figure it out as a team and not have that expectation of coming out of the gates of being in first place and leading the league right away in points. This year, it's been a little different in that sense, and it's been good. It's allowed guys that are new to the team to figure out their role and allowed our team just to figure out our identity. It's been nice for a change.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Of course, the division standings at the start of the new year mean even less than the Presidents' Trophy. Just ask the two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins, who are in seventh place in the Metropolitan, and just one point out of the basement. Two years ago at this time, Washington had the best record in the Eastern Conference, and the Penguins, who had fired coach Mike Johnston a few weeks earlier, were in fifth place in the division.

{"sentence": "Tuesday, November 10, 1998; Page A01 Meeting for the first time since GOP setbacks in last Tuesday's elections, Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee yesterday strongly indicated they still plan to move forward with impeachment proceedings against President Clinton. God, I'd like to forget all of this. I mean, who needs it? said Judiciary Chairman Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.), as the panel met to hear from constitutional experts about the standards for impeaching a president. We paid attention to the polls and the elections. But, Hyde said, I'm frightened for the rule of law. . . . I really believe that notion that no man is above the law. He condemned all of the sophistries that I hear, rationales, justifications -- 'Everybody does it. It was just about sex.' In the wake of the GOP's poor showing in last week's elections and the continuing large majority of Americans who say they would like Congress simply to drop the subject of Clinton's alleged misconduct in the Monica S. Lewinsky matter, the president's prospects for avoiding impeachment seemed significantly improved. But committee Republicans yesterday appeared more energized than chastened, despite their party's five-seat House loss and the conclusion by strategists in both parties that the GOP may want to consider an exit strategy for an investigation that may have backfired politically. I think the election probably affected the disposition in the Senate more than it did anything here, Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said outside the hearing room.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "I do not see any change in mood, said Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.). They are two of the key Republican members of an informal breakfast club on Judiciary, a bipartisan group that has discussed the possibility of a solution short of impeachment. Democrats who had hoped yesterday's session might mark the start of a new, more conciliatory attitude by the GOP were disappointed. Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said Republicans haven't read the election results and that it was quite likely the committee would vote out articles of impeachment. In comments outside the hearing, several Republicans said they did not think disciplinary measures short of impeachment, such as censure, would be appropriate, and some of the experts who testified yesterday said they saw constitutional problems with that approach. I don't think censure is a possibility, said Rep. Steve Buyer (R-Ind.). Either we proceed or we do not. Hutchinson expressed similar reservations. The options are limited constitutionally, he said. Opening the daylong constitutional law seminar, Rep. Charles T. Canady (R-Fla.) was biting in his assessment of Clinton's conduct and the arguments by the president's supporters that, however reprehensible, it did not rise to the level of an impeachable offense. Obstruction of justice and lying under oath by a president inevitably subvert the respect for law which is essential to the well-being of our constitutional system, said Canady, chairman of the Judiciary subcommittee on the Constitution.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "A president who engages in such behavior, Canady said, must be called to account for setting a dangerous example of lawlessness and corruption. He must be called to account for subverting the respect for law, which is the foundation of our Constitution. Graham said he was inclined not to support articles of impeachment for Clinton's testimony at his deposition by Paula Jones's lawyers, but that the president's testimony before the grand jury was a good candidate for an article of impeachment. The subcommittee's ranking member, Rep. Robert C. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), warned against doing irreparable harm to our system of government by establishing a dangerous and partisan 'impeach at will' precedent that will forever weaken the institution of the presidency. Moreover, he said, The American people have now clearly told us that it is time to move on. Members looking for guidance about whether Clinton's misconduct warrants impeachment -- -or, perhaps more likely, to buttress their already stated positions -- had an array of choices yesterday. The panel of experts was divided among those who argued that Clinton's alleged conduct could easily justify impeachment and those who said it fell far short of what the Founding Fathers had in mind when they envisioned removing a president from office for treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. Ten of the 19 who testified represented the Republican side, eight the Democratic approach, and one -- William and Mary law professor Michael Gerhardt -- was a shared witness.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Former Reagan Justice Department official Charles Cooper said Clinton's actions are not at the fringe of high crimes and misdemeanors. They're at the core of it. Responding to the argument that Clinton's alleged lies were less serious because they involved private sexual matters, Northwestern University law professor Stephen Presser said, No person, and least of all no president . . . can pick and choose over which matters he will be truthful and over which he will not. But Georgetown University law professor Susan Low Bloch said it would be a dangerous and frightening prospect to remove a president for such actions. University of Chicago law professor Cass Sunstein warned that using the very heavy artillery of impeachment to go after Clinton would expose many future presidents to such attacks and end the tradition of mutual arms control that has greatly limited the use of impeachment. Experts on both sides expressed concerns about the constitutionality of censuring the president in some way and, in particular, imposing some kind of fine on him. In light of the founders' concern that the president not be subjected to political molestation by Congress, it cannot be emphasized too strongly that impeachment is the only means granted to Congress to censure the president, said University of London professor Gary McDowell, a GOP witness. It is either impeachment or nothing. Georgetown University law professor Rev. Robert Drinan, a former Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee, agreed that censure would establish a dangerous precedent. . . .", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Almost every election cycle we would have the Congress censuring the president if he were of a different party. But Gerhardt said censure has a textual, historical pedigree. He said two presidents -- Andrew Jackson and James Polk -- and five judges have faced censure votes. The lawmakers also talked about whether the House could conclude that Clinton had committed impeachable offenses yet choose not to impeach him. Rep. Thomas M. Barrett (D-Wis.) got GOP panel members McDowell and Yeshiva University law professor John McGinnis to agree that the House could decide not to proceed. Duke University law professor William Van Alstyne, also a GOP witness, agreed. The House has the political discretion to express its dismay, disappointment, recrimination, and still conclude it is not appropriate to take up the time of the Senate, he said. But George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley said that were the House to conclude that Clinton committed impeachable offenses, the role at that point should be the submission to the Senate. . . . It would be an enormous mistake for this matter to end in the House with some form of extra-constitutional means like censure. Harvard University law professor Laurence H. Tribe disagreed, saying it is a fallacy to conclude that you have to pass the buck to the Senate.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "The deal called for Hagelin, who had moved his company to Switzerland, to restrict sales of his most sophisticated models to countries approved by the United States. Nations not on that list would get older, weaker systems. Hagelin would be compensated for his lost sales, as much as $700,000 up front.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "The CIA and BND agreed on a series of code names for the program and its various components. Crypto was called Minerva, which is also the title of the CIA history. The operation was at first code-named Thesaurus, though in the 1980s it was changed to Rubicon.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Each year, the CIA and BND split any profits Crypto had made, according to the German history, which says the BND handled the accounting and delivered the cash owed to the CIA in an underground parking garage.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "From the outset, the partnership was beset by petty disagreements and tensions. To CIA operatives, the BND often seemed preoccupied with turning a profit, and the Americans constantly reminded the Germans that this was an intelligence operation, not a money-making enterprise.

{"sentence": "Mindful of the limitations to their abilities to run a high-tech company, the two agencies brought in corporate outsiders. The Germans enlisted Siemens, a Munich-based conglomerate, to advise Crypto on business and technical issues in exchange for 5 percent of the company's sales. The United States later brought in Motorola to fix balky products, making it clear to the company's CEO this was being done for U.S. intelligence. Siemens declined to comment. Motorola officials did not respond to a request for comment.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "To its frustration, Germany was never admitted to the vaunted Five Eyes, a long-standing intelligence pact involving the United States, Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. But with the Crypto partnership, Germany moved closer into the American espionage fold than might have seemed possible in World War II's aftermath.

{"sentence": "Buehler knew nothing about Crypto's relationship to the CIA and BND or the vulnerabilities in its devices. But he returned traumatized and suspicious that Iran knew more about the company he worked for than he did.

{"sentence": "The article reported NSA officials had traveled to Zug in the mid-1970s for secret meetings with Crypto executives. The officials were posing as consultants for a front company called Intercomm Associates but then proceeded to introduce themselves by their real names — which were recorded on notes of the meeting kept by a company employee.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "The main casualty of the Hydra crisis, the code name given to the Buehler case, was the CIA-BND partnership.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "For years, BND officials had recoiled at their American counterpart's refusal to distinguish adversaries from allies. The two partners often fought over which countries deserved to receive the secure versions of Crypto's products, with U.S. officials frequently insisting that the rigged equipment be sent to almost anyone — ally or not — who could be deceived into buying it.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "In the German history, Wolbert Smidt, the former director of the BND, complained that the United States wanted to deal with the allies just like they dealt with the countries of the Third World. Another BND official echoed that comment, saying that to Americans, in the world of intelligence there were no friends.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "The Cold War had ended, the Berlin Wall was down and the reunified Germany had different sensitivities and priorities. They saw themselves as far more directly exposed to the risks of the Crypto operation.

{"sentence": "In reality, the operation appears to have entered a protracted period of decline. By the mid-1990s, the days of profit were long past, and Crypto would have gone out of business but for infusions from the U.S. government.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "As a result, the CIA appears to have spent years propping up an operation that was more viable as an intelligence platform than a business enterprise. Its product line dwindled and its revenue and customer base shrank.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "But the intelligence kept coming, current and former officials said, in part because of bureaucratic inertia. Many governments just never got around to switching to newer encryption systems proliferating in the 1990s and beyond — and unplugging their Crypto devices. This was particularly true of less developed nations, according to the documents.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Most of the employees identified in the CIA and BND histories are in their 70s or 80s, and some of them have died.

There were reasons I left, she said, including her discomfort with her doubts at Crypto and her desire to be home more for her children.

{"sentence": "Most of the executives directly involved in the operation were motivated by ideological purpose and declined any payment beyond their Crypto salaries, according to the documents. Widman was among several exceptions. As his retirement drew near, his covert compensation was substantially increased, the CIA history says. He was also awarded a medal bearing the CIA seal.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "After the BND's departure, the CIA expanded its clandestine collection of companies in the encryption sector, according to former Western intelligence officials. Using cash amassed from the Crypto operation, the agency secretly acquired a second firm and propped up a third. The documents do not disclose any details about these entities. But the BND history notes that one of Crypto's longtime rivals — Gretag AG, also based in Switzerland — was taken over by an 'American' and, after a change of names in 2004, was liquidated.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Crypto itself hobbled along. It had survived the transitions from metal boxes to electronic circuits, going from teletype machines to enciphered voice systems. But it struggled to maintain its footing as the encryption market moved from hardware to software. U.S. intelligence agencies appear to have been content to let the Crypto operation play out, even as the NSA's attention shifted to finding ways to exploit the global reach of Google, Microsoft, Verizon and other U.S. tech powers.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "In 2017, Crypto's longtime headquarters building near Zug was sold to a commercial real estate company. In 2018, the company's remaining assets — the core pieces of the encryption business started nearly a century earlier — were split and sold.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "Giuliano Otth, who served as CEO of Crypto AG from 2001 until its dismemberment, took the same position at CyOne after it acquired the Swiss assets. Given his tenure at Crypto, it is likely he was witting to the CIA ownership of the company, just as all of his predecessors in the job had been.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "In a meeting in Zurich last month, Linde said he had been drawn to the company in part by its heritage and Hagelin connection, a past that still resonates in Sweden. Upon taking over operations, Linde even moved some of Hagelin's historic equipment from storage into a display at the factory entrance.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "When confronted with evidence that Crypto had been owned by the CIA and BND, Linde looked visibly shaken, and said that during negotiations he never learned the identities of the company's shareholders. He asked when the story would be published, saying he had employees overseas and voicing concern for their safety.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "In a subsequent interview, Linde said his company is investigating all the products it sells to determine whether they have any hidden vulnerabilities. We have to make a cut as soon as possible with everything that has been linked to Crypto, he said.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "When asked why he failed to confront Otth and others involved in the transaction about whether there was any truth to the long-standing Crypto allegations, Linde said he had regarded these as just rumors.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "The company's liquidation was handled by the same Liechtenstein law firm that provided cover for Hagelin's sale to the CIA and BND 48 years earlier.

{"sentence": "The Patriots, again, enter the playoffs as the Super Bowl favorites (per the betting markets) but here's something that should give you pause before backing a team that seems quite likely to reach the final NFL game of the year: They weren't tested much this season.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Sure, they may have been pressed during the absence of Tom Brady, the team's starting quarterback and a strong MVP candidate, for the first four games due to a suspension for his role in Deflategate, but on the whole New England played the easiest schedule in the NFL, a slate of games that included two divisional matchups against the 5-11 New York Jets and one each against the 1-15 Cleveland Browns, 2-14 San Francisco 49ers and 4-12 Los Angeles Rams. During the seven-game win streak to end the season, coach Bill Belichick had to overcome just one playoff team: the Dolphins in the last regular-season game of the season.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Take a look at the quarterbacks the Patriots have faced this season. The blue line represents the passer's end-of-season Total Quarterback Rating, ESPN's metric to value a quarterback on all play types on a 0-to-100 scale, and the red line is the average QBR of the top 20 passers in the NFL heading into Week 17. As you can see, it would take more than backups like Charlie Whitehurst, Jared Goff, Matt Moore and Landry Jones to throw a scare into Brady and Belichick. Moore, the Patriots' opponent in Week 17, has a high QBR but was making his third start of the season, so discard that due to sample size. Other passers faced included Ryan Fitzpatrick (twice), the second-to-worst passer this season per QBR, Trevor Siemian, Brock Osweiler and Joe Flacco. None even met the average of a QB in the top two-thirds of the league.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Beating weak opponents issue free is exactly what you want to see from a good team like the Patriots, however, it may have masked a potential weakness by helping to make New England's defense look better than it is. The Patriots allowed a league-low 1.4 points per drive, yet per Football Outsiders, the average offense they played against in 2016 was equivalent to the 7-8-1 Arizona Cardinals, a team that went three-and-out once out of every four drives, 23rd highest rate in the NFL.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "One point before we proceed: their defense isn't clearly a weakness, but we just don't know based on their scheduling. And what we do know is that one metric paints a pretty murky picture about their defense's potential to be great in the playoffs.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Pressuring the passer hasn't been a strength for the Patriots in recent history, but it has never been this bad in the Brady-era, either. This season, the team has a sack rate of 5.4 percent after adjusting for down, distance and opponent. The league average is 6.1 percent. In other words, the Patriots still ranked 23rd in the NFL despite not having to face very good offenses this year — and that will most certainly change in the playoffs. But the mitigating factor is when the Patriots will face those good offenses.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "The Patriots will play the lowest remaining seed in the AFC during the divisional round, with potential opponents including the Miami Dolphins, Houston Texans and Oakland Raiders. The Kansas City Chiefs are the No. 2 seed, the Steelers the No. 3 and they could play New England in the AFC Championship Game. Two of those opposing offensive lines, the Raiders and Chiefs, tied for the least amount of pressure allowed this season (117 total sacks, hits and hurries allowed). The Steelers ranked seventh (133 pressures allowed). That's challenging for any team to overcome, especially one with a mediocre pass rush.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Injuries to Derek Carr, Oakland's starting quarterback (and potentially to backup Matt McGloin), and the presence of Alex Smith under center for the Chiefs might not be enough to sway you from backing New England as the eventual Super Bowl winner, but the Patriots will also have to beat a team from the NFC in order to claim the ultimate prize. And the Steelers could present a challenge as well. Remember, Ben Roethlisberger missed the earlier meeting between the Patriots and Steelers.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Roethlisberger finished ranked No. 10 in QBR. In the other conference, the two top seeds in the NFC boast the second and third-best passers in the NFL per QBR, Ryan and Prescott, and Rodgers is close behind at No. 4. Matthew Stafford of the Detroit Lions finished at No. 8.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan led the league with a 130.4 passer rating in a clean pocket. Cowboys QB Dak Prescott ranked third (118.0) and the Packers' Aaron Rodgers ranked eighth (106.7). Rodgers proved this year that even when you pressure him he is still going to beat you. He threw 10 touchdowns and just one interception under pressure for a league-high 90.8 passer rating, a rating higher than the one produced by Carolina Panthers starting quarterback Cam Newton in a clean pocket (87.8) this season.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "The No. 3 seed in the NFC, the Seattle Seahawks, saw its quarterback, Russell Wilson, produce the second-best passer rating (881.) and complete over half of his passes (55.4 percent) under pressure, despite a porous offensive line.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "One player to watch for New England is linebacker Dont'a Hightower. He finished 2016 with 25 total sacks, hits and hurries in 13 games, the most he has played since 2013, and was the highest-rated pass-rushing linebacker this season per the game charters at Pro Football Focus. The problem there? He was that good and the Patriots' pass-rush was still mediocre. New England will need to see its other players overachieve if they are going to ramp up the pressure.", "label": 9}

You know, if you told me as a kid growing up in the Bay there'd be a movie called 'Black Panther' that starts off in Oakland, this is not what I would have imagined. Ryan, were there, like, a bunch of old members of the actual Black Panther Party saying, 'I can't even get an audition?' Just kidding.
