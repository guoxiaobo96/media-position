Doug Mills/The New York Times Chief executives and other leaders from many of America's largest businesses on Monday urged Congress to certify the electoral vote on Wednesday to confirm Joseph R.

Over the weekend, President Trump called Georgia's Republican secretary of state in an effort to subvert the election results.

Vasily Fedosenko/Reuters Officials from OPEC, Russia and other major oil-producing countries were unable on Monday to reach agreement on whether to allow further increases in oil output in the face of reduced demand from the pandemic. The videoconference was adjourned and was expected to be continued on Tuesday. The main issue in the meeting was whether to allow members of the group to raise oil production in February. During a difficult meeting in December, the group, known as OPEC Plus, reached a compromise that permitted production to increase by 500,000 barrels a day starting Jan. 1, instead of a previously agreed two million barrels a day. The group also agreed to meet monthly to consider whether further increases were warranted. The first of those monthly meetings, on Monday, highlighted differences in the group. Producers like Russia, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates have their reasons for wanting to lift production. But other members, led by Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, are pushing to proceed cautiously. With the pandemic worsening in Europe and the United States, the Saudi-led bloc figures the demand for oil remains relatively weak, and rising production would probably lead to falling prices.", "label": 6}

{"sentence": "For so many who have called themselves Eagles fans for a generation, this is the day, the game, the season, and the team we've dreamed of. The 2017-18 Philadelphia Eagles are Super Bowl Champions, and they've brought tremendous joy to hundreds of thousands throughout the City and region. They consistently wowed us with their dynamic play and relentless pursuit of victory. Their Next Man Up mentality when injuries arose was inspiring to anyone who has ever faced a setback, as was their willingness to embrace the role of underdogs. They looked another storied football franchise in the eyes, and never blinked. So to every member of the Eagles, from owners Jeff and Tina Lurie, and Christina Weiss Lurie, to Howie Roseman and the entire front office staff, to Doug Pederson and his coaches, and to the players who won our hearts with their resilient and exciting play: thank you. You are champions, and your accomplishments will forever be part of the rich history of Philadelphia sports. To the fans: I have long felt that our City's professional and collegiate sports teams bring Philadelphians together, regardless of race, income, neighborhood or gender, and that was never more true than during the Eagles' brilliant season. We know you have waited years, some for decades, for the chance to crown your Birds as champs. I urge everyone to celebrate in a way that is safe and respectful to everyone from neighbors to strangers.

Yet the result is not a hagiography lauding the careers of these enlightened capitalists, which includes everyone from chocolate magnate Milton Hershey to cosmetics and skin care founder Anita Roddick, but a cautionary look at how so many of their sustainable practices were cut short by bankruptcies, acquisitions or unwilling successors — and what other executives can learn from them. At a time when more and more consumers expect business to benefit the greater good, the book is timely. It asks big questions like whether socially virtuous business tactics are actually compatible with shareholder capitalism, and, as he writes in the preface, what may matter most: Whether in the collective judgment of corporate executives, executives actually believe it is possible — or sensible — to try to do good as they seek to do well.", "label": 9}

The New York Stock Exchange said Monday that it had halted plans to delist China Telecom, China Unicom and China Mobile. Credit... Alex Plavevski/EPA, via Shutterstock The Trump administration and members of Congress pressured the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday to remove China's three major state-run telecommunications companies from the exchange. The stock exchange late Monday had reversed its original plans, announced last week, to delist the companies to comply with an executive order from the administration aimed at stopping American investment in companies linked to the Chinese military. Monday's sudden reversal by the exchange sowed confusion and reflected the ongoing fighting within the Trump administration about how hard a line to take against China during President Trump's final days in office. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has been pushing for greater accommodation for Chinese companies, while officials in the Department of Defense have argued that the companies in question must be delisted for national security reasons. The Big Board said late on Monday that it had halted plans to delist the companies after consulting with the Treasury Department. The about-face came a week after the exchange said it would stop the trading of shares in China Unicom, China Telecom and China Mobile by Jan. 11 in response to a Trump administration executive order that blocked Americans from investing in companies tied to the Chinese military.", "label": 6}

In 1970, the movement was called women's liberation or, contemptuously, Women's Lib. When the name libbers was dropped for feminists, we were all relieved.

AMC, +3.24% were down more than 2% in premarket trade on Wednesday after being downgraded to sector perform from outperform at RBC Capital Markets. RBC analysts wrote in a note that their tepid view of the 2018 box office and AMC's high leverage make for a challenging combination for the company. We'd likely get more bullish on AMC if the box office outlook (given its leverage) and, or there was traction on the international IPO, lead analyst Leo Kulp wrote. As was evidenced in 2017, AMC's leverage makes it very susceptible to changes in multiple. We estimate a one point EV/EBITDA multiple change has a 36% impact on the stock price. While this is a positive in an up year for the box office, the uncertainty around the 2018 box office makes us more conservative. Kulp expects that the 2018 box office will be flat compared with 2017, which was down slightly from the last two years. They said they see fewer big event films being released this year, and instead more non-sequel content, which could be a negative or a positive depending on how the shift in the box office is received. Shares of AMC have declined more than 59% in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% is up more than 21% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% is up nearly 28%.", "label": 8}

In some cases, vaccine hesitancy has contributed to lower demand as well, they say. Shipments also have been unpredictable, sometimes arriving later than expected or in smaller quantities than previous allotments, making it difficult to plan for distribution. Protocols require a 15-minute observation window for each patient, limiting the number of people who can cycle through a chair each day. This is not your routine stop by the primary care office to get a flu shot. This is a whole different operation, said Dr. Andy Thomas, chief clinical officer at Ohio State University's Wexner Medical Center.

The unusual gathering will give Europeans a chance to coordinate plans among all 28 member states. Leaders have been reluctant to publicly condemn the United States for Soleimani's killing, focusing most of their ire on Iran, which they view as the core threat to their security interests. But they have invested more than a year of efforts to try to preserve the 2015 Iran nuclear deal following Trump's pullout. Many European diplomats view Soleimani's death as the final blow to hopes that the accord could hold together until the possible election in November of a U.S. president more supportive of the nuclear agreement than Trump. Iran on Sunday announced that it would take major additional steps to depart from the terms of the nuclear accord, although it stopped short of saying it would significantly increase its uranium enrichment. Europeans took that as a sign that Tehran is still interested in extracting concessions in exchange for returning to at least partial adherence to the deal, rather than walking away from it altogether.

Those same people think that, for once, marching and shouting were effective. Reluctant authorities gave in to the women's screaming, and allowed a tide of feticide to sweep the world. This is not what happened. In the United States, the crucial factor was a decision in the Supreme Court in the case of Roe v. Wade, which upheld the principle that, as the law had no part to play in what passed between a woman and her doctor, intervention by the state to prevent an abortion was a breach of the patient's privacy. Jane Roe or Norma McCorvey, a sometime carnival barker and druggie who was pregnant for the third time, was the stooge selected by a young Texas lawyer. She has subsequently been born again and now repudiates her part in the decision that legalised abortion in the U.S. The decision in Roe v. Wade did nothing to confront, let alone resolve, the deep moral conflicts surrounding the issue of abortion. Pregnancy is unlike other patient-doctor relations in that there are two other individuals involved—the father-to-be and the child-to-be. Every time a fetus is recognised as a party to other litigation, the safety of the decision in the case of Roe v. Wade is called into question.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "Women's liberation did not see the female's potential in terms of the male's actual; the visionary feminists of the late sixties and early seventies knew that women could never find freedom by agreeing to live the lives of unfree men. Seekers after equality clamoured to be admitted to smoke-filled male haunts. Liberationists sought the world over for clues to what women's lives could be like if they were free to define their own values, order their own priorities and decide their own fate. The Female Eunuch was one feminist text that did not argue for equality. At a debate in Oxford, one William J. Clinton heard me arguing that equality legislation could not give me the right to have broad hips or hairy thighs, to be at ease in my woman's body. Thirty years on, femininity is still compulsory for women—and has become an option for men—while genuine femaleness remains grotesque to the point of obscenity. Meanwhile, the price of the small advances we have made towards sexual equality has been the denial of femaleness as any kind of a distinguishing character. In the last 30 years, women have come a long, long way; our lives are nobler and richer than they were, but they are also fiendishly difficult.

If we accept every instance of abortion as the outcome of unwanted and easily avoided pregnancy, we have to ask ourselves how it is that women are still exposing themselves to this risk. A woman who is unable to protect her cervix from exposure to male hyperfertility is certainly not calling the shots. The man is most likely to have initiated the episode of intercourse, to have chosen the place and the time; the woman is probably still dancing backwards. If the child is unwanted, whether by her or her partner or her parents, it will be her duty to undergo an invasive procedure and an emotional trauma, and so sort the situation out. The crowning insult is that this ordeal is represented to her as some kind of a privilege: her sad and onerous duty is garbed in the rhetoric of a civil right. She is confronted with other people who know better than she what she ought to do. She will be required to undergo investigations of her pregnancy for which there is no treatment but termination, whether she would countenance a termination or not. If she undergoes the tests, say for Down's Syndrome, and refuses the termination, she will be asked why she had the test in the first place. And she will probably be talked into the termination.

Cold weather and the holiday season, too, have likely added difficulties for people with existing mental illnesses and those experiencing acute stress, she said. As a way to help, Sullivan encouraged Hoosiers to use the state-run BeWellIndiana.org to take a mental health self-assessment. Since April, more than 25,000 Hoosiers have completed those assessments.

Not only are many women not at present half of a couple, and not likely to become so, but they are also sexually inactive, which is a dereliction of their duty to themselves and the body politic. There is very little they can do about this, bar spending a fortune on body, clothes, face and hair, because, though they can signal availability in a dozen ways, they cannot actually make themselves attractive. The power to make an object attractive lies with the beholder of the object, not the object itself. As a woman grows older, her chances of mating on any but humiliating terms grow less and less. The constant pressure to be sexually active, which has replaced the old pressure to reproduce, actually places unmated women in jeopardy, and fills them with anxiety and the sense of failure. It is the greater pity then that so many feminists accept and perpetuate the notion that people who are not sexually active are of no account. So let this feminist say it again: No sex is better than bad sex. Bad sex is bad for you. Looking for sex can be humiliating, disappointing and dangerous.

A summary of the investigation was released earlier in December, but Noonan, who was commission chairman since 2017, had resisted an open records request from the Post-Dispatch to release the full report. Officials inside Parson's administration and state Sen. Jill Schupp, a Democrat from Creve Coeur, had urged Noonan to release the full report, and he did so after Attorney General Eric Schmitt directed him to, Noonan said. That came after Parson on Wednesday expressed frustration with the commission, which is an independent body.

A police officer in the Port of Dover, England, checks a driver's coronavirus test on Monday before allowing the truck onto a ferry. Credit... Glyn Kirk/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images On the first working day after Britain left the European Union's single market and customs union, the traffic trickling through the country's busiest port was running smoothly. So far, the imposition of customs declarations for British exporters, the first in decades, hasn't led to the delays some had predicted. But the transition has been made easier by low levels of truck traffic. The Eurotunnel and ferry operators, which carry trucks across the English Channel, said boats and trains were running on time on Monday. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said on Sunday that 98 percent of the trucks heading to mainland Europe via Dover and nearby terminals had the documents they needed. But traffic numbers were low because of the New Year's Day holiday and weekend. The amount of goods flowing between the two countries was also low because companies had stockpiled last year amid uncertainty about whether London and Brussels would sign a trade deal and eliminate potential tariffs by Dec. 31, the end of the Brexit transition period. Much of Britain is also under strict business and social restrictions to curb the pandemic.", "label": 6}

In a television interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corp., Sajjan said that the Iraqi parliament's decision to pass a nonbinding resolution calling on all foreign troops to leave the country created a complex situation. We know the current situation is now far more complicated, and we have to accept their process, he said, but it is more complicated than just one vote. Canada has hundreds of military personnel in Iraq as part of both the NATO mission and the global coalition fighting the Islamic State. It has suspended both of those missions, but Sajjan said he hopes they will continue. He told the CBC that Canada has taken the appropriate steps for force protection in Iraq and that some nonessential personnel have been moved out of the country in the wake of Soleimani's killing. Asked if U.S. officials had given Canada notice of their plan to kill the Iranian general, Sajjan said that Canada had an indication something was going to happen but did not know what was going to happen. In a television interview on Monday with CTV News, Sajjan condemned Iran's actions in the region but would not comment on whether he thought Soleimani's killing was legal.", "label": 9}

McKenzie told him the draft letter was an honest mistake, but used other words that were a little more colorful than mistake, Milley said.

{"sentence": "In the United States, surgical abortion is usually a 10-minute procedure—vacuum aspiration with local anaesthetic; in Canada, a cumbersome two-stage procedure, involving the insertion of a laminaria tent, and dilatation and curette under general anaesthetic 24 hours later, is preferred; in Russia, which has the highest abortion rate in the world, no anaesthesia is used; in Britain, vacuum aspiration under general anaesthetic is usual. Recently, the use of better pregnancy testing and smaller cannulas has made possible the surgical removal of the fertilised ovum as early as eight to 10 days after conception, when it is no bigger than a pinhead—at much the same point that it would be shed by the women using the contraceptive pill or an intrauterine device. At the time of writing, only about 20 of the clinics affiliated with Planned Parenthood are using the method—and only in the United States. To be pregnant against your will is to see your life swerve out of control. To become a mother without wanting to is to live like a slave or a domestic animal. Like any other adult, a woman would wish to be infertile and fertile when appropriate: she is led to believe that contraception is her duty and that the available techniques are easy to use and completely effective. If she were totally in control of the manner in which she is sexually active, she might insist that her male partner control his excessive fertility rather than delegating to her the responsibility for inhibiting his power to fecundate.

{"sentence": "The less she expected it, the more generous he feels for having done it. To her anxious question Do you love me? he has an easy answer. Of course. I married you, didn't I? The interesting thing about this particular con is that men need marriage more than women do. A man without a wife is fragile; prisons are full of men who never married and unmarried men are more likely to die violently. A wife, whose first duty is to stand by her man, reassure him, build up his confidence and attend to his creature comforts, is an asset to any man; performing such a role is not necessarily advantageous to the performer. Yet marriage is represented to women rather than men as a sign of success so effectively that failure in a woman's pair-bonding will neutralise success in any other field. Success which might put pressure on her pair-bond is success too dearly bought. Magazine after magazine offers young women advice on how to get their man to commit himself; there is nothing comparable in men's literature. Men buy literature about men's toys and pastimes; women buy magazines about men and relationships. Though young men have searing anxieties of their own about relationships, relationships are not represented to them as the only things of value in their lives. This fundamental asymmetry distorts all youthful male-female interaction: the girls put too much into their sexual relationships and set too much store by them, making demands that immature males cannot afford to recognise.

Speaking to reporters at the Pentagon, Milley said very, very few people saw the intelligence, which he said demonstrated that Soleimani was planning imminent operations against U.S. forces in the region. I would be happy when the appropriate time comes, in front of proper committees and anybody else, in history, I will stand by the intelligence I saw. That was compelling. It was imminent. It was very, very clear in scale/scope, Milley said. Did it exactly say who, what, when, where? No. But he was planning, coordinating and synchronizing significant combat operations against U.S. military forces in the region — and it was imminent, Milley added. Milley said he wouldn't give any more details about the intelligence because such a disclosure would jeopardize the sources and methods of the U.S. intelligence apparatus. I know people say, well, you're hiding behind it, and you lie. That's not true. I know what I saw, Milley said.

Wall Street began the year with a tumble on Monday, with the S&P 500 suffering its steepest decline in more than two months as it retreated from record territory. Analysts traced the sell-off to a number of factors, including political jitters stemming from Tuesday's runoff election in Georgia — which will determine control of the U.S. Senate — concerns about a resurgent coronavirus, and the simple need for investors to take a breather after a stretch of sizzling gains. It wasn't clear that the slump would continue into Tuesday. Stocks in Asian markets were steady early on Tuesday, while futures markets suggested that Wall Street would stabilize when it opens. The index fell 1.5 percent, its sharpest drop since late October. Stocks that have been most sensitive to investor sentiment about the coronavirus pandemic led the decline.

The notice stated that the new tax was novel and that determination of the creditability of the Excise Tax requires the resolution of a number of legal and factual issues.

By reducing his stake in Herbalife, the investor will also give up five board seats held by his designees. Credit... Karsten Moran for The New York Times The billionaire financier Carl Icahn has begun to cash out of his nearly decade-long bet on the nutritional food supplements company Herbalife, an investment that survived both regulatory review and a prominent — though unsuccessful — challenge by another activist investor. Herbalife said late on Sunday that it would buy back about $600 million worth of stock held by Mr. Icahn, who has been the company's biggest shareholder since 2013. Doing so would also mean that he will give up five board seats held by his designees. The move, which will reduce Mr. Icahn's stake to 6 percent from 13 percent, caps an investment success few could have foreseen in late 2012, when the billionaire first poured money into Herbalife. At the time, Mr. Icahn pushed back against a campaign by William A. Ackman, the manager of the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, who had prominently accused the company of being an illegal pyramid scheme on the verge of being shut down. Mr. Ackman shorted Herbalife shares, wagering that their price would fall to zero, eventually pouring $1 billion into his bet.

Haven, the joint venture of Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase that was formed three years ago to explore new ways to deliver health care to the companies' employees, is disbanding, according to a statement posted on its website. It will cease its operations at the end of February. The Haven team made good progress exploring a wide range of health care solutions, as well as piloting new ways to make primary care easier to access, insurance benefits simpler to understand and easier to use, and prescription drugs more affordable, Brooke Thurston, Haven's spokeswoman, said in a statement. Haven aimed to improve how people gain access to health care by pulling together the know-how and scale of three of the largest employers in America. Its formation sent shock waves through the markets, driving health insurers' stocks lower as investors wagered that the power of the three behemoths combined would completely upend the country's health care delivery system by testing new ideas on more than a million employees. In a note to employees on Monday announcing Haven's end, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said the three companies would continue to share information.

My strong women thrust their muscular feet into high heels and learned to totter; they stuffed their useful breasts into brassieres and, instead of mothers' milk, fed commercial formulae made up with dirty water to their children; they spent their tiny store of cash on lipstick and nail varnish, and were made modern.

Every issue of every woman's magazine exploits women's anxiety about unwanted hair. Even if you escape hairiness, you will fall foul of cellulite. When The Female Eunuch has written, cellulite was a French disease. The English word should by rights be cellulitis, but, as British pharmaceutical companies jumped on a bandwagon set off by sales campaigns for French products, they adopted the French word. Cellulite is subcutaneous fat, pure and simple. It keeps women warm and softens the contours of their bodies and, if it builds up, it often dimples. Whether or not your fat dimples is a matter of genetic endowment; some women have tight smooth fat and some women have softer fat, which droops and dimples, even on their knees, invariably on their bottoms. The characteristic orange-peel appearance can be seen even in the bottoms of babies who have not eaten chocolate, drunk coffee or alcohol or smoked, or committed any other of the sins that are punishable by cellulite. Once upon a time, men and women both admired dimply fat; it took 20th-century marketing to render it disgusting. Most of what is written about globular fat cells, poor lymphatic drainage and toxins that have solidified is cynical tosh. Dimply fat will only disappear if it is starved off; no amount of pounding or vibrating or massaging will have any effect on it whatsoever.", "label": 9}

The three board members in favor of the idea cite a section of Vermont law that they believe allows them to reject the governor's order. Select board member Daniel Potvin said during the meeting that quarantine requirements, restrictions on large family or public gatherings, and face mask requirements violate the constitution in part because they were imposed without normal due process of law. He asserted it was important to stand up against such measures because it could lead to more loss of personal freedoms later on.

Men do get sexually transmitted diseases so they do use condoms, sometimes, but nowhere near as often as they should. These days, contraception is abortion, because the third-generation Pills cannot be shown to prevent sperm fertilising an ovum. Yet no one feels so strongly against abortion at any stage that they picket the factories where birth control pills are produced. IUDs are clearly abortifacient: these devices work by creating inflammation of the uterus, often accompanied by infection. Women who accept them as contraceptive devices are actually being equipped with a do-it-yourself abortionist's tool. The outcome is frequent occult abortion, heavy bleeding and pelvic inflammatory disease, with the accompanying elevated risk of ectopic pregnancy. Whether you feel that the creation and wastage of so many embryos is an important issue or not, you must see that the cynical deception of millions of women by selling abortifacients as if they were contraceptives is incompatible with the respect due to women as human beings. You must also see that expecting women to be grateful for the opportunity to have inserted into their bodies instruments for sucking and scraping out the products of avoidable conception shows them as much contempt.

{"sentence": "Greer on Marriage Some of the briefest marriages are those that follow a long period of cohabitation. Nobody quite knows why this is so, but the theory is that unforced cohabitation is less oppressive than sanctioned cohabitation. Marriage does make a difference; even when the marriage service does not contain the bride's pledge to love, honour and obey, it acts in the interest of a husband rather than a wife. Though the bride herself may not feel that she has left the family of her father and been taken into the family of her husband, the ancient dynamic still prevails. His friends will now be her friends, but her friends are unlikely to become his; even if her parents are not entirely displaced by his, his will take precedence. The dynamic of mutual accommodation that propelled a couple's informal cohabitation is unnecessary once marriage has confined them. As both are bound, the power will come to be concentrated in the person best prepared to take advantage of the situation, and that person is the male partner. Having been so lucky as to acquire a wife, he begins to take the liberties that husbands have traditionally taken, comes and goes as he pleases, spends more time outside the connubial home, spends more money on himself, leaves off the share of the housework that he may have formerly done. She sees her job as making him happy; he feels that in marrying her, he has done all that is necessary to make her happy.", "label": 9}

Charlie Baker signed a wide-ranging health care bill Friday that he said will codify in law many of the emergency changes made to the state system in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The Republican said the new law extends requirements for all insurance carriers in Massachusetts to cover COVID-19 testing and treatment. It also increases insurance coverage for telehealth services, which have become vital during the pandemic. Baker's office said the law also expands the scope of practice for nurse practitioners, other specialized nurses and optometrists; takes steps to protect consumers from surprise medical bills; and calls for a study on the effects of COVID-19 on the health care system, among other steps. Meanwhile, a COVID-19 field hospital that was supposed to open at UMass Lowell last week instead will open Monday after staffing shortages delayed the soft launch. While the site has capacity for 77 beds, the facility has so far only recruited enough nurses to staff one 14-bed pod.

However, Ducey spokesman C.J. Karamargin said the governor will not be considering this request or issuing this kind of mandate. This is a local decision.

The merger with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is intended to help both companies make the transition to electric vehicles. Credit... Radovan Stoklasa/Reuters Shareholders of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and PSA, the French maker of Peugeot, Citroën and Opel cars, voted on Monday to merge as the companies try to survive a transition to electric vehicles. The new company, called Stellantis, would be the world's fourth-largest carmaker based on vehicle sales during the first nine months of 2020 and would employ 400,000 people. Executives of Fiat Chrysler and PSA agreed to merge at the end of 2019 and have been working out the details and securing regulatory approval since then. But the new company faces major challenges.

Women do menial work because it turns them on; it doesn't turn men on, therefore they should not be expected to do it. Strange, isn't it, how much men know about sensations they have never had? Kaufman knows a woman in whom dish-washing produces explosions of joy.

Faking it in bed has clearly not been enough; now women are having to fake sexual arousal even when they are cleaning the toilet.", "label": 9}

Any feminist who saw abortion as an assault on women and agitated for a concomitant right to bear children without being condemned to poverty, misery and failure was suspected of being a crypto-right-to-lifer.

Even after a decline of as much as 10 percent on Monday, the price of Bitcoin is up so far this year to about $31,000, adding to a furious rally at the end of 2020 that pushed the cryptocurrency near $30,000 a coin, a level it breached over the weekend.

Remember, she will be told, beauty starts from within, so she keeps her bowels open with plenty of fibre and her kidneys flushed with lots of pure water. Being beautiful from within takes even more time than slapping beauty on from without. Demi Moore is said to work out for four hours a day, beginning with a cardiovascular aerobic workout, then working her legs and buttocks with pliés, standing lunges and thigh lifts, her upper body with shoulder and punching exercises, and toning her abdominal muscles. She also eats only non-processed, pesticide-free, totally vegetarian foods. The result—taut abs, a rock-hard butt and twanging musculature—was still not enough to save her marriage. Whatever a woman does, she must not look her age. The fitness regime is lifelong, to go with the lifelong sexual activity that is nowadays obligatory.

Of the 265,000 doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that have been delivered to New Jersey, 72,657 residents had been given a shot by Thursday afternoon. Despite months of planning, state officials said Wednesday that a lack of personnel, along with logistics and timing issues, was to blame. Remember, you need health care workers to do this, Gov. Phil Murphy said at a briefing. I'm not qualified to deliver these vaccines. The slow rollout has been frustrating to a public eager to end a pandemic that has infected at least 477,000 New Jerseyans, killed more than 19,000 and caused vast economic hardship. State Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said the rollout of the Moderna vaccine in particular has been slow because it was delivered just before Christmas.

We can walk it down the age continuum, make it available for seventy-five and above first, then seventy above, then sixty-five and above. There's fifty million Americans sixty-five and above, a large percentage of them probably want to be vaccinated. At some point we need to allow supply to meet demand here and get the-- the shots into the arms of the people who really want to get vaccinated and are going to go out and seek out the vaccination. If we're pushing it through the retail pharmacies, you're not going to see the long lines. They're going to have a scheduling system in place and it's going to be a more orderly distribution.

The initial rollout of the vaccine has been slow, slower than anticipated, slower than we wanted, said Rich Lakin, immunization program director with the Utah Department of Health. We hope to be at a much faster pace in the next 15 days. Utah is already starting to speed up the process, health department spokesperson Tom Hudachko said Thursday. More than 6,000 doses were reportedly administered in the state Thursday, double the daily increases earlier in the week. What's making the difference, Hudachko said, is that local health departments, including tribal clinics, and long-term care facilities are able to give doses much faster than hospitals. In Davis County, a mass drive-thru clinic at the Legacy Events Center is able to vaccinate 28 health care workers at a time with appointments, he said.
