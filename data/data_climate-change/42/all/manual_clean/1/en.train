The lawsuit, filed in August by Dillinger nephew Michael C. Thompson, was initially dismissed without prejudice by Marion County Superior Court Judge Timothy Oakes on Dec. 4, but Thompson was granted an extension of time to file an amended complaint. That deadline would have been Jan. 15. But on Tuesday, a motion to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit was submitted to the court on Thompson's behalf. It has been granted, effectively putting the issue to rest. Since the lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice, the family could revisit the issue in court. It's unknown what Thompson's plans are moving forward or how this affects the status of the proposed documentary. Attempts to reach the Thompson family and their attorney, Andrea Simmons, were unsuccessful. Crown Hill Cemetery objected to plans to exhume Dillinger's body, citing a duty to ensure the safety and integrity of the grounds and those buried there. In a written statement sent to IndyStar, cemetery management said they were pleased the matter has been resolved. Dillinger, born in Indianapolis in 1903, gained notoriety after a string of bank robberies in 1933 and several high-profile escapes from police custody. His name became legend when FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover labeled him Public Enemy No. 1, but his life of crime came to an end when police and federal agents ambushed him outside Chicago's Biograph Theater on July 22, 1934.", "augmented": []}

The season initially looked like it could produce a substantial drop in catch, but Maine's lobstermen finished strong, Keliher said. The price for Maine lobster was also strong, he said.

More than 20,000 acres of federal and state public lands along the river that were acquired to protect and restore the river's riparian and aquatic habitats, could be degraded by the diversions. In addition to reducing flows in the Sacramento River, the reservoir would drown up to 15,000 acres of existing oak woodlands, grasslands, wetlands, and agricultural land in the western Sacramento Valley. Impacts associated with the reservoir footprint would harm the federally protected bald eagle, a host of other sensitive wildlife species, several rare plants, and significant historical and cultural resources. The Sites Project Authority, a consortium of water districts and local governments, claim that the reservoir could store up to 1.8 million acre feet of water (making it the seventh largest reservoir in the state) and reliably yield about a half million acre feet of water annually for communities, farms, and the environment. But this yield estimate fails to adequately consider the effects of climate change, chronic drought, and reservoir evaporation on project storage and deliveries. …", "augmented": []}

According to Firestone, the problem eluded them because manufacturers never properly analyzed data and personnel claims to identify defects or problems with tires. They say the university of claims data is simply too small. But a staff examination of the records, revealed since 1995 Firestone had reports on more than 1,600 lawsuits, property claims and personal injury claims involving their recalled tires. I must say I find it curious that Firestone did not regard 1,600 claims as significant when it took only 21 claims for State Farm Insurance Company to decide that a potential problem existed. Records available to the committee also indicate that some in Firestone, in apparent contradiction of its statements to committee staff and others, analyzed their claims dated 1998. These Firestone analyses show that the claims were especially high for ATX tires, and the claims were highest for tires produced at the Decatur, Illinois, plant. Contrary to Firestone's other assertions, at least one other American tire company, Goodyear, says it routinely looks at all its customer data, including claims data, to identify defect or failure trends with its tires.

Snowmobiling can be an expensive pastime. There's the expensive machine, helmet and cold-weather clothing, the cost to travel to a spot with enough snow and the expenses of a weekend of roaring across groomed trails. But Mecher purchased the 1990 Polaris Indy 500 snowmobile a few weeks ago, made a few minor repairs to get it running and left for his father's house in Bessemer last Friday. Mecher said It took about an hour to load the snowmobile on the roof of his 2005 Chevy Malibu, using an old blue Ford tractor with a bucket. He modified the end of the snowmobile to keep the machine's track from caving in the roof or breaking the rear window.

The figure is tentative because if someone dies as a result of injuries from a 2019 crash within the first 30 days of 2020, that person's death would be added to the list of fatalities from 2019.

That is twice the Earth's circumference, with a road trip from Delaware to Myrtle Beach, S.C. to spare. The bridge also had a record for a month in August, handling more than 1.8 million vehicles, surpassing the August 2003 record by 27,000. Officials said the record traffic volume could be associated with an improving economy and stable gasoline prices in addition to favorable beach weather. All those vehicles means a good chunk of change in toll revenue. Last year, the net total was an estimated $132.8 million, up roughly $27 million from the previous year.

But lately, that notion has been tested — by the pandemic; by violent encounters between African-Americans and the police; and by the fluctuating divide between metropolitan Atlanta and the much more conservative and traditional state surrounding it. The pandemic has laid bare gaps in access to opportunity and health care, as the virus has hit the African-American community especially hard. It has also galvanized ideological divides between the city and the state, as the mayor and governor sparred over adopting strict measures to curb the virus's spread. Protests forced many to examine the stubbornness of institutional racism. A meltdown during the summer primaries, with long lines and malfunctioning voting machines, stoked concerns over suppression. Those issues are certainly not Atlanta's alone. But again and again in recent months, the city emerged as an arena in which those tensions played out in vivid and revelatory ways.

Lincoln's love for the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence is evident. When he was visited by a delegation of powerful American leaders who had participated in a peace conference in Washington prior to his inauguration, Lincoln was urged to accommodate the demands of the secessionists. As described by one who was there, Lincoln calmly, clearly told the men lecturing him: I will, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. … It is not the Constitution as I would like to have it, but as it is, that is to be defended.

An avalanche happened at about 11 a.m. Tuesday on Wardner Peak, an area of the resort where the ski runs are rated at the highest difficulty level, according to resort officials. The runs had just been opened for a short period after crews performed avalanche control blasting in the area Tuesday morning, using explosives to trigger avalanches in hopes of leaving only the stable snow layers on the runs, officials said. Rescue crews and volunteers searched the avalanche area Tuesday with dogs and probes. The resort previously said five people had been recovered with minor injuries but said Wednesday afternoon that there were four people. Another skier was discovered Tuesday under about 10 feet of snow and did not survive. Yet another was found after dark. He was taken to a local hospital and pronounced dead.

However, they still took issue with how the Department of Business Regulation proposed regulations for dispensaries, with Mattiello calling it blatant overreach by the executive branch. The legislation not only removes the controversial provision, but also imposes limits on regulators. Among them, regulators would be barred from limiting dispensaries based on geographical zones and from preventing any center from growing its own supply of medical marijuana or limiting the number of plants.

Trenton's publicly owned water utility draws water from the Delaware River and serves some 200,000 customers in the city, in addition to surrounding communities of Ewing, Hamilton, Hopewell and Lawrence. Pipes will be replaced in phases as the city and Trenton Water Works, the public utility, continue to secure funds, which are coming from the state infrastructure bank, as well a federal program, according to David Smith, the water works chief engineer. Residents must register on the utility's website and pay $1,000 to have their lines replaced, Democratic Mayor Reed Gusciora said. That's a savings, he said, because replacement typically costs about $2,000-$5,000 per line.

In Georgia, the increase in Asian-American voters was so significant in the general election that they could play a decisive role in the two Senate runoff races this week. And on the ballot itself, Asian-American candidates were more visible in national politics than ever, most notably with Kamala Harris, a woman of South Asian descent, becoming the vice president-elect. But the election also offered some caution for Democrats who have long assumed that increasing racial diversity in the United States will benefit them at the ballot box: Demographics alone are not destiny. Asian-American voters and Latino voters made clear that while they generally support Democrats, they do not do so at the same rate as Black voters, and remain very much up for grabs by either party. At the presidential level, Asian-Americans cast a record number of ballots in battleground states where Joseph R. Biden Jr. notched narrow victories.

A Bombardier spokeswoman told the Times that the company's investigation of the cars showed that the doors had not been properly calibrated by a supplier, Nanjing Kangni Mechanical & Electrical of China. Transit workers complained that the new cars speedometer was hard to see, that the master controller used to drive the train was uncomfortable and the space between cars was too narrow for some workers to operate in.

They said all of the 2019 tornadoes were considered weak, ranking as either F0 or F1 in intensity. But in June 1972, an F2 tornado damaged about 200 homes in Paradise Valley and caused extensive damage to canals and power lines in Scottsdale and east Phoenix. The National Weather Service in Phoenix has data on tornadoes going back to 1950. Meteorologists said there were five confirmed tornadoes in the metro Phoenix area in both 1992 and 1993 with four tornadoes in 1971. Tornadoes are considered a rare event because the Phoenix area generally doesn't get the wind shear and unstable air mass needed to whip up the twisters.", "augmented": []}

The Corps said it was raising the discharge this month to 30,000 cubic feet per second, an increase of more than 11%. Until a seasonal decrease that began in November, the amount being released had been 80,000 cubic feet per second for months, also more than twice the average. Areas along the Missouri River and its tributaries in parts of Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa and Missouri were ravaged by floodwaters in the early spring. Heavy rains later in the year reflooded many areas that had been left unprotected because of levee failures. John Remus, chief of the Corps' Missouri River management, told the Omaha World-Herald the reservoir system needs to make as much space as possible in light of the National Weather Service forecast for warmer than normal weather and higher than normal runoff in January and February. The Corps normally doesn't release more during the winter because of the potential for ice jams and dams upriver, Remus told the Associated Press on Wednesday.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. LOU WATERS, CNN ANCHOR: We are covering the testimony about to be heard up on Capitol Hill before two House subcommittees. Opening statements are now being heard in the committee room. John Dingell from Michigan has the floor. Let's listen. (JOINED IN PROGRESS) REP. JOHN DINGELL (D), MICHIGAN: ... Bridgestone/Firestone announced August 9 as the second largest tire recall ever. It is surpassed only by Firestone's recall of 14.5 million tires in 1978. The recall in 1978 lead to hearings where this committee disclosed many of the same problems that are involved with the recall today. Then, like now, tread belt separations on Firestone tires were involved in accidents causing serious injury and death. Then, like now, many of Firestone's problems related to its client in Decatur, Illinois. The recent recall came about only after Ford Motor Company, whose vehicles were equipped with many of the recall tires, was given access to Firestone's claims data in late July, and was able to link 46 deaths and a large number of claims to accidents involving three 15- inch models of Firestone tires: ATX, ATXII and Wilderness AT. Since August 9, the number of fatalities attributed to these tires has grown to 88, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Time, then, is of the essence.", "augmented": []}

Yet most Republican members of Congress now seem to believe this theory, pointing to a thin report in Politico that documented no top-down, coordinated interference. Trump's racism (calling Mexican immigrants rapists; telling four congresswomen of color who are all U.S. citizens to go back to their crime infested home countries) and anti-Semitism (he implies Jews are loyal primarily to Israel and motivated mostly by money) align well with old allegations that Jewish bankers and assorted globalists have enriched themselves while inflicting economic havoc on the people, as his closing 2016 television ad suggested.", "augmented": []}

The board said a search for his replacement would begin immediately and the process will be discussed at an upcoming meeting. White can point to numerous improvements made during his eight years as education chief, including improved graduation rates and better performance on college preparation tests. His tenure was also marked by a rocky relationship with teacher unions and Gov. John Bel Edwards. And the state continues to lag others in nationwide education rankings. Still, his departure comes as his job seemed secure, following the election last year of a slate of state education board members who were backed by the state's business lobby, which was supportive of White. Although he didn't discuss his future, The Advocate reported in April that he had quietly co-founded a national nonprofit group, Propel America, aimed at connecting low-income high school graduates with solid jobs. White has been education superintendent since 2012 but he had been working on a month-to-month basis since 2016.

By Friday, the U.S. death toll topped 1,000, with more than 100,000 confirmed cases, overwhelming hospitals and forcing doctors to publicly beg for basic medical supplies. The economic fallout exceeded even the worst expectations: 3.3 million Americans filed jobless claims this week ― topping both Goldman Sachs' 2.25 million forecast from last week and smashing the previous one-week record of 695,000 reported job losses. Yet, as experts blamed the White House's back-footed response for inflaming the crisis, the Trump administration appeared to ramp up its environmental agenda, ordering the Environmental Protection Agency's enforcement division to temporarily stop policing polluters, approving a slate of mining projects, auctioning off new drilling leases and reviving a dormant fight over auto emission standards. The efforts on both the state and federal level offered jarring real-time examples of what the author Naomi Klein dubbed the shock doctrine: the phenomenon wherein polluters and their government allies push through unpopular policy changes under the smokescreen of a public emergency.

{"original": "Now, I have to caution that although seasonal flu peaks during the winter and it peters out in spring, when we have a pandemic influenza outbreak such as what happened in 2009, it can penetrate farther into the summer. The reason for this is there is heightened susceptibility in the human population that allows for transmission even as humidity conditions rise. The pandemic flu doesn't disappear until June, and then resurges again in late August and September as humidity starts to drop. So, if this novel emergent coronavirus were to follow this pattern, then it would probably continue circulating until May or June, then we'd get a break, and then we might get a second wave of it in September.

Every day, drivers rely on their vehicles and tires to carry them to destinations a mile or hundreds of miles away. They want to get where they're going and back safely. And the encouraging fact is that fatality rates have fallen in relation to vehicle miles traveled. Today we confront something out of the ordinary: a proportionally high number of accidents, some of them tragically fatal, principally involving Ford Explorers and Firestone tires. So the job of the two subcommittees here today to make sure that drivers and their families feel secure. My hope is that the Commerce Committee will be able to look at the Firestone recall situation in the detail it deserves. What caused these accidents? Was there a trend that could have been identified much earlier? What needs to be done in response? There will be questions about engineering, product quality and data review today.

Then the president suggested that Mr. Raffensperger could be prosecuted criminally. You know what they did and you're not reporting it, the president said. You know, that's a criminal — that's a criminal offense. And you know, you can't let that happen. That's a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer. That's a big risk.

Andy Beshear (D) signed legislation that ― while removing some of the original bill's most draconian measures on protest ― designated natural gas or petroleum pipelines as key infrastructure assets and made causing damage that totals more than $1,000 or tampering in a manner that renders the operations harmful or dangerous felony charges of criminal mischief in the first degree. Two days later, it was South Dakota. On March 18, Gov. Kristi Noem (R) signed a bill that expanded the definition of critical infrastructure to include virtually any oil, gas or utility equipment, and raised the charges for causing substantial interruption or impairment of such facilities to felonies. Five days later, on March 23, the governor approved a second measure defining a felony riot as intentional use of force or violence by three or more persons that causes any damage to property. On Wednesday, West Virginia followed suit. Gov. Jim Justice (R) greenlighted legislation assigning the same critical infrastructure status to a wide range of oil, gas and pipeline facilities, slapping fines as high as $20,000 on anyone found guilty of causing damage, destruction, vandalization, defacing or tampering that totals $2,500 or more.", "augmented": []}

Space Launch System rockets are expected to take astronauts to the moon as part of NASA's Artemis program. The core stage – which measures 212 feet from end to end and more than 27 feet in diameter – was transported like a giant Carnival float from the Michoud Assembly Center in eastern New Orleans to the barge as workers took pictures. It will undergo tests at Stennis ahead of the first Artemis launch, planned for 2021, said Tony Castilleja, a systems engineer with the Boeing Space Team. The SLS core stage, with four huge engines, is the largest rocket stage NASA has assembled since the Apollo stages that first powered crewed missions to the Moon. It will be used for Artemis I, a test-flight without a crew. Artemis II is to send up a crewed spacecraft.

The Kansas News Service reports the High Plains Mental Health Center in northwestern Kansas has long struggled to attract psychiatrists for patients in its 20-county coverage area. Executive Director Walt Hill stopped even trying because it typically took him more than a year to fill a position. Attracting psychiatric nurses is hard, too.

Paul Nestadt, one of the paper's authors, says the nation's opioid epidemic has clouded suicide classification across the nation. If you work in mental health, it is pretty clear there is a lot of overlap in the symptoms of someone who is using opiates and someone who may be suicidal, Nestadt said. State health officials say roughly 630 Utahns die from suicide and about 4,570 attempt suicide every year. Utah's suicide rate is above the national average, causing the deaths of 22.7 per 100,000 people in 2017, compared to a national rate of 14 people per 100,000.

Eleven Republican senators and senators-elect said they would join Senator Josh Hawley this week in challenging the results of the presidential election. Credit...

Biden Jr.'s victory when the House and the Senate meet to formally certify it. The announcement by the senators — and Mr. Pence's move to endorse it — reflected a groundswell among Republicans to defy the results of the election and indulge President Trump's attempts to remain in power with false claims of voting fraud. Every state in the country has certified the election results after verifying their accuracy, many following postelection audits or hand counts. Judges across the country, and a Supreme Court with a conservative majority, have rejected nearly 60 attempts by Mr. Trump and his allies to challenge the results. And neither Mr. Pence nor any of the senators who said they would vote to invalidate the election has made a specific allegation of fraud, instead offering vague suggestions that some wrongdoing might have occurred and asserting that many of their supporters believe that it has.

For instance, Twitter equips Trump to instantaneously air any theory, no matter how nutty, to raucous and affirming plaudits. Fox News also capitalizes on this shift to amplify Trumpian claims (Russia didn't hack our democracy, Fox host Tucker Carlson recently parroted). It's no wonder that, as Gallup found last February, 30 percent of Republicans see Russia in a favorable light.

Page and Kashkari told the newspaper in an interview that making quality education a civil right for all children is the catalyst that's needed to break the logjam that has blocked effective reform. Even though Minnesota has spent billions of dollars to solve the problem, the state still has some of the worst educational disparities in the nation, as measured by race and socioeconomic status, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Courts have interpreted the Minnesota Constitution as giving students a fundamental right to an adequate education. Page and Kashkari want to raise that standard to a quality education. Page and Kashkari said similar amendments have driven improvements in other states. To amend the Minnesota Constitution, they will need the Legislature's approval to put the question to voters.
