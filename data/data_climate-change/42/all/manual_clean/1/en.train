{"original": "consumers can also take little comfort from firestone's explanation of why it took so long to identify the firestone failure problem. according to firestone, the problem eluded them because manufacturers never properly analyzed data and personnel claims to identify defects or problems with tires. they say the university of claims data is simply too small. but a staff examination of the records, revealed since 1995 firestone had reports on more than 1,600 lawsuits, property claims and personal injury claims involving their recalled tires. i must say i find it curious that firestone did not regard 1,600 claims as significant when it took only 21 claims for state farm insurance company to decide that a potential problem existed. records available to the committee also indicate that some in firestone, in apparent contradiction of its statements to committee staff and others, analyzed their claims dated 1998. these firestone analyses show that the claims were especially high for atx tires, and the claims were highest for tires produced at the decatur, illinois, plant. contrary to firestone's other assertions, at least one other american tire company, goodyear, says it routinely looks at all its customer data, including claims data, to identify defect or failure trends with its tires. whatever else we learn at the hearing today, we hope that we will find that all involved will find the need for more open and detail communication regarding these critical products and how they perform in the field.", "augmented": []}
