Boris Johnson's green revolution is a slow motion train crash in the making. Even those invested in 'climate change' as a genuine threat are starting to wake up to the problem.
The green agenda is not just a load of green nonsense… if you do it right, it's the opportunity to create hundreds of thousands of jobs Looking ahead to COP26, Boris Johnson says he is becoming more and more obsessed with what we can dohttps://t.co/eGiunu4sRs pic.twitter.com/83cBYLzVMA — BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics) January 13, 2021
Do you think you're a role model for young women entering the field? Part of it is making sure people are connected sufficiently with their planet, to want to make sure it's still here as a home for us. If we're going to understand how our planet really works, we need everybody on deck to understand how to respond to it. The planet's going to survive — the question is, will we?
Clearly PG&E has made a decision that the legislative arena is not where they feel they're going to get the kind of results that will go far enough, he said, adding that the decisions about PG&E's future now appear to be in the hands of bankruptcy court.
Up until now, we haven't heard from the most committed constituency of the Democratic Party, the African American community, he said.
With the Senate likely to remain in Republican hands this year, Biden seems to be preparing to resurrect the Obama administration's approach after Democrats lost the House in the 2010 midterms: a combination of aggressive regulation, executive orders and close collaboration with states.
Another challenge with canceling someone for racial ignorance, particularly in a case like Groves, who expressed deep regret for her behavior, is where do they go? How do they move forward? As the Times story points out, Groves posted in support of Black Lives Matter as a senior and yet had used the N-word as a 9th grader. (A Black friend of Groves told the Times Groves had apologized about the offensive post long before it went viral. The friend defended Groves in a Snapchat post: We're supposed to educate people, not ruin their lives all because you want to feel a sense of empowerment.)
Essential government workers, like TSA agents, have been required to show up to work without pay, and have little basis for an unemployment claim, analysts said. While furloughed workers and government contractors may have stronger unemployment claims, they would likely have to return the money if Congress approves back pay to furloughed workers once the shutdown ends, as it has done with previous shutdowns.
I think Director Haspel's decision to largely stay in the shadows is the right one, Morell said. In this political environment, where most public statements are labeled as pro-Trump or anti-Trump, it is wise to stay silent, particularly when running an agency whose credibility depends as being seen as an independent voice at the policy table.
Back in Washington, Democrats on Thursday were blocked in the Senate after trying to proceed with House-passed spending bills that would fund the government and end the partial shutdown without new border wall money. Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, blocked that effort, saying it amounts to pointless show votes.
There are a lot of people in the Democratic Party, Goldberg said, who have been busting their asses.
And yes, despite President Trump's baseless claims that he actually won in the state, recounts have proven beyond any doubt that Biden carried Georgia. Trump now makes the ridiculous and delusional claim that the state's Republican governor and secretary of state are part an imaginary plot that deprived him of a victory.
The proof of these divides is already evident in the scrutiny Biden has faced from progressives in the selection of his Cabinet.
It feels like it was with Bush, said Bart Stupak, a former Michigan congressman and a Democrat who opposes abortion and worked to keep federal funding out of the Affordable Care Act. It's all political posturing. The only thing that seemed newly energized, he said, was the House's attempt at the 20-week ban.
Most of the increase last year was directly attributable to an increase in economic growth, said Trevor Houser, who leads Rhodium Group's Energy and Climate team, but he added that it does not have to be the case that a rising economy results in rising emissions.
Here, for example, is market strategist and investor Bill 'I absolutely believe climate change is the biggest challenge humanity faces' Blain writing at CapX.
But in Brazil, perhaps more than anywhere else, the Capitol riots felt like a warning from a not-so-distant future.
Although Steyer seemingly won't be on the ballot in 2020, members of his team emphasized that they felt the Democrats had momentum.
Roberts praises Tlaib — a self-described democratic socialist aligned with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Crotez (D-NY) — for articulating a cogent case of the country in crisis via the Trump administration.
A new report, pointing to signs of climate change such as the thawing of Arctic ice and intensifying wildfires, says the global average surface air temperature in 2017 exceeded 14.7 degrees Celsius (58.46 Fahrenheit), making last year a bit cooler than 2016, the warmest on record. But 2016 included the tail end of a strong El Niño in the tropical Pacific, and that bumped up temperatures that year, as well as in 2015, according to the report by the Copernicus Climate Change Service, a European agency.
Career changes accounted for about half of all moves across the country, according to a survey from United Van Lines. Retirement, lifestyle change and family were also among top reasons for moving in some regions.
The Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources similarly cautioned that Lonely George's death is likely just the beginning.
Loudoun County may be notable for the previous failures of some of their educators to lead by example. Unfortunately, they are not alone. Too many high schools are unsafe environments where students who are targeted for their racial identity are left to fend for themselves. It should surprise no one to see young people wielding their skills on social media as a weapon or a shield when they have been otherwise ignored.
The Deputy Director for Analysis is one of the most important positions at CIA, said Michael Morell, a former CIA deputy and acting director who also served as the agency's head of analysis from 2008 to 2010. Didi has extensive experience as an analyst, she has deep integrity, and she has the confidence of the director — all things necessary for someone to effectively lead the DA. Morell is also a CBS News senior national security contributor.
Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who delivered his own rebuttal to Trump's Tuesday night address from the Oval Office, also rallied attendees on Thursday. Sanders has consistently accused the White House of manufacturing a crisis, and has argued that climate change and health care are more urgent concerns than illegal immigration.
Medina also applauded Haspel's decision to name both more experienced analysts and more women to senior leadership roles. Overall, about half of the agency's analysts are women, as are about half of the directorate's senior managers, according to those familiar with the agency's make-up.
Hyde-Smith, a Republican, had been appointed to fill a vacancy before winning her election. A former state agriculture commissioner and state senator, she will complete the two years remaining of GOP Sen. Thad Cochran's term. She fended off a challenge from Democrat Mike Espy last November. Her campaign got a 11th hour boost from President Donald Trump, who traveled to Mississippi on the eve of the Senate run-off.

Sadly, his passing is also a harbinger of what's to come for our remaining Kāhuli (tree snails) if more is not done quickly to protect them from invasive species and climate change, the department wrote. Many of the island's remaining land snails are facing imminent extinction.
Omar, who sported a red hijab Thursday, said she understands the symbolism of her historic election, especially in a time when there is so much divisiveness in our nation…It still tells people that there is hope and we should still be optimistic about the American dream. And it's really not one off. There are so many of us that are walking into Congress that really are showing this nation that we are capable of having the American dream realized.
However, many government offices that process unemployment claims are understaffed, creating another headache for furloughed workers and contractors running low on funds.
He was protesting over climate change, his note read, and the dramatic method was intended as a metaphor for how fossil fuels are destroying the planet, the Mail reported.

Steyer has spent more than $14 million on radio and television commercials in South Carolina. Biden recently went on the air for the first time last week, campaign and party officials say.
KATE LARSEN: The U.S. has successfully bent its greenhouse gas emissions curve. And we are going to continue to reduce emissions over the next 10 years, likely regardless of Trump policy.
The two U.S. Senate runoff elections that will be held in Georgia Tuesday will determine whether the Senate will work in partnership with President-elect Joe Biden to build a better future for Americans, or whether Republican obstructionists who put politics ahead of patriotism will be empowered to do everything possible to oppose our new president.
Meanwhile, Sanders has taken a different approach. Michael Wukela, a senior aide for the campaign, said Sanders is focused on places and issues where other candidates are not — a climate change town hall in Myrtle Beach, a Medicare-for-all breakfast in Florence and a visit to a shuttered hospital not far from Columbia.
Weinstein has been charged with felony counts of forcible rape, forcible oral copulation, sexual penetration by use of force, and sexual battery by restraint, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey announced today.
The South Carolina primary will be one of the first contests in this process in which communities of color will have the opportunity to make their voices heard, said Biden senior adviser Symone Sanders, and our campaign has significantly increased its investments here, including with expanded television and radio ad buys covering the vast majority of the state's population.
Here's a breakdown of some of the firsts:
Antiabortion advocates have been pleased with the Trump administration's high-profile efforts for their cause, including attempting to block four undocumented minors from receiving abortions.
He was featured in many newspaper, magazine and online articles, and hundreds of school children and visitors to the lab eagerly viewed him, the last of his kind, the department wrote last week.
Earlier in the day, PG&E announced it will file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as it faces at least $30 billion in potential damages from lawsuits over catastrophic California wildfires in 2017 and 2018 that killed scores of people and destroyed thousands of homes. The announcement kicked off a 15-day window before the official filing. Newsom said he would like to stave off the bankruptcy but it may not be possible.
Increasingly, the wealthy residents living near Miami's shores are looking at another option: Move inland to higher ground, to historically less desirable neighborhoods populated by working-class people.
It's really about whether an agenda that moves the nation forward can be forged without significant compromise, said Martin Luther King III, the son of the civil rights icon. There are a lot of things that are in the balance.
In general, Peruvians like their soles (the currency is the nuevo sol) in small denominations: a fifty (roughly $20) is OK, but denominations of twenty and under are better to ensure merchants can make change.
Flying foxes have adapted to Australia's warm climate, but these fruit-eating bats are unable to regulate their body temperature when the outside temperature rises above 104 degrees Fahrenheit. The young ones are especially vulnerable, Ryan told the Camden-Narellan Advertiser.
In his plan, Biden also vowed to use the full authority of the executive branch, beginning his first day in office, to combat global warming, including orders to limit methane pollution from fossil fuel operations, protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge from oil and gas drilling and conserve 30% of America's lands and waters by 2030.
Pompeo, during his year-long tenure as CIA director, made both public appearances and unusually personal statements with some regularity. He sent a letter to the Harvard Kennedy School announcing his withdrawal from a speaking engagement and denouncing the school's decision to name Chelsea Manning, a former soldier convicted of leaking classified documents to WikiLeaks, a visiting fellow.
Trump skipped an onstage question-and-answer session with Schwab that had been expected following his address.
That said, the Norte Chico people of Peru built a civilization 5,000 years ago and the centuries that followed saw the emergence of other significant cultures, such as the Paracas and the Moche.
Marjorie Jones Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which advocates for abortion opponents in politics, said that was not the federal piece abortion opponents were going after, but it is a type of defunding of Planned Parenthood. Everything is still in progress, she said.
8. The Inca Trail is genuinely difficult
Either way, we will totally transform the global economy. The crises we face and the inevitabilities of change described here will drive this change.
Steyer seemed to tie the president's rhetoric not only to pipe bombs mailed across the country by an outspoken Trump supporter in Florida, but also to a massacre by a lone gunman at a Pittsburgh synagogue in late October.
We've seen more mail from Steyer than any candidate, times three, said Benjamin, echoing a sentiment from others in the state. Others said they had received so much mail and watched so many Steyer ads that it is a joke in their households that you cannot escape him.
Among them was the administration's expansion of the Mexico City policy, which withholds U.S. funding from foreign organizations that provide or promote abortion. The policy flips on and off when a new political party takes the White House, but Trump applied the policy to almost all global health assistance, some $8.8 billion. Past GOP presidents had limited it to the money the United States gives annually in family planning, about $600 million.
What He Can Do Without Congress
Prince said she still likes Biden, but after dealing with his campaign, she is considering other candidates. I'm on the fence, she said.
The construction and industry sectors also saw sizable emission increases.
The administration could also consider providing new resources for states to mitigate the effects of wildfires and other climate-related disasters, or give states the flexibility to figure out how to meet new federal pollution-reduction goals, Horowitz noted.
Biden won Georgia's 16 electoral votes by about 12,000 votes out of 5 million cast in November.
Daniel Swain, a researcher at UCLA, published a study late in 2017 that showed a warm-West, cold-East weather pattern over the United States has become more frequent in recent decades. A subsequent study linked the prevalence of this pattern to Arctic sea-ice loss driven by climate change.
The lack of strategy in the country's decarbonization efforts, the research says, has contributed to the gap in meeting the goal set in the Paris Agreement on climate change, a landmark 2015 accord that the US Trump administration has promised to abandon.
June 21 Updated Gabbard's position on carbon pricing from open to it to no based on a response from her campaign.
The brown and white snail was the sole survivor of the Achatinella apexfulva species, a type of invertebrate that once flourished across the tropical islands and was known as the jewels of the forest, according to Hawaii's Snail Extinction Prevention Program.
Pien Huang is a global health and development reporter on the Science desk. She was NPR's first Reflect America Fellow, working with shows, desks and podcasts to bring more diverse voices to air and online.
American views have remained quite steady for decades — since the mid-1990s, about half, give or take a few percentage points, have said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 40-odd percent have said it should be illegal in all or most cases. But the march draws a passionate, largely religious crowd that tends to highlight the political climate and take cues from whoever sits in the nearby White House and which party leads Congress.
There will be a majority in the Senate. We just don't know yet which party will have it. That depends on what happens in Georgia's twin US Senate runoffs Tuesday. If the two Republican incumbents -- Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler -- win, Republicans will have 51 votes and control access to the Senate floor. Given McConnell's expertise in obstruction and interest in the 2022 midterms, a 51-seat majority could be Biden's biggest presidential headache. If the Democratic challengers -- Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock -- win, the resulting 50-50 tie won't give Democrats much wiggle room to pass legislation, but it will give them the ability to get measures on the Senate floor with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris able to break ties as president of the Senate.
Warren: This is what fossil fuel wants us talking about
With a cold and a few jokes about his clip reel including a scene from The Love Boat, Tom Hanks accepted the Cecil B. DeMille award in true Hanks fashion, with grace and humility, and choked up when talking about his family. Hanks paid tribute to actors, writers, directors and craftsmen he worked with, naming some, like his Captain Phillips co-star Barkhad Abdi, and even nodding to Skarsgard's eyebrow artist. He championed being on time. His speech made the pursuit of acting and filmmaking feel like a noble one, captivating the audience in the room and at home.
Your skin is cold, but inside, you are warm, and safe-feeling, so that the cold is just a sensation, and not a misery. It's unlike anything else I have ever felt in my entire life, and it is just a moment every day when I feel too good to remember that things are bad. And then, honestly, I spend the rest of the day recovering from it, not hyper-focusing on a million tasks, not being free from anxiety, not feeling ready to conquer things. I take a long bath and often fall asleep, and at some point manage to do the work required of me, but it's basically a whole day lost to 20 minutes of extreme pleasure, and that's fine with me.
Minnesota's Ilhan Omar and Michigan's Rashida Tlaib: First Muslim women in Congress
But some longtime antiabortion figures say this all feels familiar: GOP leaders making promises about abortion but not following through in a dramatic way.
Most tourists come to Peru to see Machu Picchu or other Inca ruins, with maybe a few Catholic churches thrown in for balance. This makes it easy to conclude, There were the Incas, then the Spanish came, which brings us to where we are now.
Is your job at risk? Companies will either become part of the solution, or they won't be a problem because they won't be around. The emerging industries are creating millions of jobs, but millions are at risk. Will we substitute a Universal Basic Income? Will we descend into unimaginable darkness? Or will we create a Finer Future?
There will be a split in the GOP. A vote for the objections Trump wants is a vote for conspiracy theory over fact and against the democratic will of the country.
Presenter Ansel Elgort didn't say much when he presented best original song to Elton John and Bernie Taupin, but boy, did he sing! It was a little weird, but at least it was on pitch. Perhaps some guerrilla marketing for his upcoming role in Steven Spielberg's West Side Story remake? Sure, why not!
Even as the planet warms overall, some scientists who were not involved in this analysis have published studies that show climate change may be altering the atmosphere's steering currents in ways to concentrate punishing cold in certain locations at certain times.

COOPER: What you are talking about, just big picture, is radical agenda compared to the way politics is done right now.
A remarkable shift has happened in just the past decade, since the 2008 financial collapse — more Democrats now have a positive view of the word socialism (57 percent) than capitalism (43 percent), Gallup found last year.
There were people there who voted three, four times, dead people who voted, Bolsonaro told a crowd of supporters on Thursday morning, according to Folha de S.Paulo, Brazil's largest newspaper. And here in Brazil, if we have the electronic vote in '22, it will be the same thing. … We're going to have a worse problem than the United States.
That is why it is so important to come together: we need to protect ourselves and avoid the worst in 2022! Molon pleaded, while São Paulo state Gov. João Doria, a former Bolsonaro ally who may run against him in next year's elections, called it an alert for Brazil, where a minority that flirts with authoritarianism and fanaticism tries to weaken institutions and threaten the rule of law.
The Democrats secured a narrow House majority and the White House during November's general election.
For more than two months, as Trump has parroted absurd claims of voter fraud and stolen or disappeared votes, Bolsonaro remained one of his only international allies in the fight. He was one of the last world leaders to recognize President-elect Joe Biden's November victory, and still seems hellbent on pretending that Trump isn't going anywhere yet.

Biden, in other words, seems to be doing really well in what Flannery O'Connor dubbed the Christ-haunted South. But that's the place where Sanders is particularly bad at campaigning. I heard some of his surrogates onstage working stilted religious references into their speeches and looked around at a crowd that clearly wasn't overly familiar with the Bible and thought, why are they bothering? They just don't speak fluent Church Lady and neither does anyone else here.

When the Aliso Canyon natural gas well blew out, spewing 100,000 metric tons of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, the local utility feared it would be unable to keep lights on in Southern California. In record time, Tesla and others brought online more than 70 megawatts of energy storage at a price cheaper than building a new gas peaking plant, and vastly faster.
And while those two potentially embody the core split within the Democratic primary – pragmatism vs. pugilism – Trump will be waiting in the general election with another distinction he hopes to make: socialism vs. greatness.
Thirty-four-year agency veteran Beth Kimber became the first woman to lead the agency's directorate of operations earlier in December. Sonya Holt, who likewise spent over three decades at CIA, assumed the role of chief diversity and inclusion officer in August, when similarly long-serving CIA officials Vaughn Bishop, now deputy director, and Andy Makridis, now chief operating officer (COO), were also named.
Here in the United States, we are alarmed by the new calls to adopt socialism in our country, he said. America was founded on liberty and independence, and not government coercion, domination and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.

On a recent Monday, dozens of workers and volunteers were calling and plotting visits from the Sanders headquarters. A sign on the wall said the Bernie 2020 Wish List included folding chairs, water, juice, coffee, world peace, an espresso machine, snacks and Gatorade. The only item with a check mark was a microwave. The room looked like a College Democrats meeting.
Aside from making history, Tlaib said the whole event made her a little emotional.
The Biden-Harris Administration intends to pull every lever available, not only through executive and legislative action, but partnering together with cities, states, and businesses to reverse course on the climate threat, advance environmental justice and a clean energy future, and create millions of good-paying union jobs, Jamal Brown, a Biden transition spokesman, told HuffPost in an email.
The Chapter 11 process allows us to work with these many constituents in one court-supervised forum to comprehensively address our potential liabilities and to implement appropriate changes.
You've got a director, deputy director and COO who are all career intelligence officers, and two-thirds of whom are analysts – you'd have to go back decades for that to be true, Priess said. This is also leadership at CIA at a time of unprecedented institutional tension with the president – it's meaningful that it's not being run by the president's own people, but by career officers. This could have gone in a very different direction.
But first, today is the 33rd anniversary of the first time scientists detected starlight from the birth of a galaxy — which was created 12 billion years earlier. The discovery, which refuted the largely held idea that all galaxies were created at the same time, happened right here in California.
The Museo Larco and its Erotic Gallery is devoted to sculptures from more than a thousand years ago celebrating sexual congress in all of its least procreative forms. Reproductions of these works pop up all over Peru, notably in the form of a bottle of pisco shaped like a fellow in an extremely good mood.
Peru's beverage of choice is pisco, a brandy made from grapes. It's also adored in Chile, inspiring an epic rivalry over which nation is its true birthplace.
But whether he's able to forge a climate legacy that endures beyond his time in office may very well hinge on leveraging states and cities to take aggressive action.
The best way to stop McConnell is to elect Ossoff and Warnock to give Democrats 50 Senate seats — creating a tie with the 50 Republican senators. Vice President Harris will cast the tie-breaking vote to give Democrats majority control of the Senate.
Democratic success will likely depend on driving a huge turnout of African Americans, young voters, college-educated voters and women, all groups that helped Biden become the first Democratic presidential candidate since 1992 to win Georgia. Republicans, meanwhile, have been focused on energizing their own base of white men and voters beyond the core of metro Atlanta.

The Crown actress Olivia Colman really wasn't prepared to win, and she admitted it flat out on stage. I've honestly gotten a little boozy, because I didn't think this was going to happen, she said to knowing laughter.

JONES: Well, I think he overcomes it by continuing to move forward with the momentum that he's got. This is a delegate count number right now. This field is going to winnow down, and I think as Joe Biden goes forward, if you look at the states that are beyond Super Tuesday, those are also going to be very good delegate rich states for Joe Biden. This race is far from over. I think, unfortunately, folks in the media, with all due respect, have anointed four or five different people now as who is going to be the eventual Democratic nominee. We've had, like, four contests, but this race is still fluid. Yeah, Senator Sanders is going to probably have a delegate lead, but if you look at the totality of the circumstances and where the votes for the Democrats have been throughout this season, I think that they're going to all coalesce in my opinion - and it is strictly that, my opinion - around Joe Biden ultimately.

I don't know if I have any data on how pro-lifers feel about Trump in general, Dannenfelser said. But 'Never Trumpers' and others all acknowledge that he has followed through on his pro-life commitment, and they're happy about that. Trump is a pro-life hero, she said.

At the end of the day, politics and elections are typically binary choices, said Andy Surabian, who worked in the 2016 Trump campaign war room, was political director for Tea Party Express and is now a political adviser to Donald Trump Jr. The biggest gift to Trump is for Democrats to nominate what I call a 'kneeler,' someone who supports kneeling for the national anthem.

According to the Times, one student, Jimmy Galligan, shared in June 2020 a three-second Snapchat video of his classmate, Mimi Groves, using a racial slur. Groves had first sent the video message to a friend in 2016 when she was 15 and had just gotten her learner's permit. In the video, she looks into the camera and says, I can drive, [racial slur].
COOPER: Do you call yourself a radical?
Last October, Trump took a personal shot at Steyer, deriding him as a wacky and crazed & stumbling lunatic and asserting that if he is running for President, the Dems will eat him alive!
Last year, more than 2,000 flying foxes were found dead in the Richmond Valley region of northern New South Wales on Australia's east coast, the Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported. Temperatures topped 113 degrees Fahrenheit. About 100,000 bats across the state of Queensland died during a heat wave in 2014.
Just as many Brazilians have pointed to Trump as an example of the horrors that Bolsonaro could bring to their own nation, Bolsonaro has warned that the problems that exist in the minds of Trump and some Republicans in America will make their way to Brazil soon.
At the moment, he notes, we all get to take key consumption decisions — whether we travel at all, how much we travel and which means of transport we use, whether we live in a large house or a small apartment and how we heat our homes, how many electronic devices we have and how intensely we use them or how much meat and exotic fruit we eat — on the basis of 'income, not on climate considerations.'

Among Steyer's goals: a multi-million dollar digital initiative aimed at informing the public and members of Congress about the 10 impeachable offenses that Trump has already committed, town halls across the country, and even an impeachment summit in late January that will bring more than 250 supporters from across the country to D.C. together to learn about historical precedent for impeachment.

Finding the student who is imprudent about using a slur on social media focuses all the anger on that student. What about the student who anonymously leaves a note in a locker? What about the student who keeps other kids off the team? What about the kids who quietly make it so uncomfortable for outsiders that some extracurricular activity is completely closed to kids of a certain ethnic group, religion or gender? What about a school counselor who systematically counsels Black students away from AP or honors classes?
No, we saw during his 2012 campaign that Romney did not have the steel to go the distance. After he trounced Obama in the first debate between the two, Romney failed to press his advantage and the second debate was a disaster for him.

Former Vice President Joe Biden (D) also spent over $1 million on private air travel, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who spent $720,518 in the fourth quarter of the year.
There is some possibility of compromise on issues such as nuclear power, carbon capture technology and research funding for renewables, all things included in the bipartisan spending bill passed last month. But a legal mandate to rapidly phase out fossil fuels and intervene radically in the economy is difficult to envision, given the makeup of the 117th Congress.
To oversee the effort, Biden picked Gina McCarthy, Barack Obama's former EPA chief and architect of the administration's regulatory suite, as his domestic climate czar, a position Obama initially created in his first term to coordinate the federal government's energy and environmental strategy and work to get climate legislation passed in Congress.
He reminds doubters that experts totally underestimated sales of mobile phones. In the 1990s, McKinsey told ATT to expect 900,000 mobile subscribers by the year 2000. They were off by 108 million. By 2014 there were more mobile phones on earth than the seven billion people, increasing five times faster than humans.
Why do many people dismiss issues like climate change, despite strong scientific evidence? Climatologist J. Marshall Shepherd examines how different forms of bias shape how we perceive science.
The American people elected our new Democratic majority to enact a more positive and forward-looking agenda,'' Langevin, co-chair of the Bipartisan Disabilities Caucus, said in a statement. Serving as Speaker pro tempore tomorrow reaffirms our commitment to creating a more inclusive government that works for everyone.
It will mean an economic collapse on a scale never seen coming at us within about 10 years.

Although the law banning homosexuality is rarely enforced in India, it is used to intimidate, harass, blackmail and extort money from gay people, activists say.
Unfortunately, that's put them at odds with environmental groups who don't want to see the infrastructure placed in or near fragile ecosystems. The battles are expected to blow up this year as California attempts to reach zero-emission electricity by 2045.
How much and what the state can do remains to be seen. Lawmakers last year tried to prevent a threatened PG&E bankruptcy resulting from the 2017 fires by letting the utility pass on some of its costs to ratepayers, a move some critics dubbed a bailout for the utility. Democratic Assemblyman Chris Holden had considering introducing a similar bill that would pass on the costs of 2018 fires, but on Monday he said he has backed off that idea.
Sworn in were 127 women – 102 in the House and 25 in the Senate – breaking a record of 110, set in 2018, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Of the 127, 106 are Democrats and 21 are Republicans.

We have the technologies to solve the worst of the crises facing us, and buy the time to deal with the rest. Back in 2009, Stanford scientist Dr. Mark Jacobson said that renewable energy could power the entire world by 2030. His Solutions Project calculated how to do this for every state in the U.S. and many countries. More recently, scholars like Christian Breyer have shown how to do this with photovoltaics alone.
In the last five years, greater Miami has lost seven mobile-home parks, or about 700 housing units, Calvo estimated. One of these parks is now home to Magic City, a multimillion-dollar development that will eventually include 2,600 housing units. Rents for those are not yet set.

For years, Congress has neglected to finance the upkeep of cherished public lands — and America deserves better. Or so Pacific Crest Trail Association executive director and columnist Liz Bergeron says in this CALMatters commentary.
Mehlman added: If the Dems are able to nominate a presidential nominee that appeals to the middle of the country, that's going to be very powerful. But if they go hard left, there is a path for Donald Trump to get re-elected.
Jan. 6 Added Bloomberg answers on climate change in survey responses returned by his campaign.
The lesson of the Trump years is that executive order is a weak tool, said Amy Myers Jaffe, managing director of the Climate Policy Lab at Tufts University. The Biden team absolutely needs to see how they can support states ― from New England wind to stricter methane rules mirroring Colorado to California's clean freight and [electric vehicle] policies.

You don't really find mobile home parks in Miami Beach. You find them more inland. And now as developers are looking inland for long-term development, these mobile home parks are vulnerable, said Nejla Calvo, an attorney representing Hernandez and the 800 other residents of the SOAR mobile home park.
This is not a new cause célèbre for the Brazilian. Bolsonaro, like Trump, peddled conspiracies about the 2018 election, openly musing about malfeasance against him even in a race he won. He has not stopped since: Although many of Bolsonaro's other blatant threats to democratic institutions, as well as the destruction of the Amazon Rainforest on his watch, have received more international attention, he has spent the last two years attempting to undermine Brazil's electoral system and the last two months using Trump and the United States as a reason to ramp up his attacks.
Biden's administration could condition federal funding for state plans to build electric vehicle infrastructure and clean energy, or pay states to prepare climate action plans and stipulate that they be subject to federal enforcement or forced to return the money if they don't meet those goals. Such a program would need to be voluntary, and could be expanded to include funding for states that agree to conserve additional land under their control, but it's a possibility, said Michael Gerrard, director of Columbia Law School's Sabin Center for Climate Change Law.
This company has been dishonest, it has prioritized profits way over safety and there has been no effort on their part to change that, he said. I don't believe it will change unless there is some sort of restructure.

For Brazil, it is a warning about what can happen even worse here, if Bolsonaro's authoritarianism and his militias are not contained, if violations of freedom and rights continue to be tolerated, former leftist President Lula da Silva, who sought to challenge Bolsonaro in 2018's elections before he was barred from running, wrote on Twitter.
He had really high hopes, but I don't think when he was thinking about the opportunities that awaited his children as he brought us here,'' Omar recalled as she rushed to get in line for a ceremonial picture with the new Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. I don't think that he imagined that they would be of abundance - that he would within a little over 20 years take his daughter to get sworn in into the United States Congress. And so we are humbled and overwhelmed really with joy.
Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, before he became Trump's Supreme Court nominee, had not been called on to consider — or rule on — abortion as a federal judge. However, he has written about bioethics and human life with language that makes abortion opponents believe he will side with them on the topic.

He praised himself repeatedly, saying that his actions saved the global economy from the brink of recession, rescued the U.S. manufacturing industry and reshaped the rules of international trade to reflect a fairer system.
The Interior Department then proposed to cut protections that benefited the sage grouse, a grassland bird that lives in the Great Plains and Western states, which could allow for expanded oil and drilling. The plan would remove protections on nearly 9 million acres of protected habitat.
If we had a barrier of any kind, a powerful barrier, whether it's steel or concrete ... we would stop it cold, Trump said of human trafficking. The president then took part in a briefing by border agents.
Loeffler and Perdue, on the other hand, have hitched their wagons to a lame-duck president and have repeatedly refused to even acknowledge President-elect Biden's victory. They agree with anything Trump says, even if that requires them to flip-flop on their positions on issues. They act as if they are running to be selected by Trump to be his employees on The Apprentice, rather than to represent the people of Georgia in the Senate.
This is of great concern to scientists not only due to the increased risk of these 'die off' events, but also for the long term impact it will have on the recovery of several of these already threatened species, Jemison wrote.
Rapp previously served as deputy chief operating officer at CIA and headed up intelligence integration at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, where she helped oversee the production of the President's Daily Brief (PDB).

Some antiabortion leaders describe him as a pro-life hero and pose grinning with him and their children. Others say the vulgarity of the president is poisoning the future of the movement, which has worked to change its anti-woman caricature by advocating for things such as paid family leave and maternal health care. Still others say that Trump's changes are more about tone and that he reminds them of other GOP presidents who said the right things but never prioritized fighting abortion on a large scale.

From the beginning, the worry in Brazil was that Bolsonaro was a more dangerous version of Trump, a force that would offer a much tougher stress test for younger, less entrenched institutions. Trump and the Republican Party ultimately proved American institutions weaker than many initially presumed, but in the end, the country's elections, the judiciary that oversees them and the Congress required to certify them appear to have held ― if only just, and if only (possibly) just for now.
When it comes to Planned Parenthood, the House and Senate health-care bills contained provisions to block the organization from getting federal reimbursements, but those efforts died with the legislation. Under President Barack Obama, states were prevented from withholding federal money from Planned Parenthood and other abortion clinics; Trump last spring signed a resolution reversing that rule.
LUIS MACEDO/AFP via Getty Images In November 2016, dozens of protesters invaded the Brazilian Congress to call for a military takeover of the government. It was peaceful compared to the riots that took place this week in the United States but foreshadowed further calls for the closure of the country's Congress and Supreme Court from right-wing Brazilians.

In his speech, Trump made no mention of impeachment or U.S. politics, although he took a swipe at radical socialists, his term for Democrats and ideas about expansion of the government's role in health care, education and other issues.
Was Golden Globes host Ricky Gervais even trying in his fifth time at the Globes microphone? With a glass of beer on the lectern, Gervais looked a little tired when he opened the show, reminding viewers he didn't care anymore (and never really did). He had a lackluster, lazy parade of jokes about Baby Yoda and Joe Pesci (the internet has beat him to much better jokes on the tiny alien), Felicity Huffman making license plates (the audience definitely wasn't with him there), Cats, Martin Scorsese's height and movies about pedophiles.
We turn now to Alabama, one of the 14 states that will host its primary contest today. Hillary Clinton beat Bernie Sanders by more than 55 points in that state back in 2016. That suggests that it is Joe Biden's to lose. David Greene talked with Alabama's Democratic senator, Doug Jones, who has endorsed the former vice president.
The core goals aside, antiabortion advocates had a list of things they were happy about.
Henricks said he didn't notice Trump making a big difference in the movement, except for the impact of how controversial he is. I think [the Trump era is] changing clearly the character of the Republican Party, he said. Some pro-life folks are just as pro-life, but they are less Republican.
Georgia's January elections, necessary because no Senate candidates received a majority of the general-election votes, have been unique for many reasons, not least because the contenders essentially ran as teams, even campaigning together sometimes.
Tom Hanks brings America's Dad to the show
Throughout President Trump's overseas trip this week, he's been getting an earful about climate and how important the Paris climate agreement is. Many foreign leaders say the U.S. should not abandon it, and President Trump tweeted this morning that he will make a final decision next week. But as NPR's Christopher Joyce reports, staying in or out of that Paris deal may not make that much difference.
The charred remains of David Buckel were found by a jogger in Brooklyn's Prospect Park.
Though some former intelligence officials have raised concerns about excessive insularity and the risks of creating an echo chamber at the agency, others praised the relative conservatism of Haspel's choices at a time when the churn of personnel at a number of other government institutions have plunged them into turmoil.

He thinks maybe they could just ask their father for more money, House speaker Nancy Pelosi said after a contentious meeting at the White House on Wednesday. But they can't. (Trump walked out of the meeting after Pelosi flatly refused to consider any spending bill that included wall funding.)
The brutal reality is offshore wind is far less efficient than promised and requires much more expensive maintenance. They break down, sink into their foundations and don't generate anything like the power expected. For all the due diligence, they simply won't ever make any money unless the price at which they sell energy is dramatically increased – at which point they make zero sense.

That's where I think the list really shines, Horowitz said. He's packed this list with people who know how state progress is made.
There are nuanced differences between Brazil and the United States that the ready-made comparisons between Trump and Bolsonaro often obscure. Still, it's undeniable that Trump's election in 2016 was a preview of what followed in Brazil two years later. Brazil didn't learn the lessons on offer from its northern neighbor then. But this time, it still has a chance to heed the warnings before it's too late.
Brazil's institutions, meanwhile, have at times acquitted themselves better than many thought they would, and divides in Brazil's Congress, where Bolsonaro doesn't enjoy the support of a consolidated party like Trump does in the GOP, may help shield the country from total disaster.
The surge was driven largely by Democrats as the party took over House control for the first time in eight years.
Also, Romney had foreign policy chops. His comments about Russia being the nation's biggest threat proved prescient, even as he was mocked by President Obama, who thought he knew better.

This makes a nonsense of Johnson's airy claim that his green revolution will create hundreds and thousands of new jobs. Of course it won't. There is plenty of evidence to support Heymann's claim. None to support Johnson's.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who spent $1.2 million on private air travel in the final quarter of 2019, is outraged that President Trump did not mention climate change during Tuesday's State of the Union address.
LARSEN: With current policy, including everything that states have committed to do and what President Trump has indicated he is likely to roll back, we are on a path to reduce emissions below 2005 levels by about 15 to 17 percent in 2020.
We're pretty disappointed that the GOP Senate and House have still failed to fully defund Planned Parenthood — that was and continues to be our No. 1 legislative priority. This is something the president has promised to sign into law, she said. I think that one of my charges this year is making sure pro-lifers don't get complacent and say: 'We've elected them. They'll do what they say.' No, they're not doing what they said. You need to push them.

Gervais lost his shock and awe
The city, whose most exclusive neighborhoods are close to the sea and barely above sea level, is increasingly getting flooded during high tides. The city is moving to raise streets and sidewalks by two feet, at a cost of about $1 million a block, but adaptation will only be a partial help. Water is rising right through the ground, permeating the porous limestone on which much of Miami sits. The sea walls other cities are considering won't work here.
And before long we were back out there every day, in that beautiful water. It wasn't so much that I planned on swimming into mid-November in a lake in Northern California at 3,017 feet, as I just kept going every single day and over time, the water kept getting colder and colder. It was around Oct. 26 where I started to feel that I was doing something unusual and brave and at times painful. My first thought every morning was resentment that my day had this big hard part in the middle of it. But even as the air and water got colder, it didn't get worse, it got better. My body started to get used to it. The big hard part of my day became the best thing in it. My first thought every morning became swimming. And then I would just lie there smiling stupidly into the dark.
Republicans are unified against Biden's plans for health care, environmental protection and civil rights, but some fear that outgoing President Donald Trump's brazen attempts to undermine the integrity of the nation's voting systems may discourage voters in Georgia.
The truth is that Warnock and Ossoff are mainstream candidates dedicated to public service, and they echo President-elect Biden's hopeful unifying message. They are laser-focused on the facts, the issues, and the values that matter to suffering Georgians in these perilous times.
A vote against the objections is to accept the decision of the people but defy the grassroots of the GOP and fail a fealty test to Trump, likely inviting a primary challenge in the near future.

The partisan divides that inhibited strong climate action during the Obama years have only deepened under Trump, a reality that Horowitz hopes will be enough to deter the Biden administration from futile attempts at reaching across the aisle to address climate change.
– The healthcare coverage he took away
In November 2013, more than 15,000 scientists reissued a warning to humanity of widespread misery and catastrophic biodiversity loss unless business-as-usual changed. By failing to adequately limit population growth, reassess the role of an economy rooted in growth, reduce greenhouse gases, incentivize renewable energy, protect habitat, restore ecosystems, curb pollution, halt defaunation, and constrain invasive alien species, humanity is not taking the urgent steps needed to safeguard our imperilled biosphere, they wrote.
But the president faces continued questions about his approach to foreign affairs. His decision to order a strike that killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani this month — and his threat to impose a 25 percent tariff on European cars over a foreign policy dispute — created more tumult in the Middle East and in the transatlantic relationship between the United States and its closest allies.
So McConnell's goal 10 years ago — in his own words — was not to serve the American people. Not to create jobs, improve health care, strengthen education, protect national security, or fight for equal rights. No, he admitted that his top priority was to do everything humanly possible to hurt President Obama's reelection prospects, regardless of the harm inflicted on the American people. You can bet every penny you have that McConell feels the same way about our incoming president.
Trump, accompanied by elected officials and border agents, highlighted gun, trafficking and drug crimes along the border during remarks at a patrol station in McAllen.

Not mentioned during #SOTU: – The climate disaster
That's not Romney's situation. Could it be that Romney wants to be at the ready in case the impeachment abyss opens up and consumes the president … and Vice President Mike Pence at the same time? Does he think he'll be the chosen favorite in case GOP leaders have to go to their bench? It isn't going to happen.
Do you think conditions have improved for women in STEM fields since you entered the arena? Things have gotten better. The National Science Foundation has a program called Advance, where instead of just trying to hire individual women, you actually try to change the culture, like instead of dropping individual salmon in the stream, we're actually trying to change ecosystems so that more salmon will survive. I did that for five years, and we managed to go from having both the teaching and research faculty at Lamont go from having single-digit numbers of women to having double digits. We still don't see women in as many leadership positions as I'd like, and the harassment issue is probably one of the reasons we lose so many women in the pipeline in particular. Considering the cultural conversation, this is our chance to see if we can address those problems within science and to sit down and say: What have we let go by? What have we not spoken up about? And how can we make it so we can understand what our code of conduct is going to be?
ILULISSAT, GREENLAND - JULY 20: An iceberg floats through the water on July 20, 2013 in Ilulissat, Greenland. As Greenlanders adapt to the changing climate and go on with their lives, researchers from the National Science Foundation and other organizations are studying the phenomena of the melting glaciers and its long-term ramifications for the rest of the world. In recent years, sea level rise in places such as Miami Beach has led to increased street flooding and prompted leaders such as New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg to propose a $19.5 billion plan to boost the citys capacity to withstand future extreme weather events by, among other things, devising mechanisms to withstand flooding.

Cindy Hyde-Smith: Mississippi's first elected woman senator
JONES: Well, I don't think that that is going to be the issue at the end of the day. Whether it's OK or not I don't think is going to be the issue. The issue that people are looking for - they're looking for a leader that is going to help get things done. They're looking for people to be able to reach across the aisle but also bring people within their own party together to find the common ground to make sure this country goes forward in a positive way. And I think that's the main issue, and that's why you see the people of South Carolina - they know Joe Biden. They know his fallacies. They know his positives. And that's why the people of South Carolina overwhelmingly gave him the victory they did the other night and why I think he's going to do very well on Super Tuesday.
But some people close to the operation have grown worried that Biden is no longer a sure bet in this state's Feb. 29 primary and that his uneven performances on the campaign trail could dampen support. Some who once saw Biden as the strongest potential challenger to President Trump are looking at others, including billionaire Mike Bloomberg, who won't be on the ballot here but is competing in states that vote a few days later on Super Tuesday.
If I do endorse, it will probably be someone who has called and asked me, she said, adding that Biden was still the favorite in South Carolina but seemed to be fading. A lot of undecided voters are just looking for someone who can beat Trump, and they are maybe looking to New Hampshire and other states more than in previous years.
In his lengthy climate plan, Biden slammed the Trump administration for abdicating America's leadership on climate, and applauded state and local leaders for their efforts to slash planet-warming emissions, invest in renewable energy and build climate-resilient infrastructure. Since Trump announced in June 2017 that he would pull the U.S. out of the landmark Paris climate agreement, 25 states, hundreds of cities and thousands of businesses and other entities have pledged their commitment to the goals of the international accord.
Some activists said the national divisiveness over Trump is changing the direction they thought the movement was headed, one that looked at fighting abortion by providing paid family leave, chasing deadbeat dads and subsidizing child care and maternal health. That fuller approach, with a pro-woman and pro-child outlook, aimed to draw in more young people and even more abortion rights advocates.
The problem is that once you get outside of the South, and particularly in the big states, the Democratic electorate looks more like the people who have been voting for Sanders than it does like conservative southern black voters. If Biden runs the tables in the South on Tuesday, and Sanders wins everywhere else, is the party going to nominate the guy who carried California and Texas and Massachusetts, or the guy who won all the states that are virtually guaranteed to vote for a Republican come November?
It'll be an aggravating vote for those Senate Republicans running for reelection in 2022, when the party is defending more Senate seats than Democrats.
There were a few chuckles to be had, but even fans of Gervais' harsh brand of humor would likely be disappointed. There weren't many barbs to his supposedly sharp humor, merely a few weak jabs at Apple and political celebrities. More than anything else, it was dull.
Escobar, El Paso's first woman in Congress, posted a picture of the nameplate on her door and invited visitors to D.C. to stop by. I'm very grateful for the opportunity to serve our beloved community and country,'' she tweeted.
But would Mitt have done those things? Would he have stood behind Supreme Court nominee (and now justice) Brett Kavanaugh while the liberal media slimed his reputation and judged him guilty of sins allegedly committed decades earlier on the flimsiest of evidence?
Lawyer Anand Grover, who appeared for five members of the LGBT community who had petitioned the court seeking a review of the ban, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation: It is a big relief and a primary step taken by the Supreme Court to review its earlier order.
Some workers are relying on donations, including launching GoFundMe campaigns. A food pantry has opened up at a Coast Guard base in Boston.
Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the forum, thanked Trump for injecting optimism into the discussion.
Shutting down the government is not a policy that should be followed, House majority leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told a boisterous crowd of protesters in Washington, D.C., on Thursday. Some near the White House chanted, Do your jobs, so we can do ours.
UKIP education spokesman David Kurten stated that the despicable move is bad news for children and parents, who he pointed out will effectively have no choice but to be exposed to politicised education material due to Pearson's position as the largest supplier of textbooks for schools, and the owner of Britain's largest exam board, Edexcel.
READ THE TRANSCRIPTS! Trump tweeted shortly after meeting with a group of global business leaders representing industries including energy, telecommunications and finance. Before the meeting, he decried the impeachment process in remarks to reporters — repeatedly calling it a hoax.
The petitioners had told the court they were living in constant fear of police action because of their sexual orientation.
Asked whether Biden's campaign is in trouble, Dick Harpootlian, a longtime Biden friend and fundraiser, paused for two seconds and leaned back in his chair before saying no. Biden had 30 years of experience in South Carolina and could remind voters how many times he'd been in the state, how much he cared about middle-class people and his role backing President Barack Obama, Harpootlian said.
Rep. Deb Haaland (D-N.M.), one of the first two Native American women elected to Congress and a strong supporter of the Green New Deal movement, would replace a former oil lobbyist if the Senate confirms her as head of the Interior Department. In place of the ex-coal lobbyist running the Environmental Protection Agency would be Michael Regan, who brokered the biggest coal-ash cleanup settlement in U.S. history as North Carolina's top environmental regulator. The Energy Department would swap a fossil fuel die-hard for Jennifer Granholm, Michigan's former governor and attorney general and now a clean energy advocate.
We do not find any evidence for an intensification of these types of cold waves due to the Arctic warming faster than the midlatitudes, they concluded. In fact, they said, less Arctic air is coming south than it used to.
But the Steyer campaign has worried advisers like Amanda Alpert Loveday, who runs Biden's super PAC in South Carolina and said Steyer's huge push into the state hurts because it eats into the margin.
The new research indicated that US power sector emissions as a whole rose by 1.9% and that the transportation sector held its title as the largest source of US emissions for the third year running, due to a growth in demand for diesel and jet fuel offsetting a modest decline in gasoline use.
(CNN) — With a climate that ranges from desert dry to tropical lush to freeze-your-North-Face-off in the Andes, Peru packs a ton of diversity between its sea level elevation Pacific beaches and the 22,204 foot top of its highest mountain, Nevado Huascaran.
So you just got in there, and I know you got lots of good ideas, the host said, but I would encourage you to sit still for a minute and learn the job.
One problem with making someone like Groves emblematic of broader racism harbored within an institution is that it risks absolving others of examining their own behaviors. It makes her the exception, instead of recognizing what she said as a symptom of the prevailing climate at her school and in her school district.
If you feel like racing your fellow hikers, great. Do not test the porters: They're pros, and you're at best a promising amateur.
David Hayes, executive director of New York University School of Law's State Energy & Environmental Impact Center and a former deputy interior secretary under Obama, declined to comment specifically on the incoming Biden administration, but stressed the importance of federal-state collaboration.
The House a year ago passed a bill to make the prohibition on federal funding for abortions — usually contained in a legislative provision called the Hyde Amendment — permanent, but the Senate did not, and it's not on the agenda. The House also last year passed a bill banning abortions in most cases after 20 weeks (considered a late term abortion, one of Trump's pledges), but a similar measure in the Senate is seen as unlikely to pass.
We believe the evidence will show that the defendant used his power and influence to gain access to his victims and then commit violent crimes against them, Lacey said in a statement, adding that she commended the victims who spoke out and bravely recounted what happened to them. It is my hope that all victims of sexual violence find strength and healing as they move forward.
Nov. 16 Adjusted Sanders's position on a carbon tax, from 'Open to it' to 'No' following a change from his campaign.
They have less heat tolerance, she said. Their brain just fries and they become incoherent. Often, she said, they will simply get too hot and fall to the ground while the adults seek out precious shade.
In a Tuesday morning note, Height Securities noted the difficulty of finding a legislative fix for PG&E's complex problems. As of today, it wrote, we do not see a clear path to action that would avoid a bankruptcy filing.
More than 3 million Georgians voted before Tuesday. Some precincts in metro Atlanta showed light-to-steady turnout Tuesday morning with no lines and voters taking just a few minutes to complete their ballots.
After three years of decline, climate-change-causing carbon emissions rose sharply in the United States last year, according to new research.
MARC HAFSTEAD: And my analysis was, under the best-case scenario, we'd come in somewhere around 10.
(CNN) In recent years and especially since the death of George Floyd, high school and college students have been using social media to expose everyday racism they confront at school. A r ecent story in The New York Times about two high school graduates from Virginia was particularly dramatic.
Possibly this is good news for Johnson, who, as a reward for this nonsense, may now get more nookie from his eco-activist girlfriend Carrie Symonds (aka Princess Nut Nut). But it will be an absolute disaster for the country at large, as a number of recent reports and articles make clear.
Most people come to Iowa around this time to announce a campaign for president, Steyer said in his prepared remarks. But I am proud to be here to announce that I will do whatever it takes, for as long as it takes, to remove a president.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONNA'S THESE WINDOWS ARE PISTONS, PT. 2)
In his op-ed in The Washington Post, Romney tempers his criticisms of the president by lauding some of Trump's accomplishments, saying the president was right to align U.S. corporate taxes with those of global competitors, to strip out excessive regulations, to crack down on China's unfair trade practices, to reform criminal justice and to appoint conservative judges.
As President Trump visited the southern border in McAllen, Texas, and declared that he will almost definitely use his emergency powers to build the wall if talks remain stalled, the demonstrations emphasized the financial strain imposed on government employees since the shutdown began Dec. 22.
Notably, several members of Biden's environmental team have state government experience.
My early death by fossil fuel reflects what we are doing to ourselves, the New York Daily News reported his suicide note said.
Truth be told, Loeffler and Perdue — not Warnock and Ossoff — are the radical candidates running in Georgia. The Republican candidates are out-of-touch with Georgia voters and values and reject their Senate oath of office, which pledges them to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. Their only loyalty is to Donald Trump and to their own self-interest.
Regardless of the solution, the process is likely to be long: 18 years after the company's last bankruptcy filing, PG&E customers still see a small fee on their monthly bills to pay for it, labeled the energy cost recovery amount.
This week's elections mark the formal finale to the turbulent 2020 election season more than two months after the rest of the nation finished voting. The stakes have drawn nearly $500 million in campaign spending to a once solidly Republican state that now finds itself as the nation's premier battleground.
Biden isn't ruling out a legislative pathway. In the $1.7 trillion climate plan he released in 2019, which set a goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, Biden said he will demand that Congress enacts legislation in the first year of his presidency to establish a system for achieving that 2050 target. He said he will call on Congress to make huge investments in energy and climate research and incentivize a rapid shift toward clean energy technologies.
Heritage High School officials did not respond to the Times' requests for interviews.
Machu Picchu porters are even tougher than the trail. Sean Cunningham
Also speaking at the rally, Democratic Virginia Sen. Mark Warner accused Trump of using federal workers as pawns.
We'd like to see it avoided, but we're not naive, he said. I respect the taxpayer, I respect the ratepayer and I'm absolutely cognizant of those that lost their homes.
Too often, finding offenders and outing them becomes the focus, instead of how the adults -- the educators and parents -- can support Black, indigenous and students of color and give all students a thoughtful education. It allows too many communities to smugly point fingers and not to look at themselves.
DAVID GREENE, BYLINE: So why is Joe Biden your pick?
Listen to the entire View panel's comments in the video below.
The problem, though, is nuance doesn't usually play well in campaigns, especially in primaries.
Market Forces May Impact Emissions More Than Climate Agreements
Trump is making his second visit to the World Economic Forum, which for its 50th anniversary this year is focusing on climate change and sustainability. A sign at the entrance to the news center notes that paint for this year's installation was made from seaweed and carpets from recycled fishing nets.
The Inca Trail largely consists of stone stairs -- often steep ones -- and those stone stairs weren't meant to be covered by mortals. The result is that the steps feel quite high for those who don't answer to Kobe or LeBron.
Around the table tonight, we have the greatest businessmen in the world, he said. This is a great time to promote what you want to promote.
Idaho welcomed the highest percentage of movers seeking a new lifestyle at roughly 25 percent, while New Mexico led the way for retirees with 42 percent of movers wrapping up their careers.
March 1 Steyer dropped out of the presidential race.
Warnock is facing Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, a 50-year-old former businesswoman who was appointed to the Senate less than a year ago by the state's Republican governor. She is only the second woman to represent Georgia in the Senate, although race has emerged as a campaign focus far more than gender. Loeffler and her allies have seized on some snippets of Warnock's sermons at the historic Black church to cast him as extreme. Dozens of religious and civil rights leaders have pushed back.
Just being here, you have to think, 'Is it really happening?' she said.
Republicans tried a version of Trump's inversion strategy to no avail in the 2018 midterm elections. They tried to paint Democrats as wanting to abolish ICE (the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency) and create single-payer health care.
What is natural to one may not be natural to others, the top court said on Monday. A section of people or individuals who exercise their choice should never remain in a state of fear.
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y. -- who would oversee any impeachment proceedings -- also condemned Tlaib's comments.
'The green agenda is not just a load of green nonsense,' he claims. 'If you do it right, it's the opportunity to create hundreds of thousands of jobs.'
Although Trump has said that most of the people not getting paid are Democrats, he has also sounded notes of empathy during the shutdown.
This younger generation, after all, are not Cold War kids. Someone who is 29 was born the year before the fall of the Iron Curtain. The word socialism just doesn't have the same meaning for them as for those who lived through the nearly 50-year, post-World War II arms race with the Soviet Union and the underlying debate over the ideal society.
Today President Trump is at the G-7 summit and high on the agenda is climate change. Many world leaders are imploring Trump stay in the global climate agreement, but emissions are going down already.
Friends said that after he left the organization, Mr. Buckel became involved in environmental causes, which he alluded to in his note as the reason he decided to end his life by self-immolation with fossil fuels, the New York Times reported.
Loeffler pledged Monday to join a small but growing number of GOP senators protesting Congress' expected certification of Biden's victory Wednesday.
Gov. Gavin Newsom signed more than 1,200 bills into law last year (!!) and while not all of them were rolled out on Jan.1, Californians — and others across the country — can expect to experience hundreds of big changes. From a landmark labor law directed to reign in employment misclassification in the gig economy (but sparking alarm in a vast array of industries) to the first major move toward privacy protection, the Ventura County Star's Megan Diskin has you covered, highlighting the most important changes that could impact your day-to-day.
Steyer demanded an apology from Biden during Friday night's debate, which Biden did not give, and Govan called the charge that he was backing Steyer for money offensive.
For the first minute in very cold water, your brain just goes on a vacation. (Cue several million people Googling cold water near me.) You are nothing except a body experiencing itself. I laugh at this stage, I laugh like my guts are going to fall out of my body, then scream. It's so cold, and yes, that is hard. But it doesn't last that long, and you can feel the unpleasantness of the cold melding with the pleasantness of it until it is all pleasantness, until all you feel is bliss.
With a new Congress now seated, and a majority of Democrats in the House, the power is in their hands to start the process of removing this corrupt and comprised president, Need to Impeach Lead Strategist Kevin Mack said in a statement. We're not backing down, and we're not letting up on our work to hold members of Congress accountable until Donald Trump is out of the White House.
At a rally in northwest Georgia on the eve of Tuesday's runoffs, Trump repeatedly declared that the November elections were plagued by fraud that Republican officials, including his former attorney general and Georgia's elections chief, say did not occur. At the same time, Trump encouraged his supporters to show up in force for Georgia's Tuesday contests.
What the president said last night is, even if you are upset about all of that, you've got to stand up with us and fight, Perdue told Fox & Friends. We'll look back on this day if we don't vote and really rue the day that we turned the keys to the kingdom over to the Democrats.
A new solar array goes up in the U.S. every 150 seconds, but can the whole world be renewable by 2030?
In an apparent back of the hand to critics who say he is allowing massive backsliding on U.S. environmental progress, Trump said the United States has its cleanest air and water in 40 years. And in remarks outside the hall, Trump said he is a very big believer in the environment.
CIA director Gina Haspel has named Cynthia Didi Rapp to the agency's senior-most position atop the Directorate of Analysis. Rapp, a career intelligence official with an analytic background, is not the first woman to hold the role, but she is the third female official and the fifth career intelligence official Haspel has named to a leadership post at the agency in recent months.
In the year 2020, how can a president of the United States give a State of the Union speech and not mention climate change? Sanders asked following the conclusion of Trump's address to the nation:
Announcing an 'LGBT-inclusive' update to all of its products, education giant Pearson has launched a guide to pushing 'social justice' activism in every part of the school curriculum.
Mitt Romney helped create or rebuild great companies like Staples, Sealy (the mattress firm) and the Sports Authority, creating wealth not only for his firm Bain Capital but also for investors. Those businesses also created thousands of jobs. Romney's firm also had some clunkers, but for the most part he and his partners supplied capital to entrepreneurs who took that funding and created solid and enduring companies.
The scientists involved in the analysis rejected the hypothesis that climate change is making these cold extremes more likely by warming the Arctic more than the mid-latitudes and altering the atmosphere's circulation.
Goldberg argued that Ocasio-Cortez wasn't giving her Democratic predecessors the credit they deserve.
Claiming an inclusive curriculum is a crucial part of tackling homophobic bullying in schools, the handbook advises ways in which teachers can alter lessons across the syllabus so LGBT pupils see themselves represented in what they're learning.
Sept. 5 Adjusted Biden view on fracking following confirmation of his stance from the campaign.
At the G20 meeting in Argentina, just days after the release of that dire climate report, US diplomats insisted on noting that the United States reaffirmed its intention to withdraw from the Paris accord.
He was not the only Democrat outraged over the absence of climate change from Tuesday's address.
This will feel very familiar to many investors who have seen all the blithe assumption about operating and maintenance costs on all kinds of technological green marvels fail to meet expectations. Biowaste generators, biomass, thermal pellets – you name it, and the rosy assumptions failed to materialise because the difficulties in making them work and keeping them working were glossed over by the promoters. Most of the smart money already knew that about renewables and is deeply sceptical. The not-so-smart money still laps the deals up. Sadly, renewables is likely to become another charming but flawed investment thesis. I am no stranger to investment madness – three times I've invested in airships and lost my dosh every time.
Minnesota voters elected Omar, and Michigan voters elected Tlaib. Omar also became Minnesota's first Somali-American legislator, the first woman of color elected to Congress from the state and the first woman in Congress to wear a hijab, a Muslim head covering. Democrats will vote on new rules, clarifying the prohibition on wearing hats in the House does not apply to religious headwear.
Pompeo also personally wrote and sent a condescending missive to Benjamin Wittes, the editor-in-chief of Lawfare, after Wittes publicly questioned the contents of a holiday card Pompeo distributed to CIA's workforce.
Ellen DeGeneres won the Globes' Carol Burnett Award for excellence in television, and although she had her own acceptance speech, she was overshadowed by Saturday Night Live star Kate McKinnon's introduction. McKinnon was funny (listing all the clothes she wore doing her DeGeneres impressions) and deeply moving as she recalled how DeGeneres boosted her confidence as a young gay woman. She risked her entire life and her entire career to tell the truth, McKinnon said. That mix of hilarity and heart is exactly the kind of thing an awards-show host needs. Maybe McKinnon will step up next year.
'Motherf—er' is filler, writes Roberts. It means little more than someone more unpleasant than 'unpleasant' can convey. Saying you grab women by the p—y, on the other hand, is truly damaging: It turns members of that gender into something to be played with. Calling immigrants an infestation dehumanizes them.
As the election drew closer, Biden made climate a central part of his bid for the White House, tempering fears among advocates and scientists that he'd take the same slow, moderate approach that Obama had during his first term a decade earlier.
The vast majority of suggestions go far beyond issues of visibility and representation, however, with most of the handbook's tips for creating an LGBT-inclusive curriculum promoting hard-left 'social justice' activism and identity politics in the classroom.
June 21 Added Warren's position on carbon pricing based on a response from her campaign.
Trump's need to undo the Obama legacy is devastating our climate and environment. Regardless of what Trump says, #ClimateChange is real. The US needs to rejoin the #ParisAgreement and take #ClimateActionNow. #SOTU #TrumpLies — Rep. Barbara Lee (@RepBarbaraLee) February 5, 2020
But Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris have options. And they've made it clear they're all on the table.
In his book Clean Disruption Seba describes how the convergence of disruptive technologies and business models makes a renewable world inevitable. He focuses on four factors: the fall in the cost of solar energy, the fall in the cost of storage (batteries), the rise of the electric vehicle, and the advent of the driverless car.
Jan. 10 Williamson dropped out of presidential race.

Statistics provided by the Department of Labor showed that 4,760 federal employees filed for unemployment benefits in the last week of December, an increase of 3,831 from the 929 who applied the week before.
DOUG JONES: Well, I've known Joe for a long time - I mean, 40 years. I first met him as a law student here in Birmingham about - gosh, it was in I think 1978. And I've just - he struck me then as someone who would make a great president. He's the kind of leader that I think the country needs, someone that has incredible domestic policy experience but also foreign policy experience and the kind of leader who brings people together to try to actually get things done.
Consider oil. In 2011, Carbon Tracker calculated that at least 80 percent of the fossil deposits still in the ground would have to stay in the ground if the world is to avoid warming beyond 2C more that pre-industrial levels.
But this intraparty split will carry over to other questions. As Trump weighs in, unbound by any sort of official responsibility, his sway over the party will be tested.
On the other hand, over 7 in 10 moves in Vermont were inbound in 2018. Among the other states that people moved to: Oregon (63.8%), Idaho (62.4%), Nevada (61.8%) and Arizona (60.2%).
Brazil should take everything that happened yesterday seriously, Leitão continued. A president who lies for years and sabotages the bases of the Republic will one day use his powers against the country. We need to strengthen the defenses of Brazilian democracy.
Temperatures were close to 25 degrees colder than normal in a zone that included Minneapolis, Detroit, Buffalo and Boston over the period from Dec. 26 to Jan. 7. Boston's high temperature did not escape the teens for seven days, tying its longest streak in recorded history.
We are being cautiously optimistic about the development today. We have climbed mountains of hope in the past and come toppling down, said gay rights activist Harish Iyer and host of Gaydio, India's first radio show on LGBT issues.
Unfortunately and disgracefully, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has made it clear that he will block, stonewall and try to derail every action by the Biden administration.
The President has brought his drama show back to Washington early , perhaps realizing his time in the White House is down to days and counting. He's also hoping to pressure Republican lawmakers to back his wild and inaccurate claims of fraud when the electoral votes that seal his exit are counted in what's normally an antiquated ceremony.
The New York activist and Democrat, 29, cruised to victory after upsetting established Democrat Rep. Joe Crowley in the primary race. She is already making waves. In November, she kicked off her first day of new-member orientation by participating in a climate change protest at Pelosi's office. Ocasio-Cortez, who voted for Pelosi as speaker Thursday, has said she will oppose a rules package, crafted by Democratic leaders. She opposes its new budget rules that she tweeted are a dark political maneuver designed to hamstring progress on healthcare+other leg.
Republican Marsha Blackburn defeated former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen in a closely watched race for the Senate. Blackburn succeeds retiring Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, as the state's next junior senator and first woman elected to the seat.
More and more, the people we talk to don't like being taken for granted and somebody's firewall, Wukela said. People are tired of the status quo.
June 3 Adjusted Sanders answer on the Paris agreement after clarification from his campaign.
Carolyn Kaster/ASSOCIATED PRESS President-elect Joe Biden announces his climate and energy team nominees and appointees at the Queen Theater in Wilmington, Delaware, Dec. 19.

Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren participates in a climate crisis town hall hosted by CNN in New York on September 4, 2019.
March organizers announced Wednesday that Trump would address the event via satellite. They noted that Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush had addressed the march by telephone, Reagan in 1987 and Bush in 2008.
Trump ran through economic statistics with a salesman's delivery, crowing about growth during his three years in office that he said bested his predecessors and defied his skeptics.

Pelosi, the only woman to have ever served as House speaker, was re-elected to the post on Thursday.
The demonization of this pastor who now preaches in Dr. King's church is part of a long and disgraceful history in Georgia of hostility to its Black residents. In fact, Georgia has never elected a single Black U.S. senator, governor, lieutenant governor, or secretary of state. And yet the Census Bureau estimates that 32% of the state's population is Black.
Still, McConnell went on to tell his colleagues that even with a career as long as his, the vote would mark one of the most significant, perhaps the most significant, he'd ever cast -- and that it would mark the same for each senator on the call, two people familiar with the call told CNN.
Democrats have increasingly sought to make federal workers the face of the shutdown in recent days, amid reports that hundreds of unpaid Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officials are calling out sick at airports.
The other election pits 71-year-old former business executive David Perdue, who held the Senate seat until his term officially expired on Sunday, against Democrat Jon Ossoff, a former congressional aide and journalist. At just 33 years old, Ossoff would be the Senate's youngest member if elected. He first rose to national prominence in 2017 when he launched an unsuccessful House special election bid.
WASHINGTON – The 116th Congress kicked off Thursday with more women and racially diverse lawmakers than ever before – and many freshmen marking firsts for their states or the nation.
This story comes at a time when many schools, like other public institutions, are struggling to address their failures to address systemic racism. And while a very public outing and shaming of a few students here and there might offer some sense of justice, it, unfortunately, lets too many students, parents and educators -- really the whole community -- off the hook.

Honestly, the best part of the awards from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the small organization that votes on the Globes, is that sometimes it helps shine a light on small films and TV shows that could use a boost. This year the lucky recipient was the great Ramy Youssef, the star and creator of Hulu's Ramy, who knew that this big room of Hollywood heavy hitters hadn't seen his show. But they'd better now.
Rapp's appointment, announced internally last month, underscores Haspel's apparent commitment to guiding the agency down a trajectory rooted in stability and deep institutional knowledge. A former clandestine operations officer who in May became the first female director of the CIA, Haspel has surrounded herself by officials with whom she has worked for decades. Seldom in history have the agency's most senior ranks been filled with as many CIA veterans and insiders.
The filing wouldn't make the lawsuits disappear. It would result in all wildfire claims being consolidated into a single proceeding before a bankruptcy judge, not a jury. That could shield the company from excessive jury verdicts and buy time by putting a hold on the claims.
When former President Trump tweets in favor of something, will Republicans pay attention?
Harris on Trump: Lead or get out of the way
Trump received a polite but not enthusiastic reception in the hall.
RICHARD FOWLER: IN GEORGIA SENATE RACES, KEY VOTING BLOC GIVES DEMOCRATS EXCELLENT CHANCE OF WINNING
GREENE: Well, since you know him so well, can you explain some of the curious moments in this campaign? I mean, for one, there was this story that Biden told about being arrested in South Africa on his way to see Nelson Mandela. It was largely disproven. Finally, Biden is saying, OK, I wasn't arrested. I was actually just held up at an airport. Can you understand why these moments cause some doubt for voters?
The leadership positions that she has filled give tremendous credibility to the idea that she is trying to keep the agency down a professional, honest path, said Ned Price, a former CIA analyst who resigned in protest and with some controversy at the start of the Trump administration. They help ensure the agency remains a bastion of unvarnished analysis and operational proposals that are in our best interest.
More recently, a report by the think tank Onward has warned that ten million jobs in 'Red Wall' seats (i.e. traditional Labour constituencies in the Midlands and North which lent their votes to the Conservatives in the 2019 election so that Johnson could deliver Brexit) face being wiped out in Johnson's attempt to reach his 'net-zero by 2050' emissions target.
Illinois (65.9%), Connecticut (62%), New York (61.5%) and Kansas (58.7%) rounded out the top five list for states people were leaving.
Dr. J. Marshall Shepherd is the Director of the University of Georgia's Atmospheric Sciences Program. In 2013, he was the president of the American Meteorological Society, the nation's largest and oldest professional science society in the atmospheric and related sciences.
Newsom agreed PG&E hasn't been a trusted actor in the past, but he said the state must work collaboratively with the utility. He noted that a portion of its leadership is gone, including Chief Executive Geisha Williams, who resigned on Sunday with a $2.5 million severance package.
In the report, titled Climate Neutrality: Are We Ready for an Honest Discussion?, Eric Heymann warns that the EU's green ambitions of 'Net Zero' Carbon emissions cannot be achieved without a fall in standards of living, a reduction in international competitiveness, and a loss in personal freedom.
In early December, Steyer laid the groundwork for a political platform, speaking alongside a panel in Charleston, S.C., at one of five scheduled town halls. Each event focused on the Five Rights of his potential campaign platform, which he called the social contract for the 21st century.
Another underdog with a big win was The Missing Link, which edged out Frozen 2 for the best animated film award. The film comes from Laika Studios, which was behind the incredibly animated Coraline and Kubo and the Two Strings. Their films don't sell as many toys as Elsa and Anna, but they are beautiful to behold.
While Dannenfelser called late-term abortion the most effective piece of our ground game in moving voters, some say the issue is mostly symbolic. About 1 percent of abortions are performed in the third trimester (or after 21 weeks), according to the Guttmacher Institute, which provides research on reproductive health and was founded by Planned Parenthood.
Biden has visited South Carolina eight times thus far, but aides say they expect a near-universal focus on the Palmetto State in upcoming weeks before the primary vote after his last-minute decision to speak there Tuesday night. The primary is heavily, though not entirely, African American and largely focused on the state's bigger cities, such as Columbia, Orangeburg, Charleston and Greenville.
Jan. 18 Included Patrick's support for the Green New Deal, stopping the expansion of nuclear energy at this time, a moratorium on fracking, ending fossil fuel extraction on public lands and eliminating fossil fuel subsidies.
This is the biggest issue in American politics today, Steyer said in his speech Wednesday. We have a lawless president in the White House who is eroding our democracy and it is only going to get worse. Donald Trump's removal from power ultimately decides whether or not we can tackle every other challenge we face in America — and whether or not we continue to live in a democracy of, for, and by the people. It is past time for members of Congress to fulfill their constitutional duty. The question remaining is, what will Congress do?

They were much like so many of the Sanders supporters that one meets all over the country: young, full of passion, shining with belief in the better world promised by the self-described democratic socialist. Many of them were students at nearby colleges. When I asked one whether she'd attended any Sanders rallies in 2016, she laughed and said, I was in high school, and my parents are very conservative. Like Sanders voters everywhere, they said their top issues were either health care or climate change.

In 2020, Trump gets to try to make the argument himself. And people close to him think he can make a winning one.
It is very, very difficult when people make accusations where you say, you know, the Democrats have done nothing, the establishment of the Democrats have done nothing, the host said. And I just want to throw this out to you: [Rep.] John Lewis wasn't sitting still. [Sen.] Dianne Feinstein wasn't sitting still.
That Trump's provocations resulted in Wednesday's melee in Washington set off alarm bells in Bolsonaro's Brazil, as if it were merely the matinee.
In November, Elon released an all-electric long haul truck, and China announced the launch of the world's first all-electric cargo ship.
Marvin Boos is kind of a local hero. The 76-year-old Oxnard resident watched as his community grappled with the effects of a slashed budget, which took a toll on parks and sidewalks. Graffiti removal workers were let go, along with 16 of the city's 52 groundskeepers. Something had to be done — and Boos decided he would do it.
Abby Finkenauer and Cindy Axne: First women elected to House from Iowa
But not enough South Carolina Democrats are like those hopeful college students or the rest of the people who had turned out to Finlay Park to hear Sanders and his surrogates thunder about radical change. More than half of South Carolina's Democratic voters are African American, a demographic that former vice president Joe Biden does well with, rather than Latinos and whites, with whom Sanders is strong; they are older, more religious and less liberal than the ideal Bernie electorate. Too many of the people those Sanders campaigners had tried to turn out were voting for Biden, or Elizabeth Warren, or Tom Steyer.
He's the first president to never crack 50 [percent approval] in his first two years, said Bruce Mehlman, a Republican strategist and attorney who worked as an assistant secretary in the Commerce Department for technology policy. The resistance is really energized, and that's part of why you saw the highest midterm turnout since 1914 last November. The economy has been really strong, but it's showing some worrisome signs. Mr. Mueller's report and/or Democratic oversight will likely make the waters choppier. And voters want change.
June 4 Added Biden positions to several questions after he released his climate plan and his campaign confirmed his stances.
Haspel's immediate predecessor, Mike Pompeo, who is now secretary of state, named Haspel as his deputy, but brought in his longtime business partner, Brian Bulatao, to serve as COO. Brennan chose associates from within the Treasury Department and National Security Council to be his deputies.
The climate change agenda is being driven by the metropolitan liberal consensus in London, where few jobs will be at risk. Outside of London there is little support for Net Zero, but people there have little say in policy decisions. Polling may suggest otherwise, but the public have been deliberately kept in the dark about the real costs and implications involved.
His administration has since made a series of policy and diplomatic decisions or statements that appear to run counter to all of the warnings in the report. None is designed to reduce fossil fuel emissions, as the report said is needed to combat extreme climate change.
Have eyebrows ever been thanked at an awards show before? Stellan Skarsgard, who won best supporting actor in a limited TV series or movie for HBO's Chernobyl, helped kick off the night with an excellent and incredibly surprising speech. Sure, he thanked the series' director, writer and usual suspects. But he also thanked the man who made the prosthetic eyebrows for his character. It was funnier than anything Gervais said all night. Hopefully it starts a trend. Can't wait for someone to thank their fingernails.
Even as Trump faces an impeachment trial, his trip to Davos offers him an opportunity to focus on his economic message. The U.S. economy has continued to notch solid growth and maintain a low unemployment rate, and the stock market has reached record highs in recent days. Trump signed a partial trade deal with China last week, easing global tensions over his use of tariffs.
Looking at the polls, I'd expect him to take Alabama, Tennessee and probably North Carolina. But is a big win in a state he was already widely expected to carry really going to push him over the top in Texas, where he is running eight points behind Sanders and where the Democratic electorate is heavily Latino? Or Virginia, where the D.C. wonketariat is gaga for the technocratic stylings of Warren, Buttigieg and Bloomberg, and where a large youth vote is clearly in the Sanders camp?
In 2017, scientists collected a two-millimeter snippet of George's foot and sent it to San Diego's Frozen Zoo, where the living tissue sample remains frozen. This preservation offers the chance that in the future, the snail could be cloned and allowed to live again, if technology allows.

Unlike a few decades ago, retirees are leaving California, instead choosing other states in the Pacific West and Mountain West, Stoll added.
The move sent a political signal that the Trump administration is intent on shoring up the coal industry and other energy interests, and environmentalists worry that the proposed rule suggests the EPA will set new standards that would weaken the requirements that the agency uses to regulate other types of pollution.
That is a record to be proud of, but you would never have known that from Romney's presidential campaign. Running from your past is smart if your history is dishonorable; otherwise, it is dishonest.

They interact directly with policymakers throughout government and play a lead role in informing the PDB.
CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Pope Francis told President Trump to stick with the Paris agreement, so did France's newly elected president, Emmanuel Macron. The agreement they're so passionate about sets in motion a global effort to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that warm the planet. Trump says it's a bad deal for the U.S. economy. Nearly 200 other nations say it's a good deal for the planet. But climate experts point out that emissions in the U.S. are already going down without the Paris deal.
The University of Tennessee told local media that Groves withdrew voluntarily. Her lawyer (who is also a CNN legal analyst) contested that characterization, saying she was forced to withdraw or her offer of admission would be rescinded. The case does nothing to change the wider culture of racism on college campuses. That change will take a lot more work than singling out one student.
In late 2016 the Financial Times reported that Fitch Ratings warned: Widespread adoption of battery-powered vehicles is a serious threat to the oil industry, noting that transport accounted for 55 percent of total oil use in 2014. In the U.S. it accounted for 71 percent of oil use, according to 2016 figures.

At the federal level, one of the bishops' top issues, Henricks said, is getting the omnibus spending act to include a provision called the Conscience Protection Act, which would allow institutions, companies and people who oppose abortion to not have to pay for it (in employee health plans) or be involved in providing it if they are health-care providers.
That summit, Steyer promised, would be followed by an advocacy day that will include impeachment summit participants fanning out across Capitol Hill to hand deliver articles of impeachment drafted by legal scholars to members of Congress with the simple message: 'We did half the work, now it's up to you to finish the job.'
Witnessing and seeing firsthand how deeply dysfunctional attempts at bipartisan action have been over the last four years have really taken the shine off any notion that there might be some grand 'Kumbaya,' coming-together moment, and that the Biden administration should waste any amount of time whatsoever at the beginning of their administration seeking such a moment, she said.
Shortly after Galligan posted the video, Groves' acceptance to the University of Tennessee's cheer team was revoked. According to the Times, under pressure from their students, alumni and the public, the university encouraged Groves to withdraw, which she did.

On Friday, Trump will address the march from the White House Rose Garden via satellite, according to organizers. But as marchers return for the major annual antiabortion gathering, almost none of the core vows the president made has been fulfilled and there's no clear sign they'll be attained soon. Even so, movement leaders don't blame the president — they fault Congress — and seem relatively hopeful they'll advance their movement in 2018 by limiting later-term abortions and expanding exemptions for businesses or people who don't want to be connected to abortion. At minimum, they agree, Trump welcomed their movement back into the White House and treats them with respect.

Campaign officials and some Biden allies say he has been in the state for decades, raising money for local officials and representing Obama as his vice president. Benjamin, the Columbia mayor backing Bloomberg, and others lauded Kendall Corley, his campaign manager in the state, as one of the best political operatives in South Carolina. Biden has more than 100 pastors across the state who have endorsed him. His aides dismiss the other primaries as dominated by white liberal voters and activists — not the type where Biden necessarily does well.

Mitt Romney, who ran for the presidency twice, is horrified that American voters elected Donald Trump. He is not alone. There are reasons why many Republicans are wary of too close an association with the president, and Romney's op-ed detailed many of those.
The denunciation of socialism and the attempt to tie the philosophy to Democrats is Trump's and his campaign's attempt to invert the argument that he is an extremist. The president's sluggish approval rating means he is going to have to try and pull Democrats down with him — and given that surveys also show he would lose at this point to a generic Democrat, Trump also needs to show their candidates to be unelectable and out of step with the rest of America.

Such remarks would be dangerously anti-democratic in normal times, but any sense of normalcy ceased to exist both in the U.S. and in Brazil years ago. In 2016, dozens of angry, right-wing Brazilians evaded security and invaded the country's National Congress building to call for a military takeover of the government, a small demonstration that nevertheless offered some indication of the discontent that would later drive Bolsonaro to power and portended worse to come. More recently, Bolsonaro has fueled similar outbursts that feel like direct precursors to the sort of insurrection that occurred in Washington.

And hundreds of flying fox bats died because they didn't have enough cover to protect themselves from the heat. Animal rescuers in Sydney described heartbreaking scenes of dozens of dead baby bats piled on the ground. As the adult bats sought shade near a creek, babies were left dangling from trees with no means to survive the heat, according to a charity organization in the Sydney suburb of Campbelltown, home to colonies of flying foxes. Many were found scattered on the ground. Others died before they made it down.

There will be something new. Think back to the beginning of 2020, when Covid was not yet known to be in the country, and the overriding political story was the historic impeachment of Trump for pressuring foreign governments to help him taint Biden.

Why? Because the cost of solar is falling rapidly. In October Saudi Arabia announced the new world record low price in an auction bid: 1.7¢/kWh. When the Kentucky Coal Museum puts solar on its roof rather than plug into the coal fired electric grid at its doorstep, you know that the fossil era is over.

Right now, I'm having a hard time seeing that with Senator Sanders. But that's not to say he can't do it. We have got such a long way to go. I still believe this race is far from over.

But there is a more profound reason that Romney lost to Obama in 2012; he was ashamed of his success. While President Trump has touted his fortune and his accomplishments as a developer (possibly to excess), Romney never talked up his enormous wins as a private equity investor. Maybe he thought American voters would not understand his business dealings, or maybe he thinks that amassing a fortune is somehow shameful.

Alba Hernandez lives in one of Miami's few affordable pockets. She's owned her mobile home in the city's Little River neighborhood since 2003. When she moved in, rent for the patch of land under her house was $245 a month — below what she'd pay for an equivalent apartment in the city.
Although the CIA and Haspel herself have been occasionally thrust into fundamentally political controversies – including those surrounding President Trump's decision to revoke Brennan's security clearance last August; the ongoing, highly-charged fallout from the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi; and, especially during her confirmation hearings, Haspel's own involvement in the CIA's post-9/11 enhanced interrogation and rendition programs – she has consistently avoided public exposure. In doing so she has arguably bucked a trend set in motion by her more press-friendly predecessors.

Sure enough, even before polls closed, the Sanders campaign had all but conceded the state; he wasn't even there to give his concession speech, even though he'd come in a (distant) second. The television talking heads who had been increasingly panicked about a Sanders candidacy even began speculating that former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg could drop out and toss his massive ad buys to Biden. (The Bloomberg campaign hastened to announce he wouldn't.) The consensus was that we were now down to a two-man race, and that meant Biden could easily go all the way.
Some in the audience laughed and rolled their eyes at Trump's claims he has created an inclusive economy that should be a global model. But many business leaders here believe Trump is likely to be reelected and are opting to praise him on topics they agree on.

Since winning election in 2018, far-right Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro has waged an all-out assault on the country's democratic institutions, sought to undermine faith in its electoral system, and trafficked in many of the same voting-related conspiracy theories that Trump and the Republican Party fomented over the last six months.
However, Sanders has yet to address his excessive use of private air travel on the campaign trail. Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings reveal that the socialist senator spent more on private air travel than his rivals in the final quarter of 2019, spending $1,199,579, precisely, on Apollo Jets, LLC, which the Free Beacon notes is a luxury private jet charter service.
Biden will be forced to navigate a similar legislative playing field, except another decade into a rapidly worsening global crisis. Unless Democrats can somehow flip a pair of Republican-held Senate seats in the Georgia runoff election on Jan. 5, the GOP will maintain control of the Senate while Democrats hold a slim majority in the House.

Roberts heralds the Democrat Party's most openly left-wing politicians, casting them as trailblazers pushing against an insufficiently left-wing party establishment.

I, unfortunately, expect to see more in the years to come because there's a limited amount of space in Miami that's developable, Calvo said. These mobile home parks are located in areas that are more and more desirable, especially with climate change and with flooding and areas in Highlands are more attractive to developers.
In Sydney, temperatures hit 117 degrees Fahrenheit on Sunday, the hottest it has been since 1939. That oppressive heat, a side effect of climate change, has made life hard for the country's humans and infrastructure. Heat waves result in 10 percent more calls for ambulances and 10 percent more deaths, local experts said. Police in Victoria, on Australia's southeastern coast, warned drivers last week that a six-mile stretch of a freeway in the central part of the state had melted. A spokeswoman for VicRoads, which manages Victoria's road systems, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. that hot weather caused the asphalt to become soft and sticky and the road surface to bleed.
But as she told stories of Biden taking photos as he held a fundraiser at her family's Charleston house, and being so distraught when he bowed out in 2016 that her mother sent her flowers, she conceded that it would probably be a dogfight.
If we are to achieve climate neutrality, we will need to change our behaviour in all these areas of life because it is impossible to do any of the above things in a carbon neutral way. The only way this is likely to happen, he warns, is through government compulsion.

Given that those fossil assets are on the balance sheets of some of the world's wealthiest companies and form the basis of the sovereign wealth funds of many nations around the world, John Fullerton of the Capital Institute predicted that this implied a write-off of at least $20 trillion dollars. In contrast, Fullerton warned, the 2008 financial collapse was triggered by the stranding of only $2.7 trillion in mortgage assets.

The most famous cocktail is the pisco sour, consisting of lime juice, simple syrup, egg white, ice and Angostura bitters. There are assorted variations, such as the coca sour for those who feel the pisco sour requires more bitterness.
Trump largely steered clear of discussing domestic political issues during his speech to the forum in 2018, instead using his remarks to tout his accomplishments and encourage business leaders to invest in the United States. He did take a brief swipe at the opposing party, pointing out that some of the people in the room supported Democrats over him in 2016. He also drew a smattering of boos when he attacked the news media as fake.
That isn't to say that many Republican voters don't regret Romney's defeat. The former Massachusetts governor would have been a much better president than Barack Obama, given his considerable management expertise and profound understanding of the economy.

Now, Ventura County Supervisors are asking voters if they'd be willing to help pick up the tab. In the coming weeks, a poll will be conducted in the county to gauge support for an uptick in the sales tax. The Ventura County Board of Supervisors voted 3-2 last month to allocate up to $100,000 to a polling firm that will find out how popular a potential new ballot measure on the issue would be.
These states and cities deserve to once again have a partner in the White House, the Biden plan reads. Biden will be that partner.
In doing so, he has underlined how difficult it will be for President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. to forge a united front with allies against China's authoritarian policies and trade practices, a central focus of the new administration's plan to compete with Beijing and check its rising power. The image of Mr. Xi joining Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, President Emmanuel Macron of France and other European leaders in a conference call on Wednesday to seal the deal with the European Union also amounted to a stinging rebuke of the Trump administration's efforts to isolate China's Communist Party state.

There is a huge generational divide: A majority of young people, those aged 18 to 29, see socialism positively and have a dimmer view of capitalism. Older Americans have a more sharply negative view of the term — 41 percent of those aged 30 to 49, 30 percent of those aged 50 to 64 and just 28 percent of those 65 and older view it positively.
A funny acceptance speech is always welcome, but so are those that elevate thank you to the HFPA to something deeper.

This follows a Global Carbon Project report in December that said global carbon emissions were estimated to rise by 2.7% for all of 2018.
But, Romney would not have disrupted the status quo, and that's what voters wanted. Millions of Americans were fed up with a globalist agenda, tired of being told the U.S. had run out of gas, furious over the absurdities of political correctness – they wanted a change, and they elected Donald Trump.

He added: I think people are frustrated that [Iowa and New Hampshire], the first state that couldn't even get the results counted, and the second, a very small state, are setting the narrative. Neither is representative of the electorate. We have to let the race play out.
Biden, by contrast, speaks easily and naturally of his own faith and connects it with that of his likely voters here. He has been telling a story about how he shared his own suffering at the death of his son with the survivors of Dylann Roof's horrific attack on the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. It makes a big impression at the rally I attended on Friday night, and illustrates why Biden carried voters who regularly attend religious services by more than 40 percentage points while Sanders won those who never attend.
Their finding that the intensity of Arctic cold is easing in a warming world is supported by many other studies.

Pollution ravages our planet, oozing inhabitability via air, soil, water, and weather, Buckel wrote in the email sent to the Times. Most humans on the planet now breathe air made unhealthy by fossil fuels, and many die early deaths as a result — my early death by fossil fuel reflects what we are doing to ourselves.

Loeffler and Perdue were both against additional $2,000 COVID-19 economic stimulus checks before they were for the checks (but only after Trump's belated tweet storm).

As someone who loathes the administration, the short-term report card — [it] has to be said — is not bad. . . . Those of us who said, 'He's just playing you,' we were wrong about that — in the short term, said Charles Camosy, an ethics and theology professor at Fordham University who writes books and articles about abortion. But when we said that, we meant we're not fighting for the next five years but for the next 50. And what will our children think of the pro-life movement when it's headed by the 'Grab 'em by the p—y' guy?
Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, did not directly address the theme during his 30-minute address here, although he did call for rejecting the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse and went out of his way to urge Europe to use America's vast supply of oil and natural gas.
Romney would not have pulled us out of the Paris Climate Agreement, because he would have feared the backlash. He would have been too polite to throw over the Iran nuke deal, or to confront the Chinese on their ongoing theft of intellectual property or demand that our NATO allies up their defense spending; he would not have resolutely, without fail, put America first.
I might be too pessimistic about Biden's chances. It all feels just too close to the emotional roller coaster we #NeverTrumpers rode back in 2016, when we spun elaborate fantasies about the field narrowing and a champion emerging to take down the Orange Menace.

It's going to be interesting to see how Democrats walk and define the line when it comes to socialism. The word makes many Americans — and some Democrats, especially older ones — uncomfortable.
I can relate, Trump told reporters this weekend. And I'm sure that the people that are on the receiving end will make adjustments. They always do. And they'll make adjustments. People understand exactly what's going on. Many of those people that won't be receiving a paycheck, many of those people agree 100 percent with what I'm doing.
Myers Jaffe supports a federalist model for addressing climate change, one to organize state voluntary efforts into a federally led initiative that would build a national policy without letting one or two states dictate through the courts, she said.

I certainly understand the perspective of those pro-life advocates who support him, said Kelsey Hazzard, president of Secular Pro-Life, who noted that things would be worse for the antiabortion movement under a Hillary Clinton presidency. President Trump has also sparked a tremendous backlash. His boorish comments give ammunition to the abortion lobby, which has long worked to caricature the antiabortion cause.
JONES: Look, I think that Senator Sanders has a great number of supporters that are raising issues about poverty, about health care. But the way that they want to do things with Medicare for All I just don't think is a viable option. And I'm not sure how Senator Sanders right now will try to bring people around to accomplish what we all want to accomplish, and that is health care for everyone in one form or another. That's just one issue. I think his issues on climate change are farther than they need to be at this point because we've got to make sure we do things to keep people employed and we do it smart. But my concern is whether or not there will be an ability to pull people together to try to get things accomplished as opposed to it's got to be this way or that way.
While some analysts feared his wealth and lack of political experience would alienate progressives, Steyer had an extensive array of advisers and strategists at the ready, owing in part to his longstanding involvement in national politics.
Warnock has been endorsed by former Presidents Jimmy Carter (a fellow Georgian) and Obama, and by former U.N. Ambassador and Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young. Warnock is also backed by former Democratic candidate for governor of Georgia and Georgia House of Representatives Minority Leader Stacey Abrams of Fair Fight, a national voting rights organization rooted in Georgia.
David Bryant, a retired social worker from New York who lives in Columbia, said he was deciding between Steyer — whose name he at first struggled to recall — and Sanders. He said he liked Biden but had not seen a commercial from him or heard anything from his campaign, and he thought Biden, 77, lacked the vigor that some of the other candidates had.

Jayd Henricks, who just stepped down as the longtime lobbyist for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the main action both for and against abortion rights is in the states because Congress is generally broken, outside this whole issue.
There will be so much more Covid. The beginning of Biden's presidency will likely be judged more for what he does to kickstart the use of Covid vaccines than for any large policy proposals. The country is at war with the disease and, as he prepares to take office, thousands of Americans are dying each day. He's promised to move heaven and earth to get vaccines out to Americans, something more easily said than done as he navigates public skepticism of vaccines.

For abortion opponents, this felt like night and day after the previous eight years, during which both parties became inhospitable to minority views (Democrats who oppose abortion access, Republicans who believe in protecting it) and the Democratic Party platform for the first time in 2016 called access to abortion core to women's, men's and young people's health and well-being.
School leaders who have not already done so should take a long hard look at these Instagram accounts, which detail painful experiences of social exclusion, overt racism and academic discrimination. Real change requires more than just discipline for the offenders. Schools need to proactively teach anti-racism without doing more harm -- which means they need training in the best methods to do so.
Shame on Mitt Romney. Publishing an ad hominem attack on President Trump in The Washington Post on the cusp of occupying a Senate seat that he won with the help of an endorsement from the Oval Office was dishonorable. In addition, it underscored what many voters suspected all along about Romney: that he is not to be trusted.

Wildlife volunteers and rescuers spent Sunday picking up bodies of about 200 flying foxes, most of which were babies, according to the charity Help Save the Wildlife and Bushlands in Campbelltown.

During the 2016 election campaign, abortion advocates on both sides studied Trump's past as a supporter of abortion rights and Planned Parenthood for clues about how reliable, true or deep his conversion to the other side has been. At this point, the analysis of Trump seems to have stopped, and the focus has shifted to the fact that he has surrounded himself with leaders well known in the antiabortion movement, including Vice President Pence (who spoke at last year's march) and Charmaine Yoest, longtime leader of Americans United for Life and now a top communications executive at the Department of Health and Human Services.

Volunteers for the Biden campaign have been instructed to tell potential supporters that Steyer is a good Democrat but lacks experience.
As the Obama and Trump presidencies prove, it could likely be a rocky road. Absent new legislation, the White House must creatively interpret its legal mandate to enact rules under existing statutes, leaving them open to challenge. Republican state attorneys general sued the Obama administration so routinely that the top cop in Texas joked: I go into the office in the morning. I sue Barack Obama, and then I go home. GOP-led states persuaded the Supreme Court to block Obama's signature power plant regulation in 2016, and that was before Trump added three right-wing justices to the bench and stacked lower federal courts with conservatives. Red states are already vowing to pursue that same strategy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we need to keep yelling and screaming and hollering until this president opens up that government -- of the people, for the people and by the people, Hoyer continued.

He will also travel to Georgia for his last political rally as President, when he encourages voters there to show up for the all-important January 5 runoff and protect Republicans' Senate majority. There are, as of this writing, two developing complications for Trump. He's spent months attacking the electoral system as fraudulent, particularly in Georgia , where he lost. And one of the Republican candidates, Sen. David Perdue, will have to quarantine after coming into contact with someone who tested positive for Covid-19.
Some party officials, lawmakers and strategists in Columbia say they have received little contact from Biden's campaign.
Obama picked Ken Salazar, an oil and gas ally, as his interior secretary, and balanced new federal support for renewable energy with boosts to fossil fuel drillers, promising an all of the above energy play. The approach relied on Congress, both chambers of which Democrats controlled when Obama took office, to enact a new carbon pricing scheme that would gradually increase the cost of fossil fuels and incentivize a shift to solar, wind and energy efficiency. Democrats' landmark cap-and-trade bill ― a conservative and incrementalist policy that aimed to set a cap on carbon emissions, then let companies trade pollution permits ― fizzled in 2010. Going forward, the GOP, seemingly hell-bent on obstructing anything Obama proposed and financially encouraged by dark-money groups unleashed by the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United ruling, adopted a full-fledged position of denying the reality of climate change itself.

Deb Haaland and Sharice Davids: First Native American congresswomen
Former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres and physicist Stefan Rahmstorf last year warned that the world has approximately three years before the worst effects of climate change become inevitable. In an open letter they urged companies, communities, countries and citizens to cut carbon emissions now, arguing that failure means fires, floods, droughts, rising sea levels, extreme weather, agricultural losses and massive insurance costs. Between 2008 and 2016, climate related disasters displaced 21.5 million people.
There is not gonna be any bend right here, Trump added.
I think it's funny that whenever people talk about swimming in cold water they immediately start talking about how good it is for you. Oh that's so good for your immune system, it's good for your heart, it's good for your skin, it's good for your circulation, good for your anxiety. Maybe at another time in human history I would have cared, but at this point, I'm like, what does good for you even mean? Two months ago I saw the sun disappear, and it will not be the last time, so, forgive me if I feel like the good for you ship has sailed.
If we only look at it from the perspective of political agitation, it seems like [Bolsonaro] is only trying to get more support and make these people angry so they can support him with even more passion, Boghossian said. But when Trump really does something about it, when he does something concrete, then we see what Bolsonaro can really do.
The director of one of the year's most acclaimed films, South Korea's Parasite, accepted the award for foreign language film with this biting missive: Once you get over the 1-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films. May we all heed his words of wisdom.
Trump's hysterical radical socialist rants clearly did not resonate with the majority of the voting public in Georgia or across the United States in the November election, and I don't think this nonsense will work for the runoffs in Georgia.
PG&E serves about 40 percent of California's utility customers, Newsom said, making it the nation's largest utility. It operates in three-quarters of California's land most vulnerable to wildfires, Newsom said. While PG&E's equipment has been named the cause of multiple recent fires, experts blame climate change for extending California's wildfire season and making blazes more deadly and destructive.
Travelers in less trafficked areas of the world often find businesses that won't take MasterCard or Visa, much less American Express. Peru offers an extra twist: occasionally shops refuse these cards despite displaying signs advertising them.
Anyone doubting this risk must have been sobered when, in September 2017, China announced it was going to phase out internal combustion vehicles. Given that China represents a quarter of the global automobile market, this – coupled with India, France, the UK, and Norway making similar announcements – is an existential crisis for both the oil and car industries.
One year later, those words seem like something from a different era. Covid rages, impeachment feels like a footnote to history and, rather than suffer Trump's sabotage, Biden will soon be president.
There will be a split among Democrats. It's much easier to be united in pursuit of power than it is to stay united in power. Trump, to his credit, was able to effectively marshal Republicans, often through fear and bullying, during his time in office. As president, it's unlikely Biden will use those same tactics. And he'll have to contend with progressives on the left who want more attention to big problems like climate change and inequality that require systemic change the moderates in his party have less interest in pursuing. A year from now, it will be much easier for Republicans to focus on Biden's policies -- and he's likely to be a relatively moderate president -- in a way to aggravate and turn off progressives. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders won't quietly let Biden take the moderate route. Neither will Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or the Congressional Black Caucus.

Instead, Steyer, who spoke at an event in Des Moines, Iowa, declared that he will undertake and oversee a laundry list of activities in 2019 aimed at removing Trump from office.
Others close to Biden have taken a more aggressive tack in criticizing Steyer, accusing him of paying supporters for their endorsements.

It has also been nearly unbearable for some animals. Anytime we have any type of heat event, we know we're going to have a lot of animals in need, animal specialist Kristie Harris told the BBC. It was so hot that possums burned their paws on roofs and roads. Birds needed to be specially rehydrated. Koalas around the region were being sprayed down to keep them cool.
Even a closely divided Democratic Senate wouldn't guarantee Biden everything he wants, given chamber rules that require 60 votes to move most major legislation. But if Democrats lose even one of Tuesday's contests, Biden would have little shot for swift up-or-down votes on his most ambitious plans to expand government-backed health care coverage, strengthen the middle class, address racial inequality and combat climate change. A Republican-controlled Senate also would create a rougher path for Biden's Cabinet picks and judicial nominees.
Democrats have hammered Perdue and Loeffler, each among the Senate's wealthiest members, for conspicuously timed personal stock trades after members of Congress received information about the public health and economic threats of COVID-19 as Trump and Republicans downplayed the pandemic. None of the trades has been found to violate the law or Senate ethics, but Warnock and Ossoff have cast the Republicans as self-interested and out of touch.
Harpootlian, a longtime bomb-thrower in the state, grinned on a recent morning when recounting the episode and his appearance in the debate. I'm sorry for causing a distraction, he said, when asked about Biden's comments during the Friday debate that Harpootlian was sorry. If they want to get in the weeds, I'm happy to get in the weeds with them.
Attack on Democracy, the front page of Estado de S. Paulo, one of Brazil's largest newspapers, blared in bold, capitalized letters on Thursday morning ― coverage of news from afar that nevertheless felt like a plea for Brazilians to heed the danger facing their own republic.

Was the Incan era a highlight of Peruvian history? Unquestionably. But when Peruvian museums boast artifacts from before Christ, focusing exclusively on Atahualpa and his predecessors is akin to being so impressed by books that you conclude world history began with the Gutenberg press.
The company plans to develop the plot in the next three to four years, building luxury housing along with up to 2,500 units of affordable housing, Feldman said. He added that none of the mobile home residents would be forced to move if they didn't want to. He also denied that mobile home residents have been evicted, describing the eviction notices as a negotiating tactic.
There will be calls for sanity. Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse criticized those who would object to the electoral votes of Pennsylvania, and perhaps other states, when they're counted January 6.
Pressley rushed around National Statuary Hall, hoping to find her place in in line to take her photo with Pelosi.
The results also will help demonstrate whether the political coalition that fueled Biden's victory was an anti-Trump anomaly or part of a new landscape.
The Loudoun County school district -- one of the wealthiest counties in the country -- commissioned a report , presented to the superintendent in June 2019, which showed a pattern of students and teachers using racial slurs widely and disproportionate disciplinary measures meted out to White and Black students, who spoke of their growing sense of despair that racist events, large and small, are ignored and school leaders do not believe their reports of mistreatment.

No such thing actually occurred in the U.S., and no such thing is likely in Brazil, where the voting system is far more efficient and immediately accurate than any in the United States. But that doesn't matter to Bolsonaro. The point is to find even the smallest kernel of evidence to bolster wild-eyed conspiracy theories.
It is, in theory, an advantage a president has when he's up for re-election with a locked-down base and no primary opposition — yet. His potential Democratic opponents will have to outflank each other, and that often can mean being the most stridently progressive (or conservative, in GOP primaries).
President Trump is moving aggressively to define the Democrats as old-fashioned, Cold War-style socialists. Now, it's up to the Democrats to define what it is they are for.
On the Monday, General Motors, which had reclaimed its coveted status of the world's leading automobile manufacturer on the strength of its Bolt electric car, announced that its future is electric. Meanwhile, Daimler, Volkswagen and Volvo have committed to electrifying their entire product portfolios.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
Recall that McConnell famously stated in 2010: The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.
Mobile home parks are one of the few affordable options in a country that's seen skyrocketing housing costs. In Florida, 1 in 6 housing units is a mobile home, Calvo told CBS News.

More than 100 billionaires are on the official attendee list for the World Economic Forum, and Trump plans to meet with the heads of several multinational companies while in Davos.
That diverges from the country overall, as only slightly more than a third (37 percent) of Americans have a positive view of socialism. Socialism also rates lowest when people are asked about it in a list that includes small business, entrepreneurs, free enterprise, capitalism, big business and even the federal government. Since Trump's election, however, socialism is the only one on that list to gain popularity.
GREENE: Well, what specifically worries you about Bernie Sanders? You said you're worried about him bringing all the - you know, a full coalition together. What are you specifically worried about?

There were few signs for Biden in yards around Columbia, and a recent visit to the Columbia field office gave no indication of bustle.
After the report published, the district released a plan to fight systemic racism and issued a formal apology for the district's history of segregation. In June 2020, the school board also put out a statement following the death of George Floyd affirming their commitment to a safe, empathetic, respectful, and supporting learning environment for every student, acknowledging that Loudoun County is not immune from the effects of systemic racism and noting that even as we work for positive change, we recognize that harm is done by racist and hate-filled statements and acts.
It seemed a year ago that Trump, with the leadership of the GOP in Congress, had the momentum to repeal and replace Obamacare, and certainly that also included the abortion provisions, said Heather Boonstra, director of public policy at Guttmacher. That also included the defunding of Planned Parenthood. This was a very real item and real concern for us. I think it goes to show how the Republicans just didn't have a plan, in many ways.
We want to emphasize that we are not asking for any special rights. We are asking for constitutional rights given to any citizen in the country, said Koninika Roy from the Humsafar Trust that works with the LGBT community.
June 3 Updated campaign carbon footprint question with additional categories to reflect variety of answers. Also added Harris answers on fossil fuel subsidies and leasing on public lands after her campaign indicated her co-sponsorship of relevant legislation.
GREENE: Democratic Senator Doug Jones of the state of Alabama. Really appreciate talking to you, Senator. Thank you.
It is not as though the wealthy former private equity mogul needs to secure a future career as a GOP-turncoat talking head, as ex-Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., may hope to become. Last year, anti-Trumper Flake met with MSNBC President Phil Griffin and CNN's chief Jeff Zucker, sparking speculation that post-Senate he would become a contributor to one of those outlets.
Sept. 4 Additional information added from the climate plans of several candidates, including many that include specific U.S. emissions targets. Moved Castro out of 'Unclear' to better characterize his position on fracking.
Like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has announced that she's formed an exploratory committee ahead of a possible presidential run, Steyer often has tangled publicly and personally with Trump.
The Trump administration pursued its energy, climate and environmental deregulatory agenda with little regard for states' rights and interests, he said, citing, among other things, the administration's decision to revoke California's ability to set its own stronger fuel economy standards. This approach does not produce durable policy. As we've seen, many of the Trump administration's rollbacks and replacement rules have been struck down in the courts, and many more will meet the same fate.
California lawmakers are returning to the capital with a long to-do list — topped by an ambitious proposal to start a $4.2 billion climate bond. The funds would help the state prepare for dangerous natural disasters including worsening wildfires.
Along the famed trail you'll often be reminded of the Peruvian proverb: When the road is long, even slippers feel tight.
COOPER: Do you have a specific on the tax rate?
GREENE: But there are voters who have said that some of these types of missteps in the campaign have caused them to question. I mean, what do you tell voters who say what's going on here?
We're three for three on Seba's predictions. But in Seba's scenario it's the autonomous electric vehicle (AEV) that drives the real reduction in cost he claims will make the disruption inevitable. Are AEVs more than just science fiction?
In a sit-down interview with Anderson Cooper for CBS's 60 Minutes, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) floated taxing the wealthy as much as 70 percent to fund her climate change plan called the Green New Deal.
Experts say there are numerous ways for the incoming Biden administration to empower states and shore up its own gains even if a Republican unseats him in 2024.
A better politics isn't necessarily a more profane politics. But the left half of the left wants to push broader boundaries, and it's no wonder they worry when the rest of the party starts to pull instead. The liberal vanguard Tlaib belongs to seeks massive change, from Medicare for all to a grand climate bargain. They see no hope for compromise now, so they look to a future of Democratic control, when ramming transformation through will require breaking things. The party establishment so far has shown small desire to do so. And that, Tlaib might say, is a motherf—ing shame.
Upon Trump's election, many antiabortion groups circulated his list of four key pledges, goals he'd worked out with movement leaders: nominating antiabortion Supreme Court justices, signing a law ending late-term abortions, stripping funding from Planned Parenthood and making permanent a ban on taxpayer money going to abortions.
You decide. But realize that if the evidence laid out here is true, it has profound implications for everything. It will mean the dissolution in value, likely complete loss of the oil, gas, coal, uranium, nuclear, utility, auto industries, the banks that hold the loan paper for all of these companies and the pension funds and insurance companies that are invested in them.
The Natural Resources Defense Council warned that bankruptcy could threaten billions in funding for PG&E's clean energy initiatives, which are key to California's environmental goals. PG&E is the state's largest investor in energy efficiency and electric vehicle infrastructure, said the NRDC's Ralph Cavanagh.
Beyond their stark ideological contrasts to President Donald Trump's agency heads, Biden's top-level nominees also appear to signal the new administration's plans to embed climate policies at the state level, cementing the clean-energy transition and making it harder for the next GOP president to undo whatever progress his administration makes.
Expect to see trashcans in bathrooms next to the toilet.
Thunberg was quick to respond, updating her Twitter biography to describe herself as a teenager working on her anger management problem.
June 1 Adjusted Gabbard's answers on the Green New Deal and the Paris climate agreement to reflect a clarification from her campaign and a specific pledge.
All eyes are on you, Georgia. The health, safety and security of the American people are at stake.
This is the wreckage I was elected to clean up, Trump said Tuesday of the bleak economic landscape he inherited.
It appears unwise to have any of your assets in the industries that will be disrupted. Bevis Longstreth, former Securities and Exchange Commissioner, observed: It is entirely plausible, even predictable, that continuing to hold equities in fossil fuel companies will be ruled negligence.
OCASIO-CORTEZ: You know, you look at our tax rates back in the '60s, and when you have a progressive tax rate system, your tax rate, you know, let's say from 0 to $75,000 may be 10 percent or 15 percent, et cetera. But once you get to like the tippy tops, on your 10 millionth dollar, sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 percent or 70 percent, that doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate, but it means that as you climb up this ladder, you should be contributing more.
State officials are investigating whether the utility's equipment sparked the deadliest, most destructive wildfire in California history, a November blaze that killed at least 86 people and burned down 15,000 homes.
There's pisco. There's ceviche. And, yes, there's that famous trail. Don't worry, we'll get to all of those. First, some things you may not already know:
Aug. 19 Updated several positions for Castro based on a response from his campaign.
President Trump's tweets in favor of $2,000 stimulus checks got several GOP senators to endorse the idea, although McConnell effectively killed it
Protesters initially gathered near the AFL-CIO building in Washington, where union leaders placed the blame squarely on Republicans.
For her part, in the nearly eight months since she became director, Haspel has issued only a handful of brief statements and made public remarks essentially once – at her alma mater, the University of Louisville, in September.
I can't find the money at this moment. That is impossible for me in this moment, said Hernandez, who lives on a fixed income and says medical issues prevent her from working.
But some residents of the park, unwilling to fight the rent hikes, have already left, Calvo said. While about half of the 100 eviction attempts were dismissed, about 20 are still pending, she said.
Republicans said if the election turned out to be about that, as opposed to a more nuanced discussion of border security and pre-existing conditions, they felt they could win or hold their own. It didn't happen. Instead, in an election where Trump was front of mind, Democrats won over suburban voters and independents, and took back the House by flipping 40 seats.
Black voters in South Carolina really like Joe Biden, trust Joe Biden and respect Joe Biden, said Steve Benjamin, the mayor of Columbia and a Bloomberg supporter. But they are pragmatic and want to win and beat Trump. If your number one argument is electability, and you can't crack the top four in two or three states in a row, that's a tough argument to make.
Ocasio-Cortez has taken a number of anti-establishment positions since arriving on the political scene. She ruffled the feathers of some party colleagues in November when she encouraged future primary challenges against Democratic incumbents. She also participated in a climate change protest outside then-House Minority Leader Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office during her congressional orientation.
The scenario is a common one in many low-income communities in increasingly pricey cities. But in low-lying Miami, it's more than real estate speculation driving the new owners. It's also the fear of climate change.
Climate change a key issue as voters head to polls on Super Tuesday Environmental policy is set to be a key issue as voters head to the polls on Super Tuesday. CBS News meteorologist and climate specialist Jeff Berardelli joins CBSN to discuss why climate change matters more this year than ever before.
Jan. 31 Adjusted Patrick's stance on fracking after additional input from his campaign.
JOYCE: A 10 percent drop in emissions. President Obama promised to cut emissions well over twice that under the Paris agreement. In the end, though, the decision about staying in or leaving the Paris agreement is not just about hitting numerical targets. Hafstead, who's with Resources for the Future, says what the U.S. does sends a message to the rest of the world.
Climate change has made severe cold spells like the one that recently gripped the Northeast far less common than they used to be, a team of researchers has found.
Despite brushing off criticisms of Tlaib's use of vulgar language from unspecified pro-civility crusaders, in a column published in November, Roberts called for amplified political censorship across Facebook and Twitter. She encouraged social media companies to further flex their power to shut down disinformation and false news, terms she neglected to define.
GREENE: So, I mean, I'm sure you're aware he faces an uphill battle going into Super Tuesday. I mean, he is at a huge fundraising disadvantage compared to Bernie Sanders right now. He's been behind in the polls in some very big states like California and Texas. How does he overcome that?
Former senior CIA official Carmen Medina, who spent over three decades at the agency and served as Deputy Director of Intelligence, agreed.
And the impact South Carolina may have on the broader race remains unclear. Biden can ill afford another defeat in the Feb. 22 Nevada caucuses, which take place one week before the primary here, and the outcome here will be quickly swamped by Super Tuesday on March 3, when states including California, Texas and Virginia hold their primaries.
Biggest issues in Michigan ahead of the Democratic primary CBSN's Elaine Quijano sits down with Jonathan Oosting, Michigan politics reporter for Bridge magazine, on Red and Blue. He talks about the significance of Governor Gretchen Whitmer's endorsement of Joe Biden, how Biden's and Bernie Sanders' climate change policies would affect autoworkers, and other key factors for Michigan voters.
The coming year is sure to include its own twists, and our collective view of this strange and tumultuous period will change as it's stretched through time and perspective.
