it was a disaster, she said.
the problem is that once you get outside of the south, and particularly in the big states, the democratic electorate looks more like the people who have been voting for sanders than it does like conservative southern black voters. if biden runs the tables in the south on tuesday, and sanders wins everywhere else, is the party going to nominate the guy who carried california and texas and massachusetts, or the guy who won all the states that are virtually guaranteed to vote for a republican come november?
gervais lost his shock and awe
this follows a global carbon project report in december that said global carbon emissions were estimated to rise by 2.7% for all of 2018.
a better politics isn't necessarily a more profane politics. but the left half of the left wants to push broader boundaries, and it's no wonder they worry when the rest of the party starts to pull instead. the liberal vanguard tlaib belongs to seeks massive change, from medicare for all to a grand climate bargain. they see no hope for compromise now, so they look to a future of democratic control, when ramming transformation through will require breaking things. the party establishment so far has shown small desire to do so. and that, tlaib might say, is a motherf—ing shame.
the shutdown, which enters its 21st day friday, will be the longest in history by this weekend. most of the government workers received their last paycheck two weeks ago.

we've seen more mail from steyer than any candidate, times three, said benjamin, echoing a sentiment from others in the state. others said they had received so much mail and watched so many steyer ads that it is a joke in their households that you cannot escape him.
truth be told, loeffler and perdue — not warnock and ossoff — are the radical candidates running in georgia. the republican candidates are out-of-touch with georgia voters and values and reject their senate oath of office, which pledges them to support and defend the constitution of the united states against all enemies, foreign and domestic. their only loyalty is to donald trump and to their own self-interest.
it's really about whether an agenda that moves the nation forward can be forged without significant compromise, said martin luther king iii, the son of the civil rights icon. there are a lot of things that are in the balance.
republicans are unified against biden's plans for health care, environmental protection and civil rights, but some fear that outgoing president donald trump's brazen attempts to undermine the integrity of the nation's voting systems may discourage voters in georgia.
in the report, titled climate neutrality: are we ready for an honest discussion?, eric heymann warns that the eu's green ambitions of 'net zero' carbon emissions cannot be achieved without a fall in standards of living, a reduction in international competitiveness, and a loss in personal freedom.
to oversee the effort, biden picked gina mccarthy, barack obama's former epa chief and architect of the administration's regulatory suite, as his domestic climate czar, a position obama initially created in his first term to coordinate the federal government's energy and environmental strategy and work to get climate legislation passed in congress.
rapp's appointment, announced internally last month, underscores haspel's apparent commitment to guiding the agency down a trajectory rooted in stability and deep institutional knowledge. a former clandestine operations officer who in may became the first female director of the cia, haspel has surrounded herself by officials with whom she has worked for decades. seldom in history have the agency's most senior ranks been filled with as many cia veterans and insiders.
biden's administration could condition federal funding for state plans to build electric vehicle infrastructure and clean energy, or pay states to prepare climate action plans and stipulate that they be subject to federal enforcement or forced to return the money if they don't meet those goals. such a program would need to be voluntary, and could be expanded to include funding for states that agree to conserve additional land under their control, but it's a possibility, said michael gerrard, director of columbia law school's sabin center for climate change law.
biden, by contrast, speaks easily and naturally of his own faith and connects it with that of his likely voters here. he has been telling a story about how he shared his own suffering at the death of his son with the survivors of dylann roof's horrific attack on the emanuel african methodist episcopal church in charleston. it makes a big impression at the rally i attended on friday night, and illustrates why biden carried voters who regularly attend religious services by more than 40 percentage points while sanders won those who never attend.
market forces may impact emissions more than climate agreements
in 2013 he founded nextgen america, a political action committee and nonprofit working to combat climate change.
more and more, the people we talk to don't like being taken for granted and somebody's firewall, wukela said. people are tired of the status quo.
yes, biden had a big win on saturday in south carolina. he's catching up to sanders in the delegate race, because south carolina has a lot of delegates, and he will probably have a big fundraising night. he should have a nice tail wind heading into super tuesday. but where is he going to win big?
but it's also not clear, boghossian said, that other institutions, including lower ranks of the military and the judiciary, would stand firm in the face of an all-out challenge should bolsonaro manage to incite one.

i'm so excited to be here,'' said haaland, sporting native garb, before rushing off to cast a vote. it took native women 240 years to get on the house floor.
the move sent a political signal that the trump administration is intent on shoring up the coal industry and other energy interests, and environmentalists worry that the proposed rule suggests the epa will set new standards that would weaken the requirements that the agency uses to regulate other types of pollution.
luis macedo/afp via getty images in november 2016, dozens of protesters invaded the brazilian congress to call for a military takeover of the government. it was peaceful compared to the riots that took place this week in the united states but foreshadowed further calls for the closure of the country's congress and supreme court from right-wing brazilians.

unfortunately and disgracefully, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., has made it clear that he will block, stonewall and try to derail every action by the biden administration.
the other election pits 71-year-old former business executive david perdue, who held the senate seat until his term officially expired on sunday, against democrat jon ossoff, a former congressional aide and journalist. at just 33 years old, ossoff would be the senate's youngest member if elected. he first rose to national prominence in 2017 when he launched an unsuccessful house special election bid.

″it's probably the first forming galaxy we've seen, and if that's right, galaxy formation is a much more extended process than heretofore imagined,″ stanislav djorgovski of the harvard-smithsonian center for astrophysics told the associated press back in 1987. ″that's something very new and changes our conception of how galaxies form,″ djorgovski added.
jones: look, i think that senator sanders has a great number of supporters that are raising issues about poverty, about health care. but the way that they want to do things with medicare for all i just don't think is a viable option. and i'm not sure how senator sanders right now will try to bring people around to accomplish what we all want to accomplish, and that is health care for everyone in one form or another. that's just one issue. i think his issues on climate change are farther than they need to be at this point because we've got to make sure we do things to keep people employed and we do it smart. but my concern is whether or not there will be an ability to pull people together to try to get things accomplished as opposed to it's got to be this way or that way.
state officials are investigating whether the utility's equipment sparked the deadliest, most destructive wildfire in california history, a november blaze that killed at least 86 people and burned down 15,000 homes.
pressley, a former boston city councilor who became the first black women to represent massachusetts in the house, tweeted a picture of the plaque bearing her name outside her new door in one of the house office buildings.
do you think conditions have improved for women in stem fields since you entered the arena? things have gotten better. the national science foundation has a program called advance, where instead of just trying to hire individual women, you actually try to change the culture, like instead of dropping individual salmon in the stream, we're actually trying to change ecosystems so that more salmon will survive. i did that for five years, and we managed to go from having both the teaching and research faculty at lamont go from having single-digit numbers of women to having double digits. we still don't see women in as many leadership positions as i'd like, and the harassment issue is probably one of the reasons we lose so many women in the pipeline in particular. considering the cultural conversation, this is our chance to see if we can address those problems within science and to sit down and say: what have we let go by? what have we not spoken up about? and how can we make it so we can understand what our code of conduct is going to be?
the best way to stop mcconnell is to elect ossoff and warnock to give democrats 50 senate seats — creating a tie with the 50 republican senators. vice president harris will cast the tie-breaking vote to give democrats majority control of the senate.
he described the 4.7 percent unemployment rate before he took office as reasonably high, even though it was well below the average rate in the united states over the past 70 years. he also took credit for additional funding that has been approved for historically black colleges and universities, saying inaccurately that the funding saved the schools from ruin.
sacramento, calif. - the announcement by the nation's largest utility that it's filing for bankruptcy puts pacific gas & electric co.'s problems squarely in the hands of gov. gavin newsom and state lawmakers, who now must try to keep ratepayer costs down, ensure wildfire victims get the money they're owed and rethink california's energy picture in the face of climate change.

that trump's provocations resulted in wednesday's melee in washington set off alarm bells in bolsonaro's brazil, as if it were merely the matinee.
among them was the administration's expansion of the mexico city policy, which withholds u.s. funding from foreign organizations that provide or promote abortion. the policy flips on and off when a new political party takes the white house, but trump applied the policy to almost all global health assistance, some $8.8 billion. past gop presidents had limited it to the money the united states gives annually in family planning, about $600 million.
lawyer anand grover, who appeared for five members of the lgbt community who had petitioned the court seeking a review of the ban, told the thomson reuters foundation: it is a big relief and a primary step taken by the supreme court to review its earlier order.
one problem with making someone like groves emblematic of broader racism harbored within an institution is that it risks absolving others of examining their own behaviors. it makes her the exception, instead of recognizing what she said as a symptom of the prevailing climate at her school and in her school district.
biden isn't ruling out a legislative pathway. in the $1.7 trillion climate plan he released in 2019, which set a goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, biden said he will demand that congress enacts legislation in the first year of his presidency to establish a system for achieving that 2050 target. he said he will call on congress to make huge investments in energy and climate research and incentivize a rapid shift toward clean energy technologies.
christopher joyce, byline: pope francis told president trump to stick with the paris agreement, so did france's newly elected president, emmanuel macron. the agreement they're so passionate about sets in motion a global effort to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that warm the planet. trump says it's a bad deal for the u.s. economy. nearly 200 other nations say it's a good deal for the planet. but climate experts point out that emissions in the u.s. are already going down without the paris deal.

house judiciary committee chairman jerry nadler, d-n.y. -- who would oversee any impeachment proceedings -- also condemned tlaib's comments.
there is some possibility of compromise on issues such as nuclear power, carbon capture technology and research funding for renewables, all things included in the bipartisan spending bill passed last month. but a legal mandate to rapidly phase out fossil fuels and intervene radically in the economy is difficult to envision, given the makeup of the 117th congress.

antiabortion advocates have been pleased with the trump administration's high-profile efforts for their cause, including attempting to block four undocumented minors from receiving abortions.
the biden-harris administration intends to pull every lever available, not only through executive and legislative action, but partnering together with cities, states, and businesses to reverse course on the climate threat, advance environmental justice and a clean energy future, and create millions of good-paying union jobs, jamal brown, a biden transition spokesman, told huffpost in an email.

he was featured in many newspaper, magazine and online articles, and hundreds of school children and visitors to the lab eagerly viewed him, the last of his kind, the department wrote last week.
but some people close to the operation have grown worried that biden is no longer a sure bet in this state's feb. 29 primary and that his uneven performances on the campaign trail could dampen support. some who once saw biden as the strongest potential challenger to president trump are looking at others, including billionaire mike bloomberg, who won't be on the ballot here but is competing in states that vote a few days later on super tuesday.
pompeo also personally wrote and sent a condescending missive to benjamin wittes, the editor-in-chief of lawfare, after wittes publicly questioned the contents of a holiday card pompeo distributed to cia's workforce.
there are nuanced differences between brazil and the united states that the ready-made comparisons between trump and bolsonaro often obscure. still, it's undeniable that trump's election in 2016 was a preview of what followed in brazil two years later. brazil didn't learn the lessons on offer from its northern neighbor then. but this time, it still has a chance to heed the warnings before it's too late.

lima is peru's largest city by far. it's home to more than a quarter of peru's roughly 30 million people, has wonderful food, the beautiful miraflores district (where you can drink while overlooking beaches lined with small rocks that form eye-catching patterns each time the tide rolls out) and excellent museums.

justice neil m. gorsuch, before he became trump's supreme court nominee, had not been called on to consider — or rule on — abortion as a federal judge. however, he has written about bioethics and human life with language that makes abortion opponents believe he will side with them on the topic.

as president trump visited the southern border in mcallen, texas, and declared that he will almost definitely use his emergency powers to build the wall if talks remain stalled, the demonstrations emphasized the financial strain imposed on government employees since the shutdown began dec. 22.
essential government workers, like tsa agents, have been required to show up to work without pay, and have little basis for an unemployment claim, analysts said. while furloughed workers and government contractors may have stronger unemployment claims, they would likely have to return the money if congress approves back pay to furloughed workers once the shutdown ends, as it has done with previous shutdowns.
ocasio-cortez has taken a number of anti-establishment positions since arriving on the political scene. she ruffled the feathers of some party colleagues in november when she encouraged future primary challenges against democratic incumbents. she also participated in a climate change protest outside then-house minority leader speaker nancy pelosi's office during her congressional orientation.

on friday, trump will address the march from the white house rose garden via satellite, according to organizers. but as marchers return for the major annual antiabortion gathering, almost none of the core vows the president made has been fulfilled and there's no clear sign they'll be attained soon. even so, movement leaders don't blame the president — they fault congress — and seem relatively hopeful they'll advance their movement in 2018 by limiting later-term abortions and expanding exemptions for businesses or people who don't want to be connected to abortion. at minimum, they agree, trump welcomed their movement back into the white house and treats them with respect.

black voters in south carolina really like joe biden, trust joe biden and respect joe biden, said steve benjamin, the mayor of columbia and a bloomberg supporter. but they are pragmatic and want to win and beat trump. if your number one argument is electability, and you can't crack the top four in two or three states in a row, that's a tough argument to make.
steyer had been considered by many analysts to be a potential contender for the white house, and had taken apparent steps in that direction. in recent months he ran television advertisements in which he appeared personally to call for trump's removal, appeared at numerous political events, and even named a potential campaign manager.
pelosi, the only woman to have ever served as house speaker, was re-elected to the post on thursday.
unsurprisingly, climate activists and scientists revolted, with some dubbing him middle ground joe. the biden campaign dismissed the report, and biden himself defended his record as an early champion of climate action.
if we are to achieve climate neutrality, we will need to change our behaviour in all these areas of life because it is impossible to do any of the above things in a carbon neutral way. the only way this is likely to happen, he warns, is through government compulsion.
there will be so much more covid. the beginning of biden's presidency will likely be judged more for what he does to kickstart the use of covid vaccines than for any large policy proposals. the country is at war with the disease and, as he prepares to take office, thousands of americans are dying each day. he's promised to move heaven and earth to get vaccines out to americans, something more easily said than done as he navigates public skepticism of vaccines.

given how much the climate has warmed, the scientists called the recent cold exceptional. yet, as frigid as it was, the scientists found that there were many similar or colder two-week periods in that region in earlier periods. they made clear that, on balance, cold outbreaks like these are getting less frequent due to global warming, but cold waves still occur somewhere in north america almost every winter.

so mcconnell's goal 10 years ago — in his own words — was not to serve the american people. not to create jobs, improve health care, strengthen education, protect national security, or fight for equal rights. no, he admitted that his top priority was to do everything humanly possible to hurt president obama's reelection prospects, regardless of the harm inflicted on the american people. you can bet every penny you have that mcconell feels the same way about our incoming president.
harvey weinstein indicted in los angeles

trump's hysterical radical socialist rants clearly did not resonate with the majority of the voting public in georgia or across the united states in the november election, and i don't think this nonsense will work for the runoffs in georgia.
marvin boos is kind of a local hero. the 76-year-old oxnard resident watched as his community grappled with the effects of a slashed budget, which took a toll on parks and sidewalks. graffiti removal workers were let go, along with 16 of the city's 52 groundskeepers. something had to be done — and boos decided he would do it.
in a tuesday morning note, height securities noted the difficulty of finding a legislative fix for pg&e's complex problems. as of today, it wrote, we do not see a clear path to action that would avoid a bankruptcy filing.
taking a page from trump's angry and divisive playbook filled with a mountain of lies, republican sens. kelly loeffler (running against warnock) and david perdue (running against ossoff) have gone on the attack and have falsely and ridiculously labeled their respective democratic challengers as radical socialists.
sure enough, even before polls closed, the sanders campaign had all but conceded the state; he wasn't even there to give his concession speech, even though he'd come in a (distant) second. the television talking heads who had been increasingly panicked about a sanders candidacy even began speculating that former new york mayor mike bloomberg could drop out and toss his massive ad buys to biden. (the bloomberg campaign hastened to announce he wouldn't.) the consensus was that we were now down to a two-man race, and that meant biden could easily go all the way.
the proof of these divides is already evident in the scrutiny biden has faced from progressives in the selection of his cabinet.
the other three pledges don't appear to be going anywhere.
climate change has made severe cold spells like the one that recently gripped the northeast far less common than they used to be, a team of researchers has found.

at the end of the day, politics and elections are typically binary choices, said andy surabian, who worked in the 2016 trump campaign war room, was political director for tea party express and is now a political adviser to donald trump jr. the biggest gift to trump is for democrats to nominate what i call a 'kneeler,' someone who supports kneeling for the national anthem.

former un climate chief christiana figueres and physicist stefan rahmstorf last year warned that the world has approximately three years before the worst effects of climate change become inevitable. in an open letter they urged companies, communities, countries and citizens to cut carbon emissions now, arguing that failure means fires, floods, droughts, rising sea levels, extreme weather, agricultural losses and massive insurance costs. between 2008 and 2016, climate related disasters displaced 21.5 million people.
greene: well, since you know him so well, can you explain some of the curious moments in this campaign? i mean, for one, there was this story that biden told about being arrested in south africa on his way to see nelson mandela. it was largely disproven. finally, biden is saying, ok, i wasn't arrested. i was actually just held up at an airport. can you understand why these moments cause some doubt for voters?
a lot of the reaction to the times story has focused on the cost to groves for something she did at 15: admission to her dream college and sports goals she'd pursued for years.

even as the planet warms overall, some scientists who were not involved in this analysis have published studies that show climate change may be altering the atmosphere's steering currents in ways to concentrate punishing cold in certain locations at certain times.
meanwhile, house majority leader steny hoyer said he didn't think comments like these particularly help. and rep. emanuel cleaver, d-mo., said members were aghast at tlaib, d-mich., lamenting a fever among some colleagues to impeach trump.
it is very, very difficult when people make accusations where you say, you know, the democrats have done nothing, the establishment of the democrats have done nothing, the host said. and i just want to throw this out to you: [rep.] john lewis wasn't sitting still. [sen.] dianne feinstein wasn't sitting still.
you've got a director, deputy director and coo who are all career intelligence officers, and two-thirds of whom are analysts – you'd have to go back decades for that to be true, priess said. this is also leadership at cia at a time of unprecedented institutional tension with the president – it's meaningful that it's not being run by the president's own people, but by career officers. this could have gone in a very different direction.
climate change a key issue as voters head to polls on super tuesday environmental policy is set to be a key issue as voters head to the polls on super tuesday. cbs news meteorologist and climate specialist jeff berardelli joins cbsn to discuss why climate change matters more this year than ever before.

if we only look at it from the perspective of political agitation, it seems like [bolsonaro] is only trying to get more support and make these people angry so they can support him with even more passion, boghossian said. but when trump really does something about it, when he does something concrete, then we see what bolsonaro can really do.
read the transcripts! trump tweeted shortly after meeting with a group of global business leaders representing industries including energy, telecommunications and finance. before the meeting, he decried the impeachment process in remarks to reporters — repeatedly calling it a hoax.

it is not as though the wealthy former private equity mogul needs to secure a future career as a gop-turncoat talking head, as ex-sen. jeff flake, r-ariz., may hope to become. last year, anti-trumper flake met with msnbc president phil griffin and cnn's chief jeff zucker, sparking speculation that post-senate he would become a contributor to one of those outlets.

honestly, the best part of the awards from the hollywood foreign press association, the small organization that votes on the globes, is that sometimes it helps shine a light on small films and tv shows that could use a boost. this year the lucky recipient was the great ramy youssef, the star and creator of hulu's ramy, who knew that this big room of hollywood heavy hitters hadn't seen his show. but they'd better now.
harpootlian, a longtime bomb-thrower in the state, grinned on a recent morning when recounting the episode and his appearance in the debate. i'm sorry for causing a distraction, he said, when asked about biden's comments during the friday debate that harpootlian was sorry. if they want to get in the weeds, i'm happy to get in the weeds with them.

we have the technologies to solve the worst of the crises facing us, and buy the time to deal with the rest. back in 2009, stanford scientist dr. mark jacobson said that renewable energy could power the entire world by 2030. his solutions project calculated how to do this for every state in the u.s. and many countries. more recently, scholars like christian breyer have shown how to do this with photovoltaics alone.

jan. 18 included patrick's support for the green new deal, stopping the expansion of nuclear energy at this time, a moratorium on fracking, ending fossil fuel extraction on public lands and eliminating fossil fuel subsidies.
it is, in theory, an advantage a president has when he's up for re-election with a locked-down base and no primary opposition — yet. his potential democratic opponents will have to outflank each other, and that often can mean being the most stridently progressive (or conservative, in gop primaries).
in his book clean disruption seba describes how the convergence of disruptive technologies and business models makes a renewable world inevitable. he focuses on four factors: the fall in the cost of solar energy, the fall in the cost of storage (batteries), the rise of the electric vehicle, and the advent of the driverless car.
during the 2016 election campaign, abortion advocates on both sides studied trump's past as a supporter of abortion rights and planned parenthood for clues about how reliable, true or deep his conversion to the other side has been. at this point, the analysis of trump seems to have stopped, and the focus has shifted to the fact that he has surrounded himself with leaders well known in the antiabortion movement, including vice president pence (who spoke at last year's march) and charmaine yoest, longtime leader of americans united for life and now a top communications executive at the department of health and human services.
although the law banning homosexuality is rarely enforced in india, it is used to intimidate, harass, blackmail and extort money from gay people, activists say.
aside from making history, tlaib said the whole event made her a little emotional.
huang's experiences span categories and continents. she was executive producer of data made to matter, a podcast from the mit sloan school of management, and was also an adjunct instructor in podcasting and audio journalism at northeastern university. she worked as a project manager for public artist ralph helmick to help plan and execute the founder's memorial in abu dhabi and with stoltze design to tell visual stories through graphic design. huang has traveled with scientists looking for signs of environmental change in cameroon's frogs, in panama's plants and in the ocean water off the ice edge of antarctica. she has a degree in environmental science and public policy from harvard.
thirty-four-year agency veteran beth kimber became the first woman to lead the agency's directorate of operations earlier in december. sonya holt, who likewise spent over three decades at cia, assumed the role of chief diversity and inclusion officer in august, when similarly long-serving cia officials vaughn bishop, now deputy director, and andy makridis, now chief operating officer (coo), were also named.
trump is an outlier at the forum for his views on climate change. the president has publicly criticized global efforts to combat rising temperatures and has made ridiculing energy-efficient products a key part of his reelection stump speeches.
sept. 5 adjusted biden view on fracking following confirmation of his stance from the campaign.
o'rourke: we need to support the people of puerto rico
california has set some good and aggressive climate targets, and getting there is going to require breaking ground that hasn't been broken before, shannon eddy, executive director of the large-scale solar association told the desert sun. it requires very important conversations about land use, conversations that are deep and profound and difficult. ... the whole world is facing these decisions on a macro level.
democratic success will likely depend on driving a huge turnout of african americans, young voters, college-educated voters and women, all groups that helped biden become the first democratic presidential candidate since 1992 to win georgia. republicans, meanwhile, have been focused on energizing their own base of white men and voters beyond the core of metro atlanta.
omar, with family in tow, navigated through the u.s. capitol and down a hall to a space crowded with statues and mostly new members of congress.
here's a breakdown of some of the firsts:

more than 3 million georgians voted before tuesday. some precincts in metro atlanta showed light-to-steady turnout tuesday morning with no lines and voters taking just a few minutes to complete their ballots.
such remarks would be dangerously anti-democratic in normal times, but any sense of normalcy ceased to exist both in the u.s. and in brazil years ago. in 2016, dozens of angry, right-wing brazilians evaded security and invaded the country's national congress building to call for a military takeover of the government, a small demonstration that nevertheless offered some indication of the discontent that would later drive bolsonaro to power and portended worse to come. more recently, bolsonaro has fueled similar outbursts that feel like direct precursors to the sort of insurrection that occurred in washington.
joyce: that's kate larsen with the rhodium group, which does research on climate economics. emissions in the u.s. have declined by about 12 percent since 2005. a new study by rhodium says that decline is likely to continue.
today president trump is at the g-7 summit and high on the agenda is climate change. many world leaders are imploring trump stay in the global climate agreement, but emissions are going down already.
campaign officials and some biden allies say he has been in the state for decades, raising money for local officials and representing obama as his vice president. benjamin, the columbia mayor backing bloomberg, and others lauded kendall corley, his campaign manager in the state, as one of the best political operatives in south carolina. biden has more than 100 pastors across the state who have endorsed him. his aides dismiss the other primaries as dominated by white liberal voters and activists — not the type where biden necessarily does well.
the frigid spell was particularly noteworthy for occurring when the planet is steadily warming because of the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. climate warming from the increase in these heat-trapping gases does not eliminate cold waves, but it tends to weaken them.
with the senate likely to remain in republican hands this year, biden seems to be preparing to resurrect the obama administration's approach after democrats lost the house in the 2010 midterms: a combination of aggressive regulation, executive orders and close collaboration with states.
for the first minute in very cold water, your brain just goes on a vacation. (cue several million people googling cold water near me.) you are nothing except a body experiencing itself. i laugh at this stage, i laugh like my guts are going to fall out of my body, then scream. it's so cold, and yes, that is hard. but it doesn't last that long, and you can feel the unpleasantness of the cold melding with the pleasantness of it until it is all pleasantness, until all you feel is bliss.
the climate change agenda is being driven by the metropolitan liberal consensus in london, where few jobs will be at risk. outside of london there is little support for net zero, but people there have little say in policy decisions. polling may suggest otherwise, but the public have been deliberately kept in the dark about the real costs and implications involved.
and yes, despite president trump's baseless claims that he actually won in the state, recounts have proven beyond any doubt that biden carried georgia. trump now makes the ridiculous and delusional claim that the state's republican governor and secretary of state are part an imaginary plot that deprived him of a victory.
it's the same problem, she said. the money. the money is a problem in this country.
on a recent monday, dozens of workers and volunteers were calling and plotting visits from the sanders headquarters. a sign on the wall said the bernie 2020 wish list included folding chairs, water, juice, coffee, world peace, an espresso machine, snacks and gatorade. the only item with a check mark was a microwave. the room looked like a college democrats meeting.
biden, addressing supporters here tuesday night as new hampshire results showed him running near the bottom of the field, portrayed south carolina as friendlier political terrain for him — and more representative of the party.
the handbook calls for schools to push a left-wing agenda across every subject, recommending science teachers explore gender stereotypes and barriers to participation in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (stem) subjects.

is your job at risk? companies will either become part of the solution, or they won't be a problem because they won't be around. the emerging industries are creating millions of jobs, but millions are at risk. will we substitute a universal basic income? will we descend into unimaginable darkness? or will we create a finer future?
i, unfortunately, expect to see more in the years to come because there's a limited amount of space in miami that's developable, calvo said. these mobile home parks are located in areas that are more and more desirable, especially with climate change and with flooding and areas in highlands are more attractive to developers.
joyce: which could have far greater consequences for global warming than how far off the climate mark the u.s. ends up.
warnock is facing republican sen. kelly loeffler, a 50-year-old former businesswoman who was appointed to the senate less than a year ago by the state's republican governor. she is only the second woman to represent georgia in the senate, although race has emerged as a campaign focus far more than gender. loeffler and her allies have seized on some snippets of warnock's sermons at the historic black church to cast him as extreme. dozens of religious and civil rights leaders have pushed back.
'motherf—er' is filler, writes roberts. it means little more than someone more unpleasant than 'unpleasant' can convey. saying you grab women by the p—y, on the other hand, is truly damaging: it turns members of that gender into something to be played with. calling immigrants an infestation dehumanizes them.
so you just got in there, and i know you got lots of good ideas, the host said, but i would encourage you to sit still for a minute and learn the job.
throughout the first two years of his presidency, bolsonaro's most radical supporters have called for the closure of the national congress and the supreme court, and last year, a handful of militants were arrested after shooting fireworks at the supreme court building, as if to mimic a bombing. bolsonaro doesn't always endorse the worst, but he's always there to stoke the fervor among them.
we do not find any evidence for an intensification of these types of cold waves due to the arctic warming faster than the midlatitudes, they concluded. in fact, they said, less arctic air is coming south than it used to.
according to an annual study from united van lines, new jersey was the top state people were moving out of in 2018, while vermont topped the list as the top state people moved to.
we are being cautiously optimistic about the development today. we have climbed mountains of hope in the past and come toppling down, said gay rights activist harish iyer and host of gaydio, india's first radio show on lgbt issues.
eventually, prince said she went to the campaign office, where she was assigned to door-knock in a poorer part of columbia. prince, who is in her 70s, went alone, with a script to remind black voters that biden was obama's vice president. hardly anyone was home, she said, and most yards had signs warning of dogs.
gabrielle roesch, who identified herself a government scientist, wrote on twitter: applied for unemployment....even though i have a job... surreal.

in his op-ed in the washington post, romney tempers his criticisms of the president by lauding some of trump's accomplishments, saying the president was right to align u.s. corporate taxes with those of global competitors, to strip out excessive regulations, to crack down on china's unfair trade practices, to reform criminal justice and to appoint conservative judges.

analytic issues facing the agency range from the threat posed by near-peer competitors like russia and china, to persistent proliferation concerns from north korea and iran, to the national security implications of climate change, to incorporating big data and other analytic inputs into its assessments, said david priess, a former analyst and daily intelligence briefer during the clinton and george w. bush administrations. the new dda will have to see how well analysis is being incorporated into ops, and vice versa.
the partisan divides that inhibited strong climate action during the obama years have only deepened under trump, a reality that horowitz hopes will be enough to deter the biden administration from futile attempts at reaching across the aisle to address climate change.

few senate republicans want to make this choice, which is why party elders had tried to shield themselves from it. but now that hawley has decided to object, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has made it clear to lawmakers he's giving them room to vote their conscience, according to a source familiar with a thursday conference call on which mcconnell asked hawley -- who was not in attendance -- to explain his rationale.

jones: well, i don't think that that is going to be the issue at the end of the day. whether it's ok or not i don't think is going to be the issue. the issue that people are looking for - they're looking for a leader that is going to help get things done. they're looking for people to be able to reach across the aisle but also bring people within their own party together to find the common ground to make sure this country goes forward in a positive way. and i think that's the main issue, and that's why you see the people of south carolina - they know joe biden. they know his fallacies. they know his positives. and that's why the people of south carolina overwhelmingly gave him the victory they did the other night and why i think he's going to do very well on super tuesday.

the city, whose most exclusive neighborhoods are close to the sea and barely above sea level, is increasingly getting flooded during high tides. the city is moving to raise streets and sidewalks by two feet, at a cost of about $1 million a block, but adaptation will only be a partial help. water is rising right through the ground, permeating the porous limestone on which much of miami sits. the sea walls other cities are considering won't work here.
it will mean an economic collapse on a scale never seen coming at us within about 10 years.
school leaders who have not already done so should take a long hard look at these instagram accounts, which detail painful experiences of social exclusion, overt racism and academic discrimination. real change requires more than just discipline for the offenders. schools need to proactively teach anti-racism without doing more harm -- which means they need training in the best methods to do so.
in the united states there was objection from the military, from congressmen from the republican party, from electoral authorities from the republican party in the states, and from the vice president, boghossian said. i'm not sure that bolsonaro is going to have the objection of all these players in brazil. … the checks and balances and the democratic institutions and all the authorities involved in the political process might not be as hard on bolsonaro as the american authorities were on trump.

steyer vowed in a statement to spend 100% of his time and energy focused on removing donald trump from power through the group need to impeach, which he founded in october 2017. he committed to spending $40 million on the effort to have trump removed from office in 2019.
they were much like so many of the sanders supporters that one meets all over the country: young, full of passion, shining with belief in the better world promised by the self-described democratic socialist. many of them were students at nearby colleges. when i asked one whether she'd attended any sanders rallies in 2016, she laughed and said, i was in high school, and my parents are very conservative. like sanders voters everywhere, they said their top issues were either health care or climate change.
the brutal reality is offshore wind is far less efficient than promised and requires much more expensive maintenance. they break down, sink into their foundations and don't generate anything like the power expected. for all the due diligence, they simply won't ever make any money unless the price at which they sell energy is dramatically increased – at which point they make zero sense.

(cnn) in recent years and especially since the death of george floyd, high school and college students have been using social media to expose everyday racism they confront at school. a r ecent story in the new york times about two high school graduates from virginia was particularly dramatic.
a vote against the objections is to accept the decision of the people but defy the grassroots of the gop and fail a fealty test to trump, likely inviting a primary challenge in the near future.

rep. jim langevin, a rhode island democrat and the first quadriplegic elected to congress in 2010, presided over the first day of business for the new congress, serving as the speaker pro tempore.
witnessing and seeing firsthand how deeply dysfunctional attempts at bipartisan action have been over the last four years have really taken the shine off any notion that there might be some grand 'kumbaya,' coming-together moment, and that the biden administration should waste any amount of time whatsoever at the beginning of their administration seeking such a moment, she said.
throw in the chance of heavy rains -- test your waterproof gear pretrek to make sure it's just that -- and the trail can feel less like vacation than boot camp.
the two u.s. senate runoff elections that will be held in georgia tuesday will determine whether the senate will work in partnership with president-elect joe biden to build a better future for americans, or whether republican obstructionists who put politics ahead of patriotism will be empowered to do everything possible to oppose our new president.
the lesson of the trump years is that executive order is a weak tool, said amy myers jaffe, managing director of the climate policy lab at tufts university. the biden team absolutely needs to see how they can support states ― from new england wind to stricter methane rules mirroring colorado to california's clean freight and [electric vehicle] policies.

editor's note — follow anthony bourdain parts unknown on twitter and facebook
the trump administration pursued its energy, climate and environmental deregulatory agenda with little regard for states' rights and interests, he said, citing, among other things, the administration's decision to revoke california's ability to set its own stronger fuel economy standards. this approach does not produce durable policy. as we've seen, many of the trump administration's rollbacks and replacement rules have been struck down in the courts, and many more will meet the same fate.

houser said affordable technology exists to grow the economy while reducing emissions, but that requires policy to deploy those technologies in the market. and we've seen a freeze in that kind of policy at the federal level over the past few years.
vermont independent sen. bernie sanders, who delivered his own rebuttal to trump's tuesday night address from the oval office, also rallied attendees on thursday. sanders has consistently accused the white house of manufacturing a crisis, and has argued that climate change and health care are more urgent concerns than illegal immigration.
meanwhile, sanders has taken a different approach. michael wukela, a senior aide for the campaign, said sanders is focused on places and issues where other candidates are not — a climate change town hall in myrtle beach, a medicare-for-all breakfast in florence and a visit to a shuttered hospital not far from columbia.

it feels like it was with bush, said bart stupak, a former michigan congressman and a democrat who opposes abortion and worked to keep federal funding out of the affordable care act. it's all political posturing. the only thing that seemed newly energized, he said, was the house's attempt at the 20-week ban.

your stance seems to run counter to the attitude that the planet is beyond help and there's not much more we can do. do you think you're more optimistic than most? being pessimistic isn't going to get us there. we have to take action. i've been helping review the national climate assessment report, which provides an in-depth look at how climate change affects the country, and it's fascinating to see how different the impact is in different regions. people are starting to organize at the level at which they live, and that's probably what gives me hope. new york and california are significant economies and have shown that their governments can act.
democratic sen. doug jones endorses former vice president joe biden
marjorie jones dannenfelser, president of the susan b. anthony list, which advocates for abortion opponents in politics, said that was not the federal piece abortion opponents were going after, but it is a type of defunding of planned parenthood. everything is still in progress, she said.

that diverges from the country overall, as only slightly more than a third (37 percent) of americans have a positive view of socialism. socialism also rates lowest when people are asked about it in a list that includes small business, entrepreneurs, free enterprise, capitalism, big business and even the federal government. since trump's election, however, socialism is the only one on that list to gain popularity.
in late 2016 the financial times reported that fitch ratings warned: widespread adoption of battery-powered vehicles is a serious threat to the oil industry, noting that transport accounted for 55 percent of total oil use in 2014. in the u.s. it accounted for 71 percent of oil use, according to 2016 figures.

even as trump faces an impeachment trial, his trip to davos offers him an opportunity to focus on his economic message. the u.s. economy has continued to notch solid growth and maintain a low unemployment rate, and the stock market has reached record highs in recent days. trump signed a partial trade deal with china last week, easing global tensions over his use of tariffs.
harris on trump: lead or get out of the way
no such thing actually occurred in the u.s., and no such thing is likely in brazil, where the voting system is far more efficient and immediately accurate than any in the united states. but that doesn't matter to bolsonaro. the point is to find even the smallest kernel of evidence to bolster wild-eyed conspiracy theories.
after the report published, the district released a plan to fight systemic racism and issued a formal apology for the district's history of segregation. in june 2020, the school board also put out a statement following the death of george floyd affirming their commitment to a safe, empathetic, respectful, and supporting learning environment for every student, acknowledging that loudoun county is not immune from the effects of systemic racism and noting that even as we work for positive change, we recognize that harm is done by racist and hate-filled statements and acts.

however, sanders has yet to address his excessive use of private air travel on the campaign trail. federal election commission (fec) filings reveal that the socialist senator spent more on private air travel than his rivals in the final quarter of 2019, spending $1,199,579, precisely, on apollo jets, llc, which the free beacon notes is a luxury private jet charter service.
roberts praises tlaib — a self-described democratic socialist aligned with sen. bernie sanders (i-vt) and rep. alexandria ocasio-crotez (d-ny) — for articulating a cogent case of the country in crisis via the trump administration.
boris johnson's green revolution is a slow motion train crash in the making. even those invested in 'climate change' as a genuine threat are starting to wake up to the problem.
from the beginning, the worry in brazil was that bolsonaro was a more dangerous version of trump, a force that would offer a much tougher stress test for younger, less entrenched institutions. trump and the republican party ultimately proved american institutions weaker than many initially presumed, but in the end, the country's elections, the judiciary that oversees them and the congress required to certify them appear to have held ― if only just, and if only (possibly) just for now.

steyer seemed to tie the president's rhetoric not only to pipe bombs mailed across the country by an outspoken trump supporter in florida, but also to a massacre by a lone gunman at a pittsburgh synagogue in late october.

the president has brought his drama show back to washington early , perhaps realizing his time in the white house is down to days and counting. he's also hoping to pressure republican lawmakers to back his wild and inaccurate claims of fraud when the electoral votes that seal his exit are counted in what's normally an antiquated ceremony.

throughout president trump's overseas trip this week, he's been getting an earful about climate and how important the paris climate agreement is. many foreign leaders say the u.s. should not abandon it, and president trump tweeted this morning that he will make a final decision next week. but as npr's christopher joyce reports, staying in or out of that paris deal may not make that much difference.

rep. deb haaland (d-n.m.), one of the first two native american women elected to congress and a strong supporter of the green new deal movement, would replace a former oil lobbyist if the senate confirms her as head of the interior department. in place of the ex-coal lobbyist running the environmental protection agency would be michael regan, who brokered the biggest coal-ash cleanup settlement in u.s. history as north carolina's top environmental regulator. the energy department would swap a fossil fuel die-hard for jennifer granholm, michigan's former governor and attorney general and now a clean energy advocate.
he had really high hopes, but i don't think when he was thinking about the opportunities that awaited his children as he brought us here,'' omar recalled as she rushed to get in line for a ceremonial picture with the new speaker of the house nancy pelosi. i don't think that he imagined that they would be of abundance - that he would within a little over 20 years take his daughter to get sworn in into the united states congress. and so we are humbled and overwhelmed really with joy.
kate larsen: the u.s. has successfully bent its greenhouse gas emissions curve. and we are going to continue to reduce emissions over the next 10 years, likely regardless of trump policy.
american views have remained quite steady for decades — since the mid-1990s, about half, give or take a few percentage points, have said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 40-odd percent have said it should be illegal in all or most cases. but the march draws a passionate, largely religious crowd that tends to highlight the political climate and take cues from whoever sits in the nearby white house and which party leads congress.
clearly pg&e has made a decision that the legislative arena is not where they feel they're going to get the kind of results that will go far enough, he said, adding that the decisions about pg&e's future now appear to be in the hands of bankruptcy court.

we want to emphasize that we are not asking for any special rights. we are asking for constitutional rights given to any citizen in the country, said koninika roy from the humsafar trust that works with the lgbt community.
but there is a more profound reason that romney lost to obama in 2012; he was ashamed of his success. while president trump has touted his fortune and his accomplishments as a developer (possibly to excess), romney never talked up his enormous wins as a private equity investor. maybe he thought american voters would not understand his business dealings, or maybe he thinks that amassing a fortune is somehow shameful.
with a new congress now seated, and a majority of democrats in the house, the power is in their hands to start the process of removing this corrupt and comprised president, need to impeach lead strategist kevin mack said in a statement. we're not backing down, and we're not letting up on our work to hold members of congress accountable until donald trump is out of the white house.
it's a completely different atmosphere than four years ago, she said. we are encouraged, hopeful. the issue isn't buried. candidates speak about it. it's not a movement in the ghetto. after eight years in the wilderness, eight years of having no ability to influence the president and then walking into the white house at the start of the administration — i felt like i was the pro-life movement walking in, after all those years.
it's going to be interesting to see how democrats walk and define the line when it comes to socialism. the word makes many americans — and some democrats, especially older ones — uncomfortable.
this is the wreckage i was elected to clean up, trump said tuesday of the bleak economic landscape he inherited.
brazil's institutions, meanwhile, have at times acquitted themselves better than many thought they would, and divides in brazil's congress, where bolsonaro doesn't enjoy the support of a consolidated party like trump does in the gop, may help shield the country from total disaster.
larsen: with current policy, including everything that states have committed to do and what president trump has indicated he is likely to roll back, we are on a path to reduce emissions below 2005 levels by about 15 to 17 percent in 2020.

another challenge with canceling someone for racial ignorance, particularly in a case like groves, who expressed deep regret for her behavior, is where do they go? how do they move forward? as the times story points out, groves posted in support of black lives matter as a senior and yet had used the n-word as a 9th grader. (a black friend of groves told the times groves had apologized about the offensive post long before it went viral. the friend defended groves in a snapchat post: we're supposed to educate people, not ruin their lives all because you want to feel a sense of empowerment.)

since winning election in 2018, far-right brazil president jair bolsonaro has waged an all-out assault on the country's democratic institutions, sought to undermine faith in its electoral system, and trafficked in many of the same voting-related conspiracy theories that trump and the republican party fomented over the last six months.

jones: you know, look, i disagree with senator sanders on many, many things. i think he's got to kind of try to pull people together. you know, one of the things that i'm looking for is whether or not that he can pull and make sure that all voices in the democratic party are heard. right now, i'm having a hard time seeing that with senator sanders. but that's not to say he can't do it. we have got such a long way to go. i still believe this race is far from over. instead of playing a speculation game, i think we need to let this matter play out. i think we need to let all the elections.
this is not a new cause célèbre for the brazilian. bolsonaro, like trump, peddled conspiracies about the 2018 election, openly musing about malfeasance against him even in a race he won. he has not stopped since: although many of bolsonaro's other blatant threats to democratic institutions, as well as the destruction of the amazon rainforest on his watch, have received more international attention, he has spent the last two years attempting to undermine brazil's electoral system and the last two months using trump and the united states as a reason to ramp up his attacks.

this is the biggest issue in american politics today, steyer said in his speech wednesday. we have a lawless president in the white house who is eroding our democracy and it is only going to get worse. donald trump's removal from power ultimately decides whether or not we can tackle every other challenge we face in america — and whether or not we continue to live in a democracy of, for, and by the people. it is past time for members of congress to fulfill their constitutional duty. the question remaining is, what will congress do?

we're pretty disappointed that the gop senate and house have still failed to fully defund planned parenthood — that was and continues to be our no. 1 legislative priority. this is something the president has promised to sign into law, she said. i think that one of my charges this year is making sure pro-lifers don't get complacent and say: 'we've elected them. they'll do what they say.' no, they're not doing what they said. you need to push them.

this will feel very familiar to many investors who have seen all the blithe assumption about operating and maintenance costs on all kinds of technological green marvels fail to meet expectations. biowaste generators, biomass, thermal pellets – you name it, and the rosy assumptions failed to materialise because the difficulties in making them work and keeping them working were glossed over by the promoters. most of the smart money already knew that about renewables and is deeply sceptical. the not-so-smart money still laps the deals up. sadly, renewables is likely to become another charming but flawed investment thesis. i am no stranger to investment madness – three times i've invested in airships and lost my dosh every time.
trump, accompanied by elected officials and border agents, highlighted gun, trafficking and drug crimes along the border during remarks at a patrol station in mcallen. the president spoke in front of a table of items border agents have seized, including a rifle, handguns, a plastic bag full of cash and bricks of heroin and methamphetamine.

while dannenfelser called late-term abortion the most effective piece of our ground game in moving voters, some say the issue is mostly symbolic. about 1 percent of abortions are performed in the third trimester (or after 21 weeks), according to the guttmacher institute, which provides research on reproductive health and was founded by planned parenthood.

this is a fairly new debate to be taking place within the mainstream of the democratic party rather than at the fringes. sanders caught fire in the 2016 primary race and gave a surprisingly strong challenge to democratic front-runner hillary clinton. sanders didn't prevail, but the boldness of his ideas did.

i don't know if i have any data on how pro-lifers feel about trump in general, dannenfelser said. but 'never trumpers' and others all acknowledge that he has followed through on his pro-life commitment, and they're happy about that. trump is a pro-life hero, she said.
some antiabortion leaders describe him as a pro-life hero and pose grinning with him and their children. others say the vulgarity of the president is poisoning the future of the movement, which has worked to change its anti-woman caricature by advocating for things such as paid family leave and maternal health care. still others say that trump's changes are more about tone and that he reminds them of other gop presidents who said the right things but never prioritized fighting abortion on a large scale.
i can relate, trump told reporters this weekend. and i'm sure that the people that are on the receiving end will make adjustments. they always do. and they'll make adjustments. people understand exactly what's going on. many of those people that won't be receiving a paycheck, many of those people agree 100 percent with what i'm doing.
just as many brazilians have pointed to trump as an example of the horrors that bolsonaro could bring to their own nation, bolsonaro has warned that the problems that exist in the minds of trump and some republicans in america will make their way to brazil soon.

while some analysts feared his wealth and lack of political experience would alienate progressives, steyer had an extensive array of advisers and strategists at the ready, owing in part to his longstanding involvement in national politics.
even a closely divided democratic senate wouldn't guarantee biden everything he wants, given chamber rules that require 60 votes to move most major legislation. but if democrats lose even one of tuesday's contests, biden would have little shot for swift up-or-down votes on his most ambitious plans to expand government-backed health care coverage, strengthen the middle class, address racial inequality and combat climate change. a republican-controlled senate also would create a rougher path for biden's cabinet picks and judicial nominees.
this account of biden's increasingly important campaign in south carolina is based on interviews with 39 party and campaign officials, activists, voters, political strategists and longtime political observers in the state, many of whom say biden is underperforming.
a remarkable shift has happened in just the past decade, since the 2008 financial collapse — more democrats now have a positive view of the word socialism (57 percent) than capitalism (43 percent), gallup found last year.

have eyebrows ever been thanked at an awards show before? stellan skarsgard, who won best supporting actor in a limited tv series or movie for hbo's chernobyl, helped kick off the night with an excellent and incredibly surprising speech. sure, he thanked the series' director, writer and usual suspects. but he also thanked the man who made the prosthetic eyebrows for his character. it was funnier than anything gervais said all night. hopefully it starts a trend. can't wait for someone to thank their fingernails.
in his lengthy climate plan, biden slammed the trump administration for abdicating america's leadership on climate, and applauded state and local leaders for their efforts to slash planet-warming emissions, invest in renewable energy and build climate-resilient infrastructure. since trump announced in june 2017 that he would pull the u.s. out of the landmark paris climate agreement, 25 states, hundreds of cities and thousands of businesses and other entities have pledged their commitment to the goals of the international accord.

scientists and environmentalists have fought the destruction of the tree snails' habitat and the increase of invasive predators, both of which are blamed for the snails' death.
trump largely steered clear of discussing domestic political issues during his speech to the forum in 2018, instead using his remarks to tout his accomplishments and encourage business leaders to invest in the united states. he did take a brief swipe at the opposing party, pointing out that some of the people in the room supported democrats over him in 2016. he also drew a smattering of boos when he attacked the news media as fake.
i might be too pessimistic about biden's chances. it all feels just too close to the emotional roller coaster we #nevertrumpers rode back in 2016, when we spun elaborate fantasies about the field narrowing and a champion emerging to take down the orange menace.
loeffler and perdue were both against additional $2,000 covid-19 economic stimulus checks before they were for the checks (but only after trump's belated tweet storm). they have both questioned the integrity of the november election and even demanded the resignation of a fellow republican, georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger.

jones: well, i think he overcomes it by continuing to move forward with the momentum that he's got. this is a delegate count number right now. this field is going to winnow down, and i think as joe biden goes forward, if you look at the states that are beyond super tuesday, those are also going to be very good delegate rich states for joe biden. this race is far from over. i think, unfortunately, folks in the media, with all due respect, have anointed four or five different people now as who is going to be the eventual democratic nominee. we've had, like, four contests, but this race is still fluid. yeah, senator sanders is going to probably have a delegate lead, but if you look at the totality of the circumstances and where the votes for the democrats have been throughout this season, i think that they're going to all coalesce in my opinion - and it is strictly that, my opinion - around joe biden ultimately.
this company has been dishonest, it has prioritized profits way over safety and there has been no effort on their part to change that, he said. i don't believe it will change unless there is some sort of restructure.

the crown actress olivia colman really wasn't prepared to win, and she admitted it flat out on stage. i've honestly gotten a little boozy, because i didn't think this was going to happen, she said to knowing laughter. her rambling speech was still adorable, with a shout-out for her other show, fleabag, which took the best comedy award earlier in the night. yay, 'fleabag'! yay, olivia!

the administration could also consider providing new resources for states to mitigate the effects of wildfires and other climate-related disasters, or give states the flexibility to figure out how to meet new federal pollution-reduction goals, horowitz noted.
haspel's immediate predecessor, mike pompeo, who is now secretary of state, named haspel as his deputy, but brought in his longtime business partner, brian bulatao, to serve as coo. brennan chose associates from within the treasury department and national security council to be his deputies.
he will also travel to georgia for his last political rally as president, when he encourages voters there to show up for the all-important january 5 runoff and protect republicans' senate majority. there are, as of this writing, two developing complications for trump. he's spent months attacking the electoral system as fraudulent, particularly in georgia , where he lost. and one of the republican candidates, sen. david perdue, will have to quarantine after coming into contact with someone who tested positive for covid-19.
travelers in less trafficked areas of the world often find businesses that won't take mastercard or visa, much less american express. peru offers an extra twist: occasionally shops refuse these cards despite displaying signs advertising them.
although the cia and haspel herself have been occasionally thrust into fundamentally political controversies – including those surrounding president trump's decision to revoke brennan's security clearance last august; the ongoing, highly-charged fallout from the murder of journalist jamal khashoggi; and, especially during her confirmation hearings, haspel's own involvement in the cia's post-9/11 enhanced interrogation and rendition programs – she has consistently avoided public exposure. in doing so she has arguably bucked a trend set in motion by her more press-friendly predecessors.
marc hafstead: and my analysis was, under the best-case scenario, we'd come in somewhere around 10.
romney would not have pulled us out of the paris climate agreement, because he would have feared the backlash. he would have been too polite to throw over the iran nuke deal, or to confront the chinese on their ongoing theft of intellectual property or demand that our nato allies up their defense spending; he would not have resolutely, without fail, put america first.

in 2020, trump gets to try to make the argument himself. and people close to him think he can make a winning one.

i certainly understand the perspective of those pro-life advocates who support him, said kelsey hazzard, president of secular pro-life, who noted that things would be worse for the antiabortion movement under a hillary clinton presidency. president trump has also sparked a tremendous backlash. his boorish comments give ammunition to the abortion lobby, which has long worked to caricature the antiabortion cause.

the most famous cocktail is the pisco sour, consisting of lime juice, simple syrup, egg white, ice and angostura bitters. there are assorted variations, such as the coca sour for those who feel the pisco sour requires more bitterness.
i think director haspel's decision to largely stay in the shadows is the right one, morell said. in this political environment, where most public statements are labeled as pro-trump or anti-trump, it is wise to stay silent, particularly when running an agency whose credibility depends as being seen as an independent voice at the policy table.
there will be a majority in the senate. we just don't know yet which party will have it. that depends on what happens in georgia's twin us senate runoffs tuesday. if the two republican incumbents -- sens. david perdue and kelly loeffler -- win, republicans will have 51 votes and control access to the senate floor. given mcconnell's expertise in obstruction and interest in the 2022 midterms, a 51-seat majority could be biden's biggest presidential headache. if the democratic challengers -- jon ossoff and raphael warnock -- win, the resulting 50-50 tie won't give democrats much wiggle room to pass legislation, but it will give them the ability to get measures on the senate floor with vice president-elect kamala harris able to break ties as president of the senate.
we'd like to see it avoided, but we're not naive, he said. i respect the taxpayer, i respect the ratepayer and i'm absolutely cognizant of those that lost their homes.
this story comes at a time when many schools, like other public institutions, are struggling to address their failures to address systemic racism. and while a very public outing and shaming of a few students here and there might offer some sense of justice, it, unfortunately, lets too many students, parents and educators -- really the whole community -- off the hook.

the denunciation of socialism and the attempt to tie the philosophy to democrats is trump's and his campaign's attempt to invert the argument that he is an extremist. the president's sluggish approval rating means he is going to have to try and pull democrats down with him — and given that surveys also show he would lose at this point to a generic democrat, trump also needs to show their candidates to be unelectable and out of step with the rest of america.

but the president faces continued questions about his approach to foreign affairs. his decision to order a strike that killed iranian military commander qasem soleimani this month — and his threat to impose a 25 percent tariff on european cars over a foreign policy dispute — created more tumult in the middle east and in the transatlantic relationship between the united states and its closest allies.

biden has visited south carolina eight times thus far, but aides say they expect a near-universal focus on the palmetto state in upcoming weeks before the primary vote after his last-minute decision to speak there tuesday night. the primary is heavily, though not entirely, african american and largely focused on the state's bigger cities, such as columbia, orangeburg, charleston and greenville.
greene: but does that make it - i'm sorry to interrupt. does that make it ok for joe biden to say something that's not true?
democrats have increasingly sought to make federal workers the face of the shutdown in recent days, amid reports that hundreds of unpaid transportation security administration (tsa) officials are calling out sick at airports.
biden won georgia's 16 electoral votes by about 12,000 votes out of 5 million cast in november.
according to the times, one student, jimmy galligan, shared in june 2020 a three-second snapchat video of his classmate, mimi groves, using a racial slur. groves had first sent the video message to a friend in 2016 when she was 15 and had just gotten her learner's permit. in the video, she looks into the camera and says, i can drive, [racial slur].
in november 2013, more than 15,000 scientists reissued a warning to humanity of widespread misery and catastrophic biodiversity loss unless business-as-usual changed. by failing to adequately limit population growth, reassess the role of an economy rooted in growth, reduce greenhouse gases, incentivize renewable energy, protect habitat, restore ecosystems, curb pollution, halt defaunation, and constrain invasive alien species, humanity is not taking the urgent steps needed to safeguard our imperilled biosphere, they wrote.
i don't think it's in trouble. but i do think they have to apply the resources and focus on south carolina if they're going to have the kind of win that sends a message, he said. they need to send more resources here to get the message out.

and schatz may be on to something. when younger voters respond positively to socialism in polls, they're not saying they want the country to become like venezuela or cuba. to them, socialism is synonymous with a strong social safety net and an economy where big banks and billionaires pay — proportionately — their fair share in taxes.
recall that mcconnell famously stated in 2010: the single most important thing we want to achieve is for president obama to be a one-term president.
this week's elections mark the formal finale to the turbulent 2020 election season more than two months after the rest of the nation finished voting. the stakes have drawn nearly $500 million in campaign spending to a once solidly republican state that now finds itself as the nation's premier battleground.

in fact, the inca were a bit like mitt romney's bain capital: they had a knack for taking control of long-established things and making them their own. the incan state didn't emerge until the 1200s. it became an empire in the 1400s, and its final sovereign emperor died in 1533, officially ending the period of constructing the buildings and roads that lure visitors to this day.
if we had a barrier of any kind, a powerful barrier, whether it's steel or concrete ... we would stop it cold, trump said of human trafficking. the president then took part in a briefing by border agents.
it seemed a year ago that trump, with the leadership of the gop in congress, had the momentum to repeal and replace obamacare, and certainly that also included the abortion provisions, said heather boonstra, director of public policy at guttmacher. that also included the defunding of planned parenthood. this was a very real item and real concern for us. i think it goes to show how the republicans just didn't have a plan, in many ways.
giving states the power and funding to make progress helps to insulate progress from the seesaw of future federal policy priorities ― not perfectly, but at least somewhat, she said.
the democrat party has never been more outside of the mainstream, trump said in el paso, texas, on monday night in what was his first campaign rally of 2019. they're becoming the party of socialism, late-term abortion, open borders and crime.
beyond their stark ideological contrasts to president donald trump's agency heads, biden's top-level nominees also appear to signal the new administration's plans to embed climate policies at the state level, cementing the clean-energy transition and making it harder for the next gop president to undo whatever progress his administration makes.
that is a record to be proud of, but you would never have known that from romney's presidential campaign. running from your past is smart if your history is dishonorable; otherwise, it is dishonest.
the truth is that warnock and ossoff are mainstream candidates dedicated to public service, and they echo president-elect biden's hopeful unifying message. they are laser-focused on the facts, the issues, and the values that matter to suffering georgians in these perilous times.

jones: look at the totality of the record and what he can do and how he can bring together. look at the people who've known joe biden for as long as they have. look at the number of folks around this country who are for him because they know the kind of leader he is.
one year later, those words seem like something from a different era. covid rages, impeachment feels like a footnote to history and, rather than suffer trump's sabotage, biden will soon be president.

the reason is straightforward: the arctic has warmed so much — twice as fast in recent decades than other parts of the world — that when polar air descends to lower latitudes, the cold snaps are warmer on average. so a spell of extremely cold weather like the recent one is rare, about 15 times rarer than a century ago, the scientists said.
the remarks came after steyer -- among the prominent liberals who received a threatening suspicious package earlier in the month -- said he absolutely was blaming trump for creating an atmosphere in which anything can bubble up, and anything is bubbling up.
and the impact south carolina may have on the broader race remains unclear. biden can ill afford another defeat in the feb. 22 nevada caucuses, which take place one week before the primary here, and the outcome here will be quickly swamped by super tuesday on march 3, when states including california, texas and virginia hold their primaries.
how much and what the state can do remains to be seen. lawmakers last year tried to prevent a threatened pg&e bankruptcy resulting from the 2017 fires by letting the utility pass on some of its costs to ratepayers, a move some critics dubbed a bailout for the utility. democratic assemblyman chris holden had considering introducing a similar bill that would pass on the costs of 2018 fires, but on monday he said he has backed off that idea.

loeffler and perdue, on the other hand, have hitched their wagons to a lame-duck president and have repeatedly refused to even acknowledge president-elect biden's victory. they agree with anything trump says, even if that requires them to flip-flop on their positions on issues. they act as if they are running to be selected by trump to be his employees on the apprentice, rather than to represent the people of georgia in the senate.

when it comes to planned parenthood, the house and senate health-care bills contained provisions to block the organization from getting federal reimbursements, but those efforts died with the legislation. under president barack obama, states were prevented from withholding federal money from planned parenthood and other abortion clinics; trump last spring signed a resolution reversing that rule.

what are the most important things that humans can do now in order to not destroy the planet? we have to accept responsibility for our role. i am trying to keep track of what my carbon impact is this year — america produces about 20 metric tons per person a year. we also have to encourage all sorts of people to go into science and engineering, because some of the solutions will involve new technologies.
trump, who has called climate change a hoax, did not directly address the theme during his 30-minute address here, although he did call for rejecting the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse and went out of his way to urge europe to use america's vast supply of oil and natural gas.

democrats have hammered perdue and loeffler, each among the senate's wealthiest members, for conspicuously timed personal stock trades after members of congress received information about the public health and economic threats of covid-19 as trump and republicans downplayed the pandemic. none of the trades has been found to violate the law or senate ethics, but warnock and ossoff have cast the republicans as self-interested and out of touch.

the demonization of this pastor who now preaches in dr. king's church is part of a long and disgraceful history in georgia of hostility to its black residents. in fact, georgia has never elected a single black u.s. senator, governor, lieutenant governor, or secretary of state. and yet the census bureau estimates that 32% of the state's population is black.

david bryant, a retired social worker from new york who lives in columbia, said he was deciding between steyer — whose name he at first struggled to recall — and sanders. he said he liked biden but had not seen a commercial from him or heard anything from his campaign, and he thought biden, 77, lacked the vigor that some of the other candidates had.

looking at the polls, i'd expect him to take alabama, tennessee and probably north carolina. but is a big win in a state he was already widely expected to carry really going to push him over the top in texas, where he is running eight points behind sanders and where the democratic electorate is heavily latino? or virginia, where the d.c. wonketariat is gaga for the technocratic stylings of warren, buttigieg and bloomberg, and where a large youth vote is clearly in the sanders camp?

newsom and legislative leaders carefully avoided laying out potential solutions in the hours after the bankruptcy announcement while stressing the importance of ensuring wildfire victims get the money they are owed. but no one has yet figured out the future of california energy policy as the state faces increasing threats -- and more wildfires -- as it copes with climate change.

the house a year ago passed a bill to make the prohibition on federal funding for abortions — usually contained in a legislative provision called the hyde amendment — permanent, but the senate did not, and it's not on the agenda. the house also last year passed a bill banning abortions in most cases after 20 weeks (considered a late term abortion, one of trump's pledges), but a similar measure in the senate is seen as unlikely to pass.
but that may be where the agreement about trump's impact on the antiabortion movement ends.
republicans said if the election turned out to be about that, as opposed to a more nuanced discussion of border security and pre-existing conditions, they felt they could win or hold their own. it didn't happen. instead, in an election where trump was front of mind, democrats won over suburban voters and independents, and took back the house by flipping 40 seats.

where does your energy come from? are you dependent on an industry that is at risk? millions of people, communities and cities are going 100 percent renewable.
there will be a split among democrats. it's much easier to be united in pursuit of power than it is to stay united in power. trump, to his credit, was able to effectively marshal republicans, often through fear and bullying, during his time in office. as president, it's unlikely biden will use those same tactics. and he'll have to contend with progressives on the left who want more attention to big problems like climate change and inequality that require systemic change the moderates in his party have less interest in pursuing. a year from now, it will be much easier for republicans to focus on biden's policies -- and he's likely to be a relatively moderate president -- in a way to aggravate and turn off progressives. vermont sen. bernie sanders won't quietly let biden take the moderate route. neither will massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren, new york rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez or the congressional black caucus.

we do feel like this is an arc of a story that hasn't reached its final chapter, that these fights are ongoing, boonstra said.
as the obama and trump presidencies prove, it could likely be a rocky road. absent new legislation, the white house must creatively interpret its legal mandate to enact rules under existing statutes, leaving them open to challenge. republican state attorneys general sued the obama administration so routinely that the top cop in texas joked: i go into the office in the morning. i sue barack obama, and then i go home. gop-led states persuaded the supreme court to block obama's signature power plant regulation in 2016, and that was before trump added three right-wing justices to the bench and stacked lower federal courts with conservatives. red states are already vowing to pursue that same strategy.

in doing so, he has underlined how difficult it will be for president-elect joseph r. biden jr. to forge a united front with allies against china's authoritarian policies and trade practices, a central focus of the new administration's plan to compete with beijing and check its rising power. the image of mr. xi joining chancellor angela merkel of germany, president emmanuel macron of france and other european leaders in a conference call on wednesday to seal the deal with the european union also amounted to a stinging rebuke of the trump administration's efforts to isolate china's communist party state.

he's the first president to never crack 50 [percent approval] in his first two years, said bruce mehlman, a republican strategist and attorney who worked as an assistant secretary in the commerce department for technology policy. the resistance is really energized, and that's part of why you saw the highest midterm turnout since 1914 last november. the economy has been really strong, but it's showing some worrisome signs. mr. mueller's report and/or democratic oversight will likely make the waters choppier. and voters want change.
educators and parents need to focus on character over consequences. when a very few kids receive an outsized consequence and many others escape notice, the message can all too easily become a smug see we got that racist over there -- or, worse don't get caught -- instead of examine your bias and do the right thing.
biden will be forced to navigate a similar legislative playing field, except another decade into a rapidly worsening global crisis. unless democrats can somehow flip a pair of republican-held senate seats in the georgia runoff election on jan. 5, the gop will maintain control of the senate while democrats hold a slim majority in the house.

the new york activist and democrat, 29, cruised to victory after upsetting established democrat rep. joe crowley in the primary race. she is already making waves. in november, she kicked off her first day of new-member orientation by participating in a climate change protest at pelosi's office. ocasio-cortez, who voted for pelosi as speaker thursday, has said she will oppose a rules package, crafted by democratic leaders. she opposes its new budget rules that she tweeted are a dark political maneuver designed to hamstring progress on healthcare+other leg.
but, top democrats seemed less than enthusiastic about introducing impeachment articles. last week, house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., downplayed freshman rep. rashida tlaib's profanity-laced vow to impeach trump, as republicans strongly condemned the language.
and before long we were back out there every day, in that beautiful water. it wasn't so much that i planned on swimming into mid-november in a lake in northern california at 3,017 feet, as i just kept going every single day and over time, the water kept getting colder and colder. it was around oct. 26 where i started to feel that i was doing something unusual and brave and at times painful. my first thought every morning was resentment that my day had this big hard part in the middle of it. but even as the air and water got colder, it didn't get worse, it got better. my body started to get used to it. the big hard part of my day became the best thing in it. my first thought every morning became swimming. and then i would just lie there smiling stupidly into the dark.

but a more honorable approach for the newly elected senator would have been to become a leader in his caucus, to attempt to work with and advise the president by becoming a trusted voice, and to serve the american voter by making this presidency as successful as possible.
one contest features democrat raphael warnock, who serves as the senior pastor of the atlanta church where slain civil rights leader martin luther king jr. grew up and preached. the 51-year-old warnock was raised in public housing and spent most of his adult life preaching in baptist churches.

you've got to swarm it tomorrow, trump told thousands of cheering supporters, downplaying the threat of fraud.
biden kicked off his presidential run on the wrong side of a climate movement. young activists were leading the push for a more ambitious federal approach, against the backdrop of dire united nations projections on global warming. in may 2019, reuters reported that biden was carving out a middle ground climate policy that would likely face heavy resistance from green activists.
someone shared it with galligan a few years later, when both he and groves were seniors. galligan kept the video and after groves had chosen a college, he posted the video publicly. as he later described it to the times, the video taught someone a lesson.
biden, in other words, seems to be doing really well in what flannery o'connor dubbed the christ-haunted south. but that's the place where sanders is particularly bad at campaigning. i heard some of his surrogates onstage working stilted religious references into their speeches and looked around at a crowd that clearly wasn't overly familiar with the bible and thought, why are they bothering? they just don't speak fluent church lady and neither does anyone else here.

trump's instinct is also to throw red meat to his base when times are tough. and the riots, which broke out immediately after trump explicitly told his supporters to go to the capitol, offered brazilians an obvious look at how easily such agitation can erupt into a full-blown explosion, said bruno boghossian, a political columnist for folha de s.paulo.
